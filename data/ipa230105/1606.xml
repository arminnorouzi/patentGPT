One example implementation includes a plastic densifier including a body that partially encloses an interior volume with an aluminum interior surface. A loading port in the body can allow plastic to be loaded into the body, and a lift within the body can reduce the interior volume when actuated, compressing plastic within the interior volume. A heating element positioned beneath and abutting the aluminum surface can be configured to heat the plastic within the body to a temperature in the range of 100 C to 180 C.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Implementations can optionally include one or more of the following features.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some instances, the plastic densifier includes a loading mechanism affixed to the loading port, the loading mechanism including: a roller with a frictional surface that is configured to grab plastic and draw the plastic into the body, a comb fitted onto the roller and configured to remove plastic from the roller and deposit it through the loading port, and a roller motor configured to rotate the roller.

The controller can also be configured to apply current to the lift motor to a predetermined threshold. The predetermined threshold can be a current associated with a desired amount of compression of the plastic.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some instances, a viewing window in the body is provided to permit inspection of the interior volume and of the plastic in the body.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some instances, a cover is hingedly connected to the body.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In general the present disclosure contemplates a method for densifying plastic, the method including loading plastic to be densified into a compression chamber, compressing the plastic, and applying heat to the plastic to achieve a temperature in a range of 100 C to 180 C, to bake the compressed plastic into a brick.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some instances, during loading operations, the plastic is periodically compressed without applying heat.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some instances, heat is applied to the plastic in response to a signal that the compression chamber is full.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some instances, a loading mechanism that is automatically activated in response to a signal indicating the presence of plastic in the loading mechanism is used to load plastic into the compression chamber.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some instances, the compression of the plastic, and applying heat to the plastic is repeated at least once.

Densified plastic waste is more compact, and solid than in its non-densified form. Lightweight plastic waste (e.g., used grocery bags, empty trash bags, food wrappers, etc.) can be difficult to store and transport, as well as process for recycling. This disclosure describes a convenient solution to allow users to compress or densify plastic waste in their home, making it readily recyclable, more conveniently stored, or easily transported for further processing.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The apparatus compresses the plastic waste, and then applies a limited amount of heat to &#x201c;bake&#x201d; the compressed plastic into a &#x201c;brick&#x201d; of plastic. Most plastic materials will begin to outgas volatile organic compounds (VOCs) when above a certain temperature. VOCs are generally toxic and undesirable in a residential setting, therefore the disclosed apparatus does not raise the temperature of the plastic so high as to cause widespread melting and therefore significant outgassing of the plastic. Instead the plastic is compressed, and then heated enough to cause it to retain its compressed shape, without melting or substantial outgassing.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an external isometric view of a plastic densifier <b>100</b>. The plastic densifier <b>100</b> can include a body <b>102</b>, which houses the majority of the components and can provide an aesthetically pleasing structure for the plastic densifier <b>100</b>. In some implementations, the body <b>102</b> is constructed of plastic, aluminum, steel, or any other suitable material. A cover <b>106</b> can be hingedly connected to the body, and can be opened to allow for removal of densified plastic or maintenance of the plastic densifier <b>100</b>. In some implementations, the cover <b>108</b> is slotted into the body <b>102</b> (e.g., via a tongue and groove system), or simply placed on top of the body <b>102</b>, the present disclosure is not limited thereto. The cover <b>106</b> will be described in further detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some implementations, the plastic densifier <b>100</b> includes a loader <b>104</b> or loading mechanism. The loader <b>104</b> can be mounted to the cover <b>106</b> or the body <b>102</b>, and can assist in feeding light plastic waste into the body <b>102</b>. In some implementations, the loader <b>104</b> includes active powered components which are described in greater detail below and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cutaway diagram showing an interior portion of plastic densifier <b>100</b> and some of the additional components. The body <b>102</b> includes an inner wall <b>208</b> which can be constructed of an aluminum material. Aluminum is advantageous because it is a good heat conductor and heated plastic will not stick to it. In some implementations, the inner wall <b>208</b> is steel or another suitable material which has good heat conductivity, sufficient structural integrity, and will not stick to the heated plastic.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Heating elements <b>210</b> can be positioned between the inner wall <b>208</b> and the outside wall of the body <b>102</b> to enclose a portion of the interior volume of the body <b>102</b>. The heating elements <b>210</b> can include resistive heating components, such as Nichrome 80/20 (80% nickel and 20% chromium) strips, silicon carbide, or other element that can convert electrical power to heat. Heating elements <b>210</b> are positioned to apply heat to compressed plastic within the body <b>102</b> of the plastic densifier <b>100</b>. In some implementations, there are heating elements <b>210</b> in each wall (e.g., 4 walls) of the body <b>102</b>, as well as in the cover <b>106</b> and the lift <b>212</b>, to provide heat to the plastic from every direction.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Lift <b>212</b> is a mechanism configured to reduce the volume of storage space inside the body <b>102</b>, compressing plastic within. Lift <b>212</b> is shown in a scissor lift configuration, with a flat plate supported by a number of crosslinks. In some implementations, lift <b>212</b> can have an aluminum top surface with a heating element <b>210</b> configured to apply heat to the bottom of the plastic being compressed. Lift <b>212</b> can be actuated by any suitable means. In some implementations, a hydraulic or electric motor can rotate a screw drive which alters the distance between two links of the scissor lift at the bottom end. An example lift motor is illustrated and discussed in further detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Loader <b>104</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is illustrated with a portion of its external housing removed, showing the rollers <b>214</b>, bevel gears <b>216</b>, and comb <b>218</b>. It should be noted that a roller <b>214</b> has been removed from the diagram for clarity. Rollers <b>214</b> can include a number of bumps or knobs which can grab light plastic to feed it into the body <b>102</b>. The rollers <b>214</b> can be rubber, plastic, metal, or a combination thereof which is suitable for providing traction to pull plastic into the plastic densifier <b>100</b>. As illustrated, the rollers <b>214</b> can have a generally spherical shape. In some implementations, they can be cylindrical or helical, among other shapes. Rollers <b>214</b> can be driven by a motor (not shown) which can rotate all the rollers <b>214</b> via bevel gears <b>216</b>. In the illustrated example there are three spherical rollers <b>214</b>, however more, or fewer, rollers <b>214</b> (e.g., six, or two) can be implemented without departing from the scope of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts an example plastic densifier <b>100</b> in a rotated view, with some housing components transparent for clarity. The lift <b>212</b> is shown in an extended position, as it might be if it were compressing plastic. In the illustrated implementation, the lift <b>212</b> is actuated by a lift motor <b>320</b>, which can be an electric motor (e.g., brushless DC motor, stepper motor, AC motor, etc.) that drives a screw drive, which translates cross beam <b>324</b>, causing the scissor mechanism of the lift <b>212</b> to extend or retract based on the direction of rotation for the lift motor <b>320</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Loader motor <b>318</b> is also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, and can be a single electric motor, similar to, or different from lift motor <b>320</b>. Loader motor <b>318</b> in the illustrated implementation drives three rollers <b>214</b> via multiple sets of bevel gears <b>216</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Viewing windows <b>322</b> can optionally be installed in the body <b>102</b> and can provide for a means for a user to visually verify the plastic within the plastic densifier <b>100</b>. The viewing windows <b>322</b> can be a Plexiglas material, glass, quartz, or other suitable transparent material (e.g., Pyrex&#xae;). As shown in the illustrated example, two viewing windows <b>322</b> can be installed, a long vertical window which shows the amount of plastic in the body <b>102</b> as well as the position of the lift <b>212</b>. In addition the vertical window, a lower, larger window can be provided to permit inspection of the densified plastic. In some implementations, the lower window <b>322</b> can be open-ended for easy removal of the densified plastic.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates the plastic densifier with its cover <b>106</b> in an open position. The open cover <b>106</b> can provide access to the storage volume <b>424</b>, which is within the body <b>102</b> of the plastic densifier <b>100</b>. Storage volume <b>424</b> can be the region where plastic is stored, compressed, and heated for densification. In some implementations, the open cover <b>106</b> permits easy removal of densified plastic from the storage volume <b>424</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> show a side cutaway diagram of the plastic densifier <b>100</b>. Regions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> with a cross hash pattern indicate regions of the plastic densifier <b>100</b> with heating elements to apply heat to the plastic. In general, operations of the plastic densifier <b>100</b> can be broken into two phases: a loading phase and a densification phase.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">During the loading phase, the lift <b>212</b> can be maintained near the bottom of the plastic densifier <b>100</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>. Plastic to be densified is loaded in via the loader <b>104</b>. In some implementations, the loader includes one or more sensors and automatically activates when the presence of plastic to be loaded is detected. In general, the loading phase can be a long-term phase. For example, the plastic densifier <b>100</b> can be in the loading phase whenever it is not full, and can be slowly filled with plastic to be densified (e.g., grocery bags, wrappers, packing material, etc.) over a period of time (e.g., one week, on month, etc.). Upon the plastic densifier <b>100</b> being filled, it can then begin a densification phase. In some implementations, the plastic densifier <b>100</b> automatically detects when it is full and begins densification. In some implementations, densification is initiated based on user input (e.g., the user presses a &#x201c;compress&#x201d; or &#x201c;densify&#x201d; button).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">During the densification phase, the lift <b>212</b> can rise, compressing the light plastic into a smaller volume that comprises the heated region <b>526</b>. In some implementations, a predetermined amount of pressure is applied by the lift <b>212</b>. For example, by measuring the current supplied to an electric motor actuating the lift <b>212</b>, it can be determined how much torque, and therefore, how much pressure is being exerted. In some implementations, additional sensors (e.g., a force sensor or pressure sensor) can be used to determine what height to raise the lift <b>212</b> to. Once the plastic is compressed, heating elements can apply heat to &#x201c;bake&#x201d; the plastic, causing it to harden and retain its compressed shape, without significant melting or outgassing of the plastic. The applied heat maintains the plastic in the range of 100 C to 180 C, and preferably below 120 C. The upper bound of 180 C prevents significant outgassing of the plastic, and the release of toxic VOCs. The lower bound of 100 C ensures any moisture present in the plastic is vaporized and able to escape the densified plastic. In some implementations, once the plastic is within the desired temperature range, the lift is further actuated, applying additional pressure to further compress the plastic. This can be a cyclic, iterative process of applying heat and pressure. In some implementations, the process is carried out a predetermined number of times (e.g., 3 times, or 5 times etc.). In some implementations, the process can be carried out until a predetermined criteria is met (e.g., compression ratio or target volume). For example, the process can repeat until a compression ratio of less than 5% is achieved. Following densification, the heating elements can be de-energized and the densified plastic allowed to return to ambient temperature. The lift <b>212</b> can either retract, to allow more plastic to be loaded on top of the brick of densified plastic or maintain position, to allow for easy removal of the brick. In some implementations, upon opening of the cover, or a removal port in the plastic densifier <b>100</b>, the lift <b>212</b> can raise the brick up and partially out of the densifier <b>100</b>, to make it readily removable.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a controller <b>628</b> and some sensors and systems the controller can actuate.

These inputs can include a temperature signal from one or more temperature sensors <b>634</b>. The temperature sensors <b>634</b> can be thermocouples, resistance temperature detectors (RTDs), thermistors, or other suitable temperature sensors. Temperature sensors <b>634</b> can be located within the plastic densifier, or near heating elements <b>650</b>, which can be similar to, or different from heating elements <b>210</b> as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

One or more position sensors <b>638</b> can also provide inputs <b>630</b> to the controller.
