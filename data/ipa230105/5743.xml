More particularly, the present disclosure relates to forming structures overlaying substrates using trench bottom-up fill techniques, such as during the fabrication of semiconductor devices.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Films are commonly deposited onto substrates to form various types of structures during the fabrication of various types of semiconductors devices such as display devices, power electronics, and very large-scale integrated circuits. Deposition of such films is generally accomplished by positioning a substrate within a reactor, heating the substrate to a temperature suitable for deposition of a desired film onto the substrate, and flowing gas containing constituents of the desired film into the reactor. As the gas flows through the reactor and across the substrate the constituent forms a film on the substrate, typically at a rate and to thickness corresponding to the environmental conditions within the reactor and temperature of the substrate. The resulting film is generally conformal with the underlying substrate, the film typically depositing onto the topology of the substrate in a way that corresponds to the substrate topology.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">During the fabrication of some semiconductor devices it may be necessary to deposit a film into the recess such a trench defined within the surface of the substrate. For example, during the fabrication transistor devices having two-dimensional or three-dimensional architectures, fill structures may be formed within trenches by depositing films having desired electrical properties within the trenches, such as isolation features formed to electrically separate adjacent transistors from one another. Such fill features may be formed using epitaxial techniques, the fill feature resulting from the progressive thickening of film from the bottom of the trench upwards and laterally inward from the opposing sidewalls of the trench. Film deposition typically continues until the trench closes&#x2014;either by the film overlaying the trench bottom bridging the film overlying the sidewalls and overtopping the trench mouth or surfaces of the film overlaying the sidewall converging against one another within the trench.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some fill structures, the interface (or seam) where opposing surfaces of the sidewall films and/or bottom surface film converge may influence the electrical properties of the resulting fill structure. For example, in substrates where the trench bottom presents a different crystalline structure to the trench than that presented by the trench sidewalls to the trench, film deposited on the trench bottom surface may develop with a different crystalline structure than that of film deposited onto the trench sidewalls. As a consequence, the crystalline structure within the fill structure may change at the interface of the opposing surfaces within the fill structure, locally increasing (or decreasing) electrical resistivity at the interface in relation to the remainder of the fill structure. While generally manageable, the localized variation in electrical properties at the interface can, in some semiconductor devices, influence reliability of the semiconductor device incorporating the fill structure.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Such systems and methods have generally been considered suitable for their intended purpose. However, there remains a need in the art for improved methods of forming structures using bottom-up fill techniques, semiconductor processing systems configured to form structures using bottom-up fill techniques, and semiconductor devices including structures formed using bottom-up fill techniques. The present disclosure provides a solution to this need.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A method of forming a structure is provided.

It is contemplated that the substrate have a recess overlaying the substrate, e.g., a recess <b>308</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). It is also contemplated that the recess have a bottom surface and a sidewall surface, e.g., a bottom surface <b>316</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) and a sidewall surface <b>318</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>).

As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art in view of the present disclosure, depositing the bottom segment onto the bottom surface more rapidly than the sidewall segment onto the sidewall surface may reduce the cycle time required to fill the recess, improving throughput of the semiconductor processing system employed to form the structure.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, depositing <b>220</b> the film within the recess may include only partially filling the recess. In this respect the film may be deposited such that the recess is partially filled with the bottom segment of the film and the sidewall segment of the film, as shown with box <b>224</b> and box <b>226</b>. It is contemplated that the bottom segment and the sidewall segment be deposited at a bottom segment deposition rate-to-sidewall segment deposition rate ratio (i.e. a deposition rate ratio). In certain examples, the deposition rate ratio may be between about 1.1:1 and about 2:1. It is also contemplated that the bottom segment of the film have a crystalline structure that is different than the crystalline structure of the sidewall segment of the film. For example, in accordance with certain examples, the bottom segment of the film may have a 1 0 0 crystalline structure and the sidewall segment of the film may have a 1 1 0 crystalline structure, as shown with box <b>221</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown with box <b>223</b>, depositing <b>220</b> the film may include flowing dichlorosilane (DCS), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) gas into the interior of the reaction chamber, e.g., using the gas delivery arrangement <b>118</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In certain examples, a predetermined deposition pressure may be maintained within the reaction chamber during the deposition of the film within the recess, as shown with box <b>225</b>.

For example, pressure within the interior of the reaction chamber may be maintained at less than about 50 torr, or less than about 40 torr, or less than about 30 torr, or less than about 20 torr, or even less than about 10 torr during the depositing operation, as shown with box <b>225</b>.

Advantageously, flowing dichlorosilane (DCS), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) gas within these pressure and temperature ranges allows the bottom segment of the film to be deposited onto the bottom surface of the recess more rapidly than the sidewall segment of the film is deposited onto the sidewall surface of the recess in examples where the bottom surface of the recess has a silicon 1 0 0 crystalline structure and the lower surface of the recess has a silicon 1 1 0 crystalline structure, as shown with chart A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> and with chart B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">With continuing reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, once the film is deposited within the recess, the sidewall segment of the film is thereafter removed from the sidewall surface of the recess while at least a portion of the bottom segment of the film is retained within the recess, as shown with box <b>230</b>. In certain examples, the sidewall segment of the film may be removed from the sidewall surface of the recess more rapidly than the bottom segment of the film from the bottom surface of the recess. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art in view of the present disclosure, removing the sidewall segment of the film more rapidly from the sidewall surface of the recess than the bottom segment from the bottom surface of the recess may also reduce the cycle time required to fill the recess, also improving throughput of the semiconductor processing system employed to form the structure.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, removing <b>230</b> the sidewall segment of the film while retaining at least a portion of the bottom segment of the film may include flowing hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) gas into the interior of the reaction chamber, as shown with box <b>234</b>.

For example, pressure within the interior of the reaction chamber may be maintained at less than about 50 torr, or less than about 40 torr, or less than about 30 torr, or less than about 20 torr, or even less than about 10 torr, as shown with box <b>235</b>. Advantageously, pressures within this range allows the sidewall segment of the film to be removed more rapidly than the bottom segment of the film, as shown with chart C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. Moreover, the removal rate ratio increases according to an exponential function with decreasing pressure, e.g., at pressures of about 2 torr, providing unexpected advantage at these pressures with respect to cycle time and throughput. In this respect, the removing operation may include removing the film with a removal rate ratio greater than about 5:1, or greater than about 10:1, or greater than about 15:1, or even greater than about 20:1, as shown with box <b>237</b>. The removal rate ratio may be between about 5:1 and about 25:1, as also shown with box <b>237</b>.

Temperature within the interior of the reaction chamber may be maintained between about 850&#xb0; C. and about 675&#xb0; C. during the removing operation, as further shown with box <b>239</b>. Advantageously, temperatures within this range may further increase the removal rate ratio during the removing operation, as shown with chart D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>. As shown with box <b>290</b>, the depositing operation and the removing operation may be done at a common deposition temperature and removal temperature, the deposition and removal operations being isothermal in this respect. Notably, as shown in chart B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the deposition rate ratio is relatively insensitive to temperature and the deposition temperature may therefore be selected according to a desired removal rate ratio within this temperature range.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">With continuing reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the depositing operation and the removing operation may be a first depositing/removing cycle employed to deposit a first retained portion of the film within the recess, e.g., a first retained portion <b>336</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>), and the method may include one or more second depositing/removal cycle, as shown with arrow <b>240</b>.
