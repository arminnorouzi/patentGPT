Fibrosis often develops after joint trauma or major surgical procedures such as total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (Cheuy et al., 2017; Magit et al., 2007). Approximately 3-10% of TKA patients are treated for arthrofibrosis, while 2-35% of ACL reconstruction patients and 14.5% of patients with knee intra-articular fractures require intervention (Abdul et al., 2015; Haller et al., 2015; Sanders et al., 2017). The standard-of-care is limited to arthroscopic debridement, capsule-release, and manipulating limbs under anesthesia. While these procedures can partially restore joint mobility, 25% of patients suffer recurring fibrosis that necessitates multiple interventions (Dean et al., 2016; Komuijt et al., 2018; Stephenson et al., 2010; Usher et al., 2019). Thus, there is a need to develop approaches to augment these interventions.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-&#x3b2;1) and histamines released by mast cells activate adjacent fibroblasts to migrate to wound sites, where they proliferate and transform into highly contractile myofibroblasts that rapidly close the wound (Freeman et al., 2010; Grinnell &#x26; Ho, 2002). Myofibroblasts express alpha-smooth muscle actin (&#x3b1;-SMA), a marker that distinguishes them from other fibroblasts (Unterhauser et al., 2004). Normally myofibroblasts undergo apoptosis at the end of tissue repair and remodeling (Darby et al., 2014). In contrast, myofibroblasts in fibrotic tissues resist apoptosis and continue to synthesize and contract the extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in tissue stiffening (Oakley et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2018). In addition, mechanical forces exerted by myofibroblasts can activate latent TGF-01 sequestered in the ECM (Wipff et al., 2007), which further stimulates the fibroblast to myofibroblast transformation (Van De Water et al., 2013). Moreover, substrate stretching enhances &#x3b1;-SMA and type I collagen expression, and induces reorganization of the ECM (Grinnell &#x26; Ho, 2002; Junker et al., 2008; Sawhney &#x26; Howard, 2004; Wakatsuki &#x26; Elson, 2003).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Capsule contracture from joint immobilization is accompanied by the proliferation of cells lining the synovial intima (Trudel et al., 2003), which is thought to contribute to capsule hypertrophy by increasing the local secretion of TGF-&#x3b2;1 and pro-inflammatory cytokines (User et al., 2019). Thus, thickening of the intimal cell layer is part of the pro-fibrotic response to immobilization and is of interest in assessing the effects of anti-fibrotic drugs.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Interventions targeting myofibroblasts have the potential to promote the resorption of fibrotic tissues and prevent their recurrence (Oakley et al., 2005; Wakatsuki &#x26; Elson, 2003; Atluri et al., 2016; Engel et al., 2006; Tiede et al., 2009). Drugs that promote myofibroblast apoptosis aid in the resolution of liver fibrosis in a rat model, and to promote scarless healing in incisional wounds in rats and humans (Abe et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2005). Sulfasalazine (SSZ) is an anti-inflammatory aminosalicylate drug that inhibits kappa B kinase, an activity that promotes myofibroblast apoptosis (Oakley et al., 2005; Elsharkawy et al., 2005). Cis-hydroxyproline (CHP) and beta-amino propionitrile (BAPN), drugs that block collagen deposition, also proved to be successful in halting the progression of fibrosis in various contexts including flexor tendon adhesions and bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis (Steplewski et al., 2017; McCombe et al., 2006; Canelon &#x26; Wallace2016; Ledwozyw, 1995). In addition, BAPN prevented the development of fibrosis in a rat stifle joint immobilization model (Furlow &#x26; Peacock, 1967). Neither CHP nor BAPN retarded normal wound healing at therapeutic dose levels (McCombe et al., 2006; Bulut et al., 2004).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) is a debilitating condition that results in the downregulation of the lubricin gene and increased shear stress within the joint. Acute intra-articular injection of amobarbital treatment protected articular cartilage chondrocytes from the acute effects of joint injury and dramatically forestalled the progression of PTOA at 6 months post-intra-articular fracture (IAF) in the porcine model. However, moderate degenerative changes were observed at 12 months, suggesting that cellular processes other that those addressed by amobarbital contributed to long-term results.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Because amobarbital therapy alone leaves cartilage vulnerable to long-term mechanical insults resulting from lubricin loss and/or joint incongruity, cartilage was shielded from these effects by enhancing the levels of lubricin, a glycoprotein that, together with hyaluronic acid and phospholipids, accounts for the nearly frictionless motion of normal joints. However, because lubricin itself is unstable, necessitating periodic intra-articular injections to maintain joint lubrication, other delivery vehicles were tested. In one embodiment, plasmid DNA (pDNA) encoding lubricin was complexed with a cationic polymer, e.g., polyamidoamine (PAMAM) or polyethyleneimine (PEI), thereby forming nanoplexes. These nanoplexes were then encapsulated into the degradable nanoparticles, e.g., poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) nanoparticles. This delivery system for the lubricin gene allows for a local and sustained release therapeutic to upregulate the production of lubricin in damaged joints and thus mitigate the negative side effects of PTOA. This delivery system may be employed with one or more anti-fibrotic drugs, e.g., sulfasalazine, beta-amino propionitrile, cis-hydroxyl proline, blebbistatin, or paclitaxel, e.g., the nanoparticles and the anti-fibrotic may be co-delivered in the same formulation, or delivered separately. This delivery system may be employed in with amobarbital or a derivative thereof, e.g., pentobarbital, secobarbital, phenobarbital, adenosine diphosphate ribose, or metformin.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, a composition comprising nanoparticles comprising isolated nucleic acid comprising nucleic acid encoding a mammalian lubricin and a cationic polymer is provided.

Illustrative vectors include, for example, plasmids, viral vectors, liposomes and other gene delivery vehicles. The polynucleotide to be delivered, sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;target polynucleotide&#x201d; or &#x201c;transgene,&#x201d; may comprise a coding sequence of interest in gene therapy (such as a gene encoding a protein of therapeutic interest), a coding sequence of interest in vaccine development (such as a polynucleotide expressing a protein, polypeptide or peptide suitable for eliciting an immune response in a mammal), and/or a selectable or detectable marker.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">&#x201c;Transduction,&#x201d; &#x201c;transfection,&#x201d; &#x201c;transformation&#x201d; or &#x201c;transducing&#x201d; as used herein, are terms referring to a process for the introduction of an exogenous polynucleotide into a host cell leading to expression of the polynucleotide, e.g., the transgene in the cell, and includes the use of recombinant virus to introduce the exogenous polynucleotide to the host cell. Transduction, transfection or transformation of a polynucleotide in a cell may be determined by methods well known to the art including, but not limited to, protein expression (including steady state levels), e.g., by ELISA, flow cytometry and Western blot, measurement of DNA and RNA by heterologousization assays, e.g., Northern blots, Southern blots and gel shift mobility assays. Methods used for the introduction of the exogenous polynucleotide include well-known techniques such as viral infection or transfection, lipofection, transformation and electroporation, as well as other non-viral gene delivery techniques. The introduced polynucleotide may be stably or transiently maintained in the host cell.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">&#x201c;Gene delivery&#x201d; refers to the introduction of an exogenous polynucleotide into a cell for gene transfer, and may encompass targeting, binding, uptake, transport, localization, replicon integration and expression.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">&#x201c;Gene transfer&#x201d; refers to the introduction of an exogenous polynucleotide into a cell which may encompass targeting, binding, uptake, transport, localization and replicon integration, but is distinct from and does not imply subsequent expression of the gene.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">&#x201c;Gene expression&#x201d; or &#x201c;expression&#x201d; refers to the process of gene transcription, translation, and post-translational modification.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">An &#x201c;infectious&#x201d; virus or viral particle is one that comprises a polynucleotide component which it is capable of delivering into a cell for which the viral species is trophic. The term does not necessarily imply any replication capacity of the virus.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The term &#x201c;polynucleotide&#x201d; refers to a polymeric form of nucleotides of any length, including deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides, or analogs thereof. A polynucleotide may comprise modified nucleotides, such as methylated or capped nucleotides and nucleotide analogs, and may be interrupted by non-nucleotide components. If present, modifications to the nucleotide structure may be imparted before or after assembly of the polymer. The term polynucleotide, as used herein, refers interchangeably to double- and single-stranded molecules. Unless otherwise specified or required, any embodiment described herein that is a polynucleotide encompasses both the double-stranded form and each of two complementary single-stranded forms known or predicted to make up the double-stranded form.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">An &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; polynucleotide, e.g., plasmid, virus, polypeptide or other substance refers to a preparation of the substance devoid of at least some of the other components that may also be present where the substance or a similar substance naturally occurs or is initially prepared from. Thus, for example, an isolated substance may be prepared by using a purification technique to enrich it from a source mixture. Isolated nucleic acid, peptide or polypeptide is present in a form or setting that is different from that in which it is found in nature. For example, a given DNA sequence (e.g., a gene) is found on the host cell chromosome in proximity to neighboring genes; RNA sequences, such as a specific mRNA sequence encoding a specific protein, are found in the cell as a mixture with numerous other mRNAs that encode a multitude of proteins. The isolated nucleic acid molecule may be present in single-stranded or double-stranded form. When an isolated nucleic acid molecule is to be utilized to express a protein, the molecule will contain at a minimum the sense or coding strand (e.g., the molecule may single-stranded), but may contain both the sense and anti-sense strands (i.e., the molecule may be double-stranded). Enrichment can be measured on an absolute basis, such as weight per volume of solution, or it can be measured in relation to a second, potentially interfering substance present in the source mixture. Increasing enrichments of the embodiments of this invention are envisioned. Thus, for example, a 2-fold enrichment, 10-fold enrichment, 100-fold enrichment, or a 1000-fold enrichment.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">A &#x201c;transcriptional regulatory sequence&#x201d; refers to a genomic region that controls the transcription of a gene or coding sequence to which it is operably linked. Transcriptional regulatory sequences of use in the present invention generally include at least one transcriptional promoter and may also include one or more enhancers and/or terminators of transcription.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">&#x201c;Operably linked&#x201d; refers to an arrangement of two or more components, wherein the components so described are in a relationship permitting them to function in a coordinated manner. By way of illustration, a transcriptional regulatory sequence or a promoter is operably linked to a coding sequence if the TRS or promoter promotes transcription of the coding sequence. An operably linked TRS is generally joined in cis with the coding sequence, but it is not necessarily directly adjacent to it.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">&#x201c;Heterologous&#x201d; means derived from a genotypically distinct entity from the entity to which it is compared. For example, a polynucleotide introduced by genetic engineering techniques into a different cell type is a heterologous polynucleotide (and, when expressed, can encode a heterologous polypeptide). Similarly, a transcriptional regulatory element such as a promoter that is removed from is native coding sequence and operably linked to a different coding sequence is a heterologous transcriptional regulatory element.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">A &#x201c;terminator&#x201d; refers to a polynucleotide sequence that tends to diminish or prevent read-through transcription (i.e., it diminishes or prevent transcription originating on one side of the terminator from continuing through to the other side of the terminator). The degree to which transcription is disrupted is typically a function of the base sequence and/or the length of the terminator sequence. In particular, as is well known in numerous molecular biological systems, particular DNA sequences, generally referred to as &#x201c;transcriptional termination sequences&#x201d; are specific sequences that tend to disrupt read-through transcription by RNA polymerase, presumably by causing the RNA polymerase molecule to stop and/or disengage from the DNA being transcribed. Typical example of such sequence-specific terminators include polyadenylation (&#x201c;polyA&#x201d;) sequences, e.g., SV40 polyA. In addition to or in place of such sequence-specific terminators, insertions of relatively long DNA sequences between a promoter and a coding region also tend to disrupt transcription of the coding region, generally in proportion to the length of the intervening sequence. This effect presumably arises because there is always some tendency for an RNA polymerase molecule to become disengaged from the DNA being transcribed, and increasing the length of the sequence to be traversed before reaching the coding region would generally increase the likelihood that disengagement would occur before transcription of the coding region was completed or possibly even initiated. Terminators may thus prevent transcription from only one direction (&#x201c;uni-directional&#x201d; terminators) or from both directions (&#x201c;bi-directional&#x201d; terminators), and may be comprised of sequence-specific termination sequences or sequence-non-specific terminators or both. A variety of such terminator sequences are known in the art; and illustrative uses of such sequences within the context of the present invention are provided below.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">&#x201c;Host cells,&#x201d; &#x201c;cell lines,&#x201d; &#x201c;cell cultures,&#x201d; &#x201c;packaging cell line&#x201d; and other such terms denote higher eukaryotic cells, such as mammalian cells including human cells, useful in the present invention, e.g., to produce recombinant virus or recombinant fusion polypeptide. These cells include the progeny of the original cell that was transduced. It is understood that the progeny of a single cell may not necessarily be completely identical (in morphology or in genomic complement) to the original parent cell.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">&#x201c;Recombinant,&#x201d; as applied to a polynucleotide means that the polynucleotide is the product of various combinations of cloning, restriction and/or ligation steps, and other procedures that result in a construct that is distinct from a polynucleotide found in nature. A recombinant virus is a viral particle comprising a recombinant polynucleotide. The terms respectively include replicates of the original polynucleotide construct and progeny of the original virus construct.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">A &#x201c;control element&#x201d; or &#x201c;control sequence&#x201d; is a nucleotide sequence involved in an interaction of molecules that contributes to the functional regulation of a polynucleotide, including replication, duplication, transcription, splicing, translation, or degradation of the polynucleotide. The regulation may affect the frequency, speed, or specificity of the process, and may be enhancing or inhibitory in nature. Control elements known in the art include, for example, transcriptional regulatory sequences such as promoters and enhancers. A promoter is a DNA region capable under certain conditions of binding RNA polymerase and initiating transcription of a coding region usually located downstream (in the 3&#x2032; direction) from the promoter. Promoters include AAV promoters, e.g., P5, P19, P40 and AAV ITR promoters, as well as heterologous promoters.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">An &#x201c;expression vector&#x201d; is a vector comprising a region which encodes a gene product of interest, and is used for effecting the expression of the gene product in an intended target cell. An expression vector also comprises control elements operatively linked to the encoding region to facilitate expression of the protein in the target. The combination of control elements and a gene or genes to which they are operably linked for expression is sometimes referred to as an &#x201c;expression cassette,&#x201d; a large number of which are known and available in the art or can be readily constructed from components that are available in the art.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The terms &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d; and &#x201c;protein&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein to refer to polymers of amino acids of any length. The terms also encompass an amino acid polymer that has been modified; for example, disulfide bond formation, glycosylation, acetylation, phosphonylation, lipidation, or conjugation with a labeling component.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The term &#x201c;exogenous,&#x201d; when used in relation to a protein, gene, nucleic acid, or polynucleotide in a cell or organism refers to a protein, gene, nucleic acid, or polynucleotide which has been introduced into the cell or organism by artificial or natural means. An exogenous nucleic acid may be from a different organism or cell, or it may be one or more additional copies of a nucleic acid which occurs naturally within the organism or cell. By way of a non-limiting example, an exogenous nucleic acid is in a chromosomal location different from that of natural cells, or is otherwise flanked by a different nucleic acid sequence than that found in nature, e.g., an expression cassette which links a promoter from one gene to an open reading frame for a gene product from a different gene.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">&#x201c;Transformed&#x201d; or &#x201c;transgenic&#x201d; is used herein to include any host cell or cell line, which has been altered or augmented by the presence of at least one recombinant DNA sequence. The host cells of the present invention are typically produced by transfection with a DNA sequence in a plasmid expression vector, as an isolated linear DNA sequence, or infection with a recombinant viral vector.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The term &#x201c;sequence homology&#x201d; means the proportion of base matches between two nucleic acid sequences or the proportion amino acid matches between two amino acid sequences. When sequence homology is expressed as a percentage, e.g., 50%, the percentage denotes the proportion of matches over the length of a selected sequence that is compared to some other sequence. Gaps (in either of the two sequences) are permitted to maximize matching; gap lengths of 15 bases or less are usually used, 6 bases or less e.g., with 2 bases or less. When using oligonucleotides as probes or treatments, the sequence homology between the target nucleic acid and the oligonucleotide sequence is generally not less than 17 target base matches out of 20 possible oligonucleotide base pair matches (85%); not less than 9 matches out of 10 possible base pair matches (90%), or not less than 19 matches out of 20 possible base pair matches (95%).</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Two amino acid sequences are homologous if there is a partial or complete identity between their sequences. For example, 85% homology means that 85% of the amino acids are identical when the two sequences are aligned for maximum matching. Gaps (in either of the two sequences being matched) are allowed in maximizing matching; gap lengths of 5 or less or with 2 or less. Alternatively, two protein sequences (or polypeptide sequences derived from them of at least 30 amino acids in length) are homologous, as this term is used herein, if they have an alignment score of at more than 5 (in standard deviation units) using the program ALIGN with the mutation data matrix and a gap penalty of 6 or greater. The two sequences or parts thereof are more homologous if their amino acids are greater than or equal to 50% identical when optimally aligned using the ALIGN program.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The term &#x201c;corresponds to&#x201d; is used herein to mean that a polynucleotide sequence is structurally related to all or a portion of a reference polynucleotide sequence, or that a polypeptide sequence is structurally related to all or a portion of a reference polypeptide sequence, e.g., they have at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or more, e.g., 99% or 100%, sequence identity. In contradistinction, the term &#x201c;complementary to&#x201d; is used herein to mean that the complementary sequence is homologous to all or a portion of a reference polynucleotide sequence. For illustration, the nucleotide sequence &#x201c;TATAC&#x201d; corresponds to a reference sequence &#x201c;TATAC&#x201d; and is complementary to a reference sequence &#x201c;GTATA&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The term &#x201c;sequence identity&#x201d; means that two polynucleotide sequences are identical (i.e., on a nucleotide-by-nucleotide basis) over the window of comparison. The term &#x201c;percentage of sequence identity&#x201d; means that two polynucleotide sequences are identical (i.e., on a nucleotide-by-nucleotide basis) over the window of comparison. The term &#x201c;percentage of sequence identity&#x201d; is calculated by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over the window of comparison, determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base (e.g., A, T, C, G, U, or I) occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison (i.e., the window size), and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity. The terms &#x201c;substantial identity&#x201d; as used herein denote a characteristic of a polynucleotide sequence, wherein the polynucleotide comprises a sequence that has at least 85 percent sequence identity, e.g., at least 90 to 95 percent sequence identity, or at least 99 percent sequence identity as compared to a reference sequence over a comparison window of at least 20 nucleotide positions, frequently over a window of at least 20-50 nucleotides, wherein the percentage of sequence identity is calculated by comparing the reference sequence to the polynucleotide sequence which may include deletions or additions which total 20 percent or less of the reference sequence over the window of comparison.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">&#x201c;Conservative&#x201d; amino acid substitutions are, for example, aspartic-glutamic as polar acidic amino acids; lysine/arginine/histidine as polar basic amino acids; leucine/isoleucine/methionine/valine/alanine/glycine/proline as non-polar or hydrophobic amino acids; serine/threonine as polar or uncharged hydrophilic amino acids. Conservative amino acid substitution also includes groupings based on side chains. For example, a group of amino acids having aliphatic side chains is glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine; a group of amino acids having aliphatic-hydroxyl side chains is serine and threonine; a group of amino acids having amide-containing side chains is asparagine and glutamine; a group of amino acids having aromatic side chains is phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; a group of amino acids having basic side chains is lysine, arginine, and histidine; and a group of amino acids having sulfur-containing side chains is cysteine and methionine. For example, it is reasonable to expect that replacement of a leucine with an isoleucine or valine, an aspartate with a glutamate, a threonine with a serine, or a similar replacement of an amino acid with a structurally related amino acid will not have a major effect on the properties of the resulting polypeptide. Whether an amino acid change results in a functional polypeptide can readily be determined by assaying the specific activity of the polypeptide. Naturally occurring residues are divided into groups based on common side-chain properties: (1) hydrophobic: norleucine, met, ala, val, leu, ile; (2) neutral hydrophilic: cys, ser, thr; (3) acidic: asp, glu; (4) basic: asn, gin, his, lys, arg; (5) residues that influence chain orientation: gly, pro; and (6) aromatic; trp, tyr, phe.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The disclosure also envisions polypeptides with non-conservative substitutions. Non-conservative substitutions entail exchanging a member of one of the classes described above for another.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Exemplary Lubricin Sequences</heading><p id="p-0094"

example, viral vectors, liposomes and other lipid-containing complexes, such as lipoplexes (DNA and cationic lipids), polyplexes, e.g., DNA complexed with cationic polymers such as polyethylene glycol, nanoparticles, e.g., magnetic inorganic nanoparticles that bind or are functionalized to bind DNA such as Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>or MnO<sub>2 </sub>nanoparticles, microparticles, e.g., formed of polylactide polygalactide reagents, nanotubes, e.g., silica nanotubes, and other macromolecular complexes capable of mediating delivery of a gene to a host cell. Vectors can also comprise other components or functionalities that further modulate gene delivery and/or gene expression, or that otherwise provide beneficial properties to the targeted cells. Such other components include, for example, components that influence binding or targeting to cells (including components that mediate cell-type or tissue-specific binding); components that influence uptake of the vector by the cell; components that influence localization of the transferred gene within the cell after uptake (such as agents mediating nuclear localization); and components that influence expression of the gene. Such components also might include markers, such as detectable and/or selectable markers that can be used to detect or select for cells that have taken up and are expressing the nucleic acid delivered by the vector. A large variety of such vectors are known in the art and are generally available.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0095">Gene delivery vectors within the scope of the invention include, but are not limited to, isolated nucleic acid, e.g., plasmid-based vectors which may be extrachromosomally maintained, and viral vectors, e.g., recombinant adenovirus, retrovirus, lentivirus, herpesvirus, poxvirus, papilloma virus, or adeno-associated virus, including viral and non-viral vectors which are present in liposomes, e.g., neutral or cationic liposomes, such as DOSPA/DOPE, DOGS/DOPE or DMRIE/DOPE liposomes, and/or associated with other molecules such as DNA-anti-DNA antibody-cationic lipid (DOTMA/DOPE) complexes. Exemplary viral gene delivery vectors are described below. Gene delivery vectors may be administered via any route including, but not limited to, intracranial, intrathecal, intramuscular, buccal, rectal, intravenous or intracoronary administration, and transfer to cells may be enhanced using electroporation and/or iontophoresis, and/or scaffolding such as extracellular matrix or hydrogels, e.g., a hydrogel patch. In one embodiment, a permeation enhancer is not employed to enhance indirect delivery to the CNS.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Retroviral Vectors</heading><p id="p-0098" num="0096">Retroviral vectors exhibit several distinctive features including their ability to stably and precisely integrate into the host genome providing long-term transgene expression. These vectors can be manipulated ex vivo to eliminate infectious gene particles to minimize the risk of systemic infection and patient-to-patient transmission. Pseudotyped retroviral vectors can alter host cell tropism.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Lentiviruses</heading><p id="p-0099" num="0097">Lentiviruses are derived from a family of retroviruses that include human immunodeficiency virus and feline immunodeficiency virus. However, unlike retroviruses that only infect dividing cells, lentiviruses can infect both dividing and nondividing cells. For instance, lentiviral vectors based on human immunodeficiency virus genome are capable of efficient transduction of cardiac myocytes in vivo. Although lentiviruses have specific tropisms, pseudotyping the viral envelope with vesicular stomatitis virus yields virus with a broader range (Schnepp et al., <i>Meth. Mol. Med., </i>69:427 (2002)).</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">Adenoviral Vectors</heading><p id="p-0100" num="0098">Adenoviral vectors may be rendered replication-incompetent by deleting the early (E1A and E1B) genes responsible for viral gene expression from the genome and are stably maintained into the host cells in an extrachromosomal form. These vectors have the ability to transfect both replicating and nonreplicating cells and, in particular, these vectors have been shown to efficiently infect cardiac myocytes in vivo, e.g., after direction injection or perfusion. Adenoviral vectors have been shown to result in transient expression of therapeutic genes in vivo, peaking at 7 days and lasting approximately 4 weeks. The duration of transgene expression may be improved in systems utilizing neural specific promoters. In addition, adenoviral vectors can be produced at very high titers, allowing efficient gene transfer with small volumes of virus.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">Adeno-Associated Virus Vectors</heading><p id="p-0101" num="0099">Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAV) are derived from nonpathogenic parvoviruses, evoke essentially no cellular immune response, and produce transgene expression lasting months in most systems. Moreover, like adenovirus, adeno-associated virus vectors also have the capability to infect replicating and nonreplicating cells and are believed to be nonpathogenic to humans. Moreover, they appear promising for sustained cardiac gene transfer (Hoshijima et al., <i>Nat. Med., </i>8:864 (2002); Lynch et al., <i>Circ. Res., </i>80:197 (1997)).</p><p id="p-0102" num="0100">AAV vectors include but are not limited to AAV1, AAV2, AAV5, AAV7, AAV8, AAV9 or AAVrh.10.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">Plasmid DNA Vectors</heading><p id="p-0103" num="0101">Plasmid DNA is often referred to as &#x201c;naked DNA&#x201d; to indicate the absence of a more elaborate packaging system. Direct injection of plasmid DNA to myocardial cells in vivo has been accomplished. Plasmid-based vectors are relatively nonimmunogenic and nonpathogenic, with the potential to stably integrate in the cellular genome, resulting in long-term gene expression in postmitotic cells in vivo. For example, expression of secreted angiogenesis factors after muscle injection of plasmid DNA, despite relatively low levels of focal transgene expression, has demonstrated significant biologic effects in animal models and appears promising clinically (Isner, <i>Nature, </i>415:234 (2002)). Furthermore, plasmid DNA is rapidly degraded in the blood stream; therefore, the chance of transgene expression in distant organ systems is negligible. Plasmid DNA may be delivered to cells as part of a macromolecular complex, e.g., a liposome or DNA-protein complex, and delivery may be enhanced using techniques including electroporation.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">Exemplar Formulations</heading><p id="p-0104" num="0102">The disclosed nanoparticles may include or may be formed from biodegradable polymeric molecules which may include, but are not limited to polylactic acid (PLA), polyglycolic acid (PGA), co-polymers of PLA and PGA (e.g., polyactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA)), poly-&#x3b5;-caprolactone (PCL), polyethylene glycol (PEG), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate), poly(p-dioxanone), polypropylene fumarate, poly(orthoesters), polyol/diketene acetals addition polymers, poly-alkyl-cyano-acrylates (PAC), poly(sebacic anhydride) (PSA), poly(carboxybiscarboxyphenoxyphenoxy hexone (PCPP) poly[bis (p-carboxypheonoxy)methane](PCPM), copolymers of PSA, PCPP and PCPM, poly(amino acids), poly(pseudo amino acids), polyphosphazenes, derivatives of poly[(dichloro)phosphazenes] and poly[(organo)phosphazenes], poly-hydroxybutyric acid, or S-caproic acid, elastin, or gelatin.

Suitable methods for preparing the nanoparticles may include methods that utilize a dispersion of a preformed polymer, which may include but are not limited to solvent evaporation, nanoprecipitation, emulsification/solvent diffusion, salting out, dialysis, and supercritical fluid technology. In some embodiments, the nanoparticles may be prepared by forming a double emulsion (e.g., water-in-oil-in-water) and subsequently performing solvent-evaporation.

Typically, the nanoparticles have a zeta-potential greater than 0. In some embodiments, the nanoparticles have a zeta-potential between about 5 mV to about 45 mV, between about 15 mV to about 35 mV, or between about 20 mV and about 40 mV. Zeta-potential may be determined via characteristics that include electrophoretic mobility or dynamic electrophoretic mobility. Electrokinetic phenomena and electroacoustic phenomena may be utilized to calculate zeta-potential.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0106">In one embodiment, a non-viral delivery vehicle comprises polymers including but not limited to poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), polylactic acid (PLA), linear and/or branched PEI with differing molecular weights (e.g., 2, 22 and 25 kDa), dendrimers such as polyamidoamine (PAMAM) and polymethoacrylates; lipids including but not limited to cationic liposomes, cationic emulsions, DOTAP, DOTMA, DMRIE, DOSPA, distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), DOPE, or DC-cholesterol; peptide based vectors including but not limited to Poly-L-lysine or protamine; or poly(&#x3b2;-amino ester), chitosan, PEI-polyethylene glycol, PEI-mannose-dextrose, DOTAP-cholesterol or RNAiMAX.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0107">In one embodiment, the delivery vehicle is a glycopolymer-based delivery vehicle, poly(glycoamidoamine)s (PGAAs), that have the ability to complex with various polynucleotide types and form nanoparticles. These materials are created by polymerizing the methylester or lactone derivatives of various carbohydrates (D-glucarate (D), meso-galactarate (G), D-mannarate (M), and L-tartarate (T)) with a series of oligoethyleneamine monomers (containing between 1-4 ethylenamines (Liu and Reineke, 2006). A subset composed of these carbohydrates and four ethyleneamines in the polymer repeat units yielded exceptional delivery efficiency.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0108">In one embodiment, the delivery vehicle comprises polyethyleneimine (PEI), Polyamidoamine (PAMAM), PEI-PEG, PEI-PEG-mannose, dextran-PEI, OVA conjugate, PLGA microparticles, or PLGA microparticles coated with PAMAM, or any combination thereof. The disclosed cationic polymer may include, but are not limited to, polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers. Polyamidoamine dendrimers suitable for preparing the presently disclosed nanoparticles may include 3rd-, 4th-, 5th-, or at least 6th-generation dendrimers.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0109">In one embodiment, the delivery vehicle comprises a cationic lipid, e.g., N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propel]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium (DOTMA), 2,3-dioleyloxy-N-[2-spermine carboxamide]ethyl-N,N-dimethyl-1-propanammonium trifluoracetate (DOSPA, Lipofectamine); 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP); N-[1-(2,3-dimyristloxy) propyl]; N,N-dimethyl-N-(2-hydroxyethyl) ammonium bromide (DMRIE), 3-&#x3b2;-[N&#x2014;(N,N&#x2032;-dimethylaminoethane) carbamoyl] cholesterol (DC-Chol); dioctadecyl amidoglyceryl spermine (DOGS, Transfectam); or imethyldioctadeclyammonium bromide (DDAB). The positively charged hydrophilic head group of cationic lipids usually consists of monoamine such as tertiary and quaternary amines, polyamine, amidinium, or guanidinium group. A series of pyridinium lipids have been developed (Zhu et al., 2008; van der Woude et al., 1997; Ilies et al., 2004). In addition to pyridinium cationic lipids, other types of heterocyclic head group include imidazole, piperizine and amino acid. The main function of cationic head groups is to condense negatively charged nucleic acids by means of electrostatic interaction to slightly positively charged nanoparticles, leading to enhanced cellular uptake and endosomal escape.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0110">Lipids having two linear fatty acid chains, such as DOTMA, DOTAP and SAINT-2, or DODAC, may be employed as a delivery vehicle, as well as tetraalkyl lipid chain surfactant, the dimer of N,N-dioleyl-N,N-dimethylammonium chloride (DODAC). All the trans-orientated lipids regardless of their hydrophobic chain lengths (C<sub>16.1</sub>, C<sub>18.1 </sub>and C<sub>20.1</sub>) appear to enhance the transfection efficiency compared with their cis-orientated counterparts.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0111">The structures of cationic polymers useful as a delivery vehicle include but are not limited to linear polymers such as chitosan and linear poly(ethyleneimine), branched polymers such as branch poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI), circle-like polymers such as cyclodextrin, network (crosslinked) type polymers such as crosslinked poly(amino acid) (PAA), and dendrimers. Dendrimers consist of a central core molecule, from which several highly branched arms &#x2018;grow&#x2019; to form a tree-like structure with a manner of symmetry or asymmetry. Examples of dendrimers include polyamidoamine (PAMAM) and polypropylenimine (PPI) dendrimers.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0112">DOPE and cholesterol are commonly used neutral co-lipids for preparing cationic liposomes. Branched PEI-cholesterol water-soluble lipopolymer conjugates self-assemble into cationic micelles.

In one embodiment, when the composition consists of the gene transfer vector complexed with the cationic polymer and optionally encapsulated in nanoparticles, or recombinant virus, and the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, the composition does not comprise any additional components. Any suitable carrier can be used within the context of the invention, and such carriers are well known in the art.

The composition can be formulated to decrease the light sensitivity and/or temperature sensitivity of the gene transfer vector. To this end, the composition may comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier, such as, for example, those described above, and a stabilizing agent selected from the group consisting of polysorbate 80, L-arginine, polyvinylpyrrolidone, trehalose, and combinations thereof. Use of such a composition will extend the shelf life of the gene transfer vector, facilitate administration, and increase the efficiency of the inventive method. Formulations for gene transfer vector containing compositions are further described in, for example, Wright et al., <i>Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Devel., </i>6(2): 174-178 (2003) and Wright et al., <i>Molecular Therapy, </i>12: 171-178 (2005))</p><p id="p-0125" num="0123">The composition also can be formulated to enhance transduction efficiency. In addition, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the gene transfer vector can be present in a composition with other therapeutic or biologically-active agents. For example, factors that control inflammation, such as ibuprofen or steroids, can be part of the composition to reduce swelling and inflammation associated with in vivo administration of the gene transfer vector. Immune system stimulators or adjuvants, e.g., interleukins, lipopolysaccharide, and double-stranded RNA. Antibiotics, i.e., microbicides and fungicides, can be present to treat existing infection and/or reduce the risk of future infection, such as infection associated with gene transfer procedures.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0124">Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsulated matrices of the subject vectors in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending on the ratio of vector to polymer, and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of vector release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the vector optionally in a complex with a cationic polymer in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissue.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0125">In certain embodiments, a formulation comprises a biocompatible polymer selected from the group consisting of polyamides, polycarbonates, polyalkylenes, polymers of acrylic and methacrylic esters, polyvinyl polymers, polyglycolides, polysiloxanes, polyurethanes and co-polymers thereof, celluloses, polypropylene, polyethylenes, polystyrene, polymers of lactic acid and glycolic acid, polyanhydrides, poly(ortho)esters, poly(butic acid), poly(valeric acid), poly(lactide-co-caprolactone), polysaccharides, proteins, polyhyaluronic acids, polycyanoacrylates, and blends, mixtures, or copolymers thereof.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0126">The composition can be administered in or on a device that allows controlled or sustained release, such as a sponge, biocompatible meshwork, mechanical reservoir, or mechanical implant. Implants (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,443,505), devices (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,863,457), such as an implantable device, e.g., a mechanical reservoir or an implant or a device comprised of a polymeric composition, are particularly useful for administration of the inventive gene transfer vector. The composition also can be administered in the form of sustained-release formulations (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,378,475) comprising, for example, gel foam, hyaluronic acid, gelatin, chondroitin sulfate, a polyphosphoester, such as bis-2-hydroxyethyl-terephthalate (BHET), and/or a polylactic-glycolic acid.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0127">The dose of the gene transfer vector in the composition administered to the mammal will depend on a number of factors, including the size (mass) of the mammal, the extent of any side-effects, the particular route of administration, and the like. In one embodiment, the inventive method comprises administering a &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; of the composition comprising the inventive gene transfer vector described herein. A &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve a desired therapeutic result. The therapeutically effective amount may vary according to factors such as the extent of the disease or disorder, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the gene transfer vector to elicit a desired response in the individual. The dose of gene transfer vector in the composition required to achieve a particular therapeutic effect typically is administered in units of vector genome copies per cell (gc/cell) or vector genome copies/per kilogram of body weight (gc/kg). One of ordinary skill in the art can readily determine an appropriate gene transfer vector dose range to treat a patient having a particular disease or disorder, based on these and other factors that are well known in the art. In one embodiment, the therapeutically effective amount may be between 1&#xd7;10<sup>10 </sup>genome copies to 1&#xd7;10<sup>13 </sup>genome copies for viruses.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0128">In one embodiment, the composition is administered once to the mammal. It is believed that a single administration of the composition may result in persistent expression in the mammal with minimal side effects. However, in certain cases, it may be appropriate to administer the composition multiple times during a therapeutic period to ensure sufficient exposure of cells to the composition. For example, the composition may be administered to the mammal two or more times (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, or 10 or more times) during a therapeutic period.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0129">The present disclosure provides pharmaceutically acceptable compositions which comprise a therapeutically-effective amount of gene transfer vector comprising a nucleic acid sequence as described above.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="2">Routes of Administration, Dosages and Dosage Forms</heading><p id="p-0132" num="0130">Administration of the gene delivery vectors may be continuous or intermittent, depending, for example, upon the recipient's physiological condition, and other factors known to skilled practitioners. The administration of the gene delivery vector(s) may be essentially continuous over a preselected period of time or may be in a series of spaced doses. Both local administration, e.g., intra joint, e.g., intraarticular, intranasal or intrathecal, and systemic administration are contemplated. Any route of administration may be employed, e.g., intravenous, intranasal or intrabronchial, or local administration, e.g., to a joint.

The formulations may, where appropriate, be conveniently presented in discrete unit dosage forms and may be prepared by any of the methods well known to pharmacy.

A suitable administration format may best be determined by a medical practitioner for each patient individually, according to standard procedures. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and their formulation are described in standard formulations treatises, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceuticals Sciences. By &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable&#x201d; it is meant a carrier, diluent, excipient, and/or salt that is compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation, and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0134">Vectors of the present invention may be formulated in solution at neutral pH, for example, about pH 6.5 to about pH 8.5, or from about pH 7 to 8, with an excipient to bring the solution to about isotonicity, for example, 4.5% mannitol or 0.9% sodium chloride, pH buffered with art-known buffer solutions, such as sodium phosphate, that are generally regarded as safe, together with an accepted preservative such as metacresol 0.1% to 0.75%, or from 0.15% to 0.4% metacresol. Obtaining a desired isotonicity can be accomplished using sodium chloride or other pharmaceutically acceptable agents such as dextrose, boric acid, sodium tartrate, propylene glycol, polyols (such as mannitol and sorbitol), or other inorganic or organic solutes. Sodium chloride is useful for buffers containing sodium ions. If desired, solutions of the above compositions can also be prepared to enhance shelf life and stability. Therapeutically useful compositions can be prepared by mixing the ingredients following generally accepted procedures. For example, the selected components can be mixed to produce a concentrated mixture which may then be adjusted to the final concentration and viscosity by the addition of water and/or a buffer to control pH or an additional solute to control tonicity.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0135">The vectors can be provided in a dosage form containing an amount of a vector effective in one or multiple doses.

New Zealand White rabbits were subjected to an impaction insult to the left knee. In the surgery, each animal was positioned prone, and the posterior aspect of the medial femoral condyle was approached through a posterior arthrotomy. The experimental knee was secured on a custom fixation platform, and a 7 mm diameter flat metal platen was placed on the medial femoral surface (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). A force pulse was then delivered by dropping a 1.55-kg mass onto the platen. The peak compressive impact force during impaction was measured using an accelerometer mounted in the drop mass. No impaction force was delivered for the remaining 8 (sham surgery control) animals. Localized osteoarticular injury led to joint-wide histological changes defined as the (ratio of the defect cross-sectional area to the estimated normal cartilage cross-sectional area in a 4 mm antero-posterior span in the central part of habitual weight-bearing region). Changes in the medial femoral surfaces were measured in terms of structural damage, cartilage thickness, cell density, and proteoglycan (PG) staining.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0160">All impacted joints had a cartilage defect on the posterior aspect of the medial femoral surface.

Joint injuries and inflammation increase PRG4 degradation and suppress de novo synthesis, leading to PRG4 deficiency and increased friction between cartilage surfaces (Jones et al., 2009; Elsaid et al., 2007; Elsaid et al., 2005; Jay et al., 2007). Repeated intra-articular injections of recombinant PRG4 over 1-2 weeks has been shown to mitigate PTOA in animal models, indicating that PRG4 loss is pathogenic (Flannery, 2010; Flannery et al., 2009).</p><heading id="h-0023" level="2">Lubricin Delivery Via AAV-Mediated Gene Therapy In Vivo</heading><p id="p-0165" num="0163">Favorable results from studies of PRG4 therapy in animal models have not led to translation to people due in part to difficulties in sustaining therapeutic levels of the recombinant peptide, which can only be achieved with multiple intra-articular injections; hence, the need for approaches that extend the benefits of a single treatment. By ensuring a long-term, steady supply of transgenic protein from cells within the joint, intra-articular PRG4 gene therapy offers a means to address this challenge. This strategy was implemented in rabbit and mouse PTOA models and it was found that transgene expression can be sustained for up to 8 weeks after a single treatment. In preparation, a version of the PRG4 gene was cloned in an AAV-compatible plasmid in which expression is driven by the constitutively active cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). For tracking purposes, a short sequence in the PRG4 mucin domain was replaced with a sequence encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP).

A promising polymer for providing sustained plasmid DNA (pDNA) delivery is poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), which has an FDA approved track record as a vehicle for drug, protein, and pDNA delivery (Abbas et al., 2008). Therapeutic agents loaded in PLGA particles have shown efficient endo-lysosomal escape and sustained intracytoplasmic delivery. Biodegradable PLGA particles are biocompatible and have the capacity to protect pDNA from nuclease degradation and increase pDNA stability (Zhang et al., 2008). The inclusion of excipients such as cationic polymers can protect pDNA loaded into the PLGA particles and improve loading rates (D'Mello et al., 2017). These pDNA loaded PLGA particles exhibited low toxicity and efficient transgene expression profiles. The first step in preparing PLGA pDNA particles is selecting the appropriate molecular weight of PLGA and ratios of lactide and glycolide exhibit to tailor degradation rates for specific applications.</p><heading id="h-0026" level="2">Objectives</heading><p id="p-0168" num="0166">Post-traumatic lubricin deficiency likely promotes PTOA independently from the pathogenic processes targeted by amobarbital.

The Yucatan minipig model was developed to create an IAF of a reproducible severity without arthrotomy (Goetz et al., 2015). Under general anesthesia, an antero-medial approach to the hock joint, which is analogous to the human ankle joint, is made without disrupting the joint capsule. Under fluoroscopic visualization, a custom impaction tripod is rigidly affixed to the talus from the caudal (posterior/inferior) side of the leg. A stress-rising saw cut is made through the anterior tibial cortex, stopping 1-2 mm proximal to the subchondral bone. Two drill holes are made proximal to the saw cut into which a plate with a ball-joint is press fit. This ball joint interfaces with the instrumented sled on our impaction pendulum to rigidly support the tibia. The pendulum delivers a 40 J impact to the impaction tripod, driving the talus against the distal tibia causing a fracture of the distal tibia that is guided by the stress-rising saw cut. The result is a fracture fragment that consists of the anterior third of the distal tibial articular surface which is fixed using standard open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) techniques (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>). Hock fractures in the Yucatan minipig leads reliably to moderate PTOA at 6 months-post op, with additional progression to 12 months (Coleman et al., 2017; Goetz et al., 2015). Intra-operative amobarbital treatment by joint injection with 2.5 mM amobarbital in anatomically-reduced joints was highly effective in preventing changes at 6 months (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>). but was less effective at 12 months (Coleman et al., 2017). In this study it is determined if lubricin gene therapy is an effective adjunct to amobarbital at the later time point, with or without residual incongruity; thus, all animals in this study survive to 12 months post-fracture.

PTOA is a progressively degenerative and irreversible condition that affects over six million individuals in the US. Though there are multiple strategies that can be used to mitigate PTOA, decreasing the damaging shear stress at the articular surface by improving the lubrication of the joint is of interest. Lubricin, also known as proteoglycan 4 (PRG4), is a protein which serves as a lubricant in joints by forming a protective coating along the cartilage extracellular matrix. The majority of PRG4 found in the joint fluid is secreted by synoviocyte and chondrocyte cells. The inflammation that results from injury to joints leads to increased PRG4 degradation and downregulates de novo synthesis. This suppression of PRG4 synthesis means that there is increased friction between cartilage surfaces leading to damaging shear stress.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0203">Poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) is a copolymer that is degradable and FDA approved for use in drug delivery systems.

These nanoplexes were then encapsulated into the degradable PLGA nanoparticles.

A 2 mm-diameter burr was used to create bleeding above the medial and lateral collateral ligaments. A 5 mm skin incision was made mid-diaphysis on the medial tibia and a 1.6 mm-diameter Kirschner wire (K-wire) was inserted in a craniolateral direction and tunneled subcutaneously to the lateral side of the femur, where a short incision was made in the skin and then in the underlying lateral fascia. Muscle bellies were separated and retracted, and then the K-wire was bent and wrapped around the cranial portion of the femur. The wire was pulled taught and secured to the tibia by bending the wire flat, thus pulling the tibia toward the femur and fixing the stifle in flexion. Local anesthetic (0.5% Bupivacaine, total dose not to exceed 8 mg/kg) was applied to the surgery site, and then fascial and skin incisions were closed in a routine manner with resorbable sutures. Sustained Release Buprenorphine (SR-Buprenorphine): A dose of 0.1-0.3 mg/kg, was given subcutaneously pre-operative (op) and a second dose was given 72 hours post-op.

The K-wire was removed via two small incisions, local anesthetic applied to sites, and tissues dosed in routine surgical manner. Pellets were secured to the patellar tendon (distal to the patella) with 6.0 resorbable sutures as shown and arthrotomies were closed (Figure S-1). Analgesics were administered as stated above. All surgeries were performed between 08:00 and 16:00 in an IACUC approved surgical suite under aseptic conditions.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0216">Post-operative care: The animals were monitored at least twice a day for the duration of the study for attitude, pain score, surgical site, eating/drinking habits, and urination/defecation habits. Surgical sites were examined daily for signs of infection or inflammation (swelling, discharge, redness, heat, etc.). Surgical sites were also monitored for self-trauma (rabbit pulling sutures out, excessive licking, etc.). If these conditions were noted, an E-collar was placed on the animal to prevent the animal from inflicting further damage. Rabbits in the immobilization group were monitored for abnormal/excessive movement in the fixed limb (left hind limb), or abnormal use/movement of contralateral limb (right hind limb) indicating that immobilization had failed, or a fracture or other injury of a limb was present.</p><heading id="h-0051" level="2">Mechanical Testing</heading><p id="p-0223" num="0217">Flexion-extension testing of normal and fibrotic joints was performed immediately after euthanasia, when limbs were disarticulated at the hip, stripped of skin and muscle, and fastened securely to a custom testing device equipped with a stepper motor and a 10 N load cell and controlled by a computer with a custom LabVIEW (National Instruments)-based program (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref>) (Hildebrand et al., 2004; Nesterenko et al., 2009). Starting at 10&#xb0; of extension, the limbs were driven to 170&#xb0; of extension, and then returned to the starting position at a rotational velocity of 5&#xb0;/s while continuously recording load and position. The starting extension angle was measured using a digital protractor (Barry Wixey Development) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b></figref>). The peak torque at maximum extension (N-m) and dissipated energy (mJ) were derived as measures of joint stiffness. The increased hysteresis in immobilized joints arises from posterior capsule stiffening, which restricts extension, but not flexion. Measurements were based on the first flexion-extension cycle, as stiffness declined significantly with subsequent cycling, consistent with stretching or failure of capsule tissues during the first cycle.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0218">After flexion-extension testing, a custom loading fixture was used to assess sagittal-plane laxity (drawer test), which is related to cruciate ligament integrity (Tochigi et al., 2011).

The tibial leg holder was attached to a LabVIEW-controlled stepper motor-driven actuator with force feedback via an inline load cell. The tibial leg holder with affixed limb performed a movement of &#xb1;3 mm A-P from the central anatomical position at 1.0 mm/s unless the load limit of &#xb1;75 N was reached. Force and displacement data were continuously recorded through the sequence of tests, which consisted of three cycles to adjust leg placement for neutral starting position, followed by three cycles of data collection.

SSZ has been shown to overcome this resistance by blocking NF-&#x3ba;B activation (Oakley et al., 2005; Abe et al., 2012; Elsharkawy et al., 2005; Oakley et al., 2009). Myofibroblast apoptosis has also been shown to be down-regulated by adhesion to stiff substrates via a Rho-associated protein kinase-mediated mechanotransduction pathway (Van De Water et al., 2013; Junker et al., 2008). Reducing substrate tension leads to rapid induction of BCL-2/cytochrome C-induced apoptosis (Hinz, 2016; Hinz et al., 2001). BAPN and CHP could induce apoptosis through this pathway by degrading the ability of myofibroblasts to sustain the high rates of collagen matrix synthesis required to maintain stiff extracellular matrices. Trends toward reduced joint stiffness, contractile activity, and &#x3b1;-SMA expression in the BAPN and CHP groups are consistent with this hypothesis.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0238">Drugs were encapsulated in PLGA pellets to localize delivery to the fibrotic joint.

Pellet delivery allowed drug levels to be steadily maintained for 2-3 weeks, obviating the need for multiple intra-articular injections while reducing toxicity to normal joint tissues. In that regard, drawer test results suggested that pellets carrying SSZ did not lead to A-P plane laxity, indicating that the treatments did not impair ACL function (Tochigi et al., 2011) and in vitro tests showed that the pellet forms of the drugs was not cytotoxic to normal capsule fibroblasts.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0239">Regression analysis revealed positive correlations between mechanical measures (maximum extension torque and dissipated energy) and among biologic measures (maximum compaction, compaction rate, and &#x3b1;-SMA expression).

Fibrosis/contracture is associated with the abnormal persistence of myofibroblasts, which over-produce and contract collagen matrices. It was hypothesized that intra-articular therapy with drugs targeting myofibroblast survival (sulfasalazine), or collagen production (beta-aminopropionitrile and cis-hydroxyproline), would reduce joint stiffness in a rabbit model of fibrosis/contracture. Drugs were encapsulated in poly[lactic-co-glycolic] acid pellets, and implanted in joints after fibrosis/contracture induction. Capsule alpha-smooth muscle actin (&#x3b1;-SMA) expression and intimal thickness were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and histomorphometry respectively. Joint stiffness was quantified by flexion-extension testing. Drawer tests were employed to determine if the drugs induced cruciate ligament laxity. Joint capsule fibroblasts were tested in vitro for contractile activity and &#x3b1;-SMA expression. Stiffness in immobilized joints treated with blank pellets (control) was significantly higher than in non-immobilized, untreated joints (normal) (p=0.0008), and higher than in immobilized joints treated with sulfasalazine (p=0.0065). None of the drugs caused significant cruciate ligament laxity. Intimal thickness was significantly lower than control in the normal and sulfasalazine-treated groups (p=0.010 and 0.025 respectively).

The explants were cultured for 48 h and the transfection of the nanoparticles was evaluated by Confocal microscopy (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>44</b></figref>). To visualize the nanoparticle entry into the cells of the explant, the nanoparticles were encapsulated with Rhodamine B dye. The transfection in the cells was observed with PLGA-PEI-pEGFP and PLGA-PEI-AAV only. There is no transfection AAV group within 48 h. The transfection was occurred mostly in the deep zone of the tissue and none was observed in the superficial zone.
