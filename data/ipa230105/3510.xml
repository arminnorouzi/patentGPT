The piping systems can include straight and bent sections of pipe, as well as sections with more complex geometries such as reducers, expanders, elbow joints, and tee joints. These piping systems are subject to internal wear from erosion and/or corrosion caused by the flow of the fluids within the piping systems. Additionally, solid particles that may be flowing with the fluids within the piping can contact the inner surface of the piping systems and exacerbate erosion. Erosion tends to be most severe at locations where the piping geometry redirects the fluid flow, such as at elbow and tee joints. The fluids transported within the piping systems are often transported under pressure which adds stress to the walls of the piping systems.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order to maintain the integrity of the piping systems, a variety of techniques are available to monitor sections of the pipe systems and detect internal wear of the pipe sections. One approach uses ultrasonic sensors permanently mounted on the outside of the piping. Another approach uses a pipeline inspection gauge (&#x201c;PIG&#x201d;) that travels along the inside of the piping system and uses sensors, such as ultrasonic sensors or magnetic flux leakage sensors, to detect wear. The foregoing approaches have limitations in that they may only gather data at a fixed location, they may require interruption of the fluid transport process, they can be expensive to deploy, they are limited in applicable pipe sizing and geometry, they may require personnel to complete challenging tasks in the field, and they cannot passively provide measurements continuously or immediately on demand. The foregoing limitations are particularly acute for piping systems located undersea or in hazardous locations.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 8,941,821 to Coupe et al. (&#x201c;Coupe&#x201d;) describes using optical fibers placed on the outer surface of a pipe to measure strain in the pipe wall. The optical fibers described in Coupe include fiber Bragg gratings (&#x201c;FBGs&#x201d;) that can reflect light when the surface of the pipe deforms. The reflected light can be processed into a strain measurement. However, Coupe is limited in that it teaches spacing the FBGs at least one meter apart and only taking localized measurements at discrete and widely spaced points on the surface of the pipe. A shortcoming of Coupe's approach is that wear can occur along the inner wall of the pipe in irregular contours and at unexpected locations. For example, an area of wear that has a narrow channel shape or a hemispherical shape could easily escape detection using the approach described in Coupe. The localized measurements at discrete and widely spaced points described in Coupe will not provide an accurate assessment of the erosion and corrosion that may be present in various areas along the inner wall of the pipe.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, there is a need for an improved technique for detecting wear within piping systems. Specifically, a sensing technique that can collect data with greater resolution to provide a more complete and accurate assessment of the condition of the inner surface of the piping system would be beneficial. Additionally, a sensing technique that can collect data for substantial lengths (e.g. a kilometer) of the piping system would be beneficial. Furthermore, a sensing technique that collects data passively without the need for a local power source would be beneficial.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one example embodiment, the present disclosure is generally directed to an optical strain gauge system for measuring strain on an exterior surface of a piping system.

The example systems and methods described herein are particularly beneficial in the oil and gas industry where fluids are often transported through lengthy piping systems. The example systems described herein improve upon prior approaches to detecting wear within a piping system because they can be deployed more easily in remote locations, including remote undersea locations. As will be described, the approaches disclosed herein provide a more accurate assessment of wear along the inner surface of a piping system. Obtaining an accurate assessment of wear within a piping system is beneficial in that pipe failures and unplanned downtime for the piping system can be reduced.

While 8 loops of optical fiber are illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, it should be understood that the optical fiber can be arranged to monitor large lengths of pipe including distances up to, for example, 1 kilometer.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0036">Each loop of optical fiber in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> comprises FBGs <b>132</b> disposed along the length of the optical fiber. Different types of optical strain gauge systems can be used. Using FBGs in the optical strain gauge system is advantageous because the FBGs provide a well-defined sensor with a high signal-to-noise ratio resulting in high strain sensitivity, resolution, and accuracy. However, an optical strain gauge system without FBGs can use a scattering technique that detects strain by measuring scattering of light caused by naturally occurring and random imperfections in the fiber optic cable. In the scattering approach, the optical strain gauge system obtains data by observing changes in naturally occurring Raman, Brillouin, or Rayleigh backscattering patterns. The scattering approach is fully distributed, meaning data can be obtained along the entire length of the fiber instead of only at critical points. The distributed nature of the scattering approach allows for collection of data over several kilometers and provides a distributed profile of strain along the length of the fiber. However, the scattering approach can be limited in that resolution is only on the order of meters and data acquisition speed is limited.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0037">When high resolution and high data acquisition rates are required, an optical strain gauge system with FBGs is a better approach. With FBGs, two different data demodulation techniques are wavelength division multiplexing (&#x201c;WDM&#x201d;) and optical frequency domain reflectometry (&#x201c;OFDR&#x201d;). WDM can cover large distances and can obtain data quickly. WDM technology can support multiple gratings on a fiber, but each grating that is added significantly reduces the data refresh rate. WDM allows for strain monitoring at the location points of the FBGs, as opposed to the entire strain profile along the length of the optical fiber. Therefore, applications requiring very high speed data acquisition, but only for a small number of data points are well-suited for the WDM technology.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0038">On the other hand, OFDR demodulation technology uses FBGs placed end-to-end resulting in a fully distributed sensing fiber. OFDR has significantly higher spatial resolution that the scattering approach and has exponentially more gratings than the WDM technique. OFDR is able to maintain high data refresh rates even as the number of FBG sensors increases. OFDR is more sophisticated than scattering and FBGs using WDM and therefore provides higher spatial resolution, quick data refresh rates, a large number of FBG sensors, and full distribution along the length of the fiber optic cable.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0039">Referring again to the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the FBGs are arranged in a two-dimensional array on the exterior surface of the pipe <b>105</b> and the two-dimensional array of FBGs covers the area of wear located on the interior surface of the pipe <b>105</b>. The FBGs are spaced so that each FBG is within a distance of adjacent FBGs that is not less than 4 mm and not greater than 4 cm.

With the two-dimensional array of FBGs as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a detailed set of surface strain measurements is obtained for the area encompassed by the optical strain gauge. Variations in the surface strain measurements can be correlated to areas of wear on the interior surface of the pipe. Therefore, the two-dimensional array of data points provided by the FBGs provides a more complete picture of variations in wear on the interior surface of the pipe without accessing the interior of the pipe <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0040">When the optical strain gauge system <b>100</b> is operated, a light source <b>126</b> of the optical sensing interrogator <b>120</b> sends incident light through the optical fiber of the optical strain gauge <b>110</b>.

As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the FBGs <b>132</b> of optical strain gauge system <b>100</b> form a two-dimensional array of strain measurement points. Each FBG <b>132</b> is separated horizontally and vertically from an adjacent FBG <b>132</b> of the optical strain gauge system <b>100</b> by a first distance <b>133</b>. Similarly, the FBGs <b>232</b> of the optical strain gauge system <b>200</b> form a two-dimensional array of strain measurement points. Each FBG <b>232</b> is separated horizontally and vertically from an adjacent FBG <b>232</b> of the optical strain gauge system <b>200</b> by a second distance <b>233</b>. The first distance and the second distance fall within a range that is not greater than 4 cm and not less than 4 mm. The first distance and the second distance also can depend on the size of the pipe. As one example, for a typical pipe used in the transport of oil and gas with an outer diameter of 164.25 mm (6 inches) to 219 mm (8 inches), a preferred first distance and second distance is 1 cm. As another example, for a smaller pipe having an outer diameter of 54.75 mm (2 inches), a preferred first distance and second distance is 6 mm. The first distance and the second distance are chosen to be sufficiently small to provide a density of strain measurements that provide an accurate assessment of the strains present on the exterior surface of the pipe <b>105</b>. A sufficient density of strain measurements is necessary to detect wear areas that are shaped as a narrow channel or a hemispherical cavity on the interior surface of the pipe. Accurate detection of wear areas within the pipe is necessary to avoid pipe failures and to determine optimal times when pipe sections should be replaced.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0053">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, an example method <b>500</b> for measuring strain on an exterior surface of a pipe is illustrated. It should be understood that method <b>500</b> is a non-limiting example and in alternate embodiments certain steps of method <b>500</b> may be modified, combined, performed in parallel, or omitted.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0054">Beginning with operation <b>505</b>, an optical strain gauge is attached to the exterior surface of a section of pipe. The optical strain gauge is attached so that the FBGs are arranged in a two-dimensional array on the exterior surface of the pipe. The FBGs are arranged so that the spacing between FBGs is not greater than 4 cm and not less than 4 mm in order to provide a sufficient density of strain measurements. It should also be understood that multiple optical strain gauges can be attached to the pipe. The multiple optical strain gauges can be separate from each other or can overlap.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0055">In operation <b>510</b>, a light source of an optical sensing interrogator transmits incident light through the optical fiber of the optical strain gauge. The incident light encounters the FBGs that reflect portions of the incident light returning reflected light to a light sensor of the optical sensing interrogator in operation <b>515</b>. In operation <b>520</b>, the light sensor converts the reflected light into electrical signals that are processed, in operation <b>525</b>, by a processor. It should be understood that the processing of the electrical signals from the light sensor can be performed at an interrogator local to the pipe or the electrical signals can be transmitted to a remote device for processing.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0056">In operation <b>530</b>, the processor can compare the strain measurements calculated from the reflected light to benchmark data associated with areas of wear for a comparable pipe. For example, benchmark data can be gathered from historical data correlating strain on the exterior surface of a pipe to areas of wear on the interior surface of the pipe. As another example, in addition to or as an alternative to comparing the strain measurements to benchmark data, the processor can compare the strain measurements to prior strain measurements collected for the section of pipe to which the optical strain gauge is attached. In other words, strain measurement data can be collected for a section of pipe over a period of time, such as several months or years, and the strain measurement data can be analyzed for changes over time indicating increasing wear. In some example embodiments, the processor can use predictive analytics, such as machine learning resources, to analyze strain measurement data and predict when a section of pipe may need to be replaced due to areas of wear.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0057">Lastly, in operation <b>535</b>, the processor can generate an alert if it determines that that the estimated wear on the interior surface of the pipe section exceeds a threshold. The alert can be generated based on a comparison of the strain measurements against benchmark data for comparable pipe. Alternatively, the alert can be generated based on an analysis of historical strain measurements collected from the particular section of pipe being analyzed. As a non-limiting example, the threshold can be set based on the depth of the wear exceeding a percentage of the nominal thickness of the pipe. The threshold can also be set based on a determination that the area of the wear exceeds a predetermined area on the interior surface of the pipe.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0058">It should be understood that once the optical strain gauge is attached to the pipe as described in operation <b>505</b>, operations <b>510</b> through <b>535</b> can be repeated at an interval appropriate for monitoring the pipe. For example, operations <b>510</b> through <b>535</b> can be repeated weekly, monthly, or annually as needed to monitor the integrity of the pipe.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0059">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> through <b>12</b>B</figref>, example feasibility testing performed on a pipe will be described.

Again, similar to the optical strain gauges, the resistive foil strain gauges detected a drop in strain of approximately 56 microstrains at the points directly outboard of the wear area.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0067">Lastly, the feasibility testing was also validated using finite element software to create a model to simulate the pipe <b>600</b> with areas of wear on the interior surface of the pipe at <b>610</b> and <b>620</b>. The simulation indicated drops in strain at sections <b>610</b> and <b>620</b> that were similar to those measured using the optical strain gauges and the resistive foil strain gauges. The table provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> summarizes the data gathered for the three types of feasibility testing and shows a consistent drop in strain measured for the eroded sections of the pipe.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0068">The feasibility testing confirmed that using optical strain gauges with arrays of FBGs can provide useful strain measurements over an exterior area of a pipe. Furthermore, the feasibility testing confirmed that a drop in measurements of strain on the exterior surface of the pipe can be correlated to an area of wear on the interior surface of the pipe. By attaching the FBGs in a two-dimensional array over an area of the pipe, a more accurate picture of the variation in surface strain over the area can be assembled. The more accurate picture of surface strain variation can then be correlated to the shape of an area of wear on the interior surface of the pipe. The two-dimensional array of collected strain data is more useful in detecting narrow channels and hemispherical areas of wear on the interior surface of the pipe.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0069">For any figure shown and described herein, one or more of the components may be omitted, added, repeated, and/or substituted.
