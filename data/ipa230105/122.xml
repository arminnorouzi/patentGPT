disclosure relates generally to sweeteners and flavoring agents, and their use in food and beverage products.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Caloric sugars are widely used in the food and beverage industry. However, there is a growing trend toward use of more healthy alternatives, including non-caloric or low caloric sweeteners. Popular non-caloric sweeteners include high intensity synthetic sweeteners, such as aspartame (e.g., NutraSweet, Equal), sucralose (Splenda), and acesulfame potassium (also known as acesulfame K, or Ace-K), as well as high intensity natural sweeteners, which are typically derived from plants such as <i>Stevia </i>plants, sweet tea plants and monk fruit plants.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Despite the widespread use of non-caloric sweeteners, which are gaining in popularity, many consumers are reluctant to use these products, since their taste properties are often considered to insufficiently mimic the taste profile of caloric sugars, such as sucrose. Therefore, there is a need in further developing and enhancing the taste properties of natural and synthetic sweeteners to better reproduce the taste properties associated with conventional sugar products, so as to provide increased consumer satisfaction.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><i>Rubus suavissimus </i>S. Lee or <i>Rubus chingii </i>is a perennial shrub naturally abundant in Southern China. Due to its intensely sweet taste, leaves from <i>Rubus suavissimus</i>, commonly referred to as the Chinese sweet leaf tea plant, Chinese blackberry, or sweet blackberry have been used in making leaf tea beverage (Chinese sweet tea) by local residents. Rubusoside is the dominant sweetener or steviol glycoside found in the Chinese sweet leaf tea plant. Rubusoside is 115 times sweeter than sucrose at a concentration of 0.025%, making it a good candidate for a natural sweetener. A hot water extract from the Chinese sweet tea leaves, called the tenryocha extract or Tien Cha in Japan has been previously used as a natural sweetener. In addition, the dried Chinese sweet tea leaves have been used as an ingredient in tea/herbal infusions in Europe.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Sweet tea plant extracts contain rubusoside (RU), a steviol glycoside, and kaurane-type diterpene glycosides, such as suaviosides B, G, H, I and J, constitute a variety of natural sweeteners. However, sweet tea extract and purified RU are often associated with a bitter and astringent taste when used at higher concentration, thereby limiting its application in consumer products. Accordingly, there is need to find a method to overcome disadvantage of these products and make them use widely in food, beverage, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present application relates to compositions that comprise rubusoside (RU), one or more sweet tea components (STCs), sweet tea extracts (STEs), glycosylated rubusoside (GRU), glycosylated sweet tea components (GSTCs), glycosylated sweet tea extracts (GSTEs), Maillard reaction products (MRPs) of RU, GRU, STCs, GSTCs, STEs or GSTEs (collectively ST-MRPs), glycosylated products of ST-MRPs (collectively G-ST-MRP), as well as methods of making and using such compositions to improve the taste and/or flavor of a consumable product.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect, the present application is directed to a composition that comprises one or more components selected from the group consisting of RU, GRU, STEs, GSTEs, STCs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and G-ST-MRPs in a total amount of 0.1-99.9 wt %.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the composition is a sweetening composition.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the composition is a flavoring composition.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the sweetener or flavoring composition comprises a STE containing enriched rubusoside (RU).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the sweetener or flavoring composition comprises a STE containing enriched diterpene glycoside.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, the sweetener or flavoring composition comprises a STE that comprises one or more sweet tea derived components (STC) selected from the group consisting of rubusoside (RU), suavioside (SU), steviolmonoside, rebaudioside A, 13-O-&#x3b2;-D-glucosyl-steviol, isomers of rebaudioside B, isomers of stevioside, panicloside IV, sugeroside, ent-16&#x3b1;,17-dihydroxy-kaurane-19-oic acid, ent-13-hydroxy-kaurane-16-en-19-oic acid, ent-kaurane-16-en-19-oic-13-O-&#x3b2;-D-glucoside, ent-16&#x3b2;,17-dihydroxy-kaurane-3-one, ent-16&#x3b1;,17-dihydroxy-kaurane-19-oic acid, ent-kaurane-16&#x3b2;,17-diol-3-one-17-O-&#x3b2;-D-glucoside, ent-16&#x3b1;,17-dihydroxy-kaurane-3-one, ent-kaurane-3&#x3b1;,16&#x3b2;,17-3-triol, ent-13,17-dihydroxy-kaurane-15-en-19-oic acid, ellagic acid, gallic acid, oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, rutin, quercetin, and isoquercitrin.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the sweetener or flavoring composition comprises a STE that comprises one or more suaviosides selected from the group consisting of SU-A, SU-B, SU-C1, SU-D1, SU-D2, SU-E, SU-F, SU-G, SU-H, SU-I, and SU-J.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the sweetener or flavoring composition comprises a STE wherein the STE is purified RU.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, the sweetener or flavoring composition comprises a GSTE.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, the sweetener or flavoring composition comprises a GSTE containing enriched glycosylated rubusoside (RU).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, the sweetener or flavoring composition comprises a GSTE containing enriched glycosylated diterpene glycoside.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, the sweetener or flavoring composition comprises a GSTE, wherein the GSTE is glycosylated RU.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, the sweetener or flavoring composition comprises a MRP.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, the sweetener or flavoring composition comprises a ST-MRP.

Additional glycosidic ester linkages can be formed at the hydroxyl group at C13 of steviol and at the carbonyl oxygen at C16 of isosteviol. Linkages at carbon atoms in the C1, C2, C3, C6, C7, C11, C12 and C15 positions of both steviol and isosteviol yield C-glycosides.

A glycoside is any molecule in which a sugar group is bonded through its anomeric carbon to another group via a glycosidic bond. Glycosides can be linked by an O- (an O-glycoside), N- (a glycosylamine), S- (a thioglycoside), or C- (a C-glycoside) glycosidic bond. The sugar group is known as the glycone and the non-sugar group is known as the aglycone. The glycone can be part of a single sugar group (monosaccharide) or several sugar groups (oligosaccharide). A glycosyltransferase according to the present application further embraces &#x201c;glycosyltransferase variants&#x201d; engineered for enhanced activities.</p><p id="p-0315" num="0307">Glycosyltransferases utilize &#x201c;activated&#x201d; sugar phosphates as glycosyl donors, and catalyze glycosyl group transfer to an acceptor molecule comprising a nucleophilic group, usually an alcohol. A retaining glycosyltransferases is one which transfers a sugar residue with the retention of anomeric configuration. Retaining glycosyltransferase enzymes retain the stereochemistry of the donor glycosidic linkage after transfer to an acceptor molecule. An inverting glycosyltransferase, on the other hand, is one which transfers a sugar residue with the inversion of anomeric configuration. Glycosyltransferases are classified based on amino acid sequence similarities. Glycosyltransferases are classified by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (NC-IUBMB) in the enzyme class of EC 2.4.1 on the basis of the reaction catalyzed and the specificity.</p><p id="p-0316" num="0308">Glycosyltransferases can utilize a range of donor substrates.

num="0374">(1) The Maillard Reaction</p><p id="p-0383" num="0375">The Maillard reaction generally refers to a non-enzymatic browning reaction of a sugar donor with an amine donor in the presence of heat which produces flavor. Common flavors produced as a result of the Maillard reaction include, for example, those associated with red meat, poultry, coffee, vegetables, bread crust etc. subjected to heat. A Maillard reaction relies mainly on sugars and amino acids but it can also contain other ingredients including: autolyzed yeast extracts, hydrolyzed vegetable proteins, gelatin (protein source), vegetable extracts (i.e., onion powder), enzyme treated proteins, meat fats or extracts and acids or bases to adjust the pH of the reaction. The reaction can be in an aqueous environment with an adjusted pH at specific temperatures for a specified amount of time to produce a variety of flavors. Typical flavors include those associated with chicken, pork, beef, caramel, chocolate etc. However, a wide variety of different taste and aroma profiles can be achieved by adjusting the ingredients, the temperature and/or the pH of the reaction. The main advantage of the reaction flavors is that they can produce characteristic meat, burnt, roasted, caramellic, or chocolate profiles desired by the food industry, which are not typically achievable by using compounding of flavor ingredients.</p><p id="p-0384" num="0376">Reducing groups can be found on reducing sugars (sugar donors) and amino groups can be found on amino donors such as free amino acids, peptides, and proteins. Initially, a reactive carbonyl group of a reducing sugar condenses with a free amino group, with a concomitant loss of a water molecule. A reducing sugar substrate for Maillard reaction typically has a reactive carbonyl group in the form of a free aldehyde or a free ketone. The resultant N-substituted glycoaldosylamine is not stable. The aldosylamine compound rearranges, through an Amadori rearrangement, to form a ketosamine. Ketosamines that are so-formed may further react through any of the following three pathways: (a) further dehydration to form reductones and dehydroreductones; (b) hydrolytic fission to form short chain products, such as diacetyl, acetol, pyruvaldehyde, and the like, which can, in turn, undergo Strecker degradation with additional amino groups to form aldehydes, and condensation, to form aldols; and (c) loss of water molecules, followed by reaction with additional amino groups and water, followed by condensation and/or polymerization into melanoids. Factors that affect the rate and/or extent of Maillard reactions include among others the temperature, water activity, and pH. The Maillard reaction is enhanced by high temperature, low moisture levels, and alkaline pH.</p><p id="p-0385" num="0377">In the Maillard reaction, suitable carbonyl containing reactants include those that comprise a reactive aldehyde (&#x2014;CHO) or keto (&#x2014;CO&#x2014;) group, such that the carbonyl free aldehyde or free keto group is available to react with an amino group associated with the reactant. Typically, the reducing reactant is a reducing sugar, e.g., a sugar that can reduce a test reagent, e.g., can reduce Cu2+ to Cu+, or can be oxidized by such reagents.</p><p id="p-0386" num="0378">Monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides (e.g., dextrins, starches, and edible gums) and their hydrolysis products are suitable reducing reactants if they have at least one reducing group that can participate in a Maillard reaction. Reducing sugars include aldoses or ketoses such as glucose, fructose, maltose, lactose, glyceraldehyde, dihydroxyacetone, arabinose, xylose, ribose, mannose, erythrose, threose, and galactose. Other reducing reactants include uronic acids (e.g., glucuronic acid, glucuronolactone, and galacturonic acid, mannuronic acid, iduronic acid) or Maillard reaction intermediates bearing at least one carbonyl group such as aldehydes, ketones, alpha-hydroxycarbonyl or dicarbonyl compounds.</p><p id="p-0387" num="0379">(2) Maillard Reaction Components</p><p id="p-0388" num="0380">The inventors of the present application have found that Maillard reaction product (MRP) compositions can provide improved taste profiles over previously reported high intensity natural sweetener compositions.

Additionally, the above carbohydrates may be in either the D- or L-configuration.</p><p id="p-0414" num="0406">It should be noted, however, that not all carbohydrate sweeteners are reducing sugars. Sugars having acetal or ketal linkages are not reducing sugars, as they do not have free aldehyde chains. They therefore do not react with reducing-sugar test solutions (e.g., in a Tollens' test or Benedict's test). However, a non-reducing sugar can be hydrolyzed using diluted hydrochloric acid.</p><p id="p-0415" num="0407">In some embodiments, the sugar donor is a non-reducing sugar that does not contain free aldehyde or free keto groups.

In certain embodiments, the pressure in the reaction vessel is at least 10 MPa, at least 20 MPa, at least 30 MPa, at least 40 MPa, at least 50 MPa, at least 75 MPa, at least 100 MPa, at least 150 MPa, at least 200 MPa, at least 250 MPa, at least 300 MPa, at least 400 MPa, at least 500 MPa, at least 600 MPa, at least 700 MPa, at least 800 MPa, and any pressure range derived from the aforementioned pressure values.</p><p id="p-0442" num="0434">In some embodiments, it is desirable to suppress the Maillard reaction, in part. This can be achieved by exercising one or more of the following approaches, including the use of raw materials that are not susceptible to browning, adjusting the factors affecting the browning velocity of Maillard reaction, lowering the temperature, lowering pH, adjusting water activity, increasing the level of oxygen, using oxidant, introducing enzymes, etc.</p><p id="p-0443" num="0435">In certain embodiments, the use of low solubility or insoluble amino acids in the Maillard reaction may result in insoluble reactants present in the final MRP composition. In such cases, filtration may be used to remove any insoluble components present in the MRP compositions.</p><p id="p-0444" num="0436">A general method to prepare derived Maillard reaction product(s) is described as follows. Briefly, an SG or ST extract is dissolved with or without a sugar donor, and together with amino acid donor in water, followed by heating of the solution at an elevated temperature, for example from about 50 to about 200 degrees centigrade. The reaction time can be varied from more than one second to a few days, more generally a few hours, until Maillard reaction products (MRPs) are formed or the reaction components have been exhausted or the reaction has been completed, with or without formation of caramelization reaction products (CRPs), which are further described below. When required, a pH adjuster or pH buffer can be added to regulate the pH of the reaction mixture before, during or after reaction as further described herein. The resultant solution is dried by spray dryer or hot air oven to remove the water and to obtain the MRP(s).</p><p id="p-0445" num="0437">When the reaction is completed, the product mixture does not need to be neutralized or it can be neutralized. Water and/or solvent(s) do not necessarily need to be removed but can be removed by distillation, spray drying or other known methods if the product is desired as a powder or liquid, whatever the case may be.</p><p id="p-0446" num="0438">Interestingly, when a reaction mixture is dried to a powder, such as by spray drying, the resultant powders only have a slight smell associated with them. This is in contrast to regular powdered flavoring agents that generally have a strong smell. The dried powdered reaction mixtures of the embodiments, when dissolved in a solvent, such as water or alcohol or mixtures thereof, release the smell. This demonstrates that the volatile substances in the MRPs can be preserved by SEs, SGs, STGs, STEs and/or STCs present in the reaction products and compositions of the present application. Powders with strong aroma can be obtained too, particularly where the carrier, such as STE, is much less compared with MRPs flavors or strong flavor substances are used during Maillard reaction.</p><p id="p-0447" num="0439">In some embodiments, the MRP mixtures may further include one or more carriers (or flavor carriers) acceptable for use with sweetening agents or flavoring agents. In addition, such carriers may be suitable e.g., as solvents for the Maillard reaction.</p><p id="p-0448" num="0440">Exemplary carriers include acetylated distarch adipate, acetylated distarch phosphate, agar, alginic acid, beeswax, beta-cyclodextrine, calcium carbonate, calcium silicate, calcium sulphate, candelilla wax, carboxymethyl cellulose, sodium salt, carnauba wax, carrageenan, microcrystalline cellulose, dextran, dextrin, diammonium phosphate, distarch phosphate, edible fats, elemi resin, ethyl lactate, ethyl cellulose, ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose, ethyl tartrate, gelatin, gellan gum, ghatti gum, glucose, glyceryl diacetate, glyceryl diesters of aliphatic fatty acids C6-C18, glyceryl monoesters of aliphatic fatty acids C6-C18, glyceryl triacetate (triacetin), glyceryl triesters of aliphatic fatty acids C6-C18, glyceryl tripropanoate, guar gum, gum arabic, hydrolyzed vegetable protein, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate, hydroxypropyl starch, karaya gum, konjac gum, lactic acid, lactose, locust bean gum (carob bean gum), magnesium carbonate, magnesium salts of fatty acids, maltodextrin, methyl cellulose, medium chain triglyceride, modified starches, such as acetylated distarch adipate, acetylated oxidized starch, acid-treated starch, alkaline treated starch, bleached starch, roasted starch dextrins, distarch phosphate, hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate, acetylated distarch phosphate, hydroxypropyl starch, monostarch phosphate, oxidized starch, phosphated distarch phosphate, starch acetate, starch sodium octenyl succinate, and enzyme treated starches; mono-, di- and tri-calcium orthophosphate, Na, K, NH4 and Ca alginate, pectins, processed euchema seaweed, propylene glycol alginate, sodium chloride (salt), silicon dioxide, sodium aluminium diphosphate, sodium aluminium silicate, Sodium, potassium and calcium salts of fatty acids, starch, starch (sodium) octenyl succinate, starch acetate, sucro glycerides, sucrose, sucrose esters of fatty acids, type I and type II sucrose oligoesters, taragum, tragacanth, triethylcitrate, whey powder, xanthan gum, fibers such as non-starch polysaccharides, lignin, cellulose, methylcellulose, the hemicelluloses, 3-glucans, mucilage, inulins, oligosaccharides, polydextrose, fructooligosaccharides, cyclodextrins, chitins, and combinations thereof, and thickeners such as carbomers, cellulose base materials, gums, waxes, algin, agar, pectins, carrageenan, gelatin, mineral or modified mineral thickeners, polyethylene glycol and polyalcohols, polyacrylamide and other polymeric thickeners, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0449" num="0441">When utilizing the MRP compositions for use in a sweetening or flavoring composition, one or more additional components may be added to the MRP composition after the Maillard reaction has occurred. These additional components include flavoring substances. Moreover, the reaction products after the Maillard reaction has been completed can further include, for example, one or more sweetening agents, reducing sugars (i.e., residue sugar donors), amine donors, sweetener enhancers, and CRPs, as well as one or more degraded sweetening agents, degraded sugar donors, degraded amine donors, and salts.</p><p id="p-0450" num="0442">It should also be understood, for example, that the Maillard reaction can be performed under conditions containing an excess of amine donors in comparison to reducing sugars or much less than the amount of reducing sugars present. In the first instance, the resultant MRPs would include unreacted amine donors, degraded amine donors and/or residues from reacted amine donors. Conversely, when there is an excess of reducing sugars present in the Maillard reaction, the amine donors would be more fully reacted during the course of the reaction and a greater amount of unreacted reducing sugars as well as degraded reducing sugars and/or degrading reducing sugars and residues therefrom. Surprisingly, where the reducing sugar is replaced with a sweetening agent (e.g., a material such as a STE that does not include a reactive aldehydic or ketone moiety) and reacted with one or more amine donors, the amine donors may be present in the reaction products in reduced amounts reflecting their consumption in the Maillard type reaction or there excess of amine donors, as well as amine donor residues and/or amine degradation products after the Maillard reaction has been completed.</p><p id="p-0451" num="0443">There are many ways to control the resulting MRPs. For instance, adjusting the pH, pressure, reaction time, and ingredient additions to optimize the ratio of raw materials etc. Further, the separation of MRPs products can provide a means for preparing different types of flavors or flavor enhancers. For example, MRPs include both volatile substances and non-volatile substances. Therefore, by evaporating the volatile substances, non-volatile substances can be purified for use. These non-volatile substances (or products) can be used as flavor modifiers or with the top note flavor in final products, such as volatile peach, lemon flavor provided by traditional flavor houses.</p><p id="p-0452" num="0444">Volatile substances can be used as flavor or flavor enhancers as well. Partial separation of MRPs can be carried out to obtain volatile substances, which can be further separated by distillation etc. or obtain non-volatile substances for instance by recrystallization, chromatograph etc. could be done to meet different targets of taste and flavor. Therefore, in this specification, MRPs include a composition including one or more volatile substances, one or more non-volatile substances or mixtures thereof. Non-volatile substances in MRPs or isolated from MRPs can provide a good mouth feel, umami and Kokumi taste.</p><p id="p-0453" num="0445">(4) Use of Raw Materials, Such as Fruit Juices, in Maillard Reaction</p><p id="p-0454" num="0446">(A) Raw Materials in MRP Reactions and/or MRP-Containing Composition</p><p id="p-0455" num="0447">In some embodiments, the reactants for the Maillard reaction include a number of different raw materials for producing MRP compositions.

level="1">III. Rationale for the Subject Matter of the Present Application</heading><p id="p-0504" num="0509">Memories of taste and flavor are sequential and in order. They can be accessed in the order that they are remembered. Like Marcel Proust wrote in his book, human beings are unable to directly reverse the sequence of a memory. Each sensory characteristic of taste and flavor of consumables is remembered as an elaborate hierarchy of nested activities.</p><p id="p-0505" num="0510">Consumers are constantly predicting the future and hypothesizing what we will experience in taste and smell. This expectation influences what we actually perceived from consumables. Consumers' conscious experience of perceptions is actually changed by their interpretations. Consumers can recognize a pattern of taste and flavor of consumables even if only part of it is perceived and even if it contains alterations. Consumers' recognition ability is apparently able to detect invariant features of a pattern-characteristics that survive real-world variations. Segmenting the temporal sequence and size of the tasting decision, this implicates familiar tastes and smells that spark the memory and allows a taster's attention to focus on expected familiar tastes and flavors of consumables, particular those where the perception is positive.</p><p id="p-0506" num="0511">The present application provides compositions and methods for providing the major components of flavor playing crucial roles in recognition of flavor by simultaneous activation of millions of pattern recognitions for a given flavor. As each input from a low-level recognition of taste and flavor from a consumable flows up to a higher level, the perceptional connection can be weighted to provide an indication of how important that particular element in the pattern is. Thus, the more significant elements of pattern recognition for flavors are more heavily weighted in the context of triggering recognition by the taster. If a particular level is unable to fully process and recognize the taste and flavor, the task of recognition would be sent to the next higher level. If none of the levels succeeds in recognizing the pattern of taste and flavor of consumables, it is deemed to be a new pattern of taste and flavor.</p><p id="p-0507" num="0512">Classifying a pattern of taste and flavor as new does not necessarily mean that every aspect of it is new. A person's brain has evolved to save energy when making recognition decisions of taste and flavor. The earlier the flavor is recognized at low-level pattern recognizer, the less energy would be spent for brain for recognition. The present application provides a method to accelerate the speed of recognition of a taste and flavor in consumable, thus increases the palatability. Thalamus is considered a gateway for collecting and preparing sensory information of consumable to enter the neocortex. The neocortex is responsible for sensory perception. Hundreds of millions of pattern recognizers of taste and flavor in the neocortex to be constantly checking in with the thalamus. Neocortex will determine whether a sensory experience of taste and flavor is novel or not in order to present it to the hippocampus. The present application provides a composition containing many familiar pattern of substances which are able to be recognized at low-level of recognizer. An embodiment of current composition is used for treatment of consumers who suffer from memories losses by ingesting the consumable containing composition in this invention to evoke their memories by the familiar taste and flavors.</p><p id="p-0508" num="0513">The inventors have surprisingly found that compositions in this invention could be used for enhance the umami attribute of consumable. A particular aspect of what makes umami delicious is aftertaste of consumables. Umami develops over a different time frame than do saltiness and sourness, which disappear quite quickly. Umami persists for longer than all the other basic tastes. This lingering aftertaste is probably one of the reasons why consumers associate umami with deliciousness and something pleasant. It is a taste sensation with fullness and roundness that completely permeates the oral cavity and then dissipates very slowly.</p><p id="p-0509" num="0514">The enhanced umami by this invention could successfully mask the unpleasant taste of low sugar, low fat and low salt consumables. The receptors for sweetness are closely related to the receptors for umami taste. Without bound by the theory, the inventor found there is strong synergy between umami taste substances such as MSG, 5&#x2032;ribonucleotides (such as IMP, GMP). An embodiment of composition containing umami substances which could increase palatability of high intensity sweeteners. Alanine also play a role for umami except MSG. Alapyridaine enhances not only the umami tastes, but also strengthens the sweet and salty tastes. An embodiment of composition of the present application comprises alapyridaine.</p><p id="p-0510" num="0515">Oligosaccharides are carbohydrate chains containing 3-10 sugar units. Oligosaccharides can be made of any sugar monomers, such as ADMO s (algae derived marine oligosaccharide)AOS(Arabino-oligosaccharides), COS (Chitooligosaccharides), FOS (Fructooligosaccharides), GOS (Galactooligosaccharides), HMO (Human milk oligosaccharides), MAOS (Mannan oligosaccharides), MOS (Maltooligosaccharides), POS (Pectic oligosaccharides), SOS (Soya-oligosaccharides), TOS (Transgalactosylated oligosaccharides), XOS(Xylooligosaccharides). Oligosaccharides normally have mild sweet taste, lower viscosity, moisturizing, low water activity. Adding oligosaccharides in the composition of this invention could improve the sweet taste of composition, such as creating honey flavored sweet and flavor composition. When using the composition containing in this invention, it could block the crystallization of ice creams etc., thus provide improved taste and flavor of consumables. An embodiment of composition comprises oligosaccharides.</p><p id="p-0511" num="0516">When ingesting consumables, trigeminal sensation instead of taste buds on the tongue and olfactory bulb cells gets the first impression of taste sensation such as sourness, salty, sweetness of consumables. There are many research about synergy between taste and flavor. The inventor surprisingly found that trigeminal sensation has strong interaction with taste and flavor. There are many compounds present in many foods or aromatic spices creates trigeminal stimuli, such as substances present in mustard oil, chili peppers, or horseradish, are responsible for pungency. Other trigeminal stimuli such as menthol or eucalyptol are also responsible for cooling sensations. Astringency is another trigeminal sensation, described as a dry mouthfeel that is generated by particular foods (unripe fruits) or drinks (tea or red wine), which are rich in polyphenolic compounds such as tannins. An embodiment of a method to use trigeminal stimuli to improve the taste and flavor of consumables, especially consumables with less sugar, less fat, and less salt. An embodiment of composition of a sweetener or a flavor comprises (a) one or more substances selected from SGs, GSGs, STC, GSTC, GSG-MRP, GSTC-MRP, MG, GMSG and(b) trigeminal stimuli substances.</p><p id="p-0512" num="0517">Trigeminal stimuli substances plays the big role for mouth-feel, especially mouth contracting and mouth drying. Mouthfeel could be classified into three categories: Mouth coating, mouth contracting, and mouth dry. Mouth coating is one type of mouthfeel. The word coating is chosen because these elements leave a thin layer behind in the mouth. Saliva becomes thicker, more viscous. Mouth coating is related strongly to texture of consumable. Compared with mouth coating, mouth contracting is another type of mouthfeel. Mouth contracting is the sematic trigeminal sensation, it has no or less relation with texture of consumables in mouth. Acidity, salty and all kinds of irritation (pepper, mustard, horse radish, ginger) cause contraction in the mouth, it is called mouth contracting. Just as carbonic acid (CO2) does in a variety of drinks, such as mineral water, sparkling wines, beer and soda. Light, fresh white and red wines with a nice acidity are examples of &#x2018;contracting&#x2019; drinks. A low temperature also makes the mouth contract. This implies that serving temperature influences mouthfeel (and flavor intensity as we will see). Contraction gives the impression of refreshment, of cleansing the mouth. Contracting elements will often stimulate saliva flow. An embodiment of composition in this invention improves the mouth-contracting of consumables.</p><p id="p-0513" num="0518">As one of main attribute of mouth contracting, freshness stands for the property of being pure and fresh (as if newly made) of consumable. From a sensory point of view perception of freshness is a multi-sensory decision process. Freshness cannot be perceived by single taste receptors nor is it represented by a single stimulus of somatosensory neurons. Freshness can be triggered on a perceptual level and is an important part of the sensory characteristics of a product (smell, taste, mouth-feeling, cognitive mechanisms and psychophysiological factors). Semantic and perceptual information is processed concomitantly, inter-connected and each other influencing. The processing involves a continuous context-based alignment with information stored in our memory. At the end of the processing stands a decision whether or not freshness is perceived.</p><p id="p-0514" num="0519">Freshness perception is mandatory to generate a refreshing feeling that is associated positively in the memory with freshness. Fresh fruits are a good model to comprehend the perceived freshness and the refreshing feeling (i.e. apple, orange). Freshness is not necessarily associated with refreshing (i.e., fresh bread, fresh fish) but in case of beverages, especially fruit based ones, refreshing feeling is in most cases the ultimate target to achieve. A refreshing feeling is connected to the positive experiences of alleviating unpleasant symptoms in the mouth and throat (dry mouth, thirst) as consequence of feeling hot, of exercise or of mental fatigue. An embodiment of composition in this invention improves the freshness of consumables and make quicker recognition of flavor.</p><p id="p-0515" num="0520">Quick sweet and or freshness perception are important contributors to a consumer's &#x201c;hedonic preference&#x201d;. A complicated and long lasting sensory decision making process to recognize a taste or a flavor triggers failure search and defect analysis (lower overall quality rating).</p><p id="p-0516" num="0521">The quick sweet and or freshness decision depends on the combination of sensory signals and their fit with our acquired perception of freshness. The clearer and the easier recognizable a set of signals appears, the quicker and easier our brain can decide in favor of good sweet and or freshness perception, the less attention to be paid to other attributes of sensory perception. Ambiguity in a set of signals prevents a quick decision making process. A set of unclear and/or unrecognized sensory signals triggers uncertainty in our brain. This uncertainty is either interpreted as &#x201c;not recognizable&#x201d; or yields a decision telling us &#x201c;similar to . . . with following defects&#x201d; with psychological attention.</p><p id="p-0517" num="0522">Quick and early recognition of a taste and or a flavor is not only of major importance for the sweet and or freshness decision. Our brain tends to stop further considerations once a decision is made (evolutionary useful feature as thinking costs a lot of energy). With other words, once a familiar sweet or freshness decision is made, sensory attributes will no more followed up making failure responses or defect analysis much less probable than in cases where it took long time to recognize a taste or a flavor.</p><p id="p-0518" num="0523">Freshness is an ignored sensory attribution by the food and beverage industry. Slow sweet perception is an underestimated factor for palatability of consumables. An embodiment of composition in this invention could improve the freshness and or quick onset sweetness which could significantly improve the palatability of consumables.</p><p id="p-0519" num="0524">An embodiment of a food and beverage comprises one or more components selected from STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, STE-MRPs, STC-MRPs, GSTE-MRPs, and GSTC-MRPs, and blends thereof, which contribute sucrose equivalences (SugarEs) above 1%, above 1.5%, above 2%, above 2.5%, above 3%, above 4, above 5%. In other embodiments, the present application provides methods for using one or more components selected from STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, STE-MRPs, STC-MRPs, GSTE-MRPs, GSTC-MRPs, and blends thereof as food ingredients or food additives. A further embodiment of a food ingredient or additive comprises one or more STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, STE-MRPs, STC-MRPs, GSTE-MRPs, and GSTC-MRPs. It should be noted that the rubusoside used in the compositions and methods of the present application can originate from any source, including but not limited to sweet tea, <i>stevia </i>leaves, enzymatic conversion from <i>stevia </i>extracts and <i>stevia </i>glycosides, fermentation, hydrolysis, and other biosynthetic or synthetic methods.</p><p id="p-0520" num="0525">The inventor surprisingly found that STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, STE-MRPs, STC-MRPs, GSTE-MRPs, and GSTC-MRPs can significantly mask the bitterness, metallic taste of natural high intensity sweeteners such as <i>stevia </i>extract, <i>stevia </i>glycosides, monk fruit juice, monk fruit extract, licorice extract, and also high synthetic sweeteners, such as Acesulfame K, sucralose. Thus, in certain embodiments, a food flavor or sweetener can comprise: a) one or more components selected from STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, STE-MRPs, STC-MRPs, GSTE-MRPs, and GSTC-MRPs; and b) one or more component selected from natural or synthetic high sweeteners.</p><p id="p-0521" num="0526">High intensity sweeteners like natural sweeteners such as <i>stevia </i>extract, monk fruit extract etc., and synthetic sweeteners such as sucralose, acesulfame-K, aspartame, sodium saccharin etc. are characterized by their slow on-site, less high-peak sweetness, lower tongue heaviness, sweet aftertaste, less mouth coating, slipperiness, and high bitter aftertaste, metallic aftertaste. An extraordinary or good beverage must have synchronized or harmonized sweetness temporal profile, acidity temporal profile and aroma temporal profile. However, it is painful for food and beverage formulators when using these high intensity sweeteners to make these three dimensions synchronized, especially for sugar reduced, sugar free products. Normally, the sequence of formulation is to have balanced sweetness and sourness, then add flavor, but it is so difficult to have good balanced sweetness and sourness for sugar reduced, sugar free products. These defects of high intensity sweeteners make the current diet products less palatable to consumers. In current prevailing market, flavor, acidity and sweetness are dis-integrated in diet products, such non-synchronized products leave either initial bad taste/flavor which are difficult to be swallowed, or aftertaste or after flavor with bad impression, not hedonic at all. Most case, the flavor temporal profile is very short, or the flavor comes first before sweet or sour taste, or the bitterness, lingering, metallic taste. All so-called good taste of natural sweeteners, such as GSGs, higher molecule SGs such as RI, RD, RM, highly purified RA and RE, and synthetic sweeteners, such as Ac&#x2014;K and sucralose, create metallic and lingering taste, which are difficult for consumers to swallow. Swallow is a big decision for consumers. Thinking about feeding baby and kids, if it is bitter, they use tongue to repel the food out of tongue. Swallow is the first and most important frontier to secure our lives. Mouth is the scout to identify the risk. A good food and beverage should create a synchronized aroma/taste which could let us relax and release the alertness and suspiciousness, at least the message from food and beverage should be that it is harmless to swallow.</p><p id="p-0522" num="0527">Tasty food and beverage have their own footprints. The inventor surprisingly found that STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs, G-ST-MRPs and blends thereof can provide great tools for designing such products. Tasting a beverage has a particular physical and psychological sequence; well-designed products have a characteristic rhythm and temporal sequence in providing a satisfactory response to the product. For example, the physical sequence of drinking beverage consists of ordering a drink, looking at the drink, taking in the drink and swallowing the drink. The psychological sequence of drinking a beverage can be described by three stages: LIKING, WANTING and THINKING.</p><p id="p-0523" num="0528">LIKING: When ordering a drink, consumers always have something in their memo, it means consumers have expectation. Therefore, color of product, words and photos in the package, sound of opening cans, sniff smell, all these are alluring factors for liking. The simple top note currently provided by flavor houses might not be enough for creating LIKING, especially for sugar reduced product. Liking is not only an issue to have volatile top note. The inventor has found the STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs, G-ST-MRPs and blends thereof can create retronasal aroma to enhance the orthonasal smell. An embodiment of composition comprises one or more ingredients selected from STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs, G-ST-MRPs and blends thereof which could create retronasal aroma to enhance the orthonasal smell.</p><p id="p-0524" num="0529">WANTING: When drinking the beverage in mouth, if the general impression including flavor/taste is good, it is easy to make a big &#x201c;swallowing&#x201d; decision. If the product does not taste good, the swallowing will be restricted. If the product is so, we swallow, then our natural reaction is to stretch our tongue out of mouth to show dislike, resulting in a feeling of regret or making a mistake. Wanting is not an issue only for taste, but strongly depends on the hidden retronasal aroma. Use of the ST-MRPs and G-ST-MRPs according to the present application provides retronasal aromas which can accelerate the speed and frequency of swallowing. Therefore, in preferred embodiments, a composition of the present application includes one or more ingredients selected from ST-MRPs, G-ST-MRPs. SG-MRPs, and/or GSG-MRPs, which can accelerate the speed and frequency of swallowing.</p><p id="p-0525" num="0530">THINKING: After swallowing, the first reaction psychologically is to confirm the expectation. Great designed products create surprise and desire. The present application provides a product which can make foods and beverages tasty so as to exceed expectations leading to the consumer to desire more of the product. Therefore, in preferred embodiments, a composition of the present application includes one or more ingredients selected from ST-MRPs, G-ST-MRPs. SG-MRPs, and/or GSG-MRPs, which can create retronasal aromas to improve consumer's approval and desire for the food and beverage products.</p><p id="p-0526" num="0531">The inventor have surprisingly found that ST-MRPs and G-ST-MRPs can better synchronize the overall taste dimensions of sweetness, flavor, sourness, and mouthfeel so as to provide quick sweetness onset, less sweet lingering, and a characteristic flavor. These features are useful for many food and beverage applications and can make the formulation job easier and faster. Thus, the present application has been developed to provide STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs, G-ST-MRPs and blends thereof which can synchronize the sweetness, sourness, mouthfeel and flavor in food and beverage products. An embodiment of composition comprises STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs, G-ST-MRPs and blends thereof which can provide quick onset of sweetness/flavor and less lingering sweetness. In certain embodiments, STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs, G-ST-MRPs, blends thereof, and one or more other high intensity sweeteners can provide quick onset of sweetness/flavor and less lingering sweetness.

In some embodiments, the food or beverage product comprises glycosylated rubusosides and unconverted rubusosides, where the mono-glycosylated rubusoside is more than 10 wt %, 20 wt %, 30 wt %, 40 wt %, 50 wt %, 60 wt %, 70 wt %, 80 wt %, 90 wt % or 95 wt % of the total glycosylated rubusosides.</p><p id="p-0529" num="0534">A further embodiment of a food or beverage comprises glycosylated rubusoside, where the amount of mono-glycosylated rubusoside is more than 1 ppm, 10 ppm, 50 ppm, 100 ppm, 150 ppm, 200 ppm, 250 ppm, 300 ppm, 500 ppm, 1,000 ppm or 10,000 ppm. In some embodiments, the food or beverage further comprises unconverted rubusosides.</p><p id="p-0530" num="0535">A further embodiment of a food or beverage comprises glycosylated rubusoside, where the mono-glycosylated rubusoside is less than 10,000 ppm, 5,000 ppm, 1,000 ppm, 500 ppm, 300 ppm, 250 ppm, 100 ppm, 50 ppm, 10 ppm, 5 ppm or 1 ppm. In some embodiments, the food or beverage further comprises unconverted rubusosides.</p><p id="p-0531" num="0536">Nasal cavity owns a large surface area and is a good approach for brain nutrition and medicines. Sublingual administration has certain advantages over oral administration. Being more direct, it is often faster and effective. The intranasal and sublingual routes of drug administration have been used for a variety of medications. The present application provides a solution to make intranasal and sublingual nutrition and medicines more palatable. Therefore, in some embodiments, an intranasal or sublingual composition includes one or more ingredients selected from STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and G-ST-MRPs.

Bitterness has been a challenge with a wide range of foodstuffs, such as fruits including grapefruit, passionfruit, oranges, vegetables including cucumbers, avocados, beverage including beer, coffee, chocolate, and protein products including dairy and soy products. The inventor successfully develop a new composition comprises one or more ingredient selected from GSTE, GSTC, GSTE-MRP, GSTC-MRP, G-RU-MRP which could mask the bitterness of food and beverage.</p><p id="p-0533" num="0538">The inventor has surprisingly found that MRPs originated from natural plant derived products such as MRPs using <i>stevia</i>, sweet tea, monk fruit, licorice etc. could maintain the overall flavor intensity and sensory quality of beverage and foods during the process and storage, thus also could reduce the amount of flavor added in food and beverage. An embodiment of a consumable comprises one or more MRPs ingredients derived from <i>stevia</i>, sweet tea, monk fruit, licorice etc., which could maintain the overall flavor intensity and sensory quality of consumable.</p><p id="p-0534" num="0539">The inventor also surprisingly found that STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs, and G-ST-MRPs can enhance the astringency, accelerate the quick acidity sensation. In one embodiment, the sweetener or flavoring agent composition of the present application includes one or more substances selected from STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs, and G-ST-MRPs, which can enhance the astringency and quick acid on-site sensation.

In particular, synergistic effects have been observed when these components have been combined together. In some embodiments, a consumable product includes one or more substances selected from STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, STE-MRPs, STC-MRPs, GSTE-MRPs, GSTC-MRPs in combination with one or more <i>stevia </i>extracts comprising one or more <i>stevia </i>glycosides selected from Reb A, Reb B, Reb C, Reb D, Reb E, Reb I, Reb M, Reb O, such that the solubility and/or sweetness of the <i>stevia </i>extract(s) is increased.</p><p id="p-0537" num="0542">In one embodiment, the sweetener or flavoring agent composition of the present application includes a GSTE or GSTC, where the ratio of one glucose residue being added to rubusoside to two glucose residues being added to rubusoside is more than 1.</p><p id="p-0538" num="0543">In another embodiment, the sweetener or flavoring agent composition of the present application includes an STE or STC, where the rubusoside content is less than 90%, less than 70%, less than 50%, less than 30%, less than 20%, less than 15%, less than 10%, less than 5%, the non-rubusoside substances originated from sweet tea plant are above 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 95%.</p><p id="p-0539" num="0544">In another embodiment, the sweetener or flavoring agent composition of the present application includes a GSTE or GSTC, where total glycosylated rubusosides is less than less than 90%, less than 70%, less than 50%, less than 30%, less than 20%, less than 15%, less than 10%, less than 5%, the non-rubusoside substances or their glycosylated form originated from sweet tea plant are above 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 95%.</p><p id="p-0540" num="0545">Poor aqueous solubility is not only an obstacle to extend their application for <i>stevia </i>glycosides, but also for many other pharmaceutical active substances, herb extract. for instance, carotenoids like lutein, zeaxanthin, lutein esters, epilutein, polyphenols like apple polyphenols, kiwi polyphenols, grape seed polyphenols, flavonoids such as flavonoids extracted from gingko <i>biloba</i>, alkaloids such as devil's claw extract etc. The inventor found high intensity sweetener extracts, such as <i>stevia </i>extract, sweet tea extract, monk fruit extract could improve the solubility of substances which have poor water solubility, preferably the crude extract comprises non-<i>stevia </i>glycosides or non-sweetening substances.

The beverage may be sweetened or unsweetened. The composition of the present application, or sweetener composition comprising the same, may be added to a beverage to sweeten the beverage or enhance its existing sweetness or flavor profile. In some embodiments, the composition of the present application comprises one or more substances selected from the group consisting of STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and G-ST-MRPs.</p><p id="p-0625" num="0726">A &#x201c;beverage&#x201d; or &#x201c;beverage product,&#x201d; is used herein with reference to a ready-to-drink beverage, beverage concentrate, beverage syrup, or powdered beverage. Suitable ready-to-drink beverages include carbonated and non-carbonated beverages. Carbonated beverages include, but are not limited to, frozen carbonated beverages, enhanced sparkling beverages, cola, fruit-flavored sparkling beverages (e.g., lemon-lime, orange, grape, strawberry and pineapple), ginger-ale, soft drinks and root beer. Non-carbonated beverages include, but are not limited to, fruit juice, fruit-flavored juice, juice drinks, nectars, vegetable juice, vegetable-flavored juice, sports drinks, energy drinks, enhanced water drinks, enhanced water with vitamins, near water drinks (e.g., water with natural or synthetic flavorants), coconut water, tea type drinks (e.g., black tea, green tea, red tea, oolong tea), coffee, cocoa drink, broths, beverages comprising milk components (e.g., milk beverages, coffee comprising milk components, cafe au lait, milk tea, fruit milk beverages), beverages comprising cereal extracts, and smoothies. Beverages may be frozen, semi-frozen (&#x201c;slush&#x201d;), non-frozen, ready-to-drink, concentrated (powdered, frozen, or syrup), dairy, non-dairy, probiotic, prebiotics, herbal, non-herbal, caffeinated, non-caffeinated, alcoholic, non-alcoholic, flavored, non-flavored, vegetable-based, fruit-based, root/tuber/corm-based, nut-based, other plant-based, cola-based, chocolate-based, meat-based, seafood-based, other animal-based, algae-based, calorie enhanced, calorie-reduced, and calorie-free.</p><p id="p-0626" num="0727">The resulting beverages may be dispensed in open containers, cans, bottles or other packaging. Such beverages and beverage preparations can be in ready-to-drink, ready-to-cook, ready-to-mix, raw, or ingredient form and can use the composition as a sole sweetener or as a co-sweetener.</p><p id="p-0627" num="0728">A significant challenge in the beverage industry is to preserve flavor in drinks. Normally, essential oils and their fractions are used as key flavors. They are prone to be oxidized to create unpleasant flavor(s) or the components easily evaporate to cause the food or beverage to lose their initial designed flavors as they sit on shelves. The embodiments herein provide new methods and compositions to overcome those disadvantages and provide new solutions to the food and flavor industry.</p><p id="p-0628" num="0729">Compared with conventional flavors, which are mainly preserved in different oils or oil soluble solvents, the present embodiments provide new methods to provide water soluble solutions, syrups and powders for flavoring agents.</p><p id="p-0629" num="0730">Compared to conventional isolated flavors, often as extracts from plant or animal sources, which are not always compatible for top note flavor and/or taste when sugar replacement sweeteners are added, the current embodiments provide new types of combined multi components which are compatible for a designed flavor.</p><p id="p-0630" num="0731">The embodiments surprisingly create sugar reduced sweeteners which have better taste than sugar including, for example, sweetening agents such as <i>Stevia </i>extract, steviol glycosides, STE, monk fruit, licorice, etc. and synthetic sweetener such as sucralose.</p><p id="p-0631" num="0732">Beverage concentrates and beverage syrups can be prepared with an initial volume of liquid matrix (e.g., water) and the desired beverage ingredients. Full strength beverages are then prepared by adding further volumes of water. Powdered beverages are prepared by dry-mixing all of the beverage ingredients in the absence of a liquid matrix. Full strength beverages are then prepared by adding the full volume of water.</p><p id="p-0632" num="0733">Beverages comprise a matrix, i.e., the basic ingredient in which the ingredients&#x2014;including the compositions of the present application&#x2014;are dissolved. In one embodiment, a beverage comprises water of beverage quality as the matrix, such as, for example deionized water, distilled water, reverse osmosis water, carbon-treated water, purified water, demineralized water or combinations thereof, can be used. Additional suitable matrices include, but are not limited to phosphoric acid, phosphate buffer, citric acid, citrate buffer and carbon-treated water.</p><p id="p-0633" num="0734">The beverage concentrations below can be provided by the composition of the present application or sweetener composition of the present application.</p><p id="p-0634" num="0735">Compared with simple blends of all ingredients together, the STCs and degradation products of STCs generate different compositions of sugar donors, which react with amine donors, and have interactions with the taste profile of remaining added sugar donors, STCs, STEs, GSTCs, GSTEs, ST-MRPs, G-ST-MRPs, SGs, SEs, GSGs, GSEs, <i>Stevia</i>-MRPs and C-MRPs, thus creating complicated, compatible tastes and aromas with steviol glycosides and other flavors, and substantially enriches the stereoscopic feeling of aroma and taste profile.</p><p id="p-0635" num="0736">Traditionally, the use of regular guar gum and other thickeners have been limited to certain applications due to their notable &#x201c;beany&#x201d; or &#x201c;grassy&#x201d; off notes in both flavor and aroma. These &#x201c;off notes&#x201d; are the result of volatile organic compounds such as hexanal and hexanoic acid etc. These compounds can influence the sensation of many delicate flavors in food and beverage applications. The STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and G-ST-MRPs described herein, can modify the taste of thickeners, such as guar gum, caragum, xanthan gum etc. so that the taste is more pleasing to the consumer. The STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and G-ST-MRPs described herein could also partially or totally replace thickeners used in the food and beverage industry. There is a synergy between the STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and G-ST-MRPs and thickeners to obtain a balance of taste and cost. There is also a synergy between the STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and/or G-ST-MRPs and SGs, SEs, GSGs, GSEs, <i>Stevia</i>-MRPs and/or C-MRPs to produce improved taste profiles. A desired taste and aroma of a food or beverage product can be obtained by adjusting the type of STCs and ratio of reactants and reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, reaction time etc.</p><p id="p-0636" num="0737">The size of bubbles in a carbonated beverage can significantly affect the mouth feel and flavor of the beverage. It is desirable to manipulate one or more properties of the bubbles produced in a beverage. Such properties can include the size of bubbles produced, the shape of bubbles, the amount of bubbles generated, and the rate at which bubbles are released or otherwise generated. Taste tests revealed a preference for carbonated beverages containing bubbles of smaller size.</p><p id="p-0637" num="0738">The inventors of the present application have surprisingly found that adding certain STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and/or G-ST-MRPs can minimize the size of bubbles, thus improving the mouth feel and flavor of beverages. Accordingly, in some embodiments, compositions of STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and/or G-ST-MRPs, with or without other additives such as sweetening agents and/or thaumatin, can be used as additives to manipulate the size of bubbles, preferably for reducing the size of bubbles.</p><p id="p-0638" num="0739">Additionally, the inventors surprisingly found that inclusion of thaumatin in the Maillard reaction or inclusion of thaumatin in combination of MRPs can significantly improve the overall taste profile of food and beverages to have a better mouth feel, a creamy taste, a reduction of bitterness of other ingredients in food and beverage, such as astringency of tea, protein, or their extracts, acidic nature and bitterness of coffee, etc. It can also reduce lingering, bitterness and metallic aftertaste of natural, synthetic high intensity sweeteners, or their combinations, their combination with other sweeteners, with other flavors much more than thaumatin itself. Thus, it plays a unique function in sugar reduction or sugar free products, and can be used as an additive for improving the taste performance of food and beverage products comprising one or more sweetening agents or sweeteners such as sucralose, acesulfame-K, aspartame, steviol glycosides, swingle extract, sweet tea extracts, allulose, sodium saccharin, sodium cyclamate or siratose.</p><p id="p-0639" num="0740">A probiotic beverage normally is made by fermenting milk, or skimmed milk powder, sucrose and/or glucose with selected bacteria strains, by manufacturers such as Yakult or Weichuan. Normally, a large amount of sugar is added to the probiotic beverage to provide nutrients to the probiotics in order to keep them alive during shelf life. Actually, the main function of such a large amount of sugar is also needed to counteract the sourness of probiotic beverage and enhance its taste. Sweetness and the thickness are the two key attributes that are most affected for the acceptability of the beverage. It is a challenge for the manufacturers to produce tasteful probiotic beverages of reduced sugar versions.</p><p id="p-0640" num="0741">In any of the embodiments described in the present application, the final concentration of any of STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and/or G-ST-MRPs in the beverage may be 0.0001 ppm, 0.001 ppm, 0.01 ppm, 0.1 ppm, 1 ppm, 2 ppm, 5 ppm, 10 ppm, 15 ppm, 20 ppm, 25 ppm, 30 ppm, 35 ppm, 40 ppm, 45 ppm, 50 ppm, 55 ppm, 60 ppm, 65 ppm, 70 ppm, 75 ppm, 80 ppm, 85 ppm, 90 ppm, 100 ppm, 110 ppm, 120, ppm, 130 ppm, 140 ppm, 150 ppm, 160 ppm, 170 ppm, 180 ppm, 190 ppm, 200 ppm, 220 ppm, 240 ppm, 260 ppm, 280 ppm, 300 ppm, 320 ppm, 340 ppm, 360 ppm 380 ppm, 400 ppm, 420 ppm, 440 ppm, 460 ppm, 480 ppm, 500 ppm, 525 ppm, 550 ppm, 575 ppm, 600 ppm, 625 ppm, 650 ppm, 675 ppm, 700 ppm, 725 ppm, 750 ppm, 775 ppm, 800 ppm, 825 ppm, 850 ppm, 875 ppm, 900 ppm, 925 ppm, 950 ppm, 975 ppm, 1,000 ppm, 1,200 ppm, 1,400 ppm, 1,600 ppm, 1,800 ppm, 2,000 ppm, 2,200 ppm, 2,400 ppm, 2,600 ppm, 2,800 ppm, 3,000 ppm, 3,200 ppm, 3,400 ppm, 3,600 ppm, 3,800 ppm, 4,000 ppm, 4,200 ppm, 4,400 ppm, 4,600 ppm, 4,800 ppm, 5,000 ppm, 5,500 ppm, 6,000 ppm, 6,500 ppm, 7,000 ppm, 7,500 ppm, 8,000 ppm, 8,500 ppm, 9,000 ppm, 9,500 ppm, 10,000 ppm, 11,000 ppm, 12,000 ppm, 13000 ppm, 14,000 ppm, 15,000 ppm, or a range defined by any pair of the aforementioned concentration values in this paragraph.</p><p id="p-0641" num="0742">In more particular embodiments, any of the STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and/or G-ST-MRPs may be present in the beverage at a final concentration ranging from 1 ppm to 15,000 ppm, from 1 ppm to 10,000 ppm, from 1 ppm to 5,000 ppm, from 10 ppm to 1,000 ppm, from 50 ppm to 900 ppm, from 50 ppm to 600 ppm, from 50 ppm to 500 ppm, from 50 ppm to 400 ppm, from 50 ppm to 300 ppm, from 50 ppm to 200 ppm, from 100 ppm to 600 ppm, from 100 ppm to 500 ppm, from 100 ppm to 400 ppm, from 100 ppm to 300 ppm, from 100 ppm to 200 ppm, from 125 ppm to 600 ppm, from 125 ppm to 500 ppm, from 125 ppm to 400 ppm, from 125 ppm to 300 ppm, from 125 ppm to 200 ppm, from 150 ppm to 600 ppm, from 150 ppm to 500 ppm, from 150 ppm to 500 ppm, from 150 ppm to 400 ppm, from 150 ppm to 300 ppm, from 150 ppm to 200 ppm, from 200 ppm to 600 ppm, from 200 ppm to 500 ppm, from 200 ppm to 400 ppm, from 200 ppm to 300 ppm, from 300 ppm to 600 ppm, from 300 ppm to 500 ppm, from 300 ppm to 400 ppm, from 400 ppm to 600 ppm, from 500 ppm to 600 ppm, from 20 ppm to 200 ppm, from 20 ppm to 180 ppm, from 20 ppm to 160 ppm, from 20 ppm to 140 ppm, from 20 ppm to 120 ppm, from 20 ppm to 100 ppm, from 20 ppm to 80 ppm, from 20 ppm to 60 ppm, from 20 ppm to 40 ppm, from 40 ppm to 150 ppm, from 40 ppm to 130 ppm, from 40 ppm to 100 ppm, from 40 ppm to 90 ppm, from 40 ppm to 70 ppm, from 40 ppm to 50 ppm, from 20 ppm to 100 ppm, from 40 ppm to 100 ppm, from 50 ppm to 100 ppm, from 60 ppm to 100 ppm, from 80 ppm to 100 ppm, from 5 ppm to 100 ppm, from 5 ppm to 95 ppm, from 5 ppm to 90 ppm, from 5 ppm to 85 ppm, from 5 ppm to 80 ppm, from 5 ppm to 75 ppm, from 5 ppm to 70 ppm, from 5 ppm to 65 ppm, from 5 ppm to 60 ppm, from 5 ppm to 55 ppm, from 5 ppm to 50 ppm, from 5 ppm to 45 ppm, from 5 ppm to 40 ppm, from 5 ppm to 35 ppm, from 5 ppm to 30 ppm, from 5 ppm to 25 ppm, from 5 ppm to 20 ppm, from 5 ppm to 15 ppm, from 5 ppm to 10 ppm, any aforementioned concentration value in this paragraph, or a range defined by any pair of the aforementioned concentration values in this paragraph.

The water soluble portion, which typically includes one or more STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and/or G-ST-MRPs of the present application, dissipates with a portion of the flavoring agent over a period of time during chewing while the insoluble gum base portion is retained in the mouth. The insoluble gum base generally determines whether a gum is considered chewing gum, bubble gum, or a functional gum.</p><p id="p-0675" num="0776">The insoluble gum base, which is generally present in the chewing gum composition in an amount in the range of about 15 to about 35 weight percent of the chewing gum composition, generally comprises combinations of elastomers, softeners (plasticizers), emulsifiers, resins, and fillers. Such components generally are considered food grade, recognized as safe (GRA), and/or are U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved.</p><p id="p-0676" num="0777">Elastomers, the primary component of the gum base, provide the rubbery, cohesive nature to gums and can include one or more natural rubbers (e.g., smoked latex, liquid latex, or guayule); natural gums (e.g., jelutong, perillo, sorva, massaranduba balata, massaranduba chocolate, nispero, rosindinha, chicle, and gutta hang kang); or synthetic elastomers (e.g., butadiene-styrene copolymers, isobutylene-isoprene copolymers, polybutadiene, polyisobutylene, and vinyl polymeric elastomers). In a particular embodiment, the elastomer is present in the gum base in an amount in the range of about 3 to about 50 weight percent of the gum base.</p><p id="p-0677" num="0778">Resins are used to vary the firmness of the gum base and aid in softening the elastomer component of the gum base. Non-limiting examples of suitable resins include a rosin ester, a terpene resin (e.g., a terpene resin from &#x3b1;-pinene, &#x3b2;-pinene and/or D-limonene), polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol, ethylene vinyl acetate, and vinyl acetate-vinyl laurate copolymers. Non-limiting examples of rosin esters include a glycerol ester of a partially hydrogenated rosin, a glycerol ester of a polymerized rosin, a glycerol ester of a partially dimerized rosin, a glycerol ester of rosin, a pentaerythritol ester of a partially hydrogenated rosin, a methyl ester of rosin, or a methyl ester of a partially hydrogenated rosin. In some embodiment, the resin is present in the gum base in an amount in the range of about 5 to about 75 weight percent of the gum base.</p><p id="p-0678" num="0779">Softeners, which also are known as plasticizers, are used to modify the ease of chewing and/or mouth feel of the chewing gum composition. Generally, softeners comprise oils, fats, waxes, and emulsifiers. Non-limiting examples of oils and fats include tallow, hydrogenated tallow, large, hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated vegetable oils (e.g., soybean, canola, cottonseed, sunflower, palm, coconut, corn, safflower, or palm kernel oils), cocoa butter, glycerol monostearate, glycerol triacetate, glycerol abietate, lecithin, monoglycerides, diglycerides, triglycerides acetylated monoglycerides, and free fatty acids. Non-limiting examples of waxes include polypropylene/polyethylene/Fisher-Tropsch waxes, paraffin, and microcrystalline and natural waxes (e.g., candelilla, beeswax and carnauba). Microcrystalline waxes, especially those with a high degree of crystallinity and a high melting point, also may be considered as bodying agents or textural modifiers. In some embodiments, the softeners are present in the gum base in an amount in the range of about 0.5 to about 25 weight percent of the gum base.</p><p id="p-0679" num="0780">Emulsifiers are used to form a uniform dispersion of the insoluble and soluble phases of the chewing gum composition and also have plasticizing properties. Suitable emulsifiers include glycerol monostearate (GMS), lecithin (phosphatidyl choline), polyglycerol polyricinoleic acid (PPGR), mono and diglycerides of fatty acids, glycerol distearate, tracetin, acetylated monoglyceride, glycerol triacetate, and magnesium stearate. In some embodiments, the emulsifiers are present in the gum base in an amount in the range of about 2 to about 30 weight percent of the gum base.</p><p id="p-0680" num="0781">The chewing gum composition also may comprise adjuvants or fillers in either the gum base and/or the soluble portion of the chewing gum composition. Suitable adjuvants and fillers include lecithin, inulin, polydextrin, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, magnesium silicate, ground limestone, aluminum hydroxide, aluminum silicate, talc, clay, alumina, titanium dioxide, and calcium phosphate. In some embodiments, lecithin can be used as an inert filler to decrease the stickiness of the chewing gum composition. In other some embodiments, lactic acid copolymers, proteins (e.g., gluten and/or zein) and/or guar can be used to create a gum that is more readily biodegradable. The adjuvants or fillers are generally present in the gum base in an amount up to about 20 weight percent of the gum base. Other optional ingredients include coloring agents, whiteners, preservatives, and flavors.</p><p id="p-0681" num="0782">In some embodiments of the chewing gum composition, the gum base comprises about 5 to about 95 weight percent of the chewing gum composition, more desirably about 15 to about 50 weight percent of the chewing gum composition, and even more desirably from about 20 to about 30 weight percent of the chewing gum composition.</p><p id="p-0682" num="0783">The soluble portion of the chewing gum composition may optionally include other artificial or natural sweeteners, bulk sweeteners, softeners, emulsifiers, flavoring agents, coloring agents, adjuvants, fillers, functional agents (e.g., pharmaceutical agents or nutrients), or combinations thereof. Suitable examples of softeners and emulsifiers are described above.</p><p id="p-0683" num="0784">Bulk sweeteners include both caloric and non-caloric compounds. Non-limiting examples of bulk sweeteners include sucrose, dextrose, maltose, dextrin, dried invert sugar, fructose, high fructose corn syrup, levulose, galactose, corn syrup solids, tagatose, polyols (e.g., sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, lactitol, erythritol, and maltitol), hydrogenated starch hydrolysates, isomalt, trehalose, or mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, the bulk sweetener is present in the chewing gum composition in an amount in the range of about 1 to about 75 weight percent of the chewing gum composition.</p><p id="p-0684" num="0785">Flavoring agents may be used in either the insoluble gum base or soluble portion of the chewing gum composition. Such flavoring agents may be natural or artificial flavors.

Tabletop Sweetener Compositions</p><p id="p-0689" num="0790">In general, tabletop sugar replacements lack certain taste attributes associated with sugar, especially for solid tabletop sweeteners. In addressing this need, the inventor of the present application has developed more palatable tabletop sugar replacements than commonly known. Specifically, in some embodiments, the present application provides an orally consumable product comprising one or more STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and/or G-ST-MRPs of the present application in the form of an orally consumable tabletop sweetener composition. In one embodiment, the orally consumable tabletop sweetener composition has a taste similar to molasses.</p><p id="p-0690" num="0791">In some embodiments, the tabletop sweetener composition may further include at least one bulking agent, additive, anti-caking agent, functional ingredient or combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0691" num="0792">Suitable &#x201c;bulking agents&#x201d; include, but are not limited to, maltodextrin (10 DE, 18 DE, or 5 DE), corn syrup solids (20 or 36 DE), sucrose, fructose, glucose, invert sugar, sorbitol, xylose, ribulose, mannose, xylitol, mannitol, galactitol, erythritol, maltitol, lactitol, isomalt, maltose, tagatose, lactose, inulin, glycerol, propylene glycol, polyols, polydextrose, fructooligosaccharides, cellulose and cellulose derivatives, and the like, or mixtures thereof. Additionally, in accordance with still other embodiments of the application, granulated sugar (sucrose) or other caloric sweeteners such as crystalline fructose, other carbohydrates, or sugar alcohol can be used as a bulking agent due to their provision of good content uniformity without the addition of significant calories.</p><p id="p-0692" num="0793">As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;anti-caking agent&#x201d; and &#x201c;flow agent&#x201d; refers to any composition which assists in content uniformity and uniform dissolution.

Taste Profiles and Taste Testing of Compositions Containing One or More STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and/or G-ST-MRPs</heading><p id="p-0708" num="0809">The one or more STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and/or G-ST-MRPs and methods described herein are useful for improved taste and aroma profiles of many consumable products relative to control samples. The phrase &#x201c;taste profile&#x201d;, which is interchangeable with &#x201c;sensory profile&#x201d; and &#x201c;sweetness profile&#x201d;, may be defined as the temporal profile of all basic tastes of a sweetener. The &#x201c;temporal profile&#x201d; may be considered to represent the intensity of sweetness perceived over time in tasting of the composition by a human, especially a trained &#x201c;taster&#x201d;. Carbohydrate and polyol sweeteners typically exhibit a quick onset followed by a rapid decrease in sweetness, which disappears relatively quickly on swallowing a food or beverage containing the same. In contrast, high intensity natural sweeteners typically have a slower sweet taste onset reaching a maximal response more slowly, followed by a decline in intensity more slowly than with carbohydrate and polyol sweeteners. This decline in sweetness is often referred to as &#x201c;sweetness linger&#x201d; and is a major limitation associated with the use of high intensity natural sweeteners.</p><p id="p-0709" num="0810">In the context of taste tasting, the terms &#x201c;improve&#x201d;, &#x201c;improved&#x201d; and &#x201c;improvement&#x201d; are used interchangeably with reference to a perceived advantageous change in a composition or consumable product upon introduction of one or more STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and/or G-ST-MRPs of the present application from the original taste profile of the composition or consumable product without the added one or more STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and/or G-ST-MRPs in any aspect, such as less bitterness, better sweetness, better sour taste, better aroma, better mouth feel, better flavor, less aftertaste, etc. The terms &#x201c;improve&#x201d; or &#x201c;improvement&#x201d; can refer to a slight change, a change, or a significant change of the original taste profile, etc., which makes the composition more palatable to an individual.</p><p id="p-0710" num="0811">In some embodiments, the one or more STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and/or G-ST-MRPs of the present application and methods described herein are useful for improving the taste and aroma profiles for other synthetic sweeteners, such as sucralose, ACE-K, aspartame, sodium saccharin, and mixtures thereof, and for natural high intensity sweeteners such as steviol glycosides, <i>Stevia </i>extracts, monk fruit extract, monk fruit components, licorice extract, licorice components.</p><p id="p-0711" num="0812">In some embodiments, the one or more STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and/or G-ST-MRPs of the present application may be evaluated with reference to the degree of their sucrose equivalence. Accordingly, the STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and/or G-ST-MRPs compositions of the present application may be diluted or modified with respect to its ingredients to conform with this sucrose equivalence.</p><p id="p-0712" num="0813">The onset and decay of sweetness when one or more STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and/or G-ST-MRPs of the present application are consumed can be perceived by trained human tasters and measured in seconds from first contact with a taster's tongue (&#x201c;onset&#x201d;) to a cutoff point (typically 180 seconds after onset) to provide a &#x201c;temporal profile of sweetness&#x201d;. A plurality of such human tasters is called a &#x201c;sensory panel.&#x201d; In addition to sweetness, sensory panels can also judge the temporal profile of the other &#x201c;basic tastes&#x201d;: bitterness, saltiness, sourness, piquance (aka spiciness), and umami (aka savoriness or meatiness). The onset and decay of bitterness when a sweetener is consumed, as perceived by trained human tasters and measured in seconds from first perceived taste to the last perceived aftertaste at the cutoff point, is called the &#x201c;temporal profile of bitterness.&#x201d; Aromas from aroma producing substances are volatile compounds which are perceived by the aroma receptor sites of the smell organ, i.e., the olfactory tissue of the nasal cavity. They reach the receptors when drawn in through the nose (orthonasal detection) and via the throat after being released by chewing (retronasal detection). The concept of aroma substances, like the concept of taste substances, is to be used loosely, since a compound might contribute to the typical aroma or taste of one food, while in another food it may cause a faulty aroma or taste, or both, resulting in an off-flavor. Thus, sensory profile may include evaluation of aroma as well.</p><p id="p-0713" num="0814">The term &#x201c;mouth feel&#x201d; involves the physical and chemical interaction of a consumable in the mouth. More specifically, as used herein, the term &#x201c;mouth feel&#x201d; refers to the fullness sensation experienced in the mouth, which relates to the body and texture of the consumable such as its viscosity. Mouth feel is one of the most important organoleptic properties and the major criteria that consumers use to judge the quality and freshness of foods. Subtle changes in a food and beverage product's formulation can change mouth feel significantly. Simply taking out sugar and adding a high intensity sweetener can cause noticeable alterations in mouth feel, making a formerly good product unacceptable to consumers. Sugar not only sweetens, it also builds body and viscosity in food and beverage products, and leaves a slight coating on the tongue. For example, reducing salt levels in soup changes not only taste, but can alter mouth feel as well. Primarily it is the mouth feel that is always the compliant with non-sugar sweeteners.</p><p id="p-0714" num="0815">The phrase &#x201c;sweetness detection threshold&#x201d; refers to the minimum concentration at which panelists consisting of 1-10 persons are able to detect sweetness in a composition, liquid or solid. This is further defined as provided in the Examples herein and are conducted by the methods described in Sensory Testing for Flavorings with Modifying Properties by Christie L. Harman, John B. Hallagan, and the FEMA Science, Committee Sensory Data Task Force, November 2013, Volume 67, No. 11 and Appendix A attached thereto, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0715" num="0816">&#x201c;Threshold of sweetness&#x201d; refers to a concentration of a material below which sweetness cannot be detected, but can still impart a flavor to a consumable (including water). When half of a trained panel of testers determines something is &#x201c;sweet&#x201d; at a given concentration, then the sample meets the threshold. When less than half of a panel of testers cannot discern sweetness at a given concentration, then concentrations of the substance below the sweetness level are considered a flavoring agent.</p><p id="p-0716" num="0817">It should be understood that the flavoring agents described herein, including STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and/or G-ST-MRPs, can be used in combination with other materials, including non-ST steviol glycosides, to encapsulate and reduce or eliminate the unwanted off taste present in the composition. There is a sequence of steps in Maillard reaction(s) that can be used to produce flavor(s). That is, there can be a first step where a first reaction takes place between a first sugar donor and a first amine donor under appropriate conditions followed by a second reaction with a second sugar donor and a second amine donor, and possible subsequent reactions to provide a complex flavorant composition that is a combination of various Maillard reaction products between, for example, the first sugar donor and first amine donor, along with the reaction between the first sugar donor and a second amine donor or a second sugar donor reacting with the first sugar donor, etc. under the Maillard reaction conditions described herein. The processes described herein can be used to preserve flavors.</p><p id="p-0717" num="0818">For example, to dissolve any flavor or flavor combination in a dissolved steviol glycosides solution, afterwards, the solution could be ready to use, or it could be further concentrated to syrup or powder form. For evaluating the taste profile of a given composition, a sample may be tested by e.g., a panel of 1-10 people. In some cases, a trained taster may independently taste the sample(s) first. The taster may be asked to describe the taste profile and score 0-5 according to the increasing sugar like, bitterness, aftertaste and lingering taste profiles. The taster may be allowed to re-taste, and then make notes for the sensory attributes perceived. Afterwards, another group of 1-10 tasters may similarly taste the sample(s), record its taste attributes and discuss the samples openly to find a suitable description. Where more than 1 taster disagrees with the results, the tasting may be repeated. For example, a &#x201c;5&#x201d; for sugar like is the best score for having a taste that is sugar like and conversely a value of 0 or near zero is not sugar like. Similarly, a &#x201c;5&#x201d; for bitterness, aftertaste and lingering is not desired. A value of zero or near zero means that the bitterness, aftertaste and/or lingering is reduced or is removed. Other taste attributes may include astringency and overall likability.</p><p id="p-0718" num="0819">In some embodiments, vanilla, maltol or other flavor modifier product(s) &#x201c;FMPs&#x201d; can be added to the compositions described herein to further improve the taste.

STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and/or G-ST-MRPs as Flavor Enhancers</heading><p id="p-0731" num="0832">The inventors have surprisingly found STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs or G-T-MRPs can bind the volatiles of various flavors used in food, beverages, cosmetics, feeds and pharmaceuticals. The STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and G-T-MRPs prepared by the methods disclosed herein could be widely soluble in water, water/alcohol, alcohol, and other organic solvents used for the flavor industry at different temperatures. The sweet tea composition could naturally encapsulate the flavor produced during the processes described herein. Therefore, it is also excellent carrier or encapsulating material for flavors, including but not limited to flavors and spices originated from plants such as bark, flowers, fruits, leaves, animals such as concentrated meat and sea food soups etc., and their extracts such as essential oils etc. In one aspect, a processed flavor is added to solution containing one or more STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and/or G-T-MRPs, then dried into a powder by any method, including but not limited spray-drying, crystallization, tray-drying, freeze drying etc. Thus, volatile flavors could be preserved. Normally, MRP flavors have to be maintained at low temperatures such as 10 degrees centigrade. The advantage of the present embodiments is that encapsulated flavors by STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and/or G-T-MRPs could be kept at room temperature or even higher temperatures without much loss of flavor. The antioxidant properties of one or more ST-MRPs play an additional role of protection of the flavors. In addition, depending on desired product, specially designed compositions can enhance a foam for a specific application such as foamed/frothy coffee. In addition, an anti-foaming agent could be added together or separately during the reaction processes descried herein, such that the product could be used to prevent foaming for beverage bottling applications.</p><p id="p-0732" num="0833">Another advantage of the present embodiments is that flavors could be absorbed in or to the inner surface of pores of STE, STC, GSTE, GSTC, ST-MRP and/or G-T-MRP powders. Flavors are preserved and can be released when in solution. The present embodiments avoid the use of starch, or dextrin as a carrier which can bring wheat taste to the flavors.</p><p id="p-0733" num="0834">Another advantage is that three or more molecules selected from rubusosides, or suaviosides bind one water molecule and act as a moisture preserver. An embodiment of composition comprises one more ingredient selected from STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and G-T-MRPs as a moisture preserver.</p><p id="p-0734" num="0835">Citrus flavors are among the most popular flavors in the food market. They are widely used in sauces and dressings as well as in sweet products, such as beverages, cookies, and desserts. Their consumption is growing steadily at more than 3% per year. Unfortunately, they are highly susceptible to the surroundings and deteriorate during processing and storage. Of all commercial citrus products, citrus flavor in beverages is the most delicate and difficult flavor to preserve. Lemon oil or lemon juice volatiles contain unstable flavor substances such as citral. The degradation of citrus flavors lowers intensity and balance, and develops unacceptable &#x201c;off-flavors&#x201d; from the degradation products. The generation of off-flavors is an especially troublesome problem negatively impacting the market potential of citrus flavors in the market place. Therefore, many investigators have attempted to better understand the mechanism of deterioration and inhibit deterioration of these flavors.</p><p id="p-0735" num="0836">The compositions and method in the present application have succeeded in stabilizing flavors in solution or even powder form. It is assumed that flavor substances are dissolved by <i>stevia </i>glycosides. Fat soluble flavor substances are surrounded or protected by steviol in the structure of <i>stevia </i>glycosides to prevent attachment of free radicals in water solution. On the surface of surrounded <i>stevia </i>glycosides, MRPs form a membrane acting as an antioxidant to protect the flavor substances. Additionally, dextrin residues and other sugar donors can act as coating material for powdered formulations to prevent attachment of oxygen in air.</p><p id="p-0736" num="0837">Compared with traditional essential oil flavors which have to be emulsified before being added to beverages, the compositions and methods of the present application do not require the use of emulsifiers. This maximizes the intensity of flavor, stabilizes the flavor from degradation by oxygen, light, heat etc., and makes the beverage transparent. In one embodiment, a stabilized flavor composition comprises: (a) one or more substances selected from STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTEs, ST-MRPs, G-ST-MRPs, rubusoside enriched <i>stevia </i>extracts and/or MRPs formed from rubusoside enriched <i>stevia </i>extracts; rubusoside enriched <i>stevia </i>glycosides and/or MRPs formed therefrom; glycosylated rubusoside enriched <i>stevia </i>extracts and/or MRPs formed from rubusoside enriched <i>stevia </i>glycosides; glycosylated rubusoside enriched <i>stevia </i>glycosides, such as SGs or GSGs, as well as MRPs formed from glycosylated rubusoside enriched <i>stevia </i>glycosides; and residues of dextrin and/or other type of sugar donors; and (b) a flavor substance. In a further aspect, a consumable food or beverage product contains the aforementioned substances in both (a) and (b).</p><p id="p-0737" num="0838">Freshness is one of the most important factors representing consumers' satisfaction with the sensory qualities present in fruit or berry juices, juice flavored beverages, fruited foods etc. Freshly squeezed juices without any treatment provide a refreshing, pleasant flavor with the mouth-contracting characteristics of fruits. Mouth-contracting is one type of mouthfeeling where ingredients cause contraction like freshness, acidity, salt, and spiciness in the mouth. Contracting substances typically stimulate saliva flow. Commercial fruit juices have shown variations in quality and freshness resulted from deterioration of flavor substances during the product's shelf-life as well as seasonal variations in fruit quality. Juice flavor is composed of a broad mixture of different aroma fractions containing a variety of volatile compounds. The aroma compounds in these fractions may undergo several changes during processing and storage that gradually lead to a loss of freshness and the formation of unpleasant aromas (off-flavors). Most of these changes are acid-catalyzed reactions supported by the acidity of the juice and accelerated by high processing and storage temperatures.</p><p id="p-0738" num="0839">Freshness is an important character of quality for food and beverage products and is characterized by various definitions or aspects. In one aspect, the freshness or lack of freshness is perceived as a sensation. For example, a basil leave on a plant has a fresh smell and fresh taste. The same leaf after 2 days on the shelf doesn't smell fresh or taste fresh. In another aspect, freshness is derived from a multisensory sensation and a learned expectation together which can provide a &#x201c;refreshing&#x201d; sensation. For example, a consumer can assess sparkling water as fresh or refreshing even before drinking it. When people are thirsty and an unknown drink is provided, the effect of the unknown drink may be subconsciously compared with sparkling water. The basic properties of cognitive freshness are clear. Coldness, colorless, carbonated are typical characters of refreshing; sourness enhances freshness; colors such as red or orange increase thirst-quenching perception; flavors, such as mint, orange, peppermint, lemon, citrus, and peach are among the most refreshing aromas.</p><p id="p-0739" num="0840">Without being bound by theory, the inventor's surprising findings strongly show that retronasal aroma is an inseparable part of taste. Taste and retronasal aromas arise from integrated senses. A lot of what is perceived as taste by human beings is in fact the result of retronasal aromas passing through the nose. It is known that people with severe colds have a greatly reduced sense of taste, because retronasal aromas cannot reach the retronasal olfactory receptors in the nose. Retronasal aromas compete with taste when reaching a sensory impression of a food or beverage product by the brain. Sweetness and mouthfeel cannot be solely attribute sensory perceptions originating on the tongue or in the mouth. Retronasal aroma (or nose-feeling) significantly contributes to what is considered traditional mouthfeel (mouth-contracting, mouth-coating, mouth-dry) without necessarily increasing the viscosity of a food or beverage. Aromas contracting with the mouth give the impression of refreshment and cleansing of the mouth. The compositions of the present application can be classified as contracting aromas that can stimulate saliva flow.</p><p id="p-0740" num="0841">Compared with prevailing industry approaches for improving the overall taste and flavor of food and beverage products, the present application provides a unique approach to taste and flavor that better integrates aroma and taste to provide more tasteful food and beverage products. For example, in contrast to many of the traditional approaches in the flavor industry that rely on the use of essential oils having strong orthonasal sensory characteristics, the inventor of the present application has surprisingly found that retronasal aroma plays a more important role than orthonasal smell in making a consumable product with improved hedonic characteristics. By providing good mouthfeel and intensity of aroma, the compositions of the present application provide improved overall flavor. In one embodiment, a composition of the present application includes one or more substances selected from STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and G-T-MRPs, and optionally one or more substance elected from SGs, SEs, GSGs, GSEs, <i>Stevia</i>-MRPs and C-MRPs, wherein one or more sensory attributes selected from mouth-contracting, mouth-coating, mouthfeel, flavor intensity, and sweetness are increased relative to a composition without the one or more substances.</p><p id="p-0741" num="0842">In some instances, people have acquired a reduction or loss in their sensory capabilities for taste and smell, especially upon aging or following infections by viruses, such as COVID-19. The compositions and methods of the present application provide effective tools for enhancing retronasal olfactory senses to make food and beverages more palatable for being swallowed. This can improve the speed of drinking beverages or eating foods by those with such reduced senses. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the compositions of the present application are anti-inflammatory for the mucous membranes of the oral cavity, throat and retronasal cavity, and cause increased permeability of aroma substances through the epithelium. Thus, in some embodiments, the composition comprises one or more substances selected from STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and G-T-MRPs, where at least one of the substances is an angiogenesis inhibitor. In some embodiments, the composition may further include one or more members selected from lutein, epilutein, and/or anthocyanins. Such composition may be used, for example, in patients suffering from COVID-19 or other sensory deficiencies.</p><p id="p-0742" num="0843">The inventor has surprisingly found that compositions comprising low molecular weight <i>stevia </i>glycosides, such as rubusoside and glycosylated low molecular weight <i>stevia </i>glycosides, including glycosylated rubusoside, as well as MRPs formed therefrom can increase the freshness of food and beverage products, and provide an improved, quicker onset of sweetness. These substances are further believed to provide an earlier recognition of flavor by the brain. The resultant effect of quick-onset of sweetness and refreshing flavor enables consumers to categorize food or beverage products quicker than if those glycosides were not added. The effect of this addition can provide improved overall flavor and taste of food and beverage products.</p><p id="p-0743" num="0844">For instance, when high intensity sweeteners, such as sucralose, Acesulfame K, monk fruit extract, <i>stevia </i>glycosides are used as sweeteners, lingering is always generated. The lingering becomes the lead sensation. It dominates other sensations and distracts tasters from other sensations. However, the compositions of the present application can block the lingering and bitterness of high intensity sweeteners and act synergistically to improve sweetness.</p><p id="p-0744" num="0845">In one embodiment, a flavor composition or sweetener composition comprises one or more substances selected from STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and G-T-MRPs, rubusoside enriched <i>stevia </i>extracts and/or MRPs therefrom, rubusoside enriched <i>stevia </i>glycosides and/or MRPs therefrom, glycosylated rubusoside enriched <i>stevia </i>extracts and/or MRPs therefrom, glycosylated rubusoside enriched <i>stevia </i>glycosides and/or MRPs therefrom, wherein the one or more substances generate a quick onset of sweetness, enhance the strength of orthonasal smell, improve the freshness, and/or increase the sweetness of a food or beverage product.</p><p id="p-0745" num="0846">In another embodiment, a method to accelerate flavor identification by the brain comprises adding one or more substances selected from STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and G-T-MRPs, rubusoside enriched <i>stevia </i>extracts and/or MRPs therefrom, rubusoside enriched <i>stevia </i>glycosides and/or MRPs therefrom, glycosylated rubusoside enriched <i>stevia </i>extracts and/or MRPs therefrom, glycosylated rubusoside enriched <i>stevia </i>glycosides and/or MRPs therefrom, wherein the identification is accelerated by less than 1 second, less than 0.1 second, less than 0.01 second, or less than 0.001 second.</p><p id="p-0746" num="0847">Oral mucosa can be classified into three different types: masticatory mucosa, lining mucosa and specialized mucosa. Masticatory mucosa covers the gingiva and hard palate, which accounts for about 25% of the oral mucosa. Specialized mucosa with characteristics of both masticatory and lining mucosa is found on the dorsum of the tongue. The dorsum of tongue accounts for about 15% of the oral mucosa. Lining mucosa covers the remaining regions, except for the dorsal surface of the tongue. Liming mucosa is related to the conventional third of the major chemosensory systems, the trigeminal chemosensory system. The neurons and their associated endings in this system are typically activated by chemicals classified as irritants, including air pollutants (e.g., sulfur dioxide), ammonia (smelling salts), ethanol (liquor), acetic acid (vinegar), carbon dioxide (in soft drinks), menthol (in various inhalants), and capsaicin (the compound in chili peppers that elicits the characteristic burning sensation). Contrary to conventional knowledge, the inventor of the present application believes that the lining mucosa contains taste and aroma receptors, and plays a principal role in overall taste and aroma together with retronasal nose-tasting, retronasal nose-coating, retronasal nose-aroma and taste by tongue. This means that the overall flavor, including taste and aroma, is an integrated and inseparable entity created by taste and flavor receptors spreading in lining mucosal sites, in addition to tongue, throat and retronasal areas.</p><p id="p-0747" num="0848">Substances such as STC, STE, GSTC, GSTE, ST-MRPs and G-ST-MRPs can stimulate trigeminal nerve receptors in the mouth and retronasal cavity, and play an important role in flavor and taste identification of consumable products. Further, when combining STC, STE, GSTC, GSTE, ST-MRPs and G-ST-MRPs therefrom with pungent and irritant chemicals, synergistic effects are observed. Whereas pungent and irritant chemicals can activate trigeminal nerve receptors at lower thresholds or concentrations when combined with rubusoside-based glycosides or other small molecular <i>stevia </i>glycosides. Thus, in one embodiment, a composition or consumable product comprises: (a) one or more flavor and/or taste substances, and (b) one or more substances selected from STC, STE, GSTC, GSTE, ST-MRPs, and G-ST-MRPs, wherein the threshold for activating trigeminal receptors is reduced compared to a composition or product containing only the one or more flavor and/or taste substance in part (a).</p><p id="p-0748" num="0849">The inventor has surprisingly found that substances, such as STC, STE, GSTC, GSTE, ST-MRPs and G-ST-MRPs therefrom can be used as trigeminal nerve stimulants. When used together with other taste or flavor stimulants, these substances can induce nerve firing, elicit enhanced sensations such as irritation, burning, stinging, tingling, pain, as well as the general perception of temperature, viscosity, weight, and freshness. When used at higher concentrations, these trigeminal stimulants can suppress the perception of olfactory compounds. Thus, in one embodiment, a composition or consumable product comprises: (a) one or more flavor and taste substances, and b) one or more substances selected from STCs, STEs, GSTCs, GSTEs, ST-MRPs, and G-ST-MRPs, where stimulation strength of (a) is enhanced when using (b) at lower concentrations; and stimulation strength of a) is reduced when using b) at higher concentrations.</p><p id="p-0749" num="0850">Without being bound by theory, the inventor believes that masticatory mucosa and lining mucosa are essentially responsible for mouth-contracting, and specialized mucosa is mainly responsible for mouth-coating or tongue-coating. Both are responsible for mouthfeel. It is further believed that the lining mucosa is responsive to rubusosides, glycosylated rubusosides and MRPs therefrom exhibit significant flexibility, biocompatibility and propensity for adhesively attaching to these mucosal surfaces. Accordingly, these substances are believed to improve permeability and adhesiveness of flavor substances to oral mucosa so as to bind sensory receptors responsive to bitterness, as well as metallic and synthetic tastes, thereby blocking other unpleasant substances to these receptors that would otherwise have a negative effect on taste and flavor. Nasal mucosa are particularly sensitive; rubusoside, glycosylated rubusoside and MRPs formed therefrom exhibit better accessibility and stronger impact on nasal mucosa.</p><p id="p-0750" num="0851">In view of the foregoing, one embodiment of the present application includes a composition comprising one or more components selected from rubusoside, glycosylated rubusoside, rubusoside-MRPs, and glycosylated rubusoside-MRPs. Adding these components to a consumable product can enhance the mouth-contracting and freshness of the consumable product.

However, they could create a chalky or a floury taste, and higher viscosities would make a beverage less palatable. Therefore, there is a need to find a solution to reduce the amount of thickeners to be used for food and beverage especially for sugar, fat and salt reduction products. The inventors surprisingly found that adding one or more ST-MRPs could enhance the mouth feel of thickeners and have a synergistic effect without necessarily increasing the viscosity, thus improving the palatability of the food or beverage. An embodiment comprises one or more ST-MRPs and sweetening agent(s), or a mixture of one or more ST-MRPs, sweetening agent and thaumatin) and a thickener, wherein the thickener is selected from one or more hydrocolloids and/or polyols.

With increasing demand of natural flavors such as vanilla, citrus, cocoa, coffee etc., the food and beverage industry face a big challenge to meet consumers' requirements. For example, the harvest of citrus in recent years has been heavily influenced by fruit disease which has created a shortage. Vanilla, coffee and Cocoa supply is always strongly influenced by climate. To increase their availability, farmers have to use more land to compete with other necessary cultivation of food and vegetable products, thus there is an additional danger of deforestation. Therefore, there is a need to find alternative sources to complement the market demand. The inventors surprisingly found that adding one or more ST-MRPs could significantly improve the taste profile of flavors, lower the threshold of flavors and reduce the amount of flavors to be used. An embodiment comprises one or more ST-MRPs (or mixture of one or more ST-MRPs and sweetening agent, or mixture of one or more ST-MRPs, sweetening agent and thaumatin) and a flavor.</p><p id="p-0833" num="0934">Consumers are demanding &#x2018;cleaner&#x2019; labels while retailers demand longer shelf life. The use of natural antioxidants such as tocopherols and rosemary extracts can solve these problems simultaneously. However, natural antioxidants always retain their own characteristic aroma, which makes it difficult to incorporate them in food and beverages. There is a need to look for alternative solutions. The inventors surprisingly found that adding one or more ST-MRPs to food or beverages could significantly reduce the negative aroma of antioxidants and provide a synergy of antioxidant property. In one embodiment, a composition comprising one or more ST-MRPs (or a mixture of one or more ST-MRPs and sweetening agent(s), or a mixture of one or more MRPs ST-MRPs, sweetening agent(s) and thaumatin) and a natural antioxidant is disclosed.</p><p id="p-0834" num="0935">Thaumatin is a good alternative solution for sugar reduction. However, its lingering taste makes it difficult to be used at higher dosages.

A lot of resources have been expended to prevent Maillard reactions in food proceeding in order to keep the good quality of food. Therefore, there is a need to find methods to produce useful Maillard reaction products which the food and beverage industry could benefit from. In one aspect, 2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo (4, 5-b)pyridine (PhlP) is formed in high amounts and is usually responsible for around 80% of the aromatic amines present in cooked meat products. It is listed on the IARC list of carcinogens. It is now understood that (HAAs) are over 100 fold more mutagenic than Aflatoxin B1. For example, heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) can be formed under mild conditions&#x2014;when glucose, glycine and creatine/creatinine are left at room temperature in a phosphate buffer for 84 days HAA's are formed. HAA's are reported in all kinds of cooked meat and fish products especially those that have been grilled, barbecued or roasted. Traditional restaurant food preparation tends to produce more HAA's than fast food outlets. With chicken, deep fat frying produces the highest levels of HAA's. Increasing mutagenic activity correlates with increased weight loss during cooking. In BBQ'd beef additional mutagenic components are present. Acrylamide for example, was first identified in 2002 by Margaret Tornquist of Stockholm University. She compared the blood samples of Swedish tunnel builders working with a sealant containing acrylamide with those of the general population. The results showed that the general population was regularly exposed to high levels of acrylamide. Rat feeding studies revealed that acrylamide increased the rates of several types of cancer. All these results showed that there is a need to find alternative solutions to provide the desired taste without these harmful substances, especially for bread, grilled meat, roasted coffee and chocolate. The inventor's solution was to select a suitable sugar and amine donor to create taste or flavor which could be added in food or beverages, especially for sweet foods and beverages. When adding healthy one or more ST-MRPs, it would allow for conditions of baking, frying, grilling, roasting of food at lower temperatures, to have shorter heating times, and thus reduce the amount of harmful substances, or avoid creating harmful substances compared with traditional food process methods. Meanwhile, traditional methods heat the whole food which consumes a lot of energy and creates more pollution when compared to this invention. The invention makes it possible to create new methods of baking, frying, grilling and roasting without compromising taste. In one aspect, a food or beverage can include healthy and harmless one or more ST-MRPs. Protein becomes an important healthy factor for foods and beverages. However, protein's raw egg taste and smell is an obstacle for wide use. Bean protein, whey protein and Coconut protein possess characteristic unpleasant tastes after drying.

The inventors found ST-MRPs could block the bitterness of Maillard reaction products, while one or more ST-MRPs could modify the lingering, bitterness, aftertaste etc. Surprisingly, the bitterness from STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs and ST-MRPs are not superimposed or multiplied.</p><p id="p-0860" num="0961">In some instances MRPs taste bitter. Thaumatin has a slow sweetness onset and lingering sweetness. Surprisingly, when combing (1) a MRP, such as a ST-MRP or a C-MRP, with (B) one or more products selected from STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs and (C) thaumatin together, the bitterness of STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs and lingering of thaumatin are not superimposed or multiplied. To the contrary, STEs, STCs, GSTEs, and GSTCs act as bridge between MRPs and thaumatin, while MRPs act as a bridge between STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs and thaumatin to create a pleasant integrated taste profile.</p><p id="p-0861" num="0962">Depending on requirement of flavor or flavor enhancing intensity, sweetening derived one or more ST-MRPs could be further blended with a sweetening agent(s), sweetener(s) or other ingredients to obtain acceptable taste and aroma profiles.</p><p id="p-0862" num="0963">In one aspect, a flavoring agent(s) in combination with one or more ingredient selected from STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and G-ST-MRPs is provided. It has been found that substances including rubusoside surprisingly protects the flavoring agent. Not to be limited by any theory, there is a surprising protective effect exerted by the sweet tea or rubusoside-rich derived products on the flavoring agent(s).</p><p id="p-0863" num="0964">For example, unlike typical powdered flavoring agents which have a strong aroma, the inventors have surprisingly found that the combination of (1) one or more ingredient selected from STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and G-ST-MRPs and (2) one or more flavoring agents in a powder form results in a composition with minimal smell. However, when the same combination is dissolved in a solution (e.g., water, alcohol or mixtures thereof), the aroma of the flavoring agent is released resulting in a strong smell.</p><p id="p-0864" num="0965">The above observations are not meant to be limited to powders. The one or more ingredient selected from STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and G-ST-MRPs and the flavoring agent(s) can be part of a liquid composition, such as a syrup.</p><p id="p-0865" num="0966">In one aspect, the reaction products of the embodiments described herein can be dissolved at neutral pH.</p><p id="p-0866" num="0967">In one embodiment, the processes of the embodiments described herein are useful for improvement of taste and aroma profile for other natural sweeteners, including but not limited to licorice, thaumatin etc., their mixtures, their mixtures with sweet tea or rubusoside-rich derived products, etc.</p><p id="p-0867" num="0968">In another embodiment, the processes of the embodiments described herein are used for improvement of taste and aroma profile for other synthetic sweeteners, including but not limited to AC-K, aspartame, sodium saccharin, sucralose or their mixtures.</p><p id="p-0868" num="0969">The embodiments described above are applicable for any synthetic sweetener, blends thereof and other natural sweeteners, blends thereof, or mixtures of synthetic and natural sweetener(s), especially with sucralose.</p><p id="p-0869" num="0970">For example, one or more ingredients selected from the group consisting of STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and G-ST-MRPs could be added in ratio of from about 1 to about 99% on a weight/weight basis of total raw material into the following formulation to create a Baked ham flavor:</p><p id="p-0870" num="0971">Water 10%</p><p id="p-0871" num="0972">Pork lard 5% to 10%</p><p id="p-0872" num="0973">Cysteine 1% to 5%</p><p id="p-0873" num="0974">Xylose 1% to 5%</p><p id="p-0874" num="0975">Char Oil hickory 1% to 5%</p><p id="p-0875" num="0976">Hydrolyzed vegetable protein 5% to 10%</p><p id="p-0876" num="0977">Sunflower oil 50% to 75%</p><p id="p-0877" num="0978">Mix them well with heating to 110 degree C. for two hours.</p><p id="p-0878" num="0979">Cool with mixing to 95 degree C. for one hour.</p><p id="p-0879" num="0980">Allow to separate and filter top oil layer while warm.</p><p id="p-0880" num="0981">Another example is to add one or more ingredients selected from the group consisting of STEs, STCs, GSTEs, GSTCs, ST-MRPs and G-ST-MRPs in ratio of from about 1 to about 99% on a weight to weight basis of total material in the following formulation to create tea flavored products:</p><p id="p-0881" num="0982">Reducing sugar: high fructose corn syrup</p><p id="p-0882" num="0983">Protein: theanine</p><p id="p-0883" num="0984">Acids: citric acid or phosphoric acid</p><p id="p-0884" num="0985">The ratio of reducing sugar and acid is 1 to 0.5.

The sugar group is known as the glycone and the non-sugar group as the aglycone or genin part of the glycoside. Glycosides are prevalent in nature and represent a significant portion of all the pharmacologically active constituents of botanicals. As a class, aglycones are much less water-soluble than their glycoside counterparts.</p><p id="p-0995" num="1089">Depending on whether the glycosidic bond lies &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;above&#x201d; the plane of the cyclic sugar molecule, glycosides of the present application can be classified as &#x3b1;-glycosides or &#x3b2;-glycosides. Some enzymes such as &#x3b1;-amylase can only hydrolyze &#x3b1;-linkages; others, such as emulsin, can only affect &#x3b2;-linkages. Further, there are four types of linkages present between glycone and aglycone: a C-linked glycosidic bond, which cannot be hydrolyzed by acids or enzymes&#x201d;; an O-linked glycosidic bond; an N-linked glycosidic bond; or an S-linked glycosidic bond.</p><p id="p-0996" num="1090">The glycone can consist of a single sugar group (monosaccharide) or several sugar groups (oligosaccharide). Exemplary glycones include glucose, galactose, fructose, mannose, rhamnose, rutinose, xylose, lactose, arabinose, glucuronic acid etc. An aglycone is the compound remaining after the glycosyl group on a glycoside is replaced by a hydrogen atom. When combining a glycone with an aglycone, a number of different glycosides may be formed, including steviol glycosides, terpenoid glycosides, alcoholic glycosides, anthraquinone glycosides, coumarin glycosides, chromone glycosides, cucurbitane glycosides, cyanogenic glycosides, flavonoid glycosides, phenolic glycosides, steroidal glycosides, iridoid glycosides, and thioglycosides.</p><p id="p-0997" num="1091">For example, the term &#x201c;flavonoid aglycone&#x201d; refers to an unglycosylated flavonoid. Flavonoid aglycones include flavone aglycones, flavanol aglycones, flavanone aglycones, isoflavone aglycones and mixtures thereof. Thus, the terms &#x201c;flavone aglycone&#x201d;, &#x201c;flavanol aglycone&#x201d;, &#x201c;flavanone aglycone&#x201d; and &#x201c;isoflavone aglycones&#x201d; refer to unglycosylated flavones, flavanols, flavanones and isoflavones, respectively.

It demonstrates that sweet tea extract, its glycosylated product or MRPs, <i>stevia </i>extract, its glycosylated product or MRPs can act as excellent carrier to flavor ingredient. The final product can be in powder or liquid form. This technology can be used to produce water-soluble essential oil, and products in powder form. The flavor intensity of the products produced by this technology was significantly intensified. There was synergy between the flavor ingredient and carrier. This technology can be used for any type of oils or soluble ingredients. The resulting products, such as soluble flavor ingredients, can enhance the retronasal flavor when added into food and beverage.</p><heading id="h-0054" level="1">Example 40.

The screening consisted of comparison of retention times to authentic standards, comparison of online DAD-UV spectra and tracing of m/z values in ESI-MS detection. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref> shows the chromatographic evaluation at 254 nm. As seen there, there are no mentionable signal observed in sample RU20 and GRU20. These 2 samples should contain the maximum amount of compounds from this class.</p><p id="p-1509" num="1529">As seen in Tables 47-1 to 47-3, the base samples with 20% rubusoside (whether or not treated) contains mainly rubusoside and steviol-monoside in a ratio of around 10:1 together with traces of suaviosides. The base sample with 92% rubusoside contains mainly rubusoside and traces of suaviosides (see Table 47-4). It is therefore acceptable to allocate glucosylated steviol-glycosides as stemming mostly from rubusoside. Steviol-monoside with one added glucose can be determined due to chromatographic separation from Rubusoside, in all other glycosylation patterns it can only be differentiated between different molar masses, but not the basic molecule (rubusoside or steviol-monoside). As shown in Tables 47-1 to 47-3 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref>, the glycosylated samples show for most molar masses 2 peaks which are interpreted as rubusoside isomers.</p><p id="p-1510" num="1530">Further tracing of minor steviol-related compounds tentatively present in sweet tea leaf extracts (i.e. suaviosides) was performed by detailed evaluation of the ESI-MS trace. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>27</b>A-<b>27</b>C and <b>28</b>A-<b>28</b>C</figref> present comparative fingerprints and Tables 47-4 and 47-5 provide quantitative estimates for steviol-related compounds, tentatively from the group of suaviosides.

the taste and flavor profile of lemonade juice. Preferably RU90, GRU90, GRU20-MRP-TA, GRU90-MRP-CA, GRU90-MRP-TA are used, due to their substantial improvement of the overall flavor and taste and preference rating of all tasters. Any type of these compositions, such as STE, STC, GSTE, GSTC and collectively ST-MRP/G-ST-MRP or any combination of these compositions could be used in beverage.

could improve or change the taste and flavor profile of sugar free or sugar reduced beverage. Preferably RU90, GRU90, GRU20-MRP-TA, GRU90-MRP-CA, GRU90-MRP-TA are used, due to their substantial improvement of the overall flavor and taste and preference rating of all tasters. Any type of these compositions such as STE, STC, GSTE, GSTC, ST-MRPs, <i>stevia </i>(GSGs+SGs)-MRPs or any combination of these compositions could be used in a beverage.

Thereafter the flavored samples were tasted at the use level to find a common sense on how to describe the flavors (taste, smell, intensity). Five trained tasters were tasting blinded and independently all samples of a series. They were allowed to re-taste and are making notes for the sensory attributes perceived. In the last step the attributes noted were discussed openly to find a compromise description. In case that more than 1 taster disagrees with the compromise, the tasting was repeated.</p><p id="p-1561" num="1572">Application 1: Sugar Free Energy Drink (Commercial Sample)</p><p id="p-1562" num="1573">Materials: RedBull sugar free, M23C5, PR:02.02.2020/23:35 NO, EX: 02.02.21/1803976.</p><p id="p-1563" num="1574">Test design: To evaluate the taste profile of RU samples a commercial sugar free energy drink (250 ml can, Brand: Red Bull, sweetened with acesulfame K and aspartame) was used.

effect on beverage such as energy drinks, flavored milk beverages, flavored teas, flavored coffee drinks. G-STE, GSTC, STE-MRP, STC-MRP, G-STE-MRP and G-STC-MRP could significantly improve the taste profile and palatability of beverage. The added amount calculated based on pure rubusoside content in food and beverage could be in extended to the range of 1-10,000 ppm, preferably in the range of 5-5,000 ppm, more preferably in the range of 5-3,000 ppm. In some embodiments, G-STE, GSTC, STE-MRP, STC-MRP, G-STE-MRP and/or G-STC-MRP are added at a final concentration of 10-2,000 ppm, 10-1,000 ppm, 10-500 ppm, 10-200 ppm, 10-100 ppm, 10-50 ppm, 20-2,000 ppm, 20-1,000 ppm, 20-500 ppm, 20-200 ppm, 20-100 ppm, 20-50 ppm, 50-2,000 ppm, 50-1,000 ppm, 50-500 ppm, 50-200 ppm, 50-100 ppm, 100-2,000 ppm, 100-1,000 ppm, 100-500 ppm, 100-200 ppm, 200-2,000 ppm, 200-1,000 ppm, 200-500 ppm, 500-2,000 ppm, 500-1,000 ppm or 1000-2000 ppm.</p><heading id="h-0065" level="1">Example 50.

This example demonstrate that G-ST-MRPs can act as excellent carriers of flavor ingredients. It could improve the solubility of essential oil or flavor in oil form. The final product can be in powdered or liquid forms. This production process can be used to produce water-soluble essential oil, and products in powder form. The flavor intensity of the products produced by this production process was significantly intensified. There was a synergy between the flavor ingredients and the carriers. This technology can be used for any type of oils or water soluble ingredients. The resulting products, such as soluble flavor ingredients, can enhance orthonasal and retronasal flavors when added into food products and beverages, and increase sweetness as well. In other words, G-ST-MRP can be used as a good carrier of essential oils to maintain the original flavor of essential oils and promote their solubility. STCs such as rubusoside can be obtained or isolated from e.g., <i>stevia </i>or sweet tea extracts, bio-conversion from stevioside, fermentation or chemical synthesis. The ratio of essential oil to the composition of carrier could be vary from 1:99 to 99:1 depends on the designed requirement of final products.</p><heading id="h-0077" level="1">Example 62.

sweet lingering, quicken sweetness onset and mask the bitterness of Luo Han Guo extract. This effect was observed at all tested weight ratios of Luo Han Guo extract-to-GRU90-MRP-FTA ratios (from 10:1 to 10:10). These effects can be extended to the Luo Han Guo extract-to-GRU90-MRP-FTA ratio range of 99:1 to 1:99. This example demonstrates that G-ST-MRPs can improve the taste profile, flavor intensity and mouth feel of natural sweeteners, such as Luo Han Guo extract. The Luo Han Guo extract (or monk fruit extract) can be derived from concentrated juice or a monk fruit extract with different mogroside V contents, such as 1.5%, 3%, 15%, 40%, 50%, 70%, 90%, 95%, etc. The observed effects can be extended to all natural sweeteners or low calorie sweeteners.</p><heading id="h-0089" level="1">Example 74.

num="1735">Conclusion: These results show that GRU90-MRP-FTA can significantly improve mouth feel, reduce sweet lingering, quicken sweetness onset and mask the bitterness of a Luo Han Guo extract. This effect was observed at all tested weight ratios of Luo Han Guo extract-to-GRU90-MRP-FTA (from 10:1 to 10:10). These effects can be further extended to Luo Han Guo extract-to-GRU90-MRP-FTA ratio ranges from 99:1 to 1:99. This example demonstrates that G-ST-MRPs can improve taste profile, flavor intensity and mouth feel of natural sweeteners, such as Luo Han Guo extract. The observed effects can be extended to all natural sweeteners.</p><heading id="h-0090" level="1">Example 75.

Version 1.8). Compound identification was achieved based on mass spectra comparison with NIST 17. Compounds with forward and reverse matching degrees &#x2265;750 and a peak area percentages &#x2265;0.05% were selected for inclusion in Tables 76-6 to 75-9. A series of n-alkanes (C8-C25) were injected separately to establish first-dimension retention indices (RI1). Experimental retention indices (RI) were calculated using the n-alkanes RI values and compared to literature values (NIST RI) for further confirmation. A blank run was also performed for background correction of the samples. Lots of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are identified in RU40, GRU40 and GRU40-MRP-FTA, respectively.</p><p id="p-1822" num="1772">19 VOCs including alkanes, aldehydes, ketones, esters, alcohols and acids were identified among RU40, GRU40 and GRU40-MRP-FTA (listed in Table 75-6). 16 of these are aroma substances.

Version 1.8). Compound identification was achieved based on mass spectra comparison with NIST 17. Compounds with forward and reverse matching degrees &#x2265;750 and a peak area percentages &#x2265;0.05% were selected for inclusion in (Tables 75-10 to 75-13). A series of n-alkanes (C8-C25) were injected separately to establish first-dimension retention indices (RI1). Experimental retention indices (RI) were calculated using the n-alkanes RI values and compared to literature values (NIST RI) for further confirmation. A blank run was also performed for background correction of the samples. Lots of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are identified in RU90, GRU90 and GRU90-MRA-FTA, respectively.</p><p id="p-1831" num="1777">3 VOCs including alkanes, aldehydes, ketones, esters, alcohols and acids were identified among RU90, GRU90 and GRU90-MRA-FTA (listed in Table 75-10).

Thereafter the treated samples are tasted at the use level to develop a means for describing the flavors (taste, smell, intensity). Then the &#x201c;trained&#x201d; tasters (4-5) independently blind-tasted the samples. The tasters were allowed to re-taste and take notes regarding the sensory attributes perceived. In the last step, the attributes noted were openly discussed to reach a consensus description. In cases where more than one taster disagreed with the compromise, the tasting was repeated.</p><p id="p-1927" num="1846">Triangle tests were performed according to the standard procedure (3-AFC test design) with 5 tasters.

bitterness, and metallic and/or synthetic aftertastes. Adding GSTE-MRPs, GSTC-MRPs improves the taste profile of <i>stevia </i>extracts or <i>stevia </i>glycosides in beverages. GSTE-MRPs, GSTC-MRPs can enhance the sweetness, harmonize sweetness/acidity perception, reduce acidity, and minimize the lingering, bitterness, metallic and synthetic aftertaste of <i>stevia </i>extracts and <i>stevia </i>glycosides. A <i>stevia </i>composition for use in such applications can comprise any of the <i>stevia </i>extracts and/or <i>stevia </i>glycosides described in the specification, including <i>stevia </i>glycosides selected from Reb A, Reb B, Reb C, Reb D, Reb E, Reb M, Reb N, Reb O, and Stevioside.</p><heading id="h-0106" level="1">Example 89.

improve their overall palatability as reflected in increased sweetness, enhanced flavor, and reduced sourness and/or unpleasant aftertaste. A consumable product may include GSTE-MRPs or GSTC-MRPs in a range from 5 ppm to 1,000 ppm, where total amount of rubusoside and glycosylated rubusoside can be in a range of 0.1 ppm to 600 ppm. Depending on the application, the added amount of GSTE-MRPs or GSTC-MRPs can be increased further, for instance, 1,500 ppm, 5,000 ppm, 10,000 ppm etc., and the corresponding amount of total rubusosides and glycosylated rubusosides can be increased proportionally.</p><heading id="h-0107" level="1">Example 90.

The prepared samples were transferred into a glass beaker filled with sand pre-heated for at least 30 minutes at the reaction temperature in a drying oven. After the planned reaction time, the vials were transferred into ice water.

under different reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and pH can create a variety of useful flavors, which can be used for consumables, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, pet foods etc. The types and ratios of reactants and reaction conditions can be varied and are not limited to these examples.</p><heading id="h-0111" level="1">Example 94.

This technology can be used to produce water-soluble essential oils and products in powder form. The flavor intensity of the products produced by this technology was significantly intensified. There was synergy between the flavor ingredient and carrier. This technology can be used for any type of oils or soluble ingredients. The resulting products, including the soluble flavor ingredients, can enhance the retronasal flavor when added to foods and beverages.</p><heading id="h-0143" level="1">Example 122.

It demonstrates that sweet tea extract, its glycosylated product or MRPs, <i>stevia </i>extract, its glycosylated product or MRPs can act as excellent carrier to flavor ingredient. The final product can be in powder or liquid form. This technology can be used to produce water-soluble or dispersible essential oil, and products in powder form. The flavor intensity of the products produced by this technology was significantly intensified. There was synergy between the flavor ingredient and carrier. This technology can be used for any type of oils or soluble ingredients. The resulting products, such as water soluble or dispersible flavor ingredients, can enhance the retro-nasal flavor when added into food and beverage. An embodiment of the present application comprises (1) one or more of GSG, GSG-MRPs, GST and GST-MRPs; and (2) one or more plant aroma concentrates selected from fruit aroma concentrate, berry aroma concentrate and vegetable aroma concentrate.</p><heading id="h-0176" level="1">Example 155.

Fruit flavoring (peach flavor, available from Givaudan China Ltd, Lot #: BJS003) was used to provide a peach flavor to the beverage. GSG-MRP-CA was obtained from EPC Lab, Lot #20200101.</p><p id="p-2776" num="2487">Preparation procedure: 14 g GSG was dissolved together with 1.5 g alanine and 4.5 g xylose in 120 mL deionized water. The mixtures were stirred and heated to about 95-100&#xb0; C. for about 2 hours. When the reaction was complete, the solutions were spray dried to provide about 95 g of an off white powder.</p><p id="p-2777" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00419" num="00419"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 161-1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Beverage compositions.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="77pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Base</entry><entry>157-06</entry><entry>157-07</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="140pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Ingredient</entry><entry>Concentration (ppm)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="28pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="56pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Erythritol</entry><entry>38000</entry><entry>38000</entry><entry>38000</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Steviol glycosides</entry><entry>200</entry><entry>200</entry><entry>200</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Citric acid</entry><entry>500</entry><entry>500</entry><entry>500</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Food flavoring</entry><entry>200</entry><entry>200</entry><entry>200</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>GSG-MRP-CA</entry><entry>150</entry><entry>150</entry><entry>150</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>NaHCO<sub>3</sub></entry><entry>300000</entry><entry>300000</entry><entry>300000</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>GRU90-MRP-FTA</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>100</entry><entry>100</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-2778" num="2488">Experiment: Each of the two samples were evaluated according to the sensory evaluation method in Ex. 5.

In addition, the peach flavor of the beverage is also improved with the addition of GRU90-MRP-FTAs (157-06 to 157-07 in Ex. 157). Thus, the overall likability of the peach-flavored beverage sweetened with natural sweeteners, including erythritol, steviol glycosides, etc. was improved. These results show that GRU90-MRP-FTA can improve the taste profile of beverages sweetened with polyols, steviol glycosides and other natural sweeteners.</p><heading id="h-0183" level="1">Example 162.

surprisingly show that the addition of pepper from e.g., <i>Piper longum </i>can significantly improve the taste profile of GSG-MRPs, GRU-MRPs such that little or no bitterness, lingering or spicy aftertaste is present even at a higher sucrose equivalent (SugarE). In particular, GSG-MRP-PLTA and GRU-MRP-PLTA were found to reduce the bitterness and lingering of GSG-MRP and GRU-MRPs. GRU90-MRP-PLTA is less sweet, but more spicy than GSG-MRP-PLTA. GSG-MRP-PLTA is more sweet, but less spicy than GRU90-MRP-PLTA.</p><heading id="h-0191" level="1">Example 170.
