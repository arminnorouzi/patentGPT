In order to configure resources to be shared, among the resources of the preconfigured resource pool, the base station may receive a measurement report on the entire pool or some resources of the pool (e.g., some subchannels) from the terminal.

The resource status information may indicate the amount of resource pool used by a mode 4 terminal that is configured to use the preconfigured resource pool. The base station may perform configuration such that a mode 3 terminal is capable of sharing and using the preconfigured resource pool according to the resource status information. In the case where the mode 3 terminal and the mode 4 terminal share the preconfigured resource pool, the preconfigured resource pool may be independently operated such that a predetermined portion of the resource pool is used for the mode 3 terminal and another predetermined portion thereof is used for the mode 4 terminal. The mode 3 terminal or the mode 4 terminal may refer to the resource status information when using the resources by dividing the same. With regard to the resource status information, the base station may transmit resource status measurement and report configuration information to the mode 3 terminal or the mode 4 terminal, and may receive a resource status measurement report from the terminal. According to the first scenario, the resource status measurement and reporting may be applied to the whole of the preconfigured resource pool, a partial resource area divided for mode 3 (a subchannel), and a partial resource area divided for mode 4 (e.g., a subchannel). The base station may adjust the ratio of division of the resource area for mode 3 and the resource area for mode 4 in consideration of measurement reports (e.g., measurement reports reported as CRs or CBRs) of the resource areas for the respective modes (e.g., subchannels). According to this, it is possible to adaptively adjust congestion of the mode 3 terminal and the mode 4 terminal sharing the same pool. Although it has been described in the example of the first scenario that the resources are continuously divided and operated for mode 3 and mode 4, the resources for mode 3 and mode 4 may be discontinuously divided and operated in the same pool. A separate resource ID and a measurement ID may be operated for each of the resources for mode 3 and mode 4, and the terminal may perform measurement reporting on the resource using the resource ID and the measurement ID.</p><p id="p-0474" num="0473">The preconfigured resource pool may be shared for a predetermined time. The base station may receive a measurement report to set the time during which the preconfigured resource pool resources are shared. For example, the measurement reporting information may include a CR (channel occupancy ratio) or a CBR (channel busy ratio) of the resource.</p><p id="p-0475" num="0474"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>B</figref> illustrates an example of sharing a preconfigured resource pool according to various embodiments of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0476" num="0475">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>B</figref>, in order to allow a mode 3 terminal or a mode 4 terminal to share and use a preconfigured resource pool in a second scenario, the base station may refer to resource status information on the resource pool. The resource status information may indicate the amount of resource pool used by a mode 4 terminal that is configured to use the preconfigured resource pool. The base station may perform configuration such that a mode 3 terminal is capable of sharing and using the preconfigured resource pool according to the resource status information. In the case where the mode 3 terminal and the mode 4 terminal share the preconfigured resource pool, the preconfigured resource pool may be independently operated such that a predetermined portion of the resource pool is used for the mode 3 terminal and another predetermined portion thereof is used for the mode 4 terminal.</p><p id="p-0477" num="0476">The resource status information on the resource pool may be determined through an operation in which the terminal reports usage status of the resources (for example, it may be represented as a CR or a CBR), based on resource configuration and measurement report configuration information indicated by the base station. Based on the resource status information on the resource pool, the base station may determine sharing of the preconfigured resource pool for mode 3 and mode 4, and a resource ratio for each mode. In the second scenario, it is assumed that reporting on the resource status is performed in units of preconfigured resource pools. The base station may recognize resource status information on the pool, but it is difficult for the base station to recognize resource status information on the resource area (e.g., a subchannel) that is used for mode 3 or mode 4. In order to recognize the status of mode 4 configured to use the preconfigured resource pool, the pool may be operated separately for a resource sharing time and a resource non-sharing time. That is, if it is determined that the pool is not congested for the resource non-sharing time as a result of measurement by the terminal, the base station may operate the resource area for mode 3 by extending the same. If it is determined that the pool is congested for the resource non-sharing time as a result of measurement by the terminal, the base station may reduce the resource area for mode 3, or may stop sharing resources. When the pool is used as shared resources, the resource sharing time and the resource non-sharing time may be periodically operated, which may be indicated by the base station. In order to operate measurement report in the second scenario, the resource area for mode 3 or the resource area for mode 4 does not need to be distinguished by separate IDs, and may be operated based on the pool ID. Although it has been described in the example of the second scenario that the resources are continuously divided and operated for mode 3 and mode 4, the resources for mode 3 and mode 4 may be discontinuously divided and operated in the same pool.</p><p id="p-0478" num="0477">Although the preconfigured resource pool has been described in the above embodiment, the embodiment may be applied to the case in which a normal pool for mode 3 or a normal pool for mode 4 is used as a shared resource pool.</p><p id="p-0479" num="0478"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> illustrates signal exchange for measuring resources in a resource pool and reporting the same for sharing resources according to various embodiments of the disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> illustrates signal exchange between a terminal <b>120</b> and a base station <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0480" num="0479">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, in step <b>2401</b>, the base station may transmit measurement configuration information on a resource pool to the terminal.
