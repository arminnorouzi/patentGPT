Patients displaying DGF lack acceptable autonomous kidney function and require renal replacement therapy in the first week after transplant. Most transplant centers report a DGF rate of 20 to 50% (Boom H, Mallat M J, de Fijter J W, Zwinderman A H, Paul L C. Delayed graft function influences renal function but not survival. Transplant Proc. 2001; 33(1-2):1291). Kidneys that manifest DGF have a higher frequency of adverse outcomes, including decreased graft function, decreased graft survival, and result in increased patient mortality. Additionally, the duration of DGF is an important prognostic factor for graft survival, and studies have reported that prolonged DGF (&#x3e;6 days) has a deleterious effect on graft survival and that DGF is the single most important determinant of 1 year graft survival (Giral-Classe M, Hourmant M, Cantarovich D, et al. Delayed graft function of more than six days strongly decreases long-term survival of transplanted kidneys. Kidney Int. 1998; 54(3):972-978). Though there are currently no approved therapies for treating DGF, current strategies for managing DGF include supporting patients with dialysis and monitoring for rejection with serial biopsies, typically while patients continue to be administered drugs such as calcineurin inhibitors (CNI), corticosteroids, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF; an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor). As a result, DGF increases transplant-associated costs because of longer hospital stays, more frequent out-patient clinic visits, increased imaging, increased invasive procedures including inpatient and outpatient dialysis, and pharmacologic therapies. Moreover, if a patient experiences graft failure (e.g., related to DGF), the patient must begin dialysis again, restarting the adverse health and economic cycles.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure provides certain technologies for improved treatment of delayed graft function (DGF).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides methods of treating (e.g., lessening the severity of, such as by delaying onset and/or reducing degree and/or frequency of one or more features of) DGF, which methods may comprise, for example administering a small molecule mimetic of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF, also known as scatter factor (SF)). HGF/SF is a pleiotropic growth factor that stimulates cell growth, cell motility, morphogenesis, and angiogenesis. Certain small molecule mimetics of HGF/SF have been shown to be useful for treating or lessening severity of a variety of diseases, disorders, and conditions.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure provides methods of improving renal function in a subject or a population of subjects who have undergone renal transplantation and/or are at risk of DGF. The present disclosure encompasses the recognition that particular modes of administering an HGF/SF mimetic achieve certain desirable outcomes across a population of subjects at risk of DGF. For example, the present disclosure demonstrates that administration of an HGF/SF mimic to a relevant population according to particular regimen(s) can achieve certain treatment effects across that population. In some embodiments, such population may be or comprise subjects who have undergone renal transplantation with a cadaveric kidney (e.g., a kidney from a donor after cardiac death or a kidney from a donor after brain death).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In particular, among other things, the present disclosure provides an insight that provided methods can achieve greater long-term success for kidney transplants (e.g., after 6 months or 12 months) in subjects receiving an HGF/SF mimetic. Thus, the present disclosure encompasses the recognition that administration of HGF/SF mimetics shortly after renal transplantation (e.g., within about 36 hours or within about 30 hours) can provide significant long-term benefits for the health and quality of life for subjects receiving provided therapies.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure also provides the insight that provided methods demonstrate durability of particular effects (e.g., of better renal function after transplantation) in subjects receiving an HGF/SF mimetic. For example, in some embodiments, increased renal function, as measured by, e.g., increased estimated glomerular filtration rate and/or decreased serum creatinine concentration, is maintained for at least 28 days, at least 6 months, or at least 12 months after renal transplantation. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, subjects with an estimated glomerular filtration rate after at least 28 days, at least 6 months, or at least 12 months that achieves a lower chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage on the National Kidney Foundation's predictive CKD scale are expected to have increased life expectancies, compared to those with a higher CKD stage.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure also provides insight that, in some embodiments, Compound 1 may be administered to a subject or population of subjects in need thereof, regardless of the subject's malignancy status (e.g., current malignancy status and/or history of malignancy).</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows the disposition of subjects in the human clinical trial of Example 1.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows Kaplan-Meier curves for time to production of &#x2265;1200 cc urine over 24 h by study arm.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows mean total daily urine output (in cc) from post-transplant Day 1 to Day 14 by study arm.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows least squares mean change from baseline (Day 1) in total daily urine output (in cc) from post-transplant Day 2 to Day 14 by study arm.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows least squares mean serum creatinine (mg/dL) over time by study arm.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows mean 24-hour urine creatinine clearance (mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) over time by study arm.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows serum c-reactive protein (CRP) (mg/dL) by study arm at Day 1 and Day 3 post-transplant.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows mean neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) (ng/mL) by study arm at Day 1 and Day 3 post-transplant.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows the time to first dialysis session in the first 7 days post-transplant by study arm.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows the cumulative number of dialysis sessions through Day 28 by treatment group.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows the length of transplant hospitalization (in days) per subject by treatment arm.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows least squares mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) by study arm at screening, Day 3, Day 7, Day 14, Day 28, Month 6 and Month 12.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows the duration of dialysis through Day 28 by treatment arm.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> shows incidence of graft failure over time by study arm.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> shows mean eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) by study arm at screening, Day 3, Day 7, Day 14, Day 28, Month 6 and Month 12, overlaid with the National Kidney Foundation's predictive CKD stages.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>A</figref> shows percent survival of Compound 1 treatment group vs vehicle treatment group in a first study of an orthotopic glioma model.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>B</figref> shows percent survival of Compound 1 treatment group vs vehicle treatment group in a second study of an orthotopic glioma model.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>A</figref> shows colon tumor size of Compound 1 treatment group vs vehicle treatment group in a human colon tumor xenograft model.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>B</figref> shows colon tumor weight of Compound 1 treatment group vs vehicle treatment group in a human colon tumor xenograft model.

DGF is a severe form of acute kidney injury (AKI) resulting from ischemia-reperfusion injury (caused by oxygen deprivation and reintroduction) following kidney transplantation and defined as the need for dialysis within seven days following transplantation. It is distinct from transplant rejection and is most commonly seen in recipients of deceased-donor kidneys, in part due to the longer periods of warm ischemia (ischemia occurring at body temperature) and cold ischemia (ischemia occurring during kidney preservation and transport) typical for deceased-donor kidney transplants. DGF is most commonly defined as the need for dialysis (i.e., the extracorporeal removal of waste products from the blood when the kidneys are in a state of failure) within seven days following transplantation. In the United States, 70% of the 23,000 kidney transplant procedures performed annually use deceased-donor kidneys, and nearly one-third of these transplant recipients, or more than 5,000 patients per year, are diagnosed with DGF. DGF has a very high clinical and economic burden, and there are no approved therapies.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0126">One of the challenges with DGF stems from the timing of the injury to the kidney, which can occur before the transplantation surgery. For example, in donors who die suddenly (e.g., cardiac death) or who have brain death, the kidney injury occurs when blood flow to the kidney is reduced or stopped, which occurs at or before the time of organ recovery. From that point, the lack of oxygen and nutrients continues to damage the donor kidney until the point at which it is successfully implanted into a recipient, which often takes place between 12 and 24 hours later. After the kidney is transplanted, it undergoes further damage as a result of reperfusion injury caused by the formation of free radicals as oxygen flow returns to the oxygen-starved organ. This combination of damage and its timing makes it difficult for interventions that only block damage pathways, for instance by targeting inflammatory pathways, to work effectively to improve kidney function and reduce the severity of DGF.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0127">Certain key metrics, including urine output and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), can be indicative of how a transplanted kidney is performing. Adverse readings in these key metrics can be indicative of kidney damage and more severe forms of DGF, and can be predictive of longer-term negative outcomes, such as reduced survival of the transplanted kidney and increased patient morbidity and mortality (Schnuelle, P. et al. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant (2007) 22:235-45). For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref> shows that the lowest two quintiles of patients (solid lines) with the worst urine output within 24 hours after a kidney transplantation have a significantly decreased chance of their new kidney surviving for five years compared to the highest quintile (dashed line). See Schnuelle, P. et al. 2007. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref> shows that patients with the highest eGFR at discharge (small dotted line) have better cumulative kidney transplant survival than patients with lower eGFR at discharge (large dotted and solid lines) (based on data reported in Schnuelle, P. et al. 2007). Regardless of the specific measurement used, the occurrence of more severe DGF is associated with an approximate 50% reduction in median graft survival time, from approximately ten years for patients with less severe DGF to approximately five years for patients who experienced more severe DGF. See Schnuelle, P. et al. 2007. Thus, there is a need for therapies for treating (e.g., reducing severity of) DGF.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0128">In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides methods of administering to a subject or population of subjects who have undergone renal transplantation and are at risk of DGF a composition providing Compound 1, according to a regimen established to achieve one or more desirable outcomes. In some embodiments, the regimen is or has been established to achieve one or more desirable outcomes, relative to that observed for a comparable reference population that has not received Compound 1 (e.g., that has received a reference composition which does not deliver Compound 1).</p><p id="p-0094" num="0129">In some embodiments, certain parameters may be evaluated to determine if a desirable outcome is achieved. For example, in some embodiments, certain measures of kidney function, such as serum creatinine (SCr) and/or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) can be obtained from a subject's blood sample; in some embodiments, such measures can be used to assess if renal function is improving after kidney transplantation. eGFR can be calculated from SCr using, e.g., the MDRD or MDRD4 formula, or the CKD-EPI formula. In some embodiments, eGFR is calculated from SCr using the MDRD or MDRD4 formula. In some embodiments, eGFR is calculated from SCr using the CKD-EPI formula. See Chen, Y.-W., et al. World J. Gastroenterol. 2011 Oct. 28; 17(40):4532-4538. Additionally or alternatively, other indications of kidney function may be evaluated, including urine output, number of dialysis sessions, duration of dialysis, length of hospitalization, and/or incidence of graft failure. Any one or more of parameters such as these may, in some embodiments, be useful for determining short-term and/or long-term efficacy of Compound 1 after renal transplantation.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0130">In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides a method comprising:<ul id="ul0021" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0021-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0022" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0022-0001" num="0131">administering to a subject or population of subjects who have undergone renal transplantation and are at risk of delayed graft function</li>        <li id="ul0022-0002" num="0132">a composition providing Compound 1</li>        <li id="ul0022-0003" num="0133">according to a regimen established to achieve one or more of:        <ul id="ul0023" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0023-0001" num="0134">(i) a greater mean estimated glomerular filtration rate at about 7 days, about 14 days, about 28 days, about 6 months or about 12 months after renal transplantation;

Among other things, HGF/SF is known to stimulate c-MET (e.g., in injured organ tissues), which leads to activation of various cellular pathways, including, e.g., those involved in tissue repair. In addition, it is suspected that uncontrolled activation of c-MET can initiate tumorigenesis and/or stimulate tumor growth. As described above, Compound 1 is a HGF/SF mimetic, and as such, without wishing to be bound by theory, administration of Compound 1 under certain conditions might be expected to promote initiation or growth of cancer and/or other malignancies. Yet, experiments described herein (e.g., Example 5) demonstrate that, surprisingly, this may not be the case when Compound 1 is administered according to methods provided herein. Accordingly, the present disclosure encompasses the recognition that Compound 1 can be administered to a subject or population of subjects in need thereof, regardless of the subject's malignancy status.

Initial infusion occurred within 36 h of renal transplant (Day 1), with two subsequent infusions at 24 (&#xb1;2) h intervals. An initial cohort of subjects was infused over 10 to 12 minutes. Based upon site feedback, the protocol was amended and the remaining subjects were infused over 30 min.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0339">Subjects were monitored during initial hospitalization, with subsequent clinical visits on Days 7, 14, and 28. Subjects were contacted by phone on Days 5, 6, and 8 to 13. Following completion of the study on Day 28, long-term data on graft survival and renal function were collected approximately 6 and 12 months after renal transplantation.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0340">During a subject's stay in the hospital (Days 1 to 3 and, if applicable, Day 4), blood samples were collected for determination of immunosuppressant levels and for pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses of Compound 1 and its metabolites. The subject's renal output over 24 h was assessed daily for 14 days after first study drug infusion and again on Day 28. Other assessments included standard safety measures, blood and urine biomarkers of renal function, and 24 h urine creatinine clearance.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">Selection of Study Population</heading><p id="p-0193" num="0341">Subjects were assessed for eligibility according to the following criteria:<ul id="ul0044" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0044-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0045" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0045-0001" num="0342">1.

The first infusion was administered within 36 h after transplant, with two subsequent infusions at 24&#xb1;2 h intervals. An initial cohort of subjects was infused over 10 to 12 min. Based upon site feedback, the protocol was amended and the remaining subjects were infused over 30 min. The volume of infusion was controlled by the infusion pump, based upon the subject's baseline weight (0.33 mL/kg) with a maximum infusion of 40 mL. Placebo was normal saline (United States Pharmacopeia [USP]) administered at the same intervals and volumes (0.33 mL/kg).</p><p id="p-0197" num="0375">Eligible subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive either 2 mg/kg Compound 1 or placebo. Sites were provided a set of ordered envelopes with treatment assignment and the pharmacist prepared either active treatment or placebo based upon the ordered card. Subject enrollment was initially stratified by source of donor kidney: 1) without history of diabetes mellitus or hypertension, and 2) with history of diabetes mellitus and/or hypertension. This stratification was subsequently removed.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0376">The dose regimen used in this study (2 mg/kg Compound 1) was selected based on data from nonclinical efficacy studies, as well as clinical studies assessing PK and safety in healthy volunteers and renal failure patients on hemodialysis. Preclinical studies determined that c-Met receptor upregulation occurs within 6 to 48 h following renal injury, and that Compound 1 administration within 24 h following renal ischemia injury improves renal outcome and attenuates mortality at doses up to 2 mg/kg. A dose escalation study in healthy volunteers, and a PK and safety study in patients on and off dialysis, confirmed 2 mg/kg as the optimal dose. Animal studies showed that repeat administration of Compound 1 was associated with improved renal outcomes. In a Phase 1 study of healthy subjects and a clinical study in subjects with renal failure on and off hemodialysis, IV infusions of Compound 1 were well tolerated at doses up to 6 mg/kg, the maximal practical dose.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="2">Other Medications</heading><p id="p-0199" num="0377">All concomitant medications, including dose, were recorded at study entry. Use of new concomitant medications or changes in dose of concomitant medications were recorded until the final study visit. The dose and dosing regimen of all prescriptions and non-prescription therapies and medications were documented.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0378">Subjects could receive concomitant immunosuppressive regimens used as part of standard-of-care by the clinical center. Based upon the known metabolism, serum levels of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and sirolimus were not expected to be affected by co-administration of study drug. Serum concentrations of immunosuppressants other than MPA were assayed on Days 1 to 4, prior to the morning or evening dose of immunosuppressant and prior to daily dosing of Compound 1. Both Compound 1 and MPA (the active metabolite of MMF) are metabolized by glucuronidation and the potential for drug-drug interaction has not been determined. For the trough concentration assay, blood samples were drawn within 1 h prior to the morning or evening dose of MMF/other immunosuppressant on Day 1, and 1 h prior to the morning dose of MMF/other immunosuppressant on Days 2 to 4.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0379">Based on in vitro data, Compound 1 was considered both a substrate and an inhibitor of CYP1A2. Drugs utilizing the CYP1A2 enzyme were avoided, if possible, on days that study drug was administered and for the 24 h period after the last infusion. Caffeine intake (e.g., tea, coffee, and caffeine-containing drinks) was prohibited within 3 h before and up to 3 h after infusion. In addition, potent CYP1A2 inhibitors ciprofloxacin and fluvoxamine were prohibited during treatment and up to 24 h following the last infusion of study drug.</p><heading id="h-0018" level="2">Efficacy Variables</heading><p id="p-0202" num="0380">The primary efficacy variable was time (in days) until production of &#x2265;1200 cc of urine over a 24 h period.

Following discharge, subjects recorded their total urine output in a diary each day through Day 14, and again on Day 28. The total urine output was recorded daily and obtained from the subject either by phone or through a scheduled study visit.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0397">24-hour Urine Collection for Creatinine Clearance: Four 24-h urine samples were collected to measure creatinine clearance on Days 3, 7, 14, and 28. The subjects were provided handouts on 24 h urine collections and instructed to collect their urine for a 24 h period before the scheduled visits on Days 3, 7, 14, and 28. The 24-h urine samples were tested for sodium, potassium, chloride, and creatinine. Day 3 was selected as the first time point following transplantation to collect urine for creatinine clearance, since subjects in the study were likely to have unstable SCr at earlier time points due to acute renal injury post-transplantation. If the SCr levels remained unstable at the time of urine collection, clearance was estimated by averaging the SCr at the start and at the end of the collection.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0398">Urine Analysis: A urine sample was collected on Days 14 and 28 to assess for signs of persistent inflammation in the urinary tract. Subjects with recent transplantation may have active sediments and variable findings on microscopic analysis. Subjects with inflammatory findings on urine analysis such as the presence of leukocyte esterase, &#x2265;2-5 white blood cells (WBCs) per high power field, or leukocyte casts were evaluated for causes, such as infection. In subjects with new or increased findings of inflammation on Day 28, a follow-up urine analysis was performed within seven to ten days after the Day 28 evaluation.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0399">Biomarkers: Inflammatory (C-reactive protein; CRP) and renal function (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin; NGAL) serum assays were performs. One 5 mL sample of blood was collected using heparin as an anticoagulant on Days 1 (pre-dose), 2 (pre-dose), 3 (pre-dose), 4 (if subject remained in hospital), 7, 14, and 28. Urine samples (10 mL each) were collected in the morning on the same days. The total volume and time of collection were recorded for each sample.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0400">Rejection Episodes: On each study day, the investigator recorded any episodes of acute rejection, including how they were identified, documented, and treated.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0401">Dialysis: On Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14 and 28, the investigator recorded whether a patient received dialysis. Data were retrospectively collected on all dialysis sessions that occurred during the first 28 days.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0402">Graft Survival and Renal Function: Approximately 6 and 12 months after the kidney transplant, the clinical site assessed subjects for graft survival and renal function. eGFR was derived from SCr for all timepoints using the MDRD4 formula. (See Levey, A. S., et al. Ann. Intern. Med. 2006; 145:247-54.)</p><p id="p-0212" num="0403">Adverse Events: An AE was any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome, or disease which either occurred during the study (if absent at baseline), or appeared to worsen (if present at baseline). The investigator monitored subjects for the occurrence of AEs throughout their participation in the study. All AEs, regardless of seriousness or relationship to study drug, including those occurring during the screening period (where applicable), were recorded. Whenever possible, symptoms were grouped as a single syndrome or diagnosis. The investigator was to specify the date of onset, maximal intensity, corrective therapy given, outcome, and their opinion regarding if there was a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by the study drug. The causal relationship of an AE to the study drug was the best estimate of the investigator at the time of reporting. AEs were graded as mild, moderate, or severe based on the intensity of symptoms and the degree of limitation of usual daily activities.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0404">Clinical Laboratory Assessments: Samples of venous blood were collected for the measurement of hematology and chemistry parameters at Screening and Days 2, 3, 4, 7, 14, and 28. Hematology parameters included hematocrit, hemoglobin, total leukocyte count, differential blood count (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils), and platelet count. Chemistry parameters included glucose, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, albumin, AST, ALT, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and total and direct bilirubin. Venous blood was drawn at Screening from female subjects of childbearing potential for pregnancy testing if results prior to transplantation were not available. Laboratory results were also evaluated by the investigator to determine if any abnormal results were clinically significant for an individual and were considered an AE.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0405">MPA and Immunosuppressant Drug Levels: Samples of venous blood were collected daily on Days 1 to 4 for the analysis of levels of MPA (in subjects receiving the immunosuppressant MMF) and other immunosuppressants (cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or sirolimus; unless the subject had been discharged from the hospital before Day 4). The blood samples were drawn within 1 h prior to the morning or evening dose of MMF/other immunosuppressant on Day 1, and 1 h prior to the morning dose of MMF/other immunosuppressant on Days 2 to 4. The time of blood sampling, the time of administration of the previous MMF or immunosuppressant dose, and the previous MMF or immunosuppressant dose level were recorded in source documents and in the case report form (CRF).</p><heading id="h-0019" level="2">Disposition of Subjects</heading><p id="p-0215" num="0406"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows the disposition of subjects. Twenty-nine subjects were screened and consented to participate in the study. One subject was judged by their physician to be too medically fragile to participate and was withdrawn from participation before randomization. The remaining 28 subjects were randomized: 19 to Compound 1 and 9 to placebo. Of the 28 subjects randomized, one subject in the placebo arm withdrew consent after the second infusion and did not complete the study. Withdrawal occurred after a moderate left bundle branch block, assessed as unrelated to the study product. All other subjects completed the study. The mean&#xb1;SD duration of the study across subjects was 29.0&#xb1;7.79 days (range: 4 to 50 days).</p><p id="p-0216" num="0407">Seven subjects were retrospectively identified as not meeting all eligibility criteria, but received study drug and subsequently completed the study. Three subjects in the Compound 1 arm received their initial infusions more than 28 h after transplantation: at 29 h 14 min; 29 h 14 min; 30 h 20 min. One subject in the placebo arm received the first infusion within the prescribed 36 h window (35 h 35 min), but there was a note in the subject record stating that the initial infusion time was extended from 36 h to 38 h.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0408">One subject in the Compound 1 arm was identified as having low urine output that a physician determined may have been due to structural issues associated with subsequent, non-kidney-related surgery. One subject in each study arm was discovered to have a history of prostate cancer, 3 years (Compound 1 arm) and 18 years (placebo arm) before enrollment. One subject in the placebo arm received a donor kidney with terminal creatinine &#x2264;2.2 mg/dL.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0409">There were 12 deviations from the planned dosing regimen. In the Compound 1 arm, there were six dosing deviations in four subjects. One subject failed to receive an infusion on Day 2 due to issues with dialysis that resulted in arm pain. One subject had Day 3 infusion delayed outside the 24-hour window. One subject had Day 3 infusion stopped and restarted. One subject had reduced infusion time on Day 3, while one subject had increased infusion times on Days 1 and 3. In the placebo arm, there were five dosing deviations in three subjects.

Two subjects (22%) in the placebo arm experienced graft failure within the first 12 months after transplant vs no subjects in the Compound 1 arm (&#x3c7;=4.66, P=0.03). Because there were no events in the Compound 1 arm, a hazard ratio could not be calculated. There was a discrepancy in the date of graft failure for one subject. At the 6-month visit, the subject reported that graft failure had already occurred and eGFR was not reported for this subject at 6 months. However, the investigator noted graft failure as an AE at 8 months, when the subject was hospitalized. For the purpose of this analysis, the more conservative 8-month hospitalization date reported by the investigator was used.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0434">Adverse Events (AE): There were no deaths nor discontinuations of study drug due to adverse events. While the percent of subjects experiencing an AE was nearly equivalent across study arms, the number of AEs per subject was twice as high in the placebo arm than in the Compound 1 arm. In the Compound 1 arm, there was a total of 99 AEs reported in 17 (89.5%) subjects, an average of 5.8 events per subject. In the placebo arm, there was a total of 89 AEs reported in 8 (88.9%) subjects, an average of 11.1 events per subject.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0435">Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) followed a similar pattern: while a slightly lower percent of subjects in the Compound 1 group experienced a TEAE, the number of events per subject was twice as high in the placebo group. In the Compound 1 arm, 83 TEAEs were reported in 15 (78.9%) subjects, an average of 5.5 TEAEs per subject (Table 9). Six of these TEAEs were assessed by the investigator as related to study drug. In the placebo arm, 78 TEAEs were reported in 8 (88.9%) subjects, an average of 9.8 TEAEs per subject (Table 9). None of the TEAEs in the placebo arm were assessed by the investigator as related to study drug. The majority of TEAEs were rated as mild: 72.3% in the Compound 1 arm, 78.2% in the placebo arm. However, there were 11 TEAEs in the Compound 1 arm rated as severe, vs 1 in the placebo arm. In 7 of the 12 system organ classes (SOCs) with TEAEs in &#x3e;5% of subjects, the event rate in the placebo arm exceeded that in the Compound 1 arm by &#x3e;10%. This was largely driven by higher dyspnoea and oedema in the placebo arm. In the one SOC in which the event rate in the Compound 1 arm exceeded the placebo arm (renal and urinary disorders), the difference was due to higher nocturia in the Compound 1 arm.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0436">Serious adverse events (SAEs) followed a similar pattern (note: all SAEs were treatment emergent; Table 9). In the Compound 1 arm, 8 (42.1%) subjects reported a total of 16 TESAEs, an average of 2.0 TESAEs per subject. In the placebo arm, 4 (44.4%) subjects reported 17 TESAEs, an average of 4.3 TESAEs per subject. None of the TESAEs in either study arm were assessed by the investigator as related to study drug. The most common SOC for TESAEs was renal and urinary disorders, which included 2 incidents of acute renal failure in the placebo group. There was a pronounced difference in when TESAEs occurred. In the Compound 1 arm, 75% of TESAEs occurred &#x2264;28 days after treatment. In the placebo arm, 76% of TESAEs occurred &#x3e;28 days after treatment.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0437">An overview of all AEs is shown in Table 9:</p><p id="p-0255" num="0000"><tables

who have undergone kidney transplantation and shown signs and symptoms of significant renal injury immediately post-transplantation. In the short-term, initial oliguria (&#x3c;50 cc urine per hour for 8 consecutive hours post-transplant) was more likely to resolve in the Compound 1 arm in the 28 days post-transplant (Compound 1=78.9%; Placebo=44.4%), and resolved more quickly (Compound 1=5 days; placebo=14 days). Consistent with this result, over the first 14 days after transplant, daily urine output was higher, and increased more over baseline, in the Compound 1 arm.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0439">Serologic results also showed a short-term efficacy signal in favor of Compound 1. While SCr was higher in the Compound 1 arm at baseline and Day 3, it was lower than placebo from on Days 7, 14 and 28. Adjusting SCr by gender, race and age to derive estimated glomerular filtration rate, the Compound 1 arm showed better eGFR at Days 14 and 28. CRP, a measure of inflammation, decreased in both study arms, but was higher in the Compound 1 arm at baseline and lower in the Compound 1 arm at Day 3 (68.6% reduction for Compound 1; 17.5% reduction for placebo). NGAL, a measure of kidney tissue damage, was higher in the Compound 1 arm at baseline, then decreased to a level similar to placebo at Day 3 (43.5% reduction). There was little change in the placebo arm (&#x2212;12.5%).</p><p id="p-0258" num="0440">There were also differences in clinical treatment indicating in favor of Compound 1. While the percentage of patients requiring dialysis in the first week, and number of dialysis sessions in the first 28 days did not differ between groups, duration of dialysis was 2.2 days shorter in the Compound 1 arm. Hospitalization for transplant was 3.8 days shorter in the Compound 1 arm.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0441">There was a signal in favor of Compound 1 on both long-term outcome measures. eGFR was 11 to 13 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2 </sup>higher in the Compound 1 arm at 6 and 12 months. At one year, there were more graft failures in the placebo arm (n=2; 22%) than the Compound 1 arm (n=0; 0%).</p><p id="p-0260" num="0442">Overall, urologic, serologic and clinical treatment measures manifested a pattern in which patients in the Compound 1 arm showed improved kidney function when compared to placebo.</p><heading id="h-0023" level="1">Example 2.

Similarly, a 9.1 year increase in life expectancy, on average, is projected for a 50-year-old female moving from CKD Stage 3B disease to CKD Stage 3A disease. (Turin, T. C., et al.

Primary non-function (PNF) is defined as continuous dialysis dependency for at least 60 days post-transplant.

Months 2-12 hospitalizations and costs were based on results from peer-reviewed literature and applied to the phase 2 data (Butala 2013; USRDS Annual Data Report 2018; USRDS Annual Data Report 2013; Kim D W, et al., Clin Transplant. 2020 Jun. 23:e14022. doi: 10.1111/ctr.14022; Keong, F. M., et al., Kidney Int. Reports. 2016; 1(4):269-278). Costs were generated via a Premier Hospital Database analysis and the 2018 United States Renal Data System (USRDS) annual data report. Costs for 2017 were inflated to 2018 dollars and adjusted by 58% to reflect Medicare costs (from USRDS) vs. IDN per USRDS Annual Data Report 2013. The cost of Compound 1 was unknown and therefore was not included in this analysis.</p><p id="p-0342" num="0565">The results of the analysis are summarized in Table 11.</p><p id="p-0343" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00014" num="00014"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="175pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" rowsep="1">TABLE 11</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Placebo</entry><entry>Compound 1</entry></row><row><entry>Model Inputs and Data Sources</entry><entry>Arm</entry><entry>Arm</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>MONTH 1</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Transplant hospitalization length of stay, mean, days (Phase </entry><entry>11.4</entry><entry>7.6</entry></row><row><entry>2 trial results)</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Transplant hospitalization cost, mean (Kim 2020)</entry><entry>$118,534</entry><entry>$106,296</entry></row><row><entry>MONTHS 2-6</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>6-month eGFR, mean, mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2 </sup>(Phase 2 trial </entry><entry>39.5</entry><entry>47.5</entry></row><row><entry>results)</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Readmissions, mean (Keong 2016)</entry><entry>40%</entry><entry>&#x2002;&#x2009;30%</entry></row><row><entry>Readmission costs, mean (Kim 2020)</entry><entry>&#x2003;$7,748</entry><entry>&#x2003;$7,748</entry></row><row><entry>MONTHS 7-12</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Graft Failures</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Graft failure rate at 1 year (Phase 2 trial results)</entry><entry>1/9 (22.2%)</entry><entry>&#x2009;0/19 (0.0%)</entry></row><row><entry>Imputed graft failure rate, Compound 1 (Butala 2013)</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>5.58%</entry></row><row><entry>Graft failure cost, mean (USRDS, 2013 &#x26; 2018)</entry><entry>$162,482</entry><entry>$162,482</entry></row><row><entry>Non-Graft Failures</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Non-graft failure rate at 1 year (Phase 2 trial results)</entry><entry>8/9 (77.8%)</entry><entry>19/19 (100%)</entry></row><row><entry>Imputed non-graft failure rate, Compound 1 (Butala 2013)</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>94.4%</entry></row><row><entry>Rehospitalizations, mean (Keong 2016)*</entry><entry>0.18</entry><entry>0.16</entry></row><row><entry>Rehospitalization cost, mean (Kim 2020)</entry><entry>&#x2003;$7,748</entry><entry>&#x2003;$7,748</entry></row><row><entry>Results</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Initial transplant hospitalization</entry><entry>$118,535</entry><entry>$106,296</entry></row><row><entry>Readmissions, months 2-6</entry><entry>&#x2003;$3,099</entry><entry>&#x2003;$2,324</entry></row><row><entry>Graft failure costs, months 7-12</entry><entry>&#x2002;$32,972</entry><entry>&#x2003;$6,739</entry></row><row><entry>Non-graft failure costs, months 7-12</entry><entry>&#x2003;$1,059</entry><entry>&#x2003;$1,144</entry></row><row><entry>TOTAL COSTS</entry><entry>$155,665</entry><entry>$116,504</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="left" id="FOO-00015">*Rehospitalization rates from 7-18 months were adjusted to reflect 7-12 months to fit the model time horizon.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0344" num="0566">Initial hospitalization (A $12,239), readmissions (A $775), and graft failure costs (A $26,233) were higher in the placebo arm of the model. Non-graft failure 7-12 month hospitalization costs were slightly higher in the Compound 1 arm (A $85), due to the fact that fewer patients experienced graft failure. The total calculated, per-patient, cost offset associated with Compound 1 in the first year after transplantation was $39,162.</p><p id="p-0345" num="0567">On an annual basis, treatment with Compound 1 may prevent graft failures and lower total costs. Limitations of the model include a conservative under-estimation of the clinical impact of Compound 1, a one-year time horizon, and no explicit consideration for treatment-emergent adverse events or health-related quality of life. Additionally, from months 0-6, only hospitalization costs were included in this model. Outpatient dialysis and pharmacy costs were not included for either patient group. Therefore, this analysis looks only at cost offset due to hospitalizations and graft failure costs. Yet, even so, potential cost-savings of $39,162 demonstrate economic benefits of Compound 1 therapy in these patients.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00001" cdx-file="US20230000828A1-20230105-C00001.CDX" mol-file="US20230000828A1-20230105-C00001.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00002" cdx-file="US20230000828A1-20230105-C00002.CDX" mol-file="US20230000828A1-20230105-C00002.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00003" cdx-file="US20230000828A1-20230105-C00003.CDX" mol-file="US20230000828A1-20230105-C00003.MOL"/><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
