id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0002" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention is in the fields of mechanical engineering and construction, especially mechanical construction, for example automotive engineering, aircraft construction, railcar construction, shipbuilding, machine construction, building industry, toy construction, etc. It more particularly relates to processes of fastening objects to each other.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In the automotive, aviation and other industries, there has been a tendency to move away from steel constructions and to use lightweight material such as fiber composites, especially carbon fiber reinforced polymers, instead.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">While fiber composite parts may, given a sufficiently high fiber content and average fiber length and given an appropriate fiber orientation, be manufactured to have considerable mechanical strength, the mechanical fastening of a further object, such as a connector (dowel or similar) thereto is a challenge. Conventional riveting techniques are suitable only to a limited extent, especially due to the small ductility of the fiber composite materials. Also, since such connections require pre-drilling at the position where the further object is to be attached, precision of the positioning may be an issue, especially if several parts that are connected to each other are to be attached to the fiber composite part. Adhesive connections may work well but suffer from the drawback that the strength of a bond cannot be larger than the strength of an outermost layer and of its attachment to the rest of the part. Further, curable adhesive always require a certain curing time for cross-linking. This will considerably increase the production time in case of industrial production. In order to solve this problem, it has been proposed to use UV curable adhesives that tend to cure faster than thermally curing adhesives. However, they require at least partially transparent connectors to allow the curing radiation to reach the curable adhesive. In addition, glue lines will always suffer from sensitivity in terms of layer thickness and homogeneity of glue distribution.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Also other materials than fiber composites, including classical materials such as sheet metal, are increasingly used in lightweight versions, with correspondingly reduced mechanical strength. Therefore, fastenings that require the material to be weakened&#x2014;for example by a bore or similar&#x2014;are more and more to be avoided.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition to UV curing, the prior art includes an approach of accelerating the curing of adhesives by induction heating. However, this method is restricted to connections that involve metallic parts. Also, inductive heating is relatively unspecific and furthermore not always an option, due to constraints.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It would therefore be advantageous to provide a method of fastening a further, second object (for example a connector) to a first object, which method overcomes drawbacks of prior art method and which especially yields a strong reliable mechanical bond.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an aspect of the invention, a method of fastening a second object to a first object is provided, the method including:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0008">Providing the first object including an attachment surface;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0009">Providing the second object;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0010">Placing the second object relative to the first object, with a resin in a flowable state between the attachment surface and the second object (in this, the resin may be flowable ab initio or at least by the effect of the mechanical vibration, see hereinafter);</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0011">While the resin is in contact with the first attachment surface and the second attachment surface, especially while pressing the second object and the first object against each other, for example by a vibrating tool, causing mechanical vibration to act on the second object or the first object or both, thereby activating the resin to cross-link;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0012">Whereby the resin, after cross-linking, secures the second object to the first object.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0009" num="0013">In this text, &#x201c;resin&#x201d; denotes any substance that is flowable at least during one stage of the process (generally a viscous liquid) and is capable of hardening permanently by covalent bonds generated between molecules of the resin and/or between molecules of the resin and other substances. For example, the resin may be a composition including a monomer or a plurality of monomers or a prepolymer in a flowable state that is capable of changing irreversibly into a polymer network by curing.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0014">The fastening method according to the invention features the substantial advantage that the first and second objects do not have to be weakened because the achieved bond may be a purely adhesive bond. Also, especially if one of the objects is comparably thin&#x2014;for example being a metal sheet&#x2014;the method features the advantage that no through opening has to be made in this object, and hence no measures have to be taken for sealing, electrical insulation, etc. Also, the fastening is independent of pre-defined structures, and this allows to compensate for tolerance mismatch (x-y position adjustment) in a quite straightforward manner.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0015">It has been found by the inventors that the mechanical vibration has a double effect: Firstly it causes the resin to become well distributed and to completely wet/interpenetrate and if applicable embed any structure on the attachment surface thereby cause the resin to penetrate into such structure relatively deeply.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0016">Secondly, the mechanical vibration energy is primarily absorbed at the interface between the first object and the second object and in the resin, thereby stimulating the curing process. More precisely, the resin has been found to cure rather efficiently and predominantly at the interface. If the attachment surface is provided with an according structure, after the hardening process, the resin in addition to causing a material connection (i.e. an adhesive bond) also causes a positive-fit connection due to the fact that it has interpenetrated the structure, which structure may include undercuts. In practice, it has been found (for example, using a commercially available two-component epoxy adhesive as the resin) that the curing process is accelerated compared to how quick it would have been without the ultrasonic vibration by at least an order of magnitude. As a role of thumb, a temperature increase of about 10&#xb0; C. reduces the setting time by 50%. In practice, a short term, ultrasound induced temperature increase of about 50&#xb0; C. or even 100&#xb0; C. may be observed. In embodiments, the second object has a structure different from merely being plane at the attachment surface. Rather, the surface at the attachment surface may have distinct corrugation. Especially, in embodiments the second object has a structure that includes undercuts. Thereby, resin material interpenetrating the structure assisted by the mechanical vibration will, after re-solidification, be secured to the second object by a positive-fit connection.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0017">In embodiments, the first object includes a fiber composite part including a structure of fibers embedded in a matrix material. In a group of embodiments, the fiber composite part will especially include a portion of the structure of fibers being exposed at the attachment surface. Flowable resin material then is caused to interpenetrate the structure of fibers, possible voids in the material are caused to evade. The vibrations may also cause small motions of the fibers themselves, and this helps to prevent spots from not being impregnated at all. An exposed structure of fibers will naturally include structures that define an undercut, whereby the above-mentioned positive-fit connection is achieved without any additional measures being required.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0018">In particular, the method may include the step of causing the portion of the structure of fibers to become exposed, especially by removing an outermost portion of the matrix.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0019">In addition or as an alternative, in embodiments in which the first and/or second object is of a different material than of a fiber composite, the method may include causing a surface roughness of the attachment surface of such object, by a method known for this purpose, for example by mechanical abrasion, etching, etc.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0020">The resin used in these embodiments may be of a same chemical composition as the matrix material of the fiber composite part, or it may be of a different composition.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0021">The fiber composite part may itself constitute a first object to which the second object is to be fastened, or it may constitute a portion of the first object, which first object may include additional portions connected to the fiber composite part.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0022">The fact that the structure of fibers is exposed at the attachment surface means that the structure lacks a homogeneous distribution of the matrix material fully embedding the fibers so that the resin material is capable of flowing into structures formed between and/or underneath the fibers.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0023">In order for the portion of the structure of fibers to be exposed at the attachment surface, the method may include removing matrix material from the attachment surface to expose a portion of the structure of fibers prior to placing the second object relative to the fiber composite part.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0024">Such a step of removing matrix material may include any suitable material removal step. For example, such a step may include sandblasting the attachments surface. Additionally or as an alternative, the step may include chemical etching. In addition or as yet another alternative, the step may include grinding. In either case, the step may include the sub-step of providing a mask and causing only those portions of the surface to be exposed to the material removal for which it is desired that the structure of fibers is exposed.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0025">As an alternative to fiber composite part, also other materials are suitable materials for the first object. In groups of embodiments, such materials especially include a porous or otherwise inhomogeneous structure. An example of such a material is a metallic foam. In addition or as an alternative, the first object may include surface irregularities at the attachment surface, which surface irregularities are caused in an ablating process (mechanical, by irradiation, chemical etching etc.) or in an additive (coating) process.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0026">As an analog to the exposed structure of fibers, in metallic or ceramic first objects exposed structures may be grain boundaries exposed by chemical etching or the generation of etching geometries.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0027">To summarize, the method may include providing the first object with surface irregularities at the attachment surface, which surface irregularities may be constituted by an exposure of a portion of the structure of fibers, by an inhomogeneous ablating or by an additive process.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0028">In addition or as an alternative, the method may include influencing the surface chemistry of the first and/or second object, for example by an additive or ablative process (coating (for example primering), activating, etc.), for example for causing a sufficient surface concentration of OH groups or NH groups.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0029">In many examples described hereinafter, the first object is a fiber composite part. However, the teaching applies also to other first objects, including metal foams, metal sheets or other metal parts (with our without roughened surface), porous or non-porous ceramics, porous or non-porous plastics, or any object, for example provided with surface irregularities.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0030">A further advantage of the approach according to the invention is that the steps prior to bringing the second object into contact with the first object do not require any precision in terms of positioning. A step of removing the matrix material at the attachment surface to expose the portion of the structure of fibers (see below) or another surface preparation step needs to be done only approximately at a position where the attachment is to take place. If precise positioning of the second object with respect to the fiber composite part is required, such precision can be achieved by directly arranging the second part at the desired position. This is in contrast to approaches where, for example, a pre-drilled bore defines the relative position.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0031">This is especially advantageous taking into account the fact that due to the speedy curing caused by the approach according to the invention, the method may readily be integrated in industrial production processes where corresponding equipment is used for placing the objects relative to one another, and tolerance problems may directly be balanced out.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0032">The second object may be a connector and thereby serve for fastening a further object to the first object. To this end, the second object may include a joining structure, such as a threaded portion, a nut portion, a portion of a bayonet or of a clip connector, or any other joining structure. Alternatively, the second object may be a frame or housing or any other object to be fastened to the first object.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0033">In a group of embodiments, the second object includes a second fiber composite&#x2014;if applicable of a same composition as the fiber composite part or of a different composition. In a sub-group of these embodiments, a portion of the structure of reinforcing fibers of the second object is exposed prior to the step of pressing, whereby the resin also infiltrates the structure of fibers of the second object, with a similar effect as described herein for the fiber composite part.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0034">In other embodiments, the second object, at the second attachment surface, includes a different material from a fiber composite. It may, for example, be metallic, with or without a roughened surface, of glass, ceramic, a polymer-based material, etc. In a special group of embodiments, the second object includes a roughened and/or porous surface structure.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0035">In embodiments, the second object includes a, for example, distally facing second attachment surface that in the step of placing the second object relative to the first object is placed to abut against the attachment surface of the first object (the &#x2018;first attachment surface&#x2019;), with the resin between the attachment surfaces.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0036">In embodiments, such a second attachment surface is provided with at least one indentation (groove/channel, hole or similar) that when the second attachment surface is pressed against the first attachment surface, a cavity is formed, which cavity may serve as buffer volume for surplus resin material and direct the resin flow. Especially, the at least one indentation may form a channel system of for example radially running channels effectively directing the flow. More in general, the second attachment surface may be provided with at least one indentation or protrusion resulting in a macroscopic structure leaving spaces of defined depth at the interface. In an example, the macroscopic structure may be constituted by a pattern of protrusions (spacers) yielding an adhesive gap of defined thickness, wherein the vibrations ensures a reliable filling of this gap, in addition to making an improved distribution and wetting possible.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0037">In addition, such structures tend to increase the surface thereby improving attachment. Such structures may for example constitute positive-fit structures to further strengthen the connection.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0038">In a special group of embodiments, the second object on the side facing the first object may include a geometrically structured thermoplastic contact portion. When the mechanical vibrations act, such geometrical structures may serve as energy directors, and a liquefaction process of the thermoplastic material may locally set in. Thereby, an interpenetrating network is generated between the thermoplastic material and the resin, which network on the one hand may even enhance the attachment strength and on the other hand makes a compensation of geometrical irregularities possible. Further additional heat is generated by absorption of vibration energy by the thermoplastic material further accelerating the curing process. Finally, the interpenetrating network forms, especially due to the ductility of the thermoplastic material, an impact resistant interlayer that allows to compensate the brittleness of the adhesive connection via the resin.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0039">This concept may alternatively or in addition be applied to the first object including thermoplastic material at the first attachment surface.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0040">In addition or as an alternative to the indentation(s) of the second attachment surface a structure including at least one indentation (channel, groove, hole) may be provided on the first attachment surface. Such indentation in the first object may be pre-manufactured (for example in a Resin Transfer Molding process in which the fiber composite part has been manufactured) and/or may be manufactured by a removing step, for example a material removing step with a means (sandblasting, etching or similar) that does not only affect the matrix material but also the fibers.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0041">The first object&#x2014;or the second object if the mechanical vibration acts on the first object&#x2014;during the step of pressing may be placed against a support, especially a non-vibrating support. It is also an option to apply the vibration from both sides, i.e. to press vibrating tools both, against the second object and the first object.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0042">In this text, the term &#x201c;fiber composite part&#x201d; generally refers to parts that include a structure of fibers, such as an arrangement of fiber bundles, a textile structure of fibers or any other structure of fibers, and a matrix material in which the fibers are embedded. Often, in such a structure, the fibers are so-called &#x201c;continuous fibers&#x201d;, i.e. fibers with lengths that may exceed 10 mm. The fibers will for example be carbon fibers. Such fiber composites are often referred to as &#x201c;carbon fiber composites&#x201d; or &#x201c;carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers&#x201d; or &#x201c;carbon-fiber-reinforced plastics&#x201d;; often also just as &#x201c;carbon&#x201d;. Other fibers than carbon fibers, such as glass, ceramic or polymer fibers, are not excluded.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0043">In a group of embodiments, the second object is a fastener having an anchoring plate (or &#x201c;fastener head&#x201d;) and a fastening element bonded to the anchoring plate. The fastening element can have any property of a state-of-the art fastener and for example be a threaded bolt (with an outer thread and/or an inner thread) a bolt without a thread, but for example with glue channels, a pin, a nut, a hook, an eyelet, a base for a bayonet coupling, etc. The fastener in embodiments of this group may be constituted essentially like a fastener sold under the trade name &#x201c;bighead&#x201d; and intended to be glued to a surface of another object.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0044">The anchoring plate of fasteners of this group may in addition or as an alternative to the hereinbefore discussed optional structures of the second attachment surface have at least one through opening. During the process, portions of the resin will then be caused to penetrate into the through opening(s) and to thereby contribute to the fastening effect.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0045">In embodiments of this group, the anchoring plate is provided with at least one spacer protruding from the second attachment surface. Such spacers define a minimum distance between the first attachment surface and the second attachments surface and thereby control a thickness of the resin layer. The spacer size on the one hand and the resin composition and the requirements (for example thermal extension mismatch compensation) of the attachment may therein be adapted to each other.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0046">The spacer(s) may especially be arranged near the opening(s), for example forming a collar surrounding the opening(s). In this embodiment, the spacer(s) has/have the additional effect of assisting control of the amount of resin that flows back towards proximally by the effect of the pressing force and the vibration.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0047">The vibrating tool used for coupling the vibration into the assembly may be adapted to the second object (fastener) for the tool to couple the be pressed directly against a proximally facing surface of the anchoring plate. In many embodiments, especially including but not restricted to the embodiments where the vibration is longitudinal vibration, the vibrating tool is therefore adapted to be pressed against a proximally facing surface of the anchoring plate.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0048">To this end, the vibrating tool may include a receiving indentation for the fastening element and be in force and vibration transmitting contact with the anchoring plate.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0049">The receiving indentation or other structure of the vibrating tool may be equipped to be a guiding structure cooperating with the fastening element to guide the second object relative to the vibrating tool. Such guiding structure may be configured as a fastening structure cooperating with the fastening element for fastening the second object to the vibrating tool. Alternatively, it may be a loose guiding structure for example laterally guiding the fastening element while being de-coupled with respect to axial relative movements.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0050">A possible issue may be the confinement of the resin, which may be initially relatively flowable, during the process, especially since the mechanical vibration initially enhances the mobility of the resin.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0051">A first option of a lateral confinement is to provide the second object and/or the first object with a peripheral confining feature confining the resin during the step of pressing the second object and the first object against each other and causing mechanical vibration to act. Such peripheral confining feature may for example include a peripheral annular distally facing collar of the second object, for example of a same or similar extension than the spacer(s) (if any). Such peripheral annular collar may alternatively serve as the (only) spacer. It is also possible to provide the second object and/or the first object with a surface shape that bulges away from the resin side at the location of the resin, i.e. the second object bulges towards proximally and/or the first object bulges towards distally. Thereby, a pocket is formed for the resin. The confining by such shape may be such that the pocket is closed towards laterally, or that the pocket is open, whereby a certain reduced lateral flow of the resin out of the pocket and/or into the pocket remains possible.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0052">A second option of a lateral confinement is to provide the vibrating tool with a peripheral confining feature. Such peripheral confining feature may include an annular protrusion peripherally of the second object and projecting towards the first attachment surface.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0053">According to a third option, a separate confining element may be used that at least partially surrounds the second object (if applicable, for example, the anchoring plate) to confine the resin.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0054">The options may be arbitrarily combined.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0055">Dispensing the resin prior to bringing the attachment surfaces together may include using a dispensing tool to dispense the resin on the first attachment surface and/or on the second attachment surface.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0056">In a group of embodiments, the method includes applying a resin to a relatively large portion of a surface of one of the objects prior to placing the second object relative to the first object and activating the resin to cross-link by the mechanical vibration.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0057">This group is especially suited for embodiments in which the second object (and for example also the first object) is plane and sheet-like or at least has a plane, sheet-like portion.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0058">If two objects having a relatively large common surface are to be bonded to each other by an adhesive bond, according to the prior art, in a manufacturing process after bringing the first and second objects together, with the adhesive between the attachment surfaces, the process had to wait until the adhesive was sufficiently hardened. Alternatively, rivets were used for provisionally stabilizing the relative positions of the first and second objects until the adhesive had sufficiently hardened. Rivet connections have well-known advantages briefly discussed in the introductory part of this text.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0059">In accordance with the mentioned group of embodiments, the activation is carried out selectively, only for a discrete location or a plurality of discrete locations, with the resin remaining un-influenced at positions different from the discrete location(s). Thereby, the resin at the discrete location(s) may provisionally stabilize the assembly of the first and second objects until the adhesive material has fully hardened, for example after a waiting time or heating step. Thereby, the group of embodiments brings about the advantage of provisional stabilization (with the possibility of further processing the assembly) without the disadvantages of a rivet or similar (screwed etc.) connection.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0060">In embodiments of this group, a possible challenge in this may be that depending on the stiffness of the second object it may be difficult to selectively couple the vibration through the second object into the desired spot without too much vibration energy being dissipating through the second object towards laterally, for example along a second object sheet plane.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0061">In a sub-group of embodiments, the second object is of a material that is locally sufficiently pliable to selectively couple the vibration to that portion of the resin that is immediately underneath the vibrating tool, which couples the vibration into the second object.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0062">In addition or as an alternative, the second object includes a local deformation, for example embossment that has energy directing properties. For example, such local deformation may include a corrugated structure, whereby the corrugation serves as energy director.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0063">In addition or as a further alternative, the second object may include a vibration de-coupling structure (which works in a joint-like manner) around the discrete location, for example a groove.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0064">As a further alternative, which may optionally be combined with the mentioned possibilities, an auxiliary element is placed at the discrete location between the first and second objects. Such auxiliary element serves as absorber for mechanical vibration energy and thereby heats the surrounding resin material in a targeted manner. The auxiliary element may include an energy director for this purpose. Such auxiliary element may include thermoplastic material.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0065">In embodiments, such an auxiliary element may be of a thermoplastic elastomer. Then, the E modulus may be adjusted to the according modulus of the resin (after cross-linking). The mechanical properties will then be influenced at most minimally.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0066">In embodiments, such auxiliary element may be deposited together with the resin. For example, if the resin is deposited as a resin bead by an according automatized tool, the auxiliary element may be deposited by the tool together with the bead.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0067">In embodiments, the auxiliary element may be shaped to be extended over a large portion of the interface between the first and second objects, for example by being a flexible planar structure, such as a mesh or similar, forming energy directing structures distributed over a large surface, for example in a regular pattern. A flexible planar structure in this context is a planar structure that is deformable without substantial force input and without substantial spring-back effect, such as a piece of textile, a mesh, a foil, etc. In some embodiments, instead of being a flexible planar structure, the auxiliary element may also be a stiff planar structure.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0068">In embodiments with an extended auxiliary element, depositing of the auxiliary element does not necessarily have to be with precise positioning, even if the position of an adhesive connection with rapid hardening triggered by the vibration needs to be precisely defined, because such precise definition then may be caused by the position of the tool by which the vibration is applied.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0069">In accordance with a possibility, a position of the auxiliary element may be defined by an according structure of the first or second object, for example a guiding indentation (guiding hole) of the first/second object cooperating with a corresponding protrusion of the auxiliary element.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0070">If the auxiliary element includes thermoplastic material that is made flowable during the process, a flow portion thereof may in addition to the heating effect also lead to a material flow, thereby have a stirring function on the resin and induce additional structure that contributes to the fastening effect of the resin.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0071">An auxiliary element in addition to serving as an absorber also may have the function of being a spacer and thereby defines a thickness of the resin between the first and second objects.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0072">In a group of embodiments, the first object or the second object is at least partially of a thermoplastic material, and the other one (the second object or the first object) has a piercing portion that is equipped to pierce into the thermoplastic material of the first object or second object, respectively, during the step of applying the pressing force and the mechanical vibration.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0073">The piercing portion may include a piercing tip and optionally may include an undercut with respect to axial direction.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0074">The piercing portion during the process acts as vibration energy director and by the impact of the vibration energy locally makes the thermoplastic material flowable. This firstly has the effect of allowing the piercing portion to penetrate into the first object whereby after re-solidification of the flowable thermoplastic material portions an additional anchoring (in addition to the effect of the resin) is achieved. Also, possible disruptions in the first object material are levelled out by the flowable thermoplastic material (healing effect). As a second effect, the absorbed mechanical vibration energy leads to a local heating of the assembly around the interface between the piercing portion and the first object, whereby the resin is subject to additional local activation, as explained hereinbefore.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0075">The piercing portion for the mentioned reasons provides a quick and primary stability, even if not the entire resin is hardened out. This may be important in manufacturing processes where the assembly needs to quickly have sufficient stability to move on to a next manufacturing step.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0076">In another group of embodiments, the second object and/or the first object is at least partially made of thermoplastic material and includes at least one energy directing feature&#x2014;such as a protrusion forming a tip or edge&#x2014;that during the process is caused to be in contact with the first object or second object, respectively. When the vibration and pressing force are coupled into the assembly, energy will be absorbed locally at the place(s) of the energy directing feature(s). This will cause the thermoplastic material of the energy directing feature to become locally flowable and will cause a deformation. Due to the energy absorption at the protrusions, the resin will be subject to additional local activation around the protrusions leading to local hardened zones that ensure primary stability spots even if not the entire resin is hardened yet.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0077">In these embodiments, the flowable material around the energy directing features may optionally in addition have the function of contributing to the process and/or to the fastening effect, for example by causing a weld to the respective other object (if the materials are correspondingly chosen), to cause a positive-fit connection, etc and/or by contributing to the process control, for example by defining the distance between the first and second objects at which the mechanical resistance against being further moved against each other becomes high, etc.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0078">In embodiments, the second object and/or the first object is shaped for the resin to cause a positive-fit connection in addition to the adhesive bond. To this end, the second and/or first object may be provided with a structure for the resin to flow into in a manner that after re-solidification an undercut is achieved. In a sub-group of such embodiments, if the second object/first object has a relatively thin sheet-like portion, such structure may include an opening in this second object/first object through which a portion of the resin can escape and flow into an open space beyond the opening, i.e. proximally of the second objet portion that has the opening and/or distally of the first object portion that has the opening, respectively. Thereby, a button-like positive fit connection is caused after hardening of the resin.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0079">A tool by which the vibration is applied may be a sonotrode coupled to a device for generating the vibration. Such a device may, for example, be a hand-held electrically powered device including appropriate means, such as a piezoelectric transducer, to generate the vibrations.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0080">The mechanical vibration may be longitudinal vibration; the tool by which the vibration is applied may vibrate essentially perpendicular to the surface portion (and the tool is also pressed into the longitudinal direction); this does not exclude lateral forces in the tool, for example for moving the tool over the surface portion.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0081">In other embodiments, the vibration is transverse vibration, i.e. oscillation predominantly at an angle, for example perpendicular, to the proximodistal axis and hence, for example, parallel to the first and second attachment surfaces. Vibration energy and amplitude in this may be similar to parameters of longitudinal vibration.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0082">In a further group of embodiments, which may be viewed as a sub-group of embodiments with transverse vibration, the oscillation may be rotational oscillation, i.e. the vibrating item vibrates in a back and forth twisting movement.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0083">The vibrating tool in many embodiments is used to press the second object against the first object while the vibrations act. For applying a counter force to the first object, a non-vibrating support may be used (i.e., the vibrating tool presses the second object and the first object against a non-vibrating support). Such non-vibrating support may, for example, be a working table or be constituted by a frame that holds the first object, etc.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0084">In a group of embodiments, a control foil is used for the process. Such control foil (or auxiliary foil) may be present between the non-vibrating support and the first object and/or between the tool and the second object (or generally between the tool and the object(s) against which it is pressed and/or between the non-vibrating support and the object(s) that is/are pressed against it.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0085">Such control foil may, for example, be of a plastic that does not become flowable under the conditions that apply during the process, for example polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), or of paper.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0086">The foil has the following possible functions:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0087">Force impact distribution: Especially if the first and/or second objects are sheet-like, they will have their own vibration behavior with resonance frequencies and wavelength generally not equal to the frequency and wavelength, respectively, of the coupled-in vibration. This will lead coupling only at certain contact points instead of over an entire contact surface and to losses. The comparably soft foil will balance out such mismatches (will balance out impedance mismatches) and thereby improve the coupling properties.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0088">Heat flow prevention: Often, applicable sonotrodes and/or applicable non-vibrating supports (for example working tables) are of a metal or of another good heat conductor. The intimate direct contact between the sonotrode/support on the one hand and the second/first object on the other hand will result in a substantial flow of heat into the sonotrode/support. The efficiency of the process goes down as a consequence. The control foil has a heat insulating effect drastically reducing the heat flow.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0083" num="0089">The control foil in this is used as auxiliary element that is removed after the process. To this end, the control foil is of a material that does not stick to the second object/first object.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0090">Optionally, the control foil may be present as a coating of the vibrating tool/the non-vibrating support.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0091">The mechanical vibration may be ultrasonic vibration, for example vibration of a frequency between 15 KHz and 200 kHz, especially between 20 KHz and 60 kHz. For typical sizes of second objects (for example with characteristic lateral dimensions of about 1 cm) and dimensions of composite parts for example for the automotive industry (car body parts), a power of around 100-200 W has turned out to be sufficient, although the power to be applied may vary strongly depending on the application.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0092">In any embodiment, there exists the option of carrying out the method by a tool that includes an automatic control of the pressing force. For example, the device may be configured to switch the vibrations on only if a certain minimal pressing force is applied, and/or to switch the vibrations off as soon as a certain maximum pressing force is achieved. Especially the latter may be beneficial for parts of which an undesired deformation must be avoided, such as certain car body parts.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0093">To this end, according to a first option the capability of piezoelectric transducers to measure an applied pressure may be used. According to a second option, a special mechanism can be present in the device. For example, a unit that contains the transducer and to which the tool (sonotrode) is attached may be mounted slideable against a spring force within a casing. The device may be configured so that the vibrations can be switched on only if the unit is displaced by a certain minimal displacement and/or only if it is not displaced by more than a certain maximum displacement. To achieve this, means well-known in the art such as light barriers, sliding electrical contacts, position sensitive switches or other means may be used. Also a collapsible sleeve or similar of the kind described hereinafter may contain or operate a contact or switch or similar to control the pressing force.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0094">The vibration frequency can influence the manner in which the vibrations act. A lower frequency will lead to a longer wavelength. By adapting the wavelength to the dimensions of the part to be completed, the operator can have an influence on in which depth the effect of the vibrations is the strongest and on whether the energy is primarily absorbed in a &#x2018;near field&#x2019; regime, in a &#x2018;far field&#x2019; regime or in an intermediate regime.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0095">The invention further contains a kit of parts for carrying out the method, the kit of parts including the resin material (to be precise: raw material for the resin material, which may for example include two components to be mixed to yield the resin) as well as a second object and a vibration application tool (for example sonotrode) having a distal outcoupling face adapted to a proximally facing incoupling face of the second object. The kit may further include a material removal device, such as a sandblasting device.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0090" num="0096">In the following, ways to carry out the invention and embodiments are described referring to drawings.

For illustration purposes, in all depicted examples, the fiber composite part is assumed to have a general flattish shape, as has for example a car body part, or an aircraft's wall or the like. All examples of the invention are, however, also applicable to first objects that are not flattish but have any other shape.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0127"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>schematically shows the step of removing matrix material from a spot on the attachment surface (the proximally facing surface; the top surface in the orientation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>). A sandblasting device <b>40</b> creates a jet <b>42</b> of abrasive particles that remove matrix material but the energy of which is not sufficient to systematically damage the fibers <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0128">In the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>, a mask <b>41</b> is used to cover portions of the surface that are not to be sandblasted.

In practice the depth may be a few tens of micrometers or more, for example more than 50 micrometers.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0130">Thereafter, a resin portion <b>3</b> is placed on the exposed surface part <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>c</i></figref>). The resin may, for example, be a two-component mix of a resin, e.g. an epoxy or polyester resin. The resin portion may optionally fully cover the exposed surface part <b>13</b>, but this is not necessary.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0131">In addition or as an alternative to dispensing the resin portion on the fiber composite part <b>1</b>, the resin may also be dispensed on the second object.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0132">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>d</i></figref>, the fiber composite part and the second object <b>1</b> are pressed against each other, with the resin between the respective attachment surfaces (constituted by the distally facing surface of the second object <b>2</b> and the proximally facing surface of the fiber composite part).</p><p id="p-0127" num="0133">In the depicted configuration, the second object includes a plurality of indentations, namely channels <b>21</b> in the second attachment surface.

At the same time, mechanical vibration, especially ultrasonic vibration, is coupled into the second object. By the effect of the vibration, the resin is caused to effectively infiltrate the exposed fibers of the fiber composite part and, if applicable, of the second object. At the same time, the mechanical vibration energy absorbed will cause the resin to be locally heated where it is at the interface between the fiber composite part and the second object. Thereby, at these places the curing process is substantially accelerated, whereby the time span between the step of placing and sufficient curing for the connection to be mechanically stable is substantially reduced, for example from a few minutes (without vibration) to a few seconds (with vibration). This does not affect potential surplus portions of resin that is laterally besides the attachment location, so that after the process such surplus portions may readily be removed.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0136">The sonotrode <b>6</b> includes an optional guiding protrusion <b>65</b> that cooperates with a guiding indentation <b>26</b> of the second object.

For example, the second object may have a plurality of attachment portions, the spatial relationship of which with respect to each other is precisely defined. In prior art approaches (except gluing), this demanded drilling holes into the fiber composite part very precisely at the locations corresponding to the attachment locations. Due to the approach according to the present invention, it is sufficient to provide exposed surface parts <b>13</b> only approximately where the attachment is to take place.

Such guiding structure may especially engage the fastening element, as is the case for the schematically shown guiding protrusions <b>62</b> of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0166">In embodiments, the guiding structure may be configured as fastening structure cooperating with the fastening element to temporarily fasten the second object <b>2</b> to the sonotrode. This possibility is schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the second object/fastener has a nut <b>36</b> secured, for example welded, to the anchoring plate, and this nut serves as the fastening structure. The tool <b>6</b> includes a threaded protrusion <b>65</b> adapted to the inner thread of the nut <b>36</b>, whereby for the process the fastener can be screwed onto the tool.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0167">Similar configurations are possible for other fastening elements as well, for example, an indentation with an inner thread for cooperating with a threaded bar of the fastener.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0168"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> addresses the possible issue of confining the resin to the location (attachment location) on the attachment surface where the first object is brought into contact with the second object.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0169">A first possibility has been mentioned hereinbefore, namely to provide the second object with a confining feature, for example a peripheral collar.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0170"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref> illustrates a variant of this concept. The first object <b>1</b> and/or the second object <b>2</b> has an indentation <b>131</b> towards the resin <b>3</b> side (here being an outward bulge), whereby a pocket <b>132</b> is formed for the resin. Such pocket may be closed off towards laterally or, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>, open towards laterally, whereby a certain lateral flow of the resin <b>3</b> remains possible.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0171">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>, both, the first and second objects are illustrated as metal sheets, wherein the respective indentation <b>131</b> is formed as a bulge away from the resin side, i.e. towards distally for the first object, and towards proximally for the second object. Of course, depending on the properties of the first/second objects, there are other ways to form a pocket of the illustrated kind, for example by die casting, molding, etc.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0172"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref> very schematically illustrates the principle that if both, the first and second objects <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> each have an indentation <b>131</b> for forming the pocket, the indentations can optionally be laterally offset/shifted with respect to one another, whereby cavitation effects can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0173">A second possibility is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. The tool <b>6</b> has a peripheral collar <b>66</b> protruding towards distally and thereby confining the resin <b>3</b>. The dimension of such collar is chosen so that under the applicable conditions, for example taking into account spacer elements of the above-described kind, if present, the collar <b>66</b> does not get into direct physical contact with the first object surface during the process.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0174">A third possibility is a separate confining element <b>53</b>, as for example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. Such separate confining element may for example be a for example short tube element encompassing the tool <b>6</b> but being vibrationally de-coupled from the tool <b>6</b>. Such separate confining element may, prior to dispensing the resin <b>3</b> or thereafter, be positioned to surround the attachment location and may for example abut against the proximally facing surface of the first object <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0175">The three possibilities may be applied independently from each other or may be combined, also in any sub-combination.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0176">In embodiments, the second object has a through hole, as for example the through holes <b>33</b> of an anchoring plate <b>31</b>. In these embodiments, resin material may flow through the through holes towards proximally. This may have an effect of contributing to the attachment properties, by causing a positive-fit effect, the second object being partially embedded in resin material after the hardening of the latter.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0177">In embodiments in which the second object has a through hole, a measure is taken for preventing resin material from sticking to a surface of the tool after the process. A first such measure is to cause the distally facing outcoupling surface of the tool to have properties preventing such sticking, for example by having a corresponding anti-adhesive coating.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0178">A second optional measure is very schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. The tool may have an indentation <b>67</b> at a position corresponding to the position of the through hole. This option is independent of the other features shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>; especially it is applicable independently of the confining element <b>53</b>.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0179"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> shows an example of a configuration in which in contrast to the above embodiments the vibration is transverse vibration and not longitudinal vibration. The sonotrode <b>6</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is equipped for transverse oscillation. It includes a receiving opening <b>61</b> that is configured to receive the fastening structure <b>32</b>. Especially, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> the receiving opening is illustrated to have an inner thread adapted to the thread of the fastening structure being a threaded bar, with the fastener being as for example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. The sonotrode <b>6</b> has a ring-shaped skirt <b>68</b> that during the process is pressed against a peripheral part of the anchoring plate <b>31</b> and thereby couples the pressing force and, together with the receiving opening, the mechanical vibration into the anchoring plate <b>31</b>. For symmetry reasons, the sonotrode <b>6</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> in addition to the distal ring-shaped skirt <b>68</b> that is pressed against the anchoring plate has a proximal ring-shaped skirt <b>68</b>. Due to this, it would be possible to carry out the process for two assemblies in parallel, the sonotrode being clamped between two first objects pressed against the respective second objects that are introduced from opposite sides. Two more coupling locations could be present on the opposite sides of the sonotrode that are parallel to the drawing plane in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0180">Another sonotrode <b>6</b>, suitable for example transverse oscillation for example in a &#x2018;wedge-reed&#x2019;-like configuration, is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>. The sonotrode includes a receiving opening <b>61</b> for receiving the fastening structure (for example threaded bar). Similarly to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>14</b></figref>, the receiving opening may optionally be equipped for a coupling to the fastening structure. The sonotrode is equipped and mounted for transversal vibration of the distal end portion, for example by a vibration coupled into the sonotrode by a coupler acting from sideways and causing a bending oscillation of the sonotrode, as schematically indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0181">The sonotrode in the depicted embodiment instead of a ring-shaped skirt includes a plurality of wings <b>69</b> for coupling the vibration into lateral portions of the anchoring plate.

A first object <b>1</b> and a second object are to be bonded to each other by an adhesive connection, wherein the first and second objects are both relatively large. In a manufacturing process, the hardening of the adhesive between the objects until the bond is sufficiently strong for further manufacturing steps may cause a significant delay. The approach according to embodiments of the invention is therefore to use the fastening method described herein at a plurality of discrete spots <b>81</b> to activate the resin at these spots. Thereby, the bond is caused to be sufficiently stable in a rapid process. The resin portions between the discrete spots <b>81</b> may harden slowly thereafter while the assembly of the first and second objects is subject to further processing steps.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0184"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> depicts an arrangement of a first object <b>1</b>, a second object <b>2</b> and a resin portion <b>3</b> therebetween.

As illustrated with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, the surface of the resin may be too large for the mechanical vibration to be applied extensively over the whole area covered by the adhesive, and the hardening may take place at discrete spots only. The remaining portions of the adhesive may harden thereafter at a much slower rate and/or induced by heating.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0185">A possible challenge in this may be that depending on the stiffness of the membrane (metal sheet) it may be difficult to selectively couple the vibration through the second object into the desired spot without too much vibration energy being dissipated by flowing away laterally.<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0186">In embodiments, the second object is of a material (for example, a membrane-like thin sheet material) that is locally sufficiently pliable to selectively couple the vibration to that portion of the resin that is immediately underneath the sonotrode that couples the vibration into the second object.</li>        <li id="ul0010-0002" num="0187">In other embodiments, the second object includes a local deformation, for example embossment that has energy directing properties.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0173" num="0188">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, the embossment forms a local indentation/bead <b>91</b>.
