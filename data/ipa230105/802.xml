prevention or treatment of coronavirus infections, comprising a delayed-release composition of niclosamide or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a method for preventing or treating coronavirus infections by using the same.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The emergence of coronavirus (CoV), which causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), poses a severe threat to public health.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Coronaviruses are known to mainly cause pneumonia and enteritis in humans and animals, and are also known to occasionally cause nervous system infections and hepatitis. Coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae and are positive sense RNA viruses with a spherical outer membrane of about 100-120 nm in size. Coronaviruses consist of a total of five structural proteins, including the outermost spike protein (S), hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein, transmembrane (M) protein, small membrane (E) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein (Lai and Homes, 2001. Fields Virology). Among the above, the spike protein acts as a ligand binding to a cell receptor and induces fusion between the host cell and the virus, and is known as the most mutable protein.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Both SARS and MERS are known to be caused by variant coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) which belong to the genus Beta coronavirus. Accordingly, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV share similar characteristics in clinical symptoms, etiology and infection. In the phylogenetic tree, SARS-CoV belongs to lineage B, which contains bat SARS-like coronaviruses and other bat-derived CoVs, and MERS-CoV belongs to lineage C, which contains bat-derived CoVs.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Since coronaviruses are highly mutated, using a current antiviral agent again has the drawback of having a low effect if the antiviral drug does not match the most recent virus type. Accordingly, there is a continuous demand for the development of an antiviral agent with excellent anti-infection and therapeutic effects.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The technical problem to be solved by the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition for prevention or treatment of coronavirus infections, comprising a delayed-release composition of niclosamide or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Also, the technical problem to be solved by the present invention is to provide a method for preventing or treating coronavirus infections by using the delayed-release composition.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an aspect of the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for prevention or treatment of coronavirus infections, comprising a delayed-release composition of niclosamide or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As used herein, &#x201c;niclosamide&#x201d; is an oral salicyl anilide derivative which was approved by the FDA in 1960 and used for the treatment of various parasitic infections for nearly 50 years. These conventional niclosamide formulations had very low water solubility and intestinal permeability, and bioavailability was extremely low, it was impossible to achieve and maintain a blood drug concentration to achieve antiviral activity in the body. In particular, the clearance of the drug was found to be extremely fast during oral administration, there was a problem in that the existing formulation made it impossible to administer niclosamide to the body for antiviral purposes.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The delayed-release composition of the present invention solves the problems of the conventional niclosamide formulations described above and presents PK profile characteristics capable of exhibiting antiviral activity, thereby presenting effective antiviral activity by maintaining an effective blood drug concentration for a long time.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, the delayed-release composition may comprise niclosamide or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and an anionic polysaccharide cellulose derivative.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment, the anionic polysaccharide may be a carboxy polysaccharide, and the anionic polysaccharide cellulose derivative may be carboxymethyl cellulose, carboxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl chitosan or carboxymethyl dextran, but is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, the anionic polysaccharide cellulose derivative may be carboxymethyl cellulose, but any polymer applied as an excipient of the pharmaceutical formulation exhibiting the effect of the present application may be used as the anionic polysaccharide cellulose derivative without limitation.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one embodiment, the composition may further comprise a phosphate salt and sodium salt. The phosphate salt and sodium salt may be derived from sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate, but is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment, the delayed-release composition may further comprise mannitol, but is not limited thereto, and any excipient that is applicable to an injection formulation as a sugar alcohol may be changed as needed and used.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a niclosamide delayed-release composition comprising an anionic polysaccharide cellulose derivative was prepared, and it was confirmed that a target blood drug concentration may be achieved and maintained in the prepared composition (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and Table 2), and an effective antiviral effect may be exhibited (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>4</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be a parenteral administration formulation, and specifically, the parenteral administration may be performed subcutaneously or intramuscularly.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In addition, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be applied in a pharmaceutically effective amount, and &#x201c;pharmaceutically effective amount&#x201d; means an amount sufficient to treat a disease with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to medical treatment.
