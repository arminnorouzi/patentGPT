The V2X devices communicate with each other through a PC5 interface. A communication link between the V2X devices is defined as a sidelink (SL). Communication between the V2X device and the V2X application server needs to be forwarded by the network device.

Centralized Scheduling Transmission Mode (which May Also be Referred to as a Mode 3)</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">An LTE system is a current mainstream wireless communications technology, and a related standard is formulated for a feature and a transmission requirement of a V2X service, to support LTE-based V2X communication. In V2X communication based on the LTE system, sidelink communication is a main communication manner. In the sidelink communication, data transmitted between terminal devices may not be forwarded by a network device. The sidelink communication mainly includes two transmission modes: the centralized scheduling transmission mode (which may also be referred to as the mode 3) and a distributed transmission mode (which may also be referred to as a mode 4).</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">Centralized scheduling transmission mode (which may also be referred to as the mode 3): In this mode, before sending data, a terminal device needs to apply to the network device for a resource, and sends V2X service data based on the resource allocated by the network device. Because resources of terminal devices are centrally allocated by the network device, a same resource is not allocated to adjacent terminal devices. Therefore, the centralized transmission mode can ensure better transmission reliability. However, signaling needs to be exchanged between the terminal device and the network device each time. As a result, a transmission delay of sending data in the centralized scheduling transmission mode is longer than that in the distributed transmission mode.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">It should be noted that, in NR, V2X in this mode may also be referred to as a mode 1.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">2. Distributed Transmission Mode (which May Also be Referred to as the Mode 4)</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">Distributed transmission mode (which may also be referred to as the mode 4): In a scenario of network coverage, the network device configures a resource pool for the terminal device by using a SIB message or dedicated radio resource control (Dedicated RRC) signaling. When sending V2X data, the terminal device may send the data by using at least some resources independently obtained from the resource pool through random selection, or obtained based on a listening reservation mechanism or a partial listening reservation mechanism. In a scenario without network coverage, the terminal device sends data by using at least some resources independently obtained from a resource pool in pre-configuration information. The pre-configuration information may be a resource pool that is configured in the terminal when the terminal is delivered from a factory, or may be information that is pre-configured by the network device and that is stored in the terminal. Because the terminal device independently selects a resource, different terminal devices may select a same resource to send data. Consequently, a transmission collision may occur.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">It should be noted that, in NR, V2X in this mode may also be referred to as a mode 2.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">3. Buffer Status Report (BSR)</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">When the UE requests an uplink resource from the network device by using an SR, only whether the UE needs to send uplink data is indicated, but an amount of the to-be-sent uplink data is not indicated. The UE needs to send a BSR to the network device, to indicate the amount of data that is in an uplink buffer of the UE and that needs to be sent, so that the network device determines a size of the uplink resource allocated to the UE.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">4. Logic Channel Group (LCG)</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">An LCG is a group of one or more logic channels. Each logic channel group is bound with one buffer size, to reduce a quantity of information bits transmitted over an air interface. The buffer size carries one of 64 index values ranging from 0 to 63. Each index value corresponds to a byte quantity of a different range.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">It should be understood that the buffer size is not an amount of all to-be-transmitted data of the UE or a quantity of to-be-transmitted data bytes of a logic channel, but corresponds to an amount of to-be-transmitted data of a logic channel group. Each logic channel group is bound with one buffer size. When a logic channel group of the UE has data needing to be sent, a buffer size of the logic channel group may be reported.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">In the prior art, LTE V2X supports only a broadcast service, and data of different V2X services can be transmitted. In an NR technology, more communication types are supported, for example, broadcast transmission, unicast transmission, or multicast transmission. However, according to an existing unicast communication mechanism, to be specific, a procedure in which a terminal device initiates establishment of direct communication unicast transmission in a D2D technology, there is a unicast connection between two terminal devices. When data of a plurality of V2X services is transmitted between the two terminal devices, data of different V2X services is multiplexed into one set of logic channels, that is, the data of different V2X services is multiplexed into one MAC PDU for sending. As a result, a receive end terminal device cannot identify the data of different V2X services.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">In view of this, this application provides a unicast transmission method and a communications apparatus. During V2X unicast communication, a transmit end terminal device sends first data, information about a destination identifier, and information about a target service identifier, to ensure that a receive end terminal device can distinguish between data of different V2X services by using the information about the destination identifier and the target service identifier, so as to meet requirements of the different services. In this way, unicast transmission of data of different services or different service types between two terminal devices is implemented.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">The following describes in detail the embodiments of this application with reference to specific examples.

The network device may centrally allocate measurement identifiers to different measurement configurations of different unicast connections of the first terminal device.

This may also be understood as that each measurement configuration of the different unicast connections of the first terminal device corresponds to one unique measurement identifier. Optionally, the network device may alternatively allocate a measurement identifier to a measurement configuration of each different unicast connection of the first terminal device.
