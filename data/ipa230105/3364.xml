The bendable fill light provided by aspects of this application may include multi-segment lamp body assembly connected in sequence, and any two adjacent lamp body assemblies or segments may be rotatably connected, with a connecting member passing through and connecting the segments. In one aspect, the connecting member is bendable so as to enable the different segments and adjustment fill light lamp assembly. In one embodiment, the connecting member may hold its position or stiffness once it's bent in place so that different segments of the lamp body assembly may be adjusted to be in one or more illumination angles so that the light-emitting surfaces or sides may direct lights the object. In addition, the light provided from the fill light lamp is continuous and uniform. Aspects of the invention avoid multiple light spots on the object when photographed.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">2. The bendable fill light lamp provided by this application includes the multiple segments, which enable the segments to position or arranged in a parallel arrangement state. In one aspect, the segments may not be bent so they are straight while providing a panel of fill light lamp. When the light lamp assembly is in a bent position or state (e.g., forward bending) with the light-emitting surfaces facing the object, the source of the light may be in a focused position, giving a spotlight effect on the object. When the light lamp assembly is in a backward bending position or state away from the object, the fill light lamp may provide an effect of light flooding or spreading effect.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">3. In one embodiment, the light-emitting surfaces of the segments of the fill light lamp assembly may be positioned on the same plane. In one aspect, this arrangement may avoid or alleviate having light sources coming from different light surfaces and may create negative appearances on the object, such as having light and dark boundary lines on the photographed objects during shooting.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">4. In one aspect, adjacent two segments of the fill light lamp may be connected through the connecting member and the corresponding groove. This configuration may ensure that the adjacent segments may be in a parallel arrangement state and may connect with each other with a stable connection. Further, in one embodiment, the gap between the two adjacent segments may be reduced as much as possible through the above configuration. With this approach, the lighting exposure may be continuous.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">5. In a further aspect, the connecting member may be disposed in the interior of the segments in the groove or installation channel. In such arrangement, the connecting member may be concealed or may be hidden from viewing to users. In one embodiment, the exterior appearance of the fill light lamp is aesthetically pleasing. In yet another embodiment, when the fill light lamp assembly is bent in different directions, the force required to be applied on the fill light lamp assembly is more consistent.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">6. In yet another embodiment, the fill light lamp may include or consist of a bendable metal tube. In one aspect, the metal tube may include a high bending stress and may not be prone to permanent deformation due to repeated bending. This is beneficial for the multi-segment fill lamp assembly to maintain its position.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">7. In a further aspect, the fill light lamp assembly is composed of the head-end segment, the intermediary segment and the tail-end segment and that they are arranged in a series or in sequence. In one aspect, when the number of the intermediary segments becomes larger or substantial, the fill lighting effect is especially pronounced and effective.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">8. In yet another embodiment, the head-end segment, the intermediary segment, and the tail-end segment may be connected in series, electrically. In one aspect, the head-end electrical circuit board may be configure to control the power on and off switch. In yet a further aspect, the battery may power the head-end electrical circuit board. In one aspect, this configuration conserve energy by having the plurality of segments shares the same head-end electronic circuit board and the battery, thus reducing the complicated need for the intermediary segments having the switch or battery. In this embodiment, this further reduces the production cost.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">9. In yet another embodiment, the one end of the head-end segment and the one end of the tail-end segment may include a quick-release or detachably connected connector. This configuration, in one embodiment, may provide the lateral connection of two or more fill light lamps. This further aspect may enable the fill light lamps to be joined together to create larger size and bigger angle mapping or matrix of the fill light effect.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">10.

In one aspect, the head-end segment <b>110</b>, the intermediary segments <b>120</b> and the tail-end segment <b>130</b> may be configured to include one or more lighting sources. In one embodiment, the one or more lighting sources of the head-end segment <b>110</b>, the intermediary segment <b>120</b>, and the tail-end segment <b>130</b> may be disposed on the same side of the bendable fill light lamp, so that the one or more lighting sources may be continuously or consecutively arranged. In one aspect, one or more connecting member <b>200</b> may be configured or disposed in the interior of the head-end segment <b>110</b>, the intermediary segment <b>120</b>, and the tail-end segment <b>130</b>. In one embodiment, the connecting member <b>200</b> may be of a flexible material. In another embodiment, the intermediary segments <b>120</b> may be bent or curved in response to the curvature of the connecting member <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In another aspect, the bendable fill light lamp <b>100</b> may be structured with a plurality of segments each with a lighting source and the plurality of segments are connected with one another with any two adjacent segments movably or rotatably connected. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the segments include interior chambers or channels to receive the connecting member <b>200</b>. When the bendable fill light lamp <b>100</b> is in use, the plurality of segments <b>120</b> may be moved through the curvature, angle or shape of the connecting member <b>200</b> to adjust or provide the various lighting angles needed for the photographing needs. In one embodiment, the bendable fill light lamp <b>100</b> may also provide and adjust at will of the angle of light due to its flexibility. In addition, the fill lighting may be continuous and uniformly presented or shone on the object.
