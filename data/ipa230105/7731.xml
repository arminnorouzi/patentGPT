Typical wireless communication systems may employ multiple-access technologies capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources (e.g., bandwidth, transmit power, and/or the like). Examples of such multiple-access technologies include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, single-carrier frequency-division multiple access (SC-FDMA) systems, time division synchronous code division multiple access (TD-SCDMA) systems, and Long Term Evolution (LTE). LTE/LTE-Advanced is a set of enhancements to the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) mobile standard promulgated by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A wireless communication network may include a number of base stations (BSs) that can support communication for a number of user equipment (UEs). A user equipment (UE) may communicate with a base station (BS) via the downlink and uplink. The downlink (or forward link) refers to the communication link from the BS to the UE, and the uplink (or reverse link) refers to the communication link from the UE to the BS. As will be described in more detail herein, a BS may be referred to as a Node B, a gNB, an access point (AP), a radio head, a transmit receive point (TRP), a New Radio (NR) BS, a 5G Node B, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The above multiple access technologies have been adopted in various telecommunication standards to provide a common protocol that enables different user equipment to communicate on a municipal, national, regional, and even global level. New Radio (NR), which may also be referred to as 5G, is a set of enhancements to the LTE mobile standard promulgated by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). NR is designed to better support mobile broadband Internet access by improving spectral efficiency, lowering costs, improving services, making use of new spectrum, and better integrating with other open standards using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with a cyclic prefix (CP) (CP-OFDM) on the downlink (DL), using CP-OFDM and/or SC-FDM (e.g., also known as discrete Fourier transform spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM)) on the uplink (UL), as well as supporting beamforming, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna technology, and carrier aggregation. However, as the demand for mobile broadband access continues to increase, there exists a need for further improvements in LTE and NR technologies. Preferably, these improvements should be applicable to other multiple access technologies and the telecommunication standards that employ these technologies.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some aspects, a method of wireless communication, performed by a user equipment (UE), may include: receiving a paging message from a base station associated with a first radio access network (RAN) while operating in an inactive or idle mode on the first RAN and while operating in a connected mode on a second RAN; transmitting a response rejecting the paging message to the base station associated with the first RAN, wherein the response includes information that causes the base station to release the UE to the inactive or idle mode; and receiving, from the base station, a radio resource control (RRC) message that includes information to release the UE to the inactive or idle mode on the first RAN.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some aspects, a method of wireless communication, performed by a base station, may include: transmitting a paging message to a UE operating in an inactive or idle mode on a RAN associated with the base station; receiving a response rejecting the paging message from the UE, wherein the response includes information requesting a release to the inactive or idle mode; transmitting, to the UE, an RRC message that includes information to release the UE to the inactive or idle mode; and forwarding the response rejecting the paging message to a core network.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some aspects, a UE for wireless communication may include a memory and one or more processors operatively coupled to the memory.

These apparatuses and techniques will be described in the following detailed description and illustrated in the accompanying drawings by various blocks, modules, components, circuits, steps, processes, algorithms, and/or the like (collectively referred to as &#x201c;elements&#x201d;). These elements may be implemented using hardware, software, or combinations thereof. Whether such elements are implemented as hardware or software depends upon the particular application and design constraints imposed on the overall system.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">It should be noted that while aspects may be described herein using terminology commonly associated with 3G and/or 4G wireless technologies, aspects of the present disclosure can be applied in other generation-based communication systems, such as 5G and later, including NR technologies.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a wireless network <b>100</b> in which aspects of the present disclosure may be practiced. The wireless network <b>100</b> may be an LTE network or some other wireless network, such as a 5G or NR network. The wireless network <b>100</b> may include a number of BSs <b>110</b> (shown as BS <b>110</b><i>a</i>, BS <b>110</b><i>b</i>, BS <b>110</b><i>c</i>, and BS <b>110</b><i>d</i>) and other network entities. A BS is an entity that communicates with user equipment (UEs) and may also be referred to as a base station, a NR BS, a Node B, a gNB, a 5G node B (NB), an access point, a transmit receive point (TRP), and/or the like. Each BS may provide communication coverage for a particular geographic area. In 3GPP, the term &#x201c;cell&#x201d; can refer to a coverage area of a BS and/or a BS subsystem serving this coverage area, depending on the context in which the term is used.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A BS may provide communication coverage for a macro cell, a pico cell, a femto cell, and/or another type of cell. A macro cell may cover a relatively large geographic area (e.g., several kilometers in radius) and may allow unrestricted access by UEs with service subscription. A pico cell may cover a relatively small geographic area and may allow unrestricted access by UEs with service subscription. A femto cell may cover a relatively small geographic area (e.g., a home) and may allow restricted access by UEs having association with the femto cell (e.g., UEs in a closed subscriber group (CSG)). A BS for a macro cell may be referred to as a macro BS. A BS for a pico cell may be referred to as a pico BS. A BS for a femto cell may be referred to as a femto BS or a home BS. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a BS <b>110</b><i>a </i>may be a macro BS for a macro cell <b>102</b><i>a</i>, a BS <b>110</b><i>b </i>may be a pico BS for a pico cell <b>102</b><i>b</i>, and a BS <b>110</b><i>c </i>may be a femto BS for a femto cell <b>102</b><i>c</i>. A BS may support one or multiple (e.g., three) cells. The terms &#x201c;eNB&#x201d;, &#x201c;base station&#x201d;, &#x201c;NR BS&#x201d;, &#x201c;gNB&#x201d;, &#x201c;TRP&#x201d;, &#x201c;AP&#x201d;, &#x201c;node B&#x201d;, &#x201c;5G NB&#x201d;, and &#x201c;cell&#x201d; may be used interchangeably herein.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some aspects, a cell may not necessarily be stationary, and the geographic area of the cell may move according to the location of a mobile BS. In some aspects, the BSs may be interconnected to one another and/or to one or more other BSs or network nodes (not shown) in the wireless network <b>100</b> through various types of backhaul interfaces such as a direct physical connection, a virtual network, and/or the like using any suitable transport network.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Wireless network <b>100</b> may also include relay stations. A relay station is an entity that can receive a transmission of data from an upstream station (e.g., a BS or a UE) and send a transmission of the data to a downstream station (e.g., a UE or a BS). A relay station may also be a UE that can relay transmissions for other UEs. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a relay station <b>110</b><i>d </i>may communicate with macro BS <b>110</b><i>a </i>and a UE <b>120</b><i>d </i>in order to facilitate communication between BS <b>110</b><i>a </i>and UE <b>120</b><i>d</i>. A relay station may also be referred to as a relay BS, a relay base station, a relay, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Wireless network <b>100</b> may be a heterogeneous network that includes BSs of different types, e.g., macro BSs, pico BSs, femto BSs, relay BSs, and/or the like. These different types of BSs may have different transmit power levels, different coverage areas, and different impacts on interference in wireless network <b>100</b>. For example, macro BSs may have a high transmit power level (e.g., 5 to 40 Watts) whereas pico BSs, femto BSs, and relay BSs may have lower transmit power levels (e.g., 0.1 to 2 Watts).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A network controller <b>130</b> may couple to a set of BSs and may provide coordination and control for these BSs. Network controller <b>130</b> may communicate with the BSs via a backhaul. The BSs may also communicate with one another, e.g., directly or indirectly via a wireless or wireline backhaul.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">UEs <b>120</b> (e.g., <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b</i>, <b>120</b><i>c</i>) may be dispersed throughout wireless network <b>100</b>, and each UE may be stationary or mobile. A UE may also be referred to as an access terminal, a terminal, a mobile station, a subscriber unit, a station, and/or the like.

The Uu interface is a radio interface between the UE and the RAN. The architecture <b>300</b> may further include a core network that provides communications between the RAN and a data network, which may include one or more devices that may act as a server, such as a mobile network operator server, a cloud server, a third-party server, a server that may provide data and/or services to the UE through applications on the UE, and/or the like. For example, the core network may provide communications between the RAN and the data network via wired and/or wireless connections with an application function (AF) entity, a user plane function (UPF) entity, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some aspects, the core network may include a unified data management (UDM) entity that makes relevant data available to an access and mobility management function (AMF) entity and a session management function (SMF) entity. For example, the UDM entity may store subscriber data and profiles in the wireless communication network. The UDM entity may be used for fixed access, mobile access, and/or the like, in the core network. The AMF entity manages UE network registration, manages mobility, maintains a non-access stratum (NAS) signaling connection with the UE, and manages a registration procedure of the UE with a network. The SMF entity manages sessions, allocates IP addresses to the UE, and supports establishing, modifying, and/or releasing communications sessions in the wireless communication network.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some aspects, the UPF entity manages user traffic to and from the UE through the RAN and enforces a quality of service (QoS). The UPF entity may serve as an anchor point for intra/inter radio access technology (RAT) mobility. The UPF entity may apply rules to packets, such as rules pertaining to packet routing, traffic reporting, handling user plane QoS, and/or the like. The UPF entity may determine an attribute of application-specific data that is communicated in a communications session. The UPF entity may receive information (e.g., information related to communications with a UE) from one or more RAN nodes (e.g., via an N4 interface with the SMF entity, an application program interface (API), and/or the like). Furthermore, the UPF entity may have an N3 interface that can be used to transfer downlink and uplink user plane traffic to and from the one or more RAN nodes (e.g., the UPF entity may receive downlink user plane traffic destined for a UE from the server in the data network and transfer the downlink user plane traffic to one or more RAN nodes serving the UE, receive uplink user traffic from the one or more RAN nodes serving the UE, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some aspects, the core network further includes a policy and control function (PCF) entity that implements charging rules, implements flow control rules, manages traffic priority, manages a QoS for user subscription services, and provides a policy framework that incorporates network slicing, roaming, packet processing, mobility management, and/or the like. In some aspects, the core network may further include a unified data repository (UDR) entity that stores structured data for exposure to network functions, and a network exposure function (NEF) entity that securely exposes services, capabilities, and/or events in the wireless communication network to help other entities in the wireless communication network discover network services and/or utilize network resources efficiently. In some aspects, the AF entity supports application functionality, influences traffic routing, and interacts with the PCF entity. For example, the AF entity may determine whether a UE provides preferences for a set of network slice policies and support application influence on traffic routing, access to the NEF entity, policy control, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some aspects, while Long Term Evolution (LTE) uses evolved packet system (EPS) bearers that are each assigned an EPS bearer identifier (ID), New Radio (NR) uses QoS flows, each identified by a QoS flow ID (QFI). The QoS flow is where policy and charging are enforced. All traffic within the same QoS flow may receive the same treatment. In the core network, a single user plane network function (the UPF entity) is used to transport data between a base station (e.g., a gNB) associated with the RAN and the core network. Each QoS flow on an N3 interface may be mapped to a single general packet radio service (GPRS) tunneling protocol (GTP) tunnel for the user plane (GTP-U). The base station may map individual QoS flows to one more dedicated radio bearers (DRBs), multicast radio bearers (MRBs), and/or the like. A protocol data unit (PDU) session may contain multiple QoS flows and several DRBs, but only a single N3 GTP-U tunnel. A DRB, an MRB, and/or the like may transport one or more QoS flows. In sum, these entities permit user data traffic or other types of information to be transmitted on a user plane.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As indicated above, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is provided as an example.

A SIM used in various aspects may store user account information, an IMSI, a set of SIM application toolkit (SAT) commands, and other network provisioning information, as well as provide storage space for a phone book database that contains user contacts. As part of the network provisioning information, a SIM may store home identifiers (e.g., a System Identification Number (SID)/Network Identification Number (NID) pair, a Home Public Land Mobile Network (HPLMN) code, and/or the like) to indicate the SIM card network operator provider.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some aspects, each SIM (e.g., the first SIM <b>404</b><i>a </i>and the second SIM <b>404</b><i>b</i>) may be associated with a baseband-RF resource chain, which may include a baseband modem processor <b>416</b> that may perform baseband/modem functions for communications on at least one SIM.

Accordingly, the multi-SIM UE <b>510</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> may represent an example of a multi-SIM-multi-standby (MSMS) communication device. For example, the multi-SIM UE may be a dual-SIM-dual-standby (DSDS) communication device with two SIM cards and two corresponding subscriptions that may both be active on standby (e.g., while in an RRC idle or inactive mode), but one is deactivated when the other one is in use (e.g., while the other is in an RRC connected mode). In another example, the multi-SIM UE <b>510</b> may be a triple-SIM-triple-standby (TSTS) communication device, which includes three SIM cards and corresponding subscriptions that may all be active on standby, but two are deactivated when the third one is in use. In other examples, the multi-SIM UE <b>510</b> may have other suitable multi-SIM configurations, with, for example, four or more SIMs, such that when one is in use, the others are all deactivated.

Furthermore, in some aspects, the multi-SIM UE <b>510</b> may be camped on the second wireless network <b>530</b> (e.g., in an RRC idle mode, inactive mode, and/or the like) through a second wireless connection to a RAN node in the RAN <b>534</b> associated with the second wireless network <b>530</b>, which may correspond to a second subscription associated with USIMB.

Accordingly, in some cases, as shown by reference number <b>554</b>, the multi-SIM UE <b>510</b> may receive a paging message related to the second subscription associated with USIMB from a RAN node in the second wireless network <b>530</b> serving USIMB while USIMA is operating in the connected mode and while USIMB is operating in an idle or inactive mode. In some cases, the multi-SIM UE <b>510</b> may decide to not enter the connected mode on the second wireless network <b>530</b> (e.g., because the multi-SIM UE <b>510</b> is engaged in a high-priority service, such as a voice call, on the first wireless network <b>520</b>, the paging message relates to a low-priority service, based at least in part on one or more policies, and/or the like). However, if the multi-SIM UE <b>510</b> does not send a response to the paging message or otherwise provide feedback related to the paging message to the second wireless network <b>530</b>, the second wireless network <b>530</b> may continue to send additional paging repetitions to the multi-SIM UE <b>510</b> (e.g., the lack of a response or feedback to the paging message may indicate that the multi-SIM UE <b>510</b> did not receive the paging message). This may waste resources of one or more devices in the core network <b>532</b> that initiate the additional paging repetitions, one or more devices in the RAN <b>534</b> that send the additional paging repetitions to the multi-SIM UE <b>510</b>, the multi-SIM UE <b>510</b> that receives and decodes the additional paging repetitions, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Accordingly, some aspects described herein provide techniques and apparatuses to enable a multi-SIM UE, such as the multi-SIM UE <b>510</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, to initiate a procedure to enter into a connected mode on the second wireless network <b>530</b> in order to provide a response to reject a paging message, thereby providing feedback to ensure that the second wireless network <b>530</b> will not send additional paging repetitions. Furthermore, the multi-SIM UE may include, in the response to the paging message, information to request a fast release to inactive or idle mode. For example, as described above, the multi-SIM UE <b>510</b> may be an MSMS (e.g., DSDS, TSTS, and/or the like) communication device with multiple SIMs (e.g., USIMA and USIMB) that share common radio and baseband components. Accordingly, if the multi-SIM UE <b>510</b> enters connected mode on the second wireless network <b>530</b> that serves USIMB in order to send the response rejecting the paging message, a radio connection to the first wireless network <b>520</b> that serves USIMA will be released. This may interrupt data transmission related to the first subscription associated with USIMA because the multi-SIM UE <b>510</b> has a single Tx/Rx chain shared among USIMA and USIMB. Accordingly, as shown by reference number <b>556</b>, the UE may decide to send a response to reject the paging message for USIMB and include, in the response, information to request a fast release to inactive or idle mode. In this way, interruption to communications related to the first subscription associated with USIMA may be reduced or avoided.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">As indicated above, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is provided as an example.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>B</figref>, example(s) <b>600</b> include a multi-SIM UE (referred to hereinafter as &#x201c;UE&#x201d; for simplicity), a RAN, and a core network. In some aspects, the UE may be operating in an inactive or idle mode on a first wireless network that includes the RAN and the core network using a first subscription associated with a first SIM, and may be simultaneously operating in a connected mode on a second wireless network using a second subscription associated with a second SIM. In some aspects, the UE may receive, from a base station in the RAN, a paging message that initiates from the core network while the UE is operating in the inactive or idle mode on the first wireless network that includes the RAN and the core network and while operating in the connected mode on a second wireless network. Accordingly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>B</figref> illustrate different techniques that the UE may employ to transmit a response rejecting the paging message in order to avoid additional paging repetitions from the first wireless network and include fast release information with the response to the paging message in order to minimize disruption to connected mode operations on the second wireless network.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, and by reference number <b>610</b>, the UE may transmit, and a base station in the RAN may receive, an RRC early data request message that includes a non-access stratum (NAS) paging response and fast release information. In some aspects, the NAS paging response may include information to indicate that the UE is rejecting the paging message (e.g., does not want to enter connected mode on the first wireless network). In this way, the UE may acknowledge that the paging message was received and indicate that additional paging repetitions need not be sent to the UE. Furthermore, as described above, the RRC early data request message may include fast release information, which may include a fast release indication or a fast release cause value to indicate that the UE is requesting a fast release to the idle or inactive mode. Accordingly, the fast release information may be included in the RRC early data request message to indicate that the UE is to be released to the idle or inactive mode as soon as possible such that the UE can resume or continue connected mode operations on the second wireless network as soon as possible.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Accordingly, as further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, and by reference number <b>612</b>, the base station in the RAN may transmit, and the UE may receive, an RRC early data complete message that includes information to release the UE to the idle or inactive mode based at least in part on the fast release information provided in the RRC early data request message. Furthermore, as shown by reference number <b>614</b>, the base station in the RAN may forward the NAS paging response rejecting the paging message to the core network after transmitting the RRC early data complete message that includes information to release the UE to the idle or inactive mode.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Accordingly, the base station in the RAN generally transmits the RRC early data complete message that includes the information to release the UE to the idle or inactive mode prior to transmitting the NAS paging response to the core network in order to ensure that the UE is released to the idle or inactive mode as soon as possible. For example, in some aspects, the base station in the RAN may transmit the RRC early data complete message to release the UE to the idle or inactive mode immediately in cases where the fast release information is included in the RRC early data request message, and may subsequently forward the NAS paging response to the core network independent of the RRC early data complete message that includes the information to release the UE to the idle or inactive mode. Alternatively, in some aspects, the UE may include a timer in the RRC early data request message to indicate that the base station in the RAN is to delay transmission of the RRC early data complete message until after the timer has expired. For example, the timer may be included to provide the UE with an opportunity to evaluate conditions in the first wireless network and/or the second wireless network (e.g., in cases where the UE is engaged in a service on the second wireless network that is not time sensitive). In this case, the base station may transmit the RRC early data complete message to release the UE to the idle or inactive mode after the timer has expired, and may then transmit the NAS paging response to the core network. Additionally, or alternatively, depending on a length of the timer, the base station may transmit the NAS paging response to the core network while waiting for the timer to expire and immediately transmit the RRC early data complete message to release the UE to the idle or inactive mode upon expiration of the timer.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In general, the techniques shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> may be employed in cases where the UE supports early data transmission (EDT), which generally allows one or more uplink and/or downlink transmissions to be performed (e.g., during a random access channel procedure) before an RRC connection has been fully established. In this way, the UE may transmit a single message to reject the paging message and provide the fast release information, which may reduce an amount of time that connected mode operations are disrupted on the second wireless network. However, in some cases, the UE may be a legacy UE that does not support EDT features. Accordingly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> illustrates another technique that the UE may employ to transmit a response rejecting the paging message in order to avoid additional paging repetitions from the first wireless network and include fast release information with the response to the paging message in order to minimize disruption to connected mode operations on the second wireless network.
