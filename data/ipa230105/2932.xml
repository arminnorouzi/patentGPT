Japanese Patent Application No. 2021-410843 filed on Jul. 2, 2021, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a diamond substrate, and more particularly to a method of manufacturing a diamond substrate by processing single crystal diamond using laser light.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) have been provided as semiconductor materials suitable for power devices instead of silicon (Si). However, diamond semiconductors have attracted attention as a next-generation material because they have a higher dielectric breakdown field, a higher power control index, and the highest thermal conductivity as compared with the above semiconductor materials, and research and development have been advancing toward practical application. Further, since a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is capable of highly sensitive magnetic detection at room temperature, this is expected to be applied to magnetic sensors, and research and development in this field have also been conducted (see WO 2015/107907 A1).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Single crystal diamond which is expected to be applied to these semiconductors is synthesized by a high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) method and homoepitaxial growth, and these synthesis methods make it difficult to increase the area of a bulk substrate of single crystal diamond for use in semiconductor processes. Accordingly, a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method has been applied in which single crystal diamond is heteroepitaxially grown by using a single crystal magnesium oxide (MgO) as a base crystal, because this CVD method is advantageous in increasing the area.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the heteroepitaxial growth by means of the CVD method, a bulk crystal of single crystal diamond, which is grown in the same orientation as the crystal orientation of the base MgO crystal, is obtained. That is, a bulk crystal of diamond with a crystal orientation [100] is obtained when the crystal orientation of the base MgO crystal is [100], and a bulk crystal of diamond with a crystal orientation [111]is obtained when the crystal orientation of the base MgO crystal is [111]. In the application of single crystal diamond to a magnetic sensor, it is necessary to form a high-density NV center and align the orientation axes of the NV center. Since a technique for orienting a high-density NV center in the [111] direction has been established by the CVD method, there has been an increasing need for a (111) bulk crystal using single crystal diamond having a main surface as a (111) surface (see WO 2015/046294 A1 and JP 2021-080153 A).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Meanwhile, a bulk crystal of single crystal diamond obtained by heteroepitaxial growth is sliced and processed into a plate-like substrate, but diamond is hard and not easy to be processed. As a method for processing into a substrate, a smart cut technique is used in which a defective layer is introduced by ion implantation and is removed by etching to thereby perform delamination, but there has been a problem that a device in a high vacuum environment is required for ion implantation, and the processing time is long. Although it is possible to perform delamination with a thickness of several urn, there have been no cases of delamination with a thickness of several hundred &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Other methods for processing into a substrate include polishing a bulk crystal of single crystal diamond, which is separated from a base crystal, to a desired thickness, or applying chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). Further, single crystal diamond obtained by means of the conventional HPHT method is processed to slice an ingot, or a block made by further cutting an ingot to a fixed length, into a substrate, but there has been a problem that a loss occurs as a cutting margin. Since it is especially difficult to polish a bulk crystal of single crystal diamond with the [111] orientation, the development of a manufacturing method for obtaining a (iii) substrate has been required.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As described above, there has been a need for a manufacturing method in which a bulk crystal, an ingot, or a block of (111) single crystal diamond, which is expected to be applied to a high-precision magnetic sensor, is sliced into a substrate with a reduction in processing loss due to a cutting margin by means of a relatively simple method.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention has been made in view of the above circumstances, and an object of the present invention is to provide a method of manufacturing a diamond substrate by which a (111) substrate is manufactured with little processing loss from a bulk crystal of single crystal diamond with an [111] orientation, which is heteroepitaxially grown by a CVD method, and from an ingot or a block of single crystal diamond obtained by an HTHP method.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to solve the above problem, a method of manufacturing a diamond substrate according to the present invention includes: a step of placing a laser condensing unit configured to condense laser light so as to face an upper surface of a block of single crystal diamond; a step of forming a modified layer, which includes a processing mark of graphite and a crack extending along a surface (111) around the processing mark, in a partial region of the upper surface of the block, along the surface (111) of the single crystal diamond, at a predetermined depth from the upper surface of the block by radiating the laser light on the upper surface of the block from the laser condensing unit and condensing the laser light inside the block, and moving the laser condensing unit and the block in a relative manner two-dimensionally; and a step of forming a cleavage plane at the predetermined depth of the remaining region of the upper surface of the block by spontaneously propagating cleavage from the modified layer.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The method of manufacturing a diamond substrate may further include a step of causing the block to spontaneously delaminate into a portion up to a depth from the upper surface to the modified layer or the cleavage plane, and a portion deeper than the modified layer or the cleavage plane. The block may have a plate-like shape having an upper surface as the (111) surface of the single crystal diamond.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The step of forming the modified layer may include a step of moving the laser condensing unit and the block in a relative manner in a predetermined scanning direction, and a step of moving the laser condensing unit and the block in a relative manner in a direction orthogonal to the scanning direction at a predetermined interval.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The laser light may be pulsed laser light, and the graphite of the processing mark may be formed by laser light reflected by a crack extending from another adjacent processing mark in at least one of the scanning direction and the direction orthogonal to the scanning direction. The laser light may have a pulse width in a range of several ns to several hundred ns.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention makes it possible to manufacture a (111) substrate with little processing loss from a bulk crystal of single crystal diamond with an [111] orientation, and an ingot or a block of single crystal diamond obtained by an HTHP method, thereby making it possible to improve the yield in manufacturing the diamond substrate.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating a schematic configuration of a processing device.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> are perspective views illustrating a crystal structure of diamond.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a plan view of a block of single crystal diamond illustrating scanning of laser light.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A to <b>4</b>D</figref> are plan views illustrating the formation of a modified layer in the block of single crystal diamond.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A to <b>5</b>D</figref> are plan views illustrating the formation of a modified layer in the block of single crystal diamond.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a photograph illustrating a delaminated surface of the block of single crystal diamond which has delaminated at the modified layer or a cleavage surface.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref> are cross-sectional views illustrating a method of manufacturing a plurality of diamond substrates from the block of single crystal diamond.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Next, an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings, In the following drawings, the same or similar portions are denoted by the same or similar numerals.

It is conventionally known that single crystal diamond is very hard because carbon atoms form covalent bonds with four respective adjacent carbon atoms in a diamond structure. However, a carbon atom is covalently bonded to an adjacent carbon atom in the &#x3c;111&#x3e; direction by only a single arm of the sp<sup>3 </sup>hybrid orbital. Accordingly, when the covalent bond of the single arm is cut off, it is relatively easy to separate the carbon atom from the adjacent carbon atom in the direction of the (111) surface orthogonal to the &#x3c;111&#x3e; direction.
