It is important for drivers to monitor their health as much as possible and when able, prevent disease. Among many factors that can affect drivers' health and performance, the levels of vitamin D can be often overlooked.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The active form of vitamin D is a hormone, not a vitamin. Hereinafter, we will refer to both the active and the precursor forms of vitamin D as a vitamin, using their common names. Vitamin D receptors are expressed in many tissues, including skin, bone, muscle, brain, endocrine tissues, and the immune system. This indicates that the body relies on vitamin D for proper functioning. The major source of vitamin D is exogenous&#x2014;synthesized in the skin, when ultraviolet B (UVB) energy photolyzes a cholesterol precursor (7-dehydrocholesterol) to vitamin D<sub>3</sub>. The synthesized vitamin is carried to the liver, and further to the kidneys to be converted into the biologically active form of vitamin D, calcitriol, that engages with the tissues.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The typical concerns with UV radiation (UVR) focus on excessive exposure, which can result in sunburn and skin cancer caused by excessive radiation. However, excessive UVR exposure accounts for a small fraction of the total global burden of disease. In contrast, a markedly larger annual disease burden results from very low levels of UVR exposure. This burden includes major disorders of the musculoskeletal system and possibly an increased risk of various autoimmune diseases and life-threatening cancers.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency has also been associated with mental wellbeing, and even linked with anxiety disorders. In turn, high levels of stress and anxiety can directly and indirectly impact drivers' ability to stay focused on the task of driving. Heightened emotions may create a cognitive distraction that can impede drivers' capacity to notice and respond to hazards, and undermined health may offer further diversion of attention away from the road. All of these factors can lead to risky driving behavior and compromise safety on the roads for the drivers and those around them.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure relates to a smart wearable ring system and methods that allow for continuous monitoring of the user's levels of UVB exposure and using that data to determine a ring wearer's fitness to safely operate a moving vehicle.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The described systems and techniques address the challenge for individuals to identify that they may be in an impaired state, and further to assess how their own psychological or physiological conditions may impact their driving ability. More specifically, the disclosed smart ring collects UVB exposure data representing UVB exposure patterns for a particular user. This data can be utilized, in combination with driving data, as training data for a machine learning (ML) model to train the ML model to predict high risk driving based at least in part upon observed UVB exposure. A user can be warned of this risk to prevent them from driving or to encourage them to delay driving and take a suggested remediating action. In some instances, the disclosed smart ring system may interact with the user's vehicle to prevent it from starting while the user is exposed to high risk due to deteriorated psychological or physiological conditions stemming from inadequate UVB exposure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The amount of bioactive vitamin D generated from skin exposure to sunlight (incident UVB radiation) depends on environmental and personal factors, such as the individual's skin tone, age, weight, body temperature, gut health, the health of liver and kidneys, as well as the latitude, time of day, clothing type (how penetrable is the clothing to UVB wavelength, and surface area coverage), and pollution factors. Utilizing a machine learning model to correlate the user's UVB exposure patterns with driving behavior patterns allows for a highly personalized prediction of driving behavior without quantifying all the steps leading to the production of vitamin D or quantifying the vitamin D levels.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The conventional method for determining vitamin D levels is a blood test, performed in a laboratory. There is currently no conventional method for non-invasive monitoring of the daily levels of exogenous vitamin D production and, moreover, no known method for correlating UVB exposure levels that lead to vitamin D production with driving behavior.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an embodiment, an inconspicuous and comfortable ring-shaped device, intended to be worn on a user's hand, is outfitted with sensors that are able to measure the user's UVB exposure. A system trains and implements a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm to make a personalized prediction of the level of driving risk exposure based at least in part upon the captured UVB exposure data. The ML model training may be achieved, for example, at a server by first (i) acquiring, via a smart ring, one or more sets of first data indicative of one or more UVB exposure patterns; (ii) acquiring, via a driving monitor device, one or more sets of second data indicative of one or more driving patterns; (iii) utilizing the one or more sets of first data and the one or more sets of second data as training data for a ML model to train the ML model to discover one or more relationships between the one or more UVB exposure patterns and the one or more driving patterns, wherein the one or more relationships include a relationship representing a correlation between a given UVB exposure pattern and a high-risk driving pattern.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an embodiment, the trained ML model analyzes a particular set of data collected by a particular smart ring associated with a user, and (i) determines that the particular set of data represents a particular UVB exposure pattern corresponding to the given UVB exposure pattern correlated with the high-risk driving pattern; and (ii) responds to said determining by predicting a level of risk exposure for the user during driving.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The method may further include: (i) predicting a level of driving risk exposure to a driver based at least in part upon analyzed UVB exposure patterns; and (ii) communicating the predicted risk exposure; and (iii) determining remediating action to reduce or eliminate the driving risk; or communicate or implement the remediating action in accordance with various embodiments disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Generally speaking, the described determinations regarding remediation may be made prior to the ring user attempting driving, thereby enabling the smart ring and any associated systems to prevent or discourage the user from driving while exposed to high risk due to a deteriorated psychological or physiological conditions stemming inadequate exposure to UVB light.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">UVB radiation does not penetrate glass. Therefore, if a driver spends the daylight hours inside a vehicle behind glass windows, such driver will not receive adequate UVB exposure, and will not generate a recommended vitamin D amount. The additional advantage of the disclosed system is in encouraging drivers with deficient exposure to UVB light to take a break from driving and spend time outside in sunlight, which is often accompanied with overall health-inducing movement and exercise. Skin and eyes exposure to sunlight has been associated with triggering and releasing hormones, such as serotonin, which is a major player in elevating mood, helping to feel calm and focused. Monitoring and maintaining healthy levels of UVB exposure may be an incentive for drivers to increase outdoor activity and improve health and psychological well-being&#x2014;all very important factors for enhancing driver ability to safely operate a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Depending upon the embodiment, one or more benefits may be achieved. These benefits and various additional objects, features and advantages of the present disclosure can be fully appreciated with reference to the detailed description and accompanying drawings that follow.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a system comprising a smart ring and a block diagram of smart ring components.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a number of different form factor types of a smart ring.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates examples of different smart ring surface elements.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates example environments for smart ring operation.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates example displays.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an example method for training and utilizing a ML model that may be implemented via the example system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates example methods for assessing and communicating predicted level of driving risk exposure.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows example vehicle control elements and vehicle monitor components.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates a flow diagram of a method for estimating the amount of vitamin D produced in the user's skin and communicating recommendation to a user accordingly.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> discuss various techniques, systems, and methods for implementing a smart ring to train and implement a machine learning module capable of predicting a driver's risk exposure based at least in part upon observed UVB exposure patterns. Notably, a person's UVB exposure over a given period of time may serve as a proxy for vitamin D levels in that person's body. Because vitamin D deficiency may result in cognitive impairment (which result in poor, high-risk vehicle operation), it may be desirable to measure a person's vitamin D levels. Where this direct measurement is not feasible, it may be desirable to track a person's UVB exposure as a proxy. Further, this tracked data may be fed to a machine-learning model along with corresponding driving pattern data to observe relationships between specific UVB exposure levels and certain driving patterns. For example, UVB exposure levels below a threshold may result in high(er)-risk driving patterns (which may be due to the fact that the person is vitamin D deficient, a factor which may be correlated with the UVB exposure). As a result, UVB exposure levels may be tracked and used, along with a machine-learning model, to predict poor driving performance and to take corrective or preventative action, thus improving driver safety.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Below, sections I-III and V describe, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, example smart ring systems, form factor types, and components.

In such an embodiment, the driving data may be labeled according to a risk level (e.g., depending on the nature and severity of swerving, braking, observed driver distraction, proximity to other vehicles, rates of acceleration, etc.). Unsupervised learning is a learning process for generalizing the underlying structure or distribution in unlabeled data. In an embodiment utilizing unsupervised learning, the system may rely on unlabeled UVB exposure data, unlabeled driving data, or some combination thereof. During unsupervised learning, natural structures are identified and exploited for relating instances to each other. Semi-supervised learning can use a mixture of supervised and unsupervised techniques. This learning process discovers and learns the structure in the input variables, where typically some of the input data is labeled, and most is unlabeled.

These relationships are discovered by feeding the model training data including instances each having one or more predictor feature values and one or more target feature values.

In one embodiment, at step <b>704</b>, the UVB exposure and the stress data may be loaded into the ML model module <b>452</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In an embodiment where the ML model first training data set included UVB exposure patterns for users other than the user associated with the smart ring, at the step <b>702</b>, the ML model module <b>452</b><i>b </i>of server <b>450</b> may receive particular UVB exposure data sets that may include data on the individuals' skin tone, age, and weight, from one or more data sources described above (the ring <b>405</b>, or the user device <b>422</b>, or the mobile device <b>444</b>).</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">At step <b>706</b> ML model module <b>452</b><i>b </i>may determine that particular UVB exposure data correlates to a particular level of driving risk exposure, which is determined at step <b>606</b> of the ML model. For example, the module <b>452</b><i>b </i>may determine that a particular combination of the detected amount of UVB exposure (determined from a combination of user UVB radiation exposure amount, body temperature, and the estimated clothing type) correlates with high risk driving behavior (e.g., faster driving, high acceleration, more aggressive turning or braking, more accidents, closer average proximity to other vehicles or pedestrians, etc.). Likewise, other factors represented by the stress data (e.g., particular hand grip pressure(s), gesticulation(s), hear rate(s), blood pressure(s), body temperature(s), skin conductance(s), sweat amount(s) or sweat composition(s), spoken words(s) or sound(s), etc.) may correlate with high risk driving behavior.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">At step <b>708</b>, a communication unit of an output device of system <b>100</b> (one or more implementations of the ring output unit <b>190</b>, or one or more of the display technologies depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) may alert the smart ring user of the predicted level of driving risk exposure (e.g., represented by a driving risk score). For example, the alert may be visual (e.g., a written text, an image, a color code, etc.), haptic, thermal, or an audio alert. Step <b>708</b> may or may not be implemented, depending on the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In various embodiments, an analyzing device (whether it is the server <b>450</b>, or the ring <b>405</b>, or the user device <b>422</b>, or the mobile device <b>444</b>), may use the particular UVB exposure data (or, as in one embodiment, the combination of the particular UVB exposure data and the particular stress data) and the assessed level of driving risk exposure to make a determination of a suggested action or actions to improve the particular driving risk (step <b>710</b>).</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In some embodiments, the analyzing device, at step <b>712</b>, may assess whether the calculated driving risk exceeds a pre-determined threshold indicating that the ring user's condition is not fit for safe driving. If evaluation at step <b>712</b> yields that the driving risk score does not exceed the threshold but presents a probability of high-risk driving behavior, then further assessment at step <b>714</b> determines a suitable user action to reduce or eliminate the current driving risk. For instance, the suggested user action may be to spend a certain amount of time outside in daylight to increase the skin UVB exposure, or take a vitamin D supplement, or, if the safe recommended levels of UVB exposure have been reached for the day, reduce UVB exposure by properly covering up, applying sunscreen, staying indoors, or rolling up the windows in the vehicle, if operating a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">At step <b>718</b>, similarly to step <b>708</b>, a communication unit of an output device may relay to the smart ring user the suggested user action. In the case of a positive determination at step <b>712</b>, the analyzing device further determines a system action (step <b>716</b>), which can include one or a combination of actions to block or overtake the user's vehicle control elements <b>802</b>, such as ignition <b>804</b>, brakes <b>806</b>, or other <b>808</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>), and at step <b>720</b> performs the system action by communicating it to vehicle controller <b>812</b>. We must note that the described paths are not mutually exclusive, and that each of the steps <b>718</b> and <b>720</b> may or may not be implemented, depending on the embodiment. For example, an implementation may select to communicate user action only, or communicate user action and system action, or communicate system action and perform system action, or perform system action only, etc.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In some embodiments, in addition to determining the driving risk score based at least in part upon the user's UVB exposure indicators prior to a driving session, the analyzing device may add to its analysis data indicative of the driver's UVB exposure (or, as in one embodiment, a combination of UVB exposure and stress data) in real time during a driving session. As an example, the smart ring or other capable devices may collect data on the user's UVB exposure, and physiological and behavioral parameters. The same or a different machine learning model would correlate this additional data with the saved driving data, and/or driving data of that session, and adjust the level of driving risk exposure in real time. The model may also correlate the real-time data on the indicated user parameters with driver compliance with the suggested remediating action. The analyzing device may then determine a new remediating user or system action. In the case of the latter, the system may interfere or overtake vehicle operation, thus preventing the user from further driving.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">For instance, the smart ring system might assess the ring user's driving fitness prior to a driving session and determine a driving risk score close to a threshold score. The system may suggest to the user to spend a certain amount of time outside in daylight or carry out any other suitable strategy to remediate the driving risk exposure. The driver might ignore this suggestion and initiate a driving session. After a period of time, for example, the driver's UVB exposure levels might remain unchanged, and the stress levels might increase. The ML model may process the driver's new parameters, as well as real time driving data, and determine a driving risk score at or above a threshold score. In this scenario, the driver may be prevented from further driving by either stopping and parking the vehicle in a safe location or switching the vehicle into autonomous mode.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In some embodiments, any of the suggested communication systems may communicate the acquired UVB exposure data, the determined driving risk score, the suggested remediation, and whether any actions were taken by the user, to the user's insurance provider (e.g., vehicle or health insurance provider). Such data can be used for real-time insurance adjustment, in a gamified environment of extrinsic rewards and motivators, or used in conjunction with other means of enforcing compliance with suggested remediating actions.</p><heading id="h-0019" level="1">VIII.

Examples of Additional Functionality</heading><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In one embodiment, additionally or alternatively to predicting the level of driving risk exposure, the described system and method may estimate the amount of vitamin D produced in the user's skin, and further communicate a suitable recommendation based at least in part upon the obtained result, or inform the user that the recommended level of daily vitamin D has been reached. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates a flow diagram of an exemplary method <b>900</b> describing this functionality.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The method <b>900</b> may be implemented by way of all, or part, or the computing devices, features, and/or other functionality described regarding <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.

In an embodiment, the determined level of vitamin D may be a ternary parameter having three possible values (e.g., high, normal, and low) or it may be any suitable score metric that corresponds to a range of recommended values of vitamin D blood content, or the recommended daily vitamin D intake. The analyzing device further makes a determination based at least in part upon whether the determined amount was below, at or above the recommended daily level.

Examples of General Terms and Phrases</heading><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Throughout this specification, some of the following terms and phrases are used.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Bus, according to some embodiments: Generally speaking, a bus is a communication system that transfers information between components inside a computer system, or between computer systems. A processor or a particular system (e.g., the processor <b>454</b> of the server <b>450</b>) or subsystem may communicate with other components of the system or subsystem (e.g., the components <b>452</b> and <b>456</b>) via one or more communication links. When communicating with components in a shared housing, for example, the processor may be communicatively connected to components by a system bus. Unless stated otherwise, as used herein the phrase &#x201c;system bus&#x201d; and the term &#x201c;bus&#x201d; refer to: a data bus (for carrying data), an address bus (for determining where the data should be sent), a control bus (for determining the operation to execute), or some combination thereof. Depending on the context, &#x201c;system bus&#x201d; or &#x201c;bus&#x201d; may refer to any of several types of bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, or a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. By way of example, and not limitation, such architectures include Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) bus, Enhanced ISA (EISA) bus, Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) local bus, and Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus also known as Mezzanine bus.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Communication Interface, according to some embodiments: Some of the described devices or systems include a &#x201c;communication interface&#x201d; (sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;network interface&#x201d;). A communication interface enables the system to send information to other systems and to receive information from other systems and may include circuitry for wired or wireless communication.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Each described communication interface or communications unit (e.g., communications unit <b>160</b>) may enable the device of which it is a part to connect to components or to other computing systems or servers via any suitable network, such as a personal area network (PAN), a local area network (LAN), or a wide area network (WAN). In particular, the communication unit <b>160</b> may include circuitry for wirelessly connecting the smart ring <b>101</b> to the user device <b>104</b> or the network <b>105</b> in accordance with protocols and standards for NFC (operating in the 13.56 MHz band), RFID (operating in frequency bands of 125-134 kHz, 13.56 MHz, or 856 MHz to 960 MHz), Bluetooth (operating in a band of 2.4 to 2.485 GHz), Wi-Fi Direct (operating in a band of 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz), or any other suitable communications protocol or standard that enables wireless communication.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Communication Link, according to some embodiments: A &#x201c;communication link&#x201d; or &#x201c;link&#x201d; is a pathway or medium connecting two or more nodes. A link between two end-nodes may include one or more sublinks coupled together via one or more intermediary nodes. A link may be a physical link or a logical link. A physical link is the interface or medium(s) over which information is transferred and may be wired or wireless in nature. Examples of physicals links may include a cable with a conductor for transmission of electrical energy, a fiber optic connection for transmission of light, or a wireless electromagnetic signal that carries information via changes made to one or more properties of an electromagnetic wave(s).</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">A logical link between two or more nodes represents an abstraction of the underlying physical links or intermediary nodes connecting the two or more nodes. For example, two or more nodes may be logically coupled via a logical link. The logical link may be established via any combination of physical links and intermediary nodes (e.g., routers, switches, or other networking equipment).</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">A link is sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;communication channel.&#x201d; In a wireless communication system, the term &#x201c;communication channel&#x201d; (or just &#x201c;channel&#x201d;) generally refers to a particular frequency or frequency band. A carrier signal (or carrier wave) may be transmitted at the particular frequency or within the particular frequency band of the channel. In some instances, multiple signals may be transmitted over a single band/channel. For example, signals may sometimes be simultaneously transmitted over a single band/channel via different sub-bands or sub-channels. As another example, signals may sometimes be transmitted via the same band by allocating time slots over which respective transmitters and receivers use the band in question.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Machine Learning, according to some embodiments: Generally speaking, machine-learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. Specifically, machine-learning generally refers to the algorithms and models that computer systems use to effectively perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. Machine-learning algorithms learn through a process called induction or inductive learning. Induction is a reasoning process that makes generalizations (a model) from specific information (training data).</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">Generalization is needed because the model that is prepared by a machine-learning algorithm needs to make predictions or decisions based at least in part upon specific data instances that were not seen during training. Note, a model may suffer from over-learning or under-learning.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">Over-learning occurs when a model learns the training data too closely and does not generalize. The result is poor performance on data other than the training dataset. This is also called over-fitting.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">Under-learning occurs when a model has not learned enough structure from the training data because the learning process was terminated early. The result is good generalization but poor performance on all data, including the training dataset. This is also called under-fitting.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">Memory and Computer-Readable Media, according to some embodiments: Generally speaking, as used herein the phrase &#x201c;memory&#x201d; or &#x201c;memory device&#x201d; refers to a system or device (e.g., the memory unit <b>144</b>) including computer-readable media (&#x201c;CRM&#x201d;). &#x201c;CRM&#x201d; refers to a medium or media accessible by the relevant computing system for placing, keeping, or retrieving information (e.g., data, computer-readable instructions, program modules, applications, routines, etc.). Note, &#x201c;CRM&#x201d; refers to media that is non-transitory in nature, and does not refer to disembodied transitory signals, such as radio waves.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">The CRM may be implemented in any technology, device, or group of devices included in the relevant computing system or in communication with the relevant computing system. The CRM may include volatile or nonvolatile media, and removable or non-removable media. The CRM may include, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory, or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store information, and which can be accessed by the computing system. The CRM may be communicatively coupled to a system bus, enabling communication between the CRM and other systems or components coupled to the system bus. In some implementations the CRM may be coupled to the system bus via a memory interface (e.g., a memory controller). A memory interface is circuitry that manages the flow of data between the CRM and the system bus.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Network, according to some embodiments: As used herein and unless otherwise specified, when used in the context of system(s) or device(s) that communicate information or data, the term &#x201c;network&#x201d; (e.g., the networks <b>105</b> and <b>440</b>) refers to a collection of nodes (e.g., devices or systems capable of sending, receiving or forwarding information) and links which are connected to enable telecommunication between the nodes.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Each of the described networks may include dedicated routers responsible for directing traffic between nodes, and, optionally, dedicated devices responsible for configuring and managing the network. Some or all of the nodes may be also adapted to function as routers in order to direct traffic sent between other network devices. Network devices may be inter-connected in a wired or wireless manner, and network devices may have different routing and transfer capabilities. For example, dedicated routers may be capable of high-volume transmissions while some nodes may be capable of sending and receiving relatively little traffic over the same period of time. Additionally, the connections between nodes on a network may have different throughput capabilities and different attenuation characteristics. A fiberoptic cable, for example, may be capable of providing a bandwidth several orders of magnitude higher than a wireless link because of the difference in the inherent physical limitations of the medium. If desired, each described network may include networks or sub-networks, such as a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN).</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Node, according to some embodiments: Generally speaking, the term &#x201c;node&#x201d; refers to a connection point, redistribution point, or a communication endpoint. A node may be any device or system (e.g., a computer system) capable of sending, receiving or forwarding information. For example, end-devices or end-systems that originate or ultimately receive a message are nodes. Intermediary devices that receive and forward the message (e.g., between two end-devices) are also generally considered to be &#x201c;nodes.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Processor, according to some embodiments: The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed, at least partially, by one or more processors (e.g., the one or more processors in the processor unit <b>142</b>). Generally speaking, the terms &#x201c;processor&#x201d; and &#x201c;microprocessor&#x201d; are used interchangeably, each referring to a computer processor configured to fetch and execute instructions stored to memory. By executing these instructions, the processor(s) can carry out various operations or functions defined by the instructions. The processor(s) may be temporarily configured (e.g., by instructions or software) or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations or functions (e.g., a processor for an Application Specific Integrated Circuit, or ASIC), depending on the particular embodiment.
