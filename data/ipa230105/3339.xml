To do this, the grease gun can, for instance, be coupled onto a lubricating nipple via which the lubricant conveyed out of the grease gun then reaches the point of lubrication to be lubricated.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The object of the invention is to provide a grease gun of the aforementioned type with improved usage properties.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">With a view to achieving the object, a grease gun is proposed having the features of the independent claim. In particular, with a view to achieving the object, a grease gun of the aforementioned type is proposed which is characterized in that the screw coupling encompasses at least two different coupling threads for coupling screw cartridges having different mating threads. In this way, it is possible to equip and use one and the same grease gun with different screw cartridges. Consequently, two different grease guns no longer have to be kept available in order to utilize screw cartridges having different types of thread.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The grease gun is connected via its screw coupling to a screw cartridge which contains lubricant. Upon actuation of the grease gun, the lubricant is conveyed out of the screw cartridge and supplied to a point of lubrication via a discharge aperture of the grease gun. In this process, the screw cartridge can optionally be screw-coupled with one of the at least two different coupling threads.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The two coupling threads of the grease gun may have different diameters. Accordingly, screw cartridges with differently dimensioned mating threads can be coupled onto the same grease gun.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Ordinarily, the screw cartridges have been provided with external threads. The coupling threads of the grease gun therefore preferably take the form of internal threads. In this way, a screw cartridge that includes a mating thread taking the form of external thread can be reliably screwed into one of the two coupling threads. The internal threads of the grease gun may have been configured in such a way that they overlap threaded nozzles of the screw cartridges, on which the mating threads have been formed, when the screw cartridges have been properly connected to the grease gun.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The at least two coupling threads may have been arranged one inside the other and, in particular, concentrically with respect to one another. Furthermore, they may surround, preferentially concentrically, an outlet aperture of the screw coupling into a conveying connection of the conveying mechanism toward a discharge aperture of the grease gun. In this way, it is ensured that lubricant from the screw cartridge can reach the conveying mechanism of the grease gun, regardless of the coupling thread, of the at least two coupling threads of the grease gun, via which a screw cartridge has been coupled onto the grease gun.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The screw coupling of the grease gun may include at least two threaded nozzles. One of the at least two coupling threads may have been arranged or formed on each of the threaded nozzles. The at least two threaded nozzles have preferentially been arranged one inside the other. Particularly preferably, the at least two threaded nozzles have been arranged concentrically with respect to one another. Furthermore, the threaded nozzles may concentrically surround an outlet aperture&#x2014;for instance, the outlet aperture already mentioned previously&#x2014;of the screw coupling through which lubricant can reach the conveying mechanism of the grease gun.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The at least two coupling threads of the grease gun have preferably been nested one inside the other in such a way that they terminate flush on the cartridge side. Furthermore, free, cartridge-side end faces of the at least two coupling threads may have been arranged in a common plane. Accordingly, the at least two different coupling threads of the screw coupling of the grease gun can be accessible for the mating threads of different types of screw cartridge. This can favor the reliable coupling of cartridges onto the grease gun.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment of the grease gun, the latter takes the form of a single-lever grease gun. In another embodiment of the grease gun, the latter takes the form of a double-lever grease gun.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to an embodiment example, but it is not restricted to this embodiment example.
