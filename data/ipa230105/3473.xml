of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates in general to firearms accessories and, in particular, to firearms and firearm accessories that include systems and devices for retaining and releasing primary and spare clips or magazines.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">State of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Firearms are typically configured with a means for holding a clip or magazine for feeding consecutive rounds of ammunition into the firing chamber for shooting. As used in this disclosure, &#x201c;firearms&#x201d; is meant to include both rifles and handguns in the numerous iterations and configurations in which they are made. As also used herein, the term &#x201c;detachable magazine&#x201d; refers to a removable ammunition storage and feeding device, commonly referred to as a &#x201c;clip&#x201d;, that holds several rounds of ammunition and can be selectively attached to and removed from a firearm so as to be reloaded or replaced when the magazine has been depleted of ammunition. It is convenient to have additional ammunition on or about the person in order to replenish or replace the spent clip or magazine that is in use. It is known to provide belts and other wearable devices on which additional clips or magazines may be stored. It is also known to provide an additional clip or magazine on the firearm itself to provide easy and convenient access to a second clip or magazine. While placement of an additional clip or magazine on the firearm enhances access to and placement of the additional clip or magazine in place of the spent clip or magazine, the mechanisms for releasing one or both magazines associated with the firearm are typically independently operated.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In both defensive and sport shooting, the ability to reload a firearm quickly is very important. This has led to devices attachable to the firearm that hold a spare magazine and that can be used to reload the firearm. Each of these prior art devices is attachable to a firearm, such as a handgun, personal defense weapon, or rifle and use a friction fit with flexible locking members and not needing a manually operated release mechanism in order to withdraw the spare magazine. These systems have a number of drawbacks. For example, the magazine can be accidentally removed from the firearm, as it only requires a certain minimum amount of force to overcome the flexible locking members that retain the spare clip or magazine. Additionally, immediately after a user intentionally pulls the magazine from the carrier, the sudden release of force as the clip or magazine is pulled from the device causes the firearm to be immediately pulled in the opposite direction by the hand holding the firearm, forcing the user to bring the two objects into alignment with each other. This movement often causes misalignment of the firearm with the spare clip or magazine, slowing down the reload. Thirdly, the friction and flexible locking member designs of prior art devices are prone to wear, along with wearing down the magazines that are used in conjunction therewith. As the locking members wear, their effectiveness to adequately hold a spare magazine diminishes and can result in more inadvertent dropping of the spare magazine from the device.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, there is a need in the art to provide a dual clip or magazine release system on the firearm that allows for rapid and selective release of one or both clips or magazines from the firearm, that is reliable and significantly decreases the time required to remove and replace a spent clip or magazine of a firearm.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, dual magazine release system for a firearm includes a housing with first and second magazine holders, the first magazine holder positioned to retain a first magazine to feed ammunition to the firearm and the second magazine holder positioned in front of a trigger of the firearm and configured to retain a spare second magazine. A magazine retaining and release system is coupled to the housing and configured to retain the first magazine in the first magazine holder and to retain the second magazine in the second magazine holder and to selectively release the first magazine or the second magazine independently from one another or to substantially simultaneously release the first and second magazines from the first and second magazine holders, respectively, upon actuation of the magazine retaining and release system by a user.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment, the magazine retaining and release system comprises at least one magazine retaining member movable between a resting position in which the at least one magazine retaining member engages and retains both of the first and second magazines and a second position in which at least one of the first and second magazines is released from its respective first or second magazine holder.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another embodiment, the magazine retaining and release system comprises a first release button coupled thereto below and proximate a front side of a trigger guard, the first release button movable between a resting position to a first position in which the first magazine is released and from the first position to a second position in which the second magazine is released.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In yet another embodiment, the magazine retaining and release system further comprises a second release button coupled thereto and positioned proximate to and above a trigger of the firearm, the first release button movable between a resting position to a first position in which the first magazine is released.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In still another embodiment, the magazine retaining and release system comprises a release tab coupled thereto and positioned proximate to and above a trigger of the firearm, the release tab movable between a resting position to a first position in which the first magazine is released.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another aspect, a magazine retention and release system for a firearm, comprising a mounting system attachable to a firearm and at least one housing to receive and securely retain a spare magazine, having a retention system positioned to lock into a slot in the spare magazine, and a release system positioned to the opposite end of the muzzle, being easily actuated by a user's secondary thumb.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, protective guards are positioned to guard the release from accidental actuation.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In certain embodiments, a protective guard is positioned on the muzzle end of the magazine housing for the purpose of guarding against injury.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another aspect, a firearm frame comprises a primary body, one or more housings to receive and securely retain a spare magazine, having a retention system positioned to lock into a slot in the spare magazine, and a release system positioned to the opposite end of the muzzle, being easily actuated by a user's secondary thumb.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In yet another embodiment, the retention system of the primary magazine is connected to the release system of the spare magazine housing, allowing a single actuation to release both magazines.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, actuation of the spare magazine release button immediately releases the spare magazine and the primary magazine simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In other embodiments, actuation of the spare magazine release button first releases the spare magazine in a first stage, and in a second stage, releases the primary magazine.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In still other embodiments, actuation of the spare magazine release button first releases the primary magazine in a first stage, and in a second stage, releases the spare magazine.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In other embodiments, the magazine release system is integrated into a firearm.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In still other embodiments, the magazine release system is configured to replace a frame of an existing firearm.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Other aspects, features, and advantages will become apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, which are a part of this disclosure and which illustrate, by way of example, principles of the inventions disclosed.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">When considered in connection with the following illustrative figures, a more complete understanding of the present invention may be derived by referring to the detailed description.

The dual magazine retaining system <b>10</b> includes a housing <b>20</b> configured for holding at least the firing components of the firearm (e.g., for a handgun, the firing assembly including the trigger mechanism, barrel, and slide) in an upper portion thereof. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the dual detachable magazine retaining system may be configured to replace an existing grip and body (i.e., the frame) of the firearm with the grip portion <b>22</b> and body portion <b>24</b> of the housing <b>20</b>, thereby forming a replacement frame for the firearm (i.e., the existing frame of the firearm is replaced with the housing <b>20</b>). Alternatively, the dual detachable magazine retaining system may be incorporated into the firearm <b>14</b> as an integral part thereof with the grip portion <b>22</b>, body portion <b>24</b>, barrel, slide, trigger, firing mechanism, etc. assembled together.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Positioned forward of the trigger <b>26</b> and forming the distal side of a trigger guard is a secondary magazine holder <b>28</b> for retaining the secondary detachable magazine <b>16</b>. The magazine retaining system <b>10</b> of the invention is configured to allow rapid release and removal of each magazine <b>12</b> and <b>16</b> independently or substantially simultaneously. To accomplish this, a slidable dual release mechanism <b>30</b> is slidably coupled to the housing <b>20</b> and is disposed between the grip portion <b>22</b>, extends under the trigger <b>26</b> and is slidably coupled to the secondary magazine holder <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The slidable dual release mechanism <b>30</b> is biased toward a first locking position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to hold both the primary and secondary magazines <b>12</b> and <b>16</b> relative to the housing <b>20</b>. As will be described in further detail herein, the dual release mechanism <b>30</b> can be moved relative to the housing <b>20</b> in order to independently release either one of the magazines <b>12</b> and <b>16</b>, or to release both magazines <b>12</b> and <b>16</b> at substantially the same time so that the primary magazine <b>12</b> falls from the primary magazine holder portion <b>32</b> as the secondary magazine <b>16</b> is released while being grasped by the user and subsequently moved to the primary magazine holder <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The dual release mechanism <b>30</b> can be moved to one of three magazine release positions in a number of ways. First, coupled to the housing <b>20</b> below the trigger <b>26</b> is a first release button <b>34</b>. The first release button is configured to be pressed by a thumb of the user while grasping the exposed portion <b>16</b>&#x2032; of the secondary magazine <b>16</b>. The first release mechanism <b>34</b> can be pressed approximately half-way of its full range of motion to a first release position in which the secondary magazine <b>16</b> only is released from the secondary magazine holder <b>28</b>. Fully pressing the first release mechanism <b>34</b> to nearly its full range of motion will release the primary magazine <b>12</b> from the primary magazine holder <b>32</b> as well. Thus, for rapid release of both magazines <b>12</b> and <b>16</b>, the first release mechanism <b>34</b> is fully pressed from its first resting position toward the secondary magazine holder <b>28</b> causing both magazines <b>12</b> and <b>16</b> to be substantially simultaneously released (i.e., the time it takes to fully depress the first release mechanism <b>34</b> typically less than 0.5 seconds).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Alternatively, the dual release mechanism <b>30</b> can be directly slid by the user by engaging the thumb magazine release tab <b>40</b> that is integrally formed with the dual release mechanism <b>30</b>. The thumb release tab <b>40</b> is positioned proximate a top portion of the grip portion <b>22</b> proximate where the right thumb of the user would reside when gripping the grip portion <b>22</b>. By sliding the dual release mechanism <b>30</b> toward the front end of the secondary magazine holder <b>28</b> with a thumb, the user can selectively release the primary magazine <b>12</b> without releasing the secondary magazine <b>16</b>. That is, by sliding the dual release mechanism <b>30</b> toward the front end of the secondary magazine holder <b>28</b>, the user releases the first magazine <b>12</b> by sliding the dual release mechanism <b>30</b> until the first magazine <b>12</b> is released.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Finally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the primary magazine <b>12</b> can also be released independently of the secondary magazine <b>16</b> by pressing the second release mechanism <b>50</b> with the right index finger of the user when gripping the grip portion <b>22</b>. As will be described in more detail, the second release mechanism is coupled to the dual release mechanism <b>30</b> in a manner by which the primary magazine <b>16</b> is released from the primary magazine holder <b>28</b> without releasing the secondary magazine <b>16</b> from the secondary magazine holder <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, there is illustrated components of the dual release mechanism <b>30</b> when positioned within the housing <b>20</b> (not shown) and retaining two conventional magazines, a primary magazine <b>12</b> and a secondary magazine <b>16</b>, each containing ammunition. Such conventional magazines <b>12</b> and <b>16</b> are each configured with a retaining notch <b>12</b>&#x2033; and <b>16</b>&#x2033; respectively. The dual release mechanism <b>30</b> engages with the two retaining notches <b>12</b>&#x2033; and <b>16</b>&#x2033; to hold the magazines <b>12</b> and <b>16</b> relative to the dual release mechanism <b>30</b> and thus the housing <b>20</b> (not shown).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The dual release mechanism <b>30</b> is comprised of a first release member <b>60</b> and a second release member <b>62</b>.

To do so, the first release button is configured to slide within the housing from a first resting position to first release position as shown to a fully depressed position as further herein described. The first release button <b>34</b>&#x2032; includes a first portion <b>70</b> for pressing by a user that downwardly depends from a release portion <b>72</b>. The release portion <b>72</b> is coupled to the second release member <b>62</b> with an upwardly extending tab <b>74</b> to cause direct translational movement of the second release member <b>62</b> when the first portion is pressed.
