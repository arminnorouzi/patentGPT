Performance of the cell culturing methods and processes in their various aspects result in a higher viable cell density and higher protein titer.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">INTRODUCTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Current ongoing efforts to maximize bioreactor productivity in both time and volume directly affect the scale and capital investment required for a bioreactor suite. As cells reach higher concentrations more quickly, yield is increased; therefore, the number and scale of bioreactors can be reduced. To that end, not only cell engineering, but also culture media and related chemical and physical environments are used to assist cells in reaching peak performance quickly and maintaining a high level as long as possible.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Removing or reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals, or singlet oxygen has been shown to improve productivity, presumably through reduction of apoptosis. Yun et al. showed with Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) culture that a combination of glutathione and iron chelators decreased intracellular ROS levels and increased the number of viable cells (&#x201c;Combined Addition of Glutathione and Iron Chelators for Decrease of Intracellular Level of Reactive Oxygen Species and Death of Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells&#x201d;, <i>J. Biosci. Bioeng., </i>95:124-127 (2003)). Addition of specific iron chelator combinations also reduced ROS and yielded improved viability. Adding several together was more effective than adding single chelators separately. Similar results were reported upon addition of ascorbic acid and glutathione as antioxidants to CHO culture by Yun et al. (&#x201c;Effect of Antioxidants on the Apoptosis of CHO Cells and Production of Tissue Plasminogen Activator in Suspension Culture&#x201d;, <i>J. Biosci. Bioeng., </i>91:581-585 (2001)).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Antioxidants commonly used during cell culture include tocopherol, transferrin, selenium, ascorbate and reduced glutathione. Tocopherol is a membrane antioxidant with low solubility in water that functions to neutralize lipid peroxides. Transferrin is a chelator that binds iron with such high affinity leaving no iron available to generate free radicals. Transferrin serves as an extracellular iron transporter and storage molecule. Glutathione is a water-soluble antioxidant tripeptide, which contains a reducing thiol group. It is ubiquitously produced in all cell types and is important for cell proliferation and viability. Selenium is a component of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase which reduce glutathione and thioredoxin, respectively. Ascorbate is a water-soluble antioxidant that regenerates reduced tocopherol. Most commercially-available basal mediums do not contain antioxidants as they were designed for use in conjunction with serum. The serum would typically provide the required antioxidants.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Recombinantly produced protein products are increasingly becoming medically and clinically important for use as therapeutics, treatments and prophylactics.

The antioxidants are provided to the cell cultures in an amount that is effective for attaining and maintaining viable cell density and therefore maximizing protein production until the end of a culturing run. As described herein, a variety of antioxidant supplementation regimens are encompassed by the present invention.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Culturing Processes Involving Antioxidant Addition</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In accordance with this invention, the addition of antioxidants to the cell culture increases and/or maintains viable cell density during the production run. The presence of an effective amount of antioxidants in the basal media and/or over the course of the culturing process was found to result in an increased protein titer. To maintain and/or sustain the viable cell density antioxidants are added to the basal and or feed media. The processes and methods of the present invention are suited to both small (e.g., 50 L-100 L) and large scale (e.g., 500 L and greater) cell cultures. In addition, the methods of the present invention are particularly suited to cells grown and maintained as fed-batch cultures, of both small and large scale. In addition, a variety of culture media as known in the art can be used in the culturing methods of this invention.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">An antioxidant is a molecule that inhibits the oxidation of other molecules. Oxidation is a chemical reaction that transfers electrons or hydrogen from a substance to an oxidizing agent. Oxidation reactions can produce free radicals. In turn, these radicals can start chain reactions. When the chain reaction occurs in a cell, it can cause damage or death to the cell. Antioxidants terminate these chain reactions by removing free radical intermediates, and inhibit other oxidation reactions. They do this by being oxidized themselves, so antioxidants are often reducing agents such as thiols, ascorbic acid, or polyphenols.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A polyphenol antioxidant is a type of antioxidant containing a polyphenolic or natural phenol substructure. Although all polyphenols have similar chemical structures, there are some distinctive differences. Based on these differences polyphenols are subdivided into several major subclasses including: phenolic acids (such as rosmarinic acid and chlorogenic acid), stilbens (such as resveratrol), tannins, flavonolignans (such as silibinin) and flavonoids.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Flavonoids are the largest family of polyphenolic antioxidants. Flavonoids are further divided in several subclasses including: anthocyanins (such as pelargonidin), flavanols (such as catechin), flavanones (such as naringenin and hesperetin), flavonols (such as quercetin), flavones (such as apigenin), and isoflavones (such as genistein and daidzein).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">An advantage of the present invention is that protein production costs are reduced by the increase in protein production as achieved by the culturing methods described herein. In a preferred embodiment, higher viable cell density was maintained throughout the culture run when antioxidants were included in the basal and/or feeding medium supplied to the cell culture as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>9</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">One embodiment of the invention involves the addition of antioxidant to the basal media to allow for the production of large amounts of protein independent of the reactor scale as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>8</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">One embodiment of the invention involves the maintenance of the antioxidant feeding strategy throughout a production run, preferably, with daily feeding, to allow for the production of large amounts of protein independent of the reactor scale as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>D, <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>D and <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">One embodiment of the invention involves the addition of antioxidant to the basal and feed media to allow for the production of large amounts of protein independent of the reactor scale as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C and <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>D</figref>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">An effective concentration of antioxidants as a component in a basal or feed media, increases, maintains and/or sustains viable cell density throughout the production run.

Such expression vectors contain the necessary elements for the transcription and translation of the inserted coding sequence. Methods which are well known to and practiced by those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing sequences encoding the produced proteins and polypeptides, as well as the appropriate transcriptional and translational control elements. These methods include in vitro recombinant DNA techniques, synthetic techniques, and in vivo genetic recombination. Such techniques are described in Sambrook, J. et al., <i>Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, </i>Cold Spring Harbor Press, Plainview, N.Y. (1989) and in Ausubel, F. M. et al., <i>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, </i>John Wiley &#x26; Sons, New York, N.Y. (1989).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0059">Control elements, or regulatory sequences, are those non-translated regions of the vector (e.g., enhancers, promoters, 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; untranslated regions) that interact with host cellular proteins to carry out transcription and translation. Such elements can vary in their strength and specificity. Depending on the vector system and host cell utilized, any number of suitable transcription and translation elements, including constitutive and inducible promoters, can be used. In mammalian cell systems, promoters from mammalian genes or from mammalian viruses are preferred. The constructs for use in protein expression systems are designed to contain at least one promoter, an enhancer sequence (optional, for mammalian expression systems), and other sequences as necessary or required for proper transcription and regulation of gene expression (e.g., transcriptional initiation and termination sequences, origin of replication sites, polyadenylation sequences, e.g., the Bovine Growth Hormone (BGH) poly A sequence).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0060">As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the selection of the appropriate vector, components for proper transcription, expression, and isolation of proteins produced in eukaryotic expression systems is known and routinely determined and practiced by those having skill in the art. The expression of proteins by the cells cultured in accordance with the methods of this invention can be placed under the control of promoters such as viral promoters, e.g., cytomegalovirus (CMV), Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), phosphoglycerol kinase (PGK), thymidine kinase (TK), or the &#x3b1;-ACTIN&#xae; promoter. Further, regulated promoters confer inducibility by particular compounds or molecules, e.g., the glucocorticoid response element (GRE) of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) is induced by glucocorticoids (Chandler, V. et al., <i>Cell, </i>33:489-499 (1983)). Also, tissue-specific promoters or regulatory elements can be used (Swift, G. et al., <i>Cell, </i>38:639-646 (1984)), if necessary or desired.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0061">Expression constructs can be introduced into cells by a variety of gene transfer methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, conventional gene transfection methods, such as calcium phosphate co-precipitation, liposomal transfection, microinjection, electroporation, and infection or viral transduction. The choice of the method is within the competence of the skilled practitioner in the art. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that one or more constructs carrying DNA sequences for expression in cells can be transfected into the cells such that expression products are subsequently produced in and/or obtained from the cells.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0062">In a particular aspect, mammalian expression systems containing appropriate control and regulatory sequences are preferred for use in protein expressing mammalian cells of the present invention. Commonly used eukaryotic control sequences for generating mammalian expression vectors include promoters and control sequences compatible with mammalian cells such as, for example, the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (CDM8 vector) and avian sarcoma virus (ASV) &#x3c0;LN vector. Other commonly used promoters include the early and late promoters from Simian Virus 40 (SV40) (Fiers et al., <i>Nature, </i>273:113 (1973)), or other viral promoters such as those derived from polyoma, Adenovirus 2, and bovine papilloma virus. An inducible promoter, such as hMTII (Karin et al., <i>Nature, </i>299:797-802 (1982)) can also be used.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0063">Examples of expression vectors suitable for eukaryotic host cells include, but are not limited to, vectors for mammalian host cells (e.g., BPV-1, pHyg, pRSV, pSV2, pTK2 (Maniatis); pIRES (Clontech); pRc/CMV2, pRc/RSV, pSFV1 (Life Technologies); pVPakc Vectors, pCMV vectors, pSG5 vectors (Stratagene), retroviral vectors (e.g., pFB vectors (Stratagene)), pcDNA-3 (Invitrogen), adenoviral vectors; Adeno-associated virus vectors, baculovirus vectors, yeast vectors (e.g., pESC vectors (Stratagene)), or modified forms of any of the foregoing. Vectors can also contain enhancer sequences upstream or downstream of promoter region sequences for optimizing gene expression.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0064">A selectable marker can also be used in a recombinant vector (e.g., a plasmid) to confer resistance to the cells harboring (preferably, having stably integrated) the vector to allow their selection in appropriate selection medium. A number of selection systems can be used, including but not limited to, the Herpes Simplex Virus thymidine kinase (HSV TK), (Wigler et al., <i>Cell, </i>11:223 (1977)), hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), (Szybalska et al., <i>Proc.

USA, </i>48:202 (1992)), and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (Lowy et al., <i>Cell, </i>22:817 (1980)) genes, which can be employed in tk-, hgprt-, or aprt-cells (APRT), respectively.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0065">Anti-metabolite resistance can also be used as the basis of selection for the following nonlimiting examples of marker genes: dhfr, which confers resistance to methotrexate (Wigler et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </i>77:357 (1980); and O'Hare et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </i>78:1527 (1981)); gpt, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid (Mulligan et al., <i>Proc. Natl.

Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology can be routinely applied to select the desired recombinant cell clones, and such methods are described, for example, in Ausubel et al., eds., <i>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology</i>, John Wiley &#x26; Sons, NY (1993); Kriegler, <i>Gene Transfer and Expression, A Laboratory Manual, </i>Stockton Press, NY (1990); in Dracopoli et al., eds., Chapters 12 and 13, <i>Current Protocols in Human Genetics, </i>John Wiley &#x26; Sons, NY (1994); Colberre-Garapin et al., <i>J.

When a marker in the vector system expressing a protein is amplifiable, an increase in the level of inhibitor present in the host cell culture will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the protein-encoding gene, production of the protein will concomitantly increase (Crouse et al., <i>Mol. Cell. Biol., </i>3:257 (1983)).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0067">Vectors which harbor glutamine synthase (GS) or dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) encoding nucleic acid as the selectable markers can be amplified in the presence of the drugs methionine sulphoximine or methotrexate, respectively. An advantage of glutamine synthase based vectors is the availability of cell lines (e.g., the murine myeloma cell line, NSO) which are glutamine synthase negative. Glutamine synthase expression systems can also function in glutamine synthase expressing cells (e.g., CHO cells) by providing additional inhibitor to prevent the functioning of the endogenous gene.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0068">Vectors that express DHFR as the selectable marker include, but are not limited to, the pSV2-dhfr plasmid (Subramani et al., <i>Mol.

In a continuous culture, for example, fresh culture medium supplement (i.e., feeding medium) is provided to the cells during the culturing period, while old culture medium is removed daily and the product is harvested, for example, daily or continuously. In continuous culture, feeding medium can be added daily and can be added continuously, i.e., as a drip or infusion. For continuous culturing, the cells can remain in culture as long as is desired, so long as the cells remain alive and the environmental and culturing conditions are maintained.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0070">In batch culture, cells are initially cultured in medium and this medium is neither removed, replaced, nor supplemented, i.e., the cells are not &#x201c;fed&#x201d; with new medium, during or before the end of the culturing run. The desired product is harvested at the end of the culturing run.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0071">For fed-batch cultures, the culturing run time is increased by supplementing the culture medium one or more times daily (or continuously) with fresh medium during the run, i.e., the cells are &#x201c;fed&#x201d; with new medium (&#x201c;feeding medium&#x201d;) during the culturing period. Fed-batch cultures can include the various feeding regimens and times as described above, for example, daily, every other day, every two days, etc., more than once per day, or less than once per day, and so on. Further, fed-batch cultures can be fed continuously with feeding medium.
