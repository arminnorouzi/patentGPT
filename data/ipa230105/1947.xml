Specifically, the state management unit Y<b>1</b> of the first embodiment manages the autonomous driving level as the state of the autonomous driving and switches the autonomous driving level at an appropriate time. In the first embodiment, the autonomous driving level takes a discrete numerical value that is an integer of 0 to 3. The autonomous driving level means that the range in which the system is the control subject in the driving action increases as the numerical value increases. Here, the driving action is defined as a concept obtained by adding surroundings monitoring to the driving operation described above. The autonomous driving level switched by the state management unit Y<b>1</b> conforms to the autonomous driving level defined by the American Society of Automotive Engineers.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">For example, in a case where the autonomous driving level is level 0, the driver is the implementation entity for all driving actions. So-called manual driving is performed. In a case where the autonomous driving level is level 1, among the driving actions, the implementation entity of one of the vehicle steering, the vehicle driving, and the vehicle braking is the vehicle <b>1</b> (specifically, the driving assistance ECU <b>37</b>), and the implementation entity of all the other driving actions is the driver. When the autonomous driving level is level 2, the implementation entity of the driving operations of vehicle steering, vehicle driving, and vehicle braking is the vehicle <b>1</b> (specifically, driving assistance ECU <b>37</b>). In this case, it is necessary for the driver to be an implementation entity of the surroundings monitoring, monitor the execution status of the driving operation by the vehicle <b>1</b>, and maintain a state in which the driver can perform the immediate driving operation such as gripping the steering wheel so as to intervene in the driving operation at any time.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">When the autonomous driving level is level 3, the implementation entity of all driving actions of vehicle steering, vehicle driving, vehicle braking, and surroundings monitoring is the vehicle <b>1</b>, and the autonomous driving ECU <b>40</b> of the vehicle <b>1</b> performs these driving actions. At this time, the driver can perform an action, other than driving, different from driving within a range permitted for safety without constantly monitoring the execution status of the driving action by the autonomous driving ECU <b>40</b>. The range permitted for safety may be legally defined or may be defined based on safety in actual driving.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Actions, other than driving, that can be taken by the driver include viewing a content, a computer game, browsing and sending an e-mail, browsing a website, operating a mobile phone or a smartphone, eating, makeup (makeup), reading, sleeping, and the like. The content includes, for example, a moving image such as a movie, music, an audio book, and the like. These are sometimes referred to as a second task, a secondary task, a secondary activity, and other activities. However, these reference may indicate an action itself other than driving, may indicate an action generally permitted for safety among actions other than driving, or may indicate an action individually and specifically permitted for safety according to various situations among actions other than driving. Hereinafter, among actions other than driving, an action individually and specifically permitted for safety according to various situations is defined as a permissible action, and the description will be continued. The range recognized as the permissible action may vary depending on a temporal change in various situations.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The state management unit Y<b>1</b> switches the autonomous driving level in a timely manner. When the autonomous driving level is level 0, the driving assistance ECU <b>37</b> and the autonomous driving ECU <b>40</b> do not substantially intervene in the driving action, and the travel control ECU <b>36</b> and the driving actuator are directly controlled by the driving action of the driver. When the autonomous driving level is level 1 or 2, the travel control ECU <b>36</b> and the driving actuator are controlled in a mode in which the driving assistance ECU <b>37</b> assists the driving action of the driver. When the autonomous driving level is level 3, the travel control ECU <b>36</b> and the driving actuator are controlled based on the calculation of the autonomous driving ECU <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">When vehicle <b>1</b> travels in the above-described restricted area, the state management unit Y<b>1</b> sets the upper limit of the autonomous driving level to level 3. Conversely, when the vehicle <b>1</b> travels outside the restricted area, the state management unit Y<b>1</b> basically sets the upper limit of the autonomous driving level to level 2, and sets the upper limit of the autonomous driving level to level 3 under the exceptional condition. This exceptional condition is, for example, a condition that a road on which the vehicle <b>1</b> travels is congested and the vehicle <b>1</b> travels at a low speed less than a predetermined speed. From the above, the restricted area indicated by the map database <b>34</b><i>a </i>and the congestion section in which the vehicle travels at low speed are permitted areas for at least some of the second tasks.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Even when the vehicle <b>1</b> travels in the restricted area, the state management unit Y<b>1</b> may lower the autonomous driving level from level 3 to level 2 or less. For example, when the autonomous driving function deviates from the use condition or is predicted to deviate from the use condition, the state management unit Y<b>1</b> suddenly lowers the autonomous driving level to level 2 or less. For example, in a case where the detection accuracy of the surroundings monitoring sensor <b>33</b> is lowered due to deterioration of environmental conditions due to bad weather such as heavy rain, snowfall, dense fog, and sandstorm, it may deviate from the use condition serving as a premise of the operation of the autonomous driving function. When a traffic accident occurs around the host vehicle, the autonomous driving function may deviate from the use condition.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In a case where the state management unit Y<b>1</b> determines to lower the autonomous driving level from level 3 to level 2 or lower due to the end schedule of the permitted area or deviation from the use condition, the state management unit Y<b>1</b> requests of the HCU <b>10</b> that the information presentation device <b>20</b> presents information for giving notice of the driving-mode switch to the driver. When the driver responds to the driving-mode switch, the state management unit Y<b>1</b> actually lowers the autonomous driving level from level 3 to level 2 or lower. When the driver does not respond to the driving-mode switch even after waiting for a predetermined time after the notice of the driving-mode switch, the state management unit Y<b>1</b> can determine to perform the minimal risk manoeuvre (MRM) control on the vehicle <b>1</b>. The MRM control is vehicle control in which a risk is minimized in an emergency, and specifically means control of searching for and setting an evacuation place and moving and stopping the host vehicle to the evacuation place.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">When the state management unit Y<b>1</b> sets the autonomous driving level to level 3, the driving control unit Y<b>2</b> functions as an implementation entity of a driving action and controls the travel control ECU <b>36</b>. Specifically, the driving control unit Y<b>2</b> recognizes a road shape on which the vehicle <b>1</b> travels, a position of another vehicle, and the like based on locator information and map information acquired from the locator <b>34</b>, detection information acquired from the surroundings monitoring sensor <b>33</b>, and the like. The driving control unit Y<b>2</b> generates a planned traveling line on which the vehicle <b>1</b> travels based on the recognition result of the road shape, the position of another vehicle, and the like. The driving control unit Y<b>2</b> causes the vehicle <b>1</b> to travel along the generated planned traveling line in cooperation with the travel control ECU <b>36</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">When the above-described MRM control is performed, the driving control unit Y<b>2</b> gradually decrease the traveling speed of the vehicle <b>1</b> while causing the vehicle <b>1</b> to issue an alarm such as a siren around the host vehicle, and causes the vehicle <b>1</b> to stop at a relatively safe place such as a side of a road.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Next, details of each of the information presentation device <b>20</b> and the HCU <b>10</b> included in the information presentation system IPS will be sequentially described.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The information presentation device <b>20</b> is a device that presents information to a driver.

Specifically, the stress estimation unit X<b>3</b> estimates the presence or absence of stress of the driver. For example, an analysis of an eye deflection state of the driver is used for the estimation of the presence or absence of stress of the driver. Further, the biometric sensor that detects the heart rate of the driver is provided in the driver seat, the steering wheel, and the like, and the estimation accuracy by the stress estimation unit X<b>3</b> can be improved using the information about the heart rate detected by the biometric sensor. The stress information estimated by the stress estimation unit X<b>3</b> is provided to the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b>. The stress estimation unit X<b>3</b> updates the stress information in a timely manner based on the latest information.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Based on the travel environment information acquired from the travel environment estimation unit X<b>1</b>, the awakeness level information acquired from the awakeness level estimation unit X<b>2</b>, and the stress information acquired from the stress estimation unit X<b>3</b>, the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> determines a permissible action, which is permitted for the driver to take. The permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> determines a permissible action currently permitted to the driver. The determination result of the permissible action by the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> can vary according to changes in the travel environment information, the awakeness level information, and the stress information, that is, changes in various situations. While the autonomous driving function is implemented, the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> updates the determination result in a timely manner in response to the change in the travel environment information, the change in the awakeness level information, or the change in the stress information based on the provided latest information.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Specifically, the determination theory by the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> is constructed based on a guide that the driver can keep a &#x201c;minimum safe posture and a state in which a driving-mode can be switched in an emergency&#x201d; when the passive driving function whose autonomous driving level is level 3 is implemented. That is, in a case where an unexpected driving-mode switch cause occurs in the autonomous driving at level 3, an action other than driving is permitted as a permissible action within a range in which the driver can safely take over driving.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> sets a plurality of determination viewpoints in the determination of the permissible action. The permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> temporarily calculates an individual determination result for each determination viewpoint. Thereafter, the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> definitely determines, as a permissible action, an action which is determined to be a permissible action in common between the respective determination viewpoints among the individual permissible actions for each determination viewpoint calculated provisionally.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the first embodiment in which the range of permissible actions is defined stepwise as a driver requirement described below, the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> extracts a determination result having the narrowest range of permissible actions (in other words, the lowest level of permission) among the provisional results for each determination viewpoint. The permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> sets a determination result having the narrowest permissible action range as a definite determination result (final result). The permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> provides information about a definite determination result to the information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The driver requirement is an index obtained by dividing actions other than driving stepwise based on the above-described determination theory. The driver requirement indicates that the higher the level, the wider the range of permissible actions (in other words, the higher the level of permission). The driver requirement takes a discrete numerical value that is an integer of 0 to 4. The driver requirement level 0 means that action other than driving is not permitted and is prohibited.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The action of driver requirement level 1 is an action in which the driver can easily return to a drivable state. For example, an operation on a mobile phone, a smartphone, or a CID with one hand, an action capable of holding a state in which the body does not fall to the left and right, and an action capable of holding the position of the eyes that can visually recognize all of the plurality of displays <b>21</b> are included in the actions of the driver requirement level 1. The driver requirement level 1 also includes an action of being able to immediately notice a driving-mode switch request using sound with a small volume to a medium volume of the speaker <b>22</b>, an action of being able to hold a state in which the driver seat is not substantially reclined, and the like. That is, an action in which all the five senses can be used even when returning to the driving action is regarded as the driver requirement level 1 action.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The action of driver requirement level 2 is an action in which the driver can return to a drivable state with some movement. For example, an operation on the mobile phone, the smartphone, or the CID with both hands, an action of tilting the body to the left and right by about &#xb1;20 degrees, an action of being able to hold the position of the eyes that can visually recognize the plurality of displays <b>21</b> except for one, and the like are regarded as the driver requirement level 2 actions.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Furthermore, examples of the driver requirement level 2 include an action using sound with the volume of speaker <b>22</b> being medium to large, an action of performing in a state in which the driver seat is reclined to about 45 degrees, and the like.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The action of driver requirement level 3 is an action that allows the driver to return to driving in an emergency. Examples of the action include an action of putting an object on the knee, an action of tilting the body to the left and right by about &#xb1;130 degrees, and an action of being able to hold the position of the eyes that can visually recognize the plurality of displays <b>21</b> except for two.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The action of driver requirement level 4 is an action for which the execution of the autonomous driving at level 3 is necessarily prohibited. Examples of the action include a sleeping action, a drinking action, an action of leaving a seat, an action of releasing a seat belt, an action of performing with a state in which a driver seat is reclined to about 90 degrees, and an action of wearing an earphone. It is not normal for the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> to determine the action of the driver requirement level 4 as a permissible action when the autonomous driving function at the autonomous driving level 3 is implemented.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Hereinafter, the determination of the permissible action by the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> will be specifically described. The permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> sets four determination viewpoints. A first determination viewpoint is a road shape in the travel environment. The permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> determines a permissible action based on the road shape information acquired from the travel environment estimation unit X<b>1</b>. Specifically, the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> identifies the road shape of the road on which the vehicle <b>1</b> travels from the road width, the road slope, the road curvature, the road section line shape, and the like.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">When the road shape is a straight road, the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> determines that the action up to the driver requirement level 3 is the permissible action. When the road shape is a curved road, the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> determines that the action up to the driver requirement level 2 is the permissible action. Specifically, when the road on which the vehicle <b>1</b> travels has a curve shape and the length of the curve section exceeds a predetermined distance, the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> narrows the range in which an action is determined to be a permissible action, and determines that the action up to the driver requirement level 2 is the permissible action. In addition, when the road shape is a shape requiring a lane change, the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> determines that the action up to the driver requirement level 1 is the permissible action. That is, in the assumption that the driver takes over the driving, the higher the difficulty level of the driving action immediately after the takeover of the driving, the narrower the range of the permissible action.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The second determination viewpoint is a traveling scene in the travel environment. The permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> determines a permissible action based on the information about the traveling scene acquired from the travel environment estimation unit X<b>1</b>. Specifically, the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> identifies the traveling scene of the vehicle <b>1</b> from the setting of the restricted area, the traffic volume, and the like.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">When the traveling scene is traveling in a non traffic jam in the restricted area, the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> determines that the action up to the driver requirement level 3 is the permissible action. When the traveling scene is traveling in a traffic jam in the restricted area, the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> determines that the action up to the driver requirement level 3 is the permissible action. When the traveling scene is traveling in a traffic jam outside the restricted area, the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> determines that the action up to the driver requirement level 2 is the permissible action. That is, the higher the possibility of sudden driving-mode switch to the driver, the narrower the range of permissible actions.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In addition, in a scene where the traveling scene is about to shift from the inside of the restricted area to the outside of the restricted area, the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> determines the permissible action based on the distance or the arrival time from the vehicle <b>1</b> to the boundary of the restricted area. The permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> narrows the range of the permissible action as the distance to the boundary or the arrival time is shorter.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The third determination viewpoint is an awakeness level. The permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> determines a permissible action based on the awakeness level of the driver acquired from the awakeness level estimation unit X<b>2</b>. When the awakeness level of the driver is level 0, the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> determines that the action up to the driver requirement level 3 is the permissible action. When the awakeness level of the driver is level 1, the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> determines that the action up to the driver requirement level 2 is the permissible action. When the awakeness level of the driver is level 2, the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> determines that the action of driver requirement level 1 is the permissible action. That is, the lower the handling ability of the driver handling the sudden driving-mode switch, the narrower the range of permissible actions.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In a case where the awakeness level of the driver is level 3, it is estimated that an emergency driving-mode switch cannot be performed. Therefore, the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> outputs a command for executing an alarm to the alarm determination unit X<b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The fourth determination viewpoint is a stress. The permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> determines a permissible action based on the stress of the driver acquired from the stress estimation unit X<b>3</b>. When the driver has no stress, the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> determines that the action up to the driver requirement level 3 is the permissible action. When the driver is stressed, the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> determines that the action up to the driver requirement level 2 is the permissible action. That is, in the assumption that the driver takes over the driving, the higher the possibility of the operation mistake of the driving action immediately after the taking over is, the narrower the range of the permissible action is.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Among the above provisional determination results, a result for a determination viewpoint with a low level in the driver requirement is used as a definitive determination result. This is because the validity of the presentation of information about the permissible action described later is enhanced by permitting only the action that has passed the safety standard from each determination viewpoint.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Furthermore, the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> roughly predicts the transition of the range of permissible actions in the travel route to the destination based on a determination viewpoint from which the future prediction is possible among a plurality of determination viewpoints. In the first embodiment, since the travel environment of the road on which the vehicle <b>1</b> is scheduled to travel can be estimated, the travel environment corresponds to a determination viewpoint from which the future prediction is possible.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The occupant monitoring unit X<b>5</b> monitors the action of the driver based on the state information about the driver acquired from the DSM <b>31</b>, the seating information about the driver from the seat sensor <b>32</b>, and the like. The occupant monitoring unit X<b>5</b> may identify the action of the driver by comprehensively determining the image analysis result of the captured image by the DSM <b>31</b> and the seating information. A learned artificial intelligence model constructed mainly by a neural network may be used to identify the action of the driver. The occupant monitoring unit X<b>5</b> provides the monitoring result of the action of the driver to the alarm determination unit X<b>6</b> and the information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The alarm determination unit X<b>6</b> compares the monitoring result of the action of the driver acquired from the occupant monitoring unit X<b>5</b> with the determination result of the permissible action acquired from the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b>, and determines whether to issue an alarm for the driver. For example, in a case where the driver continuously performs an action (hereinafter, non-permissible action), other than the permissible action, determined not to be the permissible action by the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> among actions other than driving for a predetermined alarm setting time or more, the alarm determination unit X<b>6</b> determines to execute an alarm for the driver.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In addition, when a command to execute an alarm is input from the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> as described above, the alarm determination unit X<b>6</b> determines to execute an alarm for the driver. The alarm determination unit X<b>6</b> provides alarm execution information to the information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The evacuation request unit X<b>7</b> requests the autonomous driving ECU <b>40</b> to forcibly evacuate the vehicle <b>1</b> when the driver continues to perform the non-permissible action for a predetermined evacuation setting time or more after the alarm starts to be issued. The retraction mentioned here is, for example, the above-described MRM control.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> controls the content that the information presentation device <b>20</b> is caused to present. The information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> acquires the determination result from the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> to output a presentation request for causing the information presentation device <b>20</b> to present information about the determination result to the information presentation device <b>20</b>. The information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> acquires the definitive determination result described above, and causes the information presentation device <b>20</b> to present information about the definitive determination result.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> can cause the information presentation device <b>20</b> to present information indicating an action determined to be a permissible action among the information about the determination result. The information indicating the action determined to be the permissible action is, for example, information indicating that the driver seat may be reclined to 45 degrees in a case where the action up to the driver requirement level 2 is determined to be the permissible action.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Furthermore, for example, in a case where the action up to the driver requirement level 3 is determined to be the permissible action, the information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> causes the information presentation device <b>20</b> to present information indicating that it is allowed to watch a movie on the display <b>21</b> (for example, CID). Under such circumstances, in a case where a functional restriction on implementing a permissible action using the information presentation device <b>20</b> is imposed on the information presentation device <b>20</b>, the information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> can make a request for a release of the restriction. The information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> requests the information presentation device <b>20</b> or the device that is the restriction entity imposing the restriction on the information presentation device <b>20</b> to release the restriction. For example, in a case where a functional restriction is imposed on a showing of the movie on the display <b>21</b>, the information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> makes a request for a release of the functional restriction so that the display <b>21</b> can perform the showing of the movie.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In addition, the information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> can cause the information presentation device <b>20</b> to present information indicating an action determined to be a non-permissible action among the information about the determination result. The information indicating the action determined to be the non-permissible action is, for example, information indicating that the driver seat should not be reclined beyond 45 degrees in a case where the action up to the driver requirement level 2 is determined to be the permissible action.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> can cause the information presentation device <b>20</b> to present information about the determination result of the permissible action at timing when the determination result of the permissible action is updated and the range of the permissible action (in other words, the driver requirement level) has changed. In the presentation at this timing, the information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> tones up the information presentation as the amount of change in the range of the permissible action increases. As the amount of change is larger, the tone in the information presentation is increased. For example, when the upper limit of the driver requirement level changes from 3 to 1, the amount of change is 2, and when the upper limit of the driver requirement level changes from 2 to 3, the amount of change is 1.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Here, examples of the tone up include improving saturation, improving luminance, increasing a display size, and thickening a line used for display in the case of display by an image. In addition, examples of the tone down include increasing the volume, using a high sound area, and enhancing the accent of the voice in the case of notification by sound.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">When the information about the determination result is presented, the information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> selects a device to be used for information presentation from the information presentation device <b>20</b> based on the monitoring result of the action of the driver acquired from the occupant monitoring unit X<b>5</b>. That is, in consideration of the nature of actions other than driving by the driver, a device that is relatively easy to pay attention to among the information presentation devices <b>20</b> is used for information presentation.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">For example, when the driver is watching a movie, information presentation is performed by display on the display <b>21</b>. In more detail, when the driver is watching a movie with the CID, the information presentation is performed by display with the CID. Furthermore, for example, in a case where the driver is operating the smartphone, eating, or the like, information presentation is performed by notification by the speaker <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Furthermore, when the information related to the determination result is presented, the information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> can determine detailed content in the presentation based on the monitoring result of the action of the driver acquired from the occupant monitoring unit X<b>5</b>. For example, in a case where the driver is taking a non-permissible action, the information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> can cause the information presentation device <b>20</b> to present at least one of the reason why the non-permissible action should not be taken and a piece of advice for shifting the non-permissible action to the permissible action. Such information presentation is continuously presented, for example, until the driver stops the non-permissible action.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">As an example, a case where an action of the driver requirement levels 1 to 2 is determined to be a permissible action, the reclining angle recognized as the permissible action is 45 degrees or less, and the driver reclines the seat at an angle of 70 degrees will be described. In this case, an example of the reason why the non-permissible action should not be taken includes a reason that &#x201c;since the road shape is curved, it is necessary to return to a state where driving action can be taken with some movement considering the burden immediately after the driver has taken over driving&#x201d;. In this case, an example of a piece of advice for shifting the non-permissible action to the permissible action includes a reason that &#x201c;please return the reclining angle to 45 degrees or less&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In a case where the driver continues the non-permissible action despite the information about the determination result of the permissible action being presented to the driver through the information presentation device <b>20</b>, the occupant monitoring unit X<b>5</b> monitors the continuation of the non-permissible action. When the non-permissible action continues for a predetermined alarm setting time or more, the alarm determination unit X<b>6</b> determines to issue an alarm as described above. The information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> causes the information presentation device <b>20</b> to issue an alarm directed to the driver. The information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> preferably selects a plurality of devices to be used for the alarm among the information presentation devices <b>20</b>. Furthermore, the information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> tones up the alarm to be more than that in the case of the above-described information presentation. In addition to such an alarm, the information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> may cause the information presentation device <b>20</b> to present a notice of lowering the autonomous driving level, in other words, a driving-mode switch to end the autonomous driving that has no surroundings monitoring obligation.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">On the other hand, in a case where the driver is taking the permissible action, the information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> does not need to present information about the determination result more than necessary. However, the information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> presents information about the determination result from time to time (for example, periodically) after a restriction time period as a time period set to restrict the frequency of information presentation elapses.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In such a presentation, it is preferable that the information is presented in a tone down mode as compared with a case where the driver is taking a non-permissible action so as not to hinder the execution of the permissible action of the driver. Here, tone down is an antonym of tone up. Examples of the tone down include lowering saturation, lowering luminance, reducing a display size, and thinning a line used for display in the case of display by an image. In addition, examples of the tone down include reducing the volume, avoiding the use of a high sound area, and weakening the accent of the voice in the case of notification by sound.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Next, a method of presenting information based on an information presentation program stored in the storage unit <b>13</b> and executed by the processing unit <b>11</b> will be described based on each step of the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">First, in S<b>10</b>, for example, the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> of the HCU <b>10</b> determines whether the autonomous driving level managed by the state management unit Y<b>1</b> of the autonomous driving ECU <b>40</b> is in the state of level 3 or whether it is scheduled to become level 3. When an affirmative determination is made in S<b>10</b>, the process proceeds to S<b>11</b>. When a negative determination is made in S<b>10</b>, the process of S<b>10</b> is performed again, for example, after a predetermined redetermination time elapses.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In S<b>11</b>, estimation regarding each determination viewpoint is performed. Specifically, the travel environment estimation unit X<b>1</b> estimates the travel environment of the road on which the vehicle <b>1</b> travels.

In the chart illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref> illustrating actions other than driving, a solid line indicates, when an action, other than driving, actually taken by a driver is applied to a driver requirement level, whether the action is applied to the driver requirement level.

At this point, since an action other than driving is not substantially permitted, the action taken by the driver is regarded as an action corresponding to level 0 of the driver requirement level.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">When the autonomous driving level is level 3, the range of permissible actions based on the determination result by the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> is set to actions up to the driver requirement level 3. At this time, an event P<b>1</b> is performed as an event (hereinafter, the information presentation event) in which the information presentation device <b>20</b> presents information based on the request by the HCU <b>10</b>. The event P<b>1</b> is an event for presenting, to the driver, information indicating that the autonomous driving level has shifted to level 3 and information indicating that the range of permissible action is actions up to the driver requirement level 3. In response to such information presentation, the driver gradually performs the action of driver requirement level 1, the action of level 2, and the action of level 3 as actions other than driving.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">The permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> predicts that the range of permissible actions will be narrowed to the actions up to the driver requirement level 2 based on the determination viewpoint from which the future prediction is possible.

Event P<b>2</b> is an event for presenting, to the driver, notice information indicating that the permissible action is scheduled to be narrowed down to the action from the driver requirement level 3 to level 2.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">When the currently permissible range of permissible action narrows to the actions up to the driver requirement level 2, an event P<b>3</b> is performed as the information presentation event. The event P<b>3</b> is an event in which information indicating that the permissible action has narrowed down to the action from the driver requirement level 3 to the level 2 is presented to the driver.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Regardless of the events P<b>2</b> and P<b>3</b>, when the driver continues the action of the driver requirement level 3 for the alarm setting time or more, an event W<b>1</b> is performed as the information presentation event. The event W<b>1</b> is an event of warning the driver to stop the action of the driver requirement level 3. In response to the event W<b>1</b>, when the driver stops the action of the driver requirement level 3 and shifts to, for example, the action of the driver requirement level 1, the count of the evacuation setting time is stopped.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Thereafter, it is assumed that the range of permissible actions has expanded to the actions up to driver requirement level 3. Under such circumstances, when it is determined that the driver is taking the action of the driver requirement level 4, that is, the action in which the execution of the autonomous driving at level 3 is prohibited, an event W<b>2</b> is immediately performed. The event W<b>2</b> is an event of warning the driver to stop the action of the driver requirement level 4. This warning can be said to be a warning that the driver's posture does not satisfy the minimum safe posture.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">When the driver continues the action of the driver requirement level 4 for the evacuation setting time or more despite the event W<b>2</b>, the event M<b>1</b> is performed as the information presentation event.

At the time of operation of the autonomous driving function in which the necessity of grasping the situation such as the travel environment of the vehicle <b>1</b> is reduced for the driver, the driver can obtain information about the determination result of the permissible action via the information presentation device <b>20</b>. Therefore, by referring to such information, the driver can easily take an appropriate action when the autonomous driving function is implemented.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Furthermore, according to the first embodiment, information indicating a permissible action among actions other than driving is presented by the information presentation device <b>20</b>. By directly indicating the permissible action, it is possible to enhance the sense of security when the driver takes the action.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">In addition, according to the first embodiment, information indicating a non-permissible action among actions other than driving is presented by the information presentation device <b>20</b>. By directly indicating the non-permissible action, it is possible to enhance the ease of avoiding the execution of the non-permissible action when the driver takes an action other than driving.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">According to the first embodiment, the permissible action is determined based on the travel environment. At the time of operation of the autonomous driving function in which the necessity of grasping the travel environment of the vehicle <b>1</b> is reduced for the driver, consideration of the travel environment in the determination of the permissible action is complementarily performed on behalf of the driver. Therefore, it is possible to enhance the appropriateness in performing an action, other than driving, by the driver.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">In addition, according to the first embodiment, the permissible action is determined based on the shape of the road on which the vehicle <b>1</b> travels. That is, the determination result of the permissible action corresponds to the difficulty level of the driving action immediately after the takeover of the driving under the assumption that the driver takes over the driving. Therefore, it is possible to cause the driver to take an action other than driving while enhancing the safety of the driving action by the driver after the driving-mode switch.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">Further, according to the first embodiment, in a case where the road on which the vehicle <b>1</b> travels has a curved shape and the length of the curve section exceeds a predetermined distance, the range in which an action is determined to be the permissible action is narrowly changed. That is, even when the road on which the vehicle travels has a curve shape, in a case where the curve section is short, the range of the permissible action is maintained at the driver requirement level 3. Therefore, for example, in a scene where the driver is relaxing with the backrest tilted, a situation in which a warning is received every time the vehicle travels in a short curve section is avoided. On the other hand, when the curve section continues for a predetermined distance or more, the driver requirement level is changed to be low, so that an appropriate alarm for the driver can be issued.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">According to the first embodiment, the permissible action is determined based on the traveling scene of the vehicle <b>1</b>. That is, the determination result of the permissible action corresponds to the possibility of sudden driving-mode switch to the driver. Therefore, it is possible to cause the driver to take an action other than driving while enhancing the safety at the time of the driving-mode switch.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">According to the first embodiment, the permissible action is determined based on the awakeness level of the driver. That is, the determination result of the permissible action corresponds to the handling of the driver handling the sudden driving-mode switch. Therefore, it is possible to cause the driver to take an action other than driving while enhancing the safety at the time of the driving-mode switch.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">In addition, according to the first embodiment, the permissible action is determined based on a stress of the driver. That is, the determination result of the permissible action corresponds to the possibility of the operation mistake of the driving action immediately after the takeover in the assumption that the driver takes over the driving. Therefore, it is possible to cause the driver to take an action other than driving while enhancing the safety of the driving action by the driver after the driving-mode switch.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">In addition, according to the first embodiment, individual permissible actions are temporarily determined for a plurality of determination viewpoints. Thereafter, an action that is commonly determined to be a permissible action among the determination viewpoints is determined to be a definitive permissible action. Since the polygonal determination is performed from a plurality of determination viewpoints, and the minimum common action is definitely determined to be the permissible action, the validity in the determination of the permissible action can be remarkably enhanced.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">In addition, according to the first embodiment, the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> determines a permissible action based on a driver requirement as a determination index in which an action other than driving is associated with a level of permission of the permissible action according to the posture of the driver in the action other than driving. It is possible to embody a determination theory based on a guide that the driver can keep a &#x201c;minimum safe posture and a state in which a driving-mode can be switched in an emergency&#x201d; by relatively simple processing operation. Therefore, it is possible to easily realize determination of a highly valid permissible action.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">In addition, according to the first embodiment, the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> determines a permissible action based on a driver requirement as a determination index in which an action other than driving is associated with a level of permission of the permissible action according to the driver seat position in the action other than driving. The position of the driver seat in this case is, for example, a reclining angle. It is possible to embody a determination theory based on a guide that the driver can keep a &#x201c;minimum safe posture and a state in which a driving-mode can be switched in an emergency&#x201d; by relatively simple processing operation. Therefore, it is possible to easily realize determination of a highly valid permissible action.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">In addition, according to the first embodiment, in a case where a functional restriction for implementing a permissible action using the information presentation device <b>20</b> is imposed on the information presentation device <b>20</b>, release of the restriction is requested. Thus, the driver can smoothly perform a permissible action using the information presentation device <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">Furthermore, according to the first embodiment, the device to be used for the information presentation by the information presentation device <b>20</b> is selected from the device that presents the visual information and the device that presents the auditory information according to an action, other than driving, that is estimated to be currently taken by the driver. Such selection makes it easier for the driver to recognize the information to be presented. By presenting information that is easily recognized, it is easy to guide the driver to an appropriate action.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">Furthermore, according to the first embodiment, in a case where it is estimated that the driver is taking a non-permissible action, the reason why the non-permissible action should not be taken is presented by the information presentation device <b>20</b>. By making the driver understand the reason, it is easy to guide the driver to an appropriate action.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">Furthermore, according to the first embodiment, in a case where it is estimated that the driver is taking a non-permissible action, a piece of advice for shifting the non-permissible action currently taken by the driver to a permissible action is presented by the information presentation device. Such a piece of advice makes it possible to smoothly shift the action of the driver to a permissible action.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">Furthermore, according to the first embodiment, in a case where it is estimated that the driver is continuously performing a non-permissible action, an alarm directed to the driver is performed by the information presentation device <b>20</b>. By causing the driver to recognize the alarm, it is possible to urge the driver to stop the non-permissible action.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">In addition, according to the first embodiment, the information presentation device <b>20</b> presents notice of a driving-mode switch to end the autonomous driving function together with issuance of the alarm. By causing the driver to recognize that the autonomous driving function is terminated when this state is maintained, it is possible to enhance the effect of promoting the cancellation of the non-permissible action.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">Further, according to the first embodiment, when it is estimated that the driver further continuously performs a non-permissible action after the alarm starts to be issued, the vehicle <b>1</b> is required to be forcibly evacuated. By evacuating the vehicle <b>1</b>, it is possible to forcibly avoid the continuation state of the inappropriate non-permissible action during the operation of the autonomous driving function.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">Furthermore, according to the first embodiment, in a case where it is estimated that the driver is taking a permissible action, information about a determination result of the permissible action is sometimes presented by the information presentation device <b>20</b> after a restriction time period elapses. With the restriction time period, an increase in the frequency of information presentation is restricted, so that it is possible to reduce annoyance of information presentation felt by the driver.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">Furthermore, according to the first embodiment, in a case where the determined range of the permissible action changes, the information presentation device <b>20</b> tones up the information presentation as the amount of change in the range of the permissible action increases. Since the strength of information presentation is appropriately set according to the degree of influence of the driver on actions other than driving, it is possible to reduce annoyance of information presentation felt by the driver.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0152" num="0151">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the second embodiment is a modification of the first embodiment.

In the second embodiment, as in the first embodiment, the determination result of the permissible action is defined by the driver requirement. Therefore, the driver requirement level corresponds to the level of permission of the determination result. That is, the point at which the level of permission of the determination result of the permissible action is the lowest is a point at which the upper limit of the driver requirement level recognized as the permissible action is the lowest. The permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> provides the information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> with the information about the continuous operation section, the information about the point at which the level of permission is the lowest, and the information about the determination result of the permissible action at the point.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">The information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> causes the information presentation device <b>20</b> to consistently present information related to the determination result of the permissible action for the point at which the level of permission is the lowest while the autonomous driving function is implemented in association with the continuous operation section.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">For example, in a case where action up to the driver requirement level 2 is permitted at the point, it is assumed that action up to the driver requirement level 3 is temporarily permitted in the continuous operation section.

In the third embodiment, the function control device is an autonomous driving ECU <b>340</b> used in the vehicle <b>1</b>. The autonomous driving ECU <b>340</b> of the third embodiment can control not only the realization of the autonomous driving but also the function of the device to be controlled CE for assisting the appropriate execution of an action, other than driving, by the driver in the state where the autonomous driving level is level 3.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">Here, the device to be controlled CE includes one or more in-vehicle devices configured to be able to assist an action, other than driving, by the driver. As an example, a plurality of in-vehicle devices such as a driver seat <b>38</b>, the display <b>21</b>, and a speaker <b>22</b> is included in the device to be controlled CE.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">The autonomous driving ECU <b>340</b> includes function units such as a travel environment estimation unit Y<b>3</b>, an awakeness level estimation unit Y<b>4</b>, a stress estimation unit Y<b>5</b>, a permissible action determination unit Y<b>6</b>, and a function restriction unit Y<b>7</b> in addition to function units such as the state management unit Y<b>1</b> and the driving control unit Y<b>2</b> provided in the autonomous driving ECU <b>40</b> according to the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">The travel environment estimation unit Y<b>3</b>, the awakeness level estimation unit Y<b>4</b>, the stress estimation unit Y<b>5</b>, and the permissible action determination unit Y<b>6</b> are similar to the travel environment estimation unit X<b>1</b>, the awakeness level estimation unit X<b>2</b>, the stress estimation unit X<b>3</b>, and the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> provided in the HCU <b>10</b> of the first embodiment. However, the determination result of the permissible action by the permissible action determination unit Y<b>6</b> is provided to the function restriction unit Y<b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">The function restriction unit Y<b>7</b> restricts the function of the device to be controlled CE that causes the driver to realize the non-permissible action based on the determination result of the permissible action. The function restriction unit Y<b>7</b> restricts the angle at which the driver seat <b>38</b> can be reclined based on the determination result of the permissible action. For example, when the permissible action determination unit Y<b>6</b> permits actions up to the driver requirement level 2, the function restriction unit Y<b>7</b> restricts the reclining angle of the driver seat <b>38</b> exceeding 45 degrees through the reclining drive device provided in the driver seat <b>38</b>. Due to the angle restriction of the reclining, the driver can easily maintain the safe posture required to prepare for the cause of sudden driving-mode change.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">The function restriction unit Y<b>7</b> restricts the display content of the display <b>21</b> based on the determination result of the permissible action. For example, in a case where the action up to the driver requirement level 1 is permitted by the permissible action determination unit Y<b>6</b>, the function restriction unit Y<b>7</b> restricts a function of a game that requires a touch operation with both hands on the display <b>21</b> (for example, CID).

A situation in which the driver inadvertently takes an action other than the permissible action at the time of operation of the autonomous driving function in which the necessity of grasping the situation such as the travel environment of the vehicle <b>1</b> is reduced for the driver is suppressed by the functional restriction.

The permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> fixes the driver requirement level to the lowest level 1 until the end of the restriction period LT. In the restriction period LT, the information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> presents, to the driver, information indicating that the driver requirement level is intentionally fixed low by the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">In the scene of the operation example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the state management unit Y<b>1</b> determines that autonomous driving level is lowered the from level 3 to level 2 or lower due to the scheduled end of the permitted area (restricted area) or deviation from the use condition. In addition, the state management unit Y<b>1</b> also determines the termination of the level 3 autonomous driving when it is estimated that the driver is continuously performing an action other than the permissible action. The state management unit Y<b>1</b> sets a switch preparation section STR before the driving-mode switch is performed with reference to a time (see event C<b>1</b>) or a point where the driving-mode switch is performed from the autonomous driving ECU <b>40</b> to the driver.

The permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> continues a state in which the driver requirement level is fixed to be equal to or lower than the lowest level 1, and then transitions a level to a driver requirement level 0 in which the action other than driving is prohibited.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">In a case where the information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> recognizes the end schedule of the autonomous driving at level 3 due to the end of the permitted area, the deviation from the use condition, the continuation of the inappropriate action, and the like, the information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> at least gives notice of the driving-mode switch to end the autonomous driving function in the information presentation at the event P<b>4</b>. The information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> presents, to the driver, information indicating the driver requirement level restricted to the switch preparation range in the switch preparation section STR before the noticed end of the autonomous driving.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">Further, the information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> presents, to the driver, information requesting a driving-mode switch in the event C<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">Also in the fourth embodiment described so far, the same effects as those of the first embodiment are obtained, and the driver can obtain information about the determination result of the permissible action, so that the driver can easily take an appropriate action.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">In addition, according to the fourth embodiment, when a warning for an unauthorized action is presented, the driver requirement level is fixed to level 1 in a subsequent restriction period LT. According to such restraint control, it is possible to make the driver aware of not performing an unacceptable second task.

In order to diagnose that the driver is in a difficult-to-drive state, the deadman function unit Z<b>1</b> detects the inclination of the upper body of the driver, the inclination of the head with respect to the upper body, and the like, and grasps collapse of a posture of the driver. When collapse of a posture of the driver continues, the deadman function unit Z<b>1</b> determines that it is difficult to perform driving, and outputs a detection result indicating an abnormal state to the communication bus <b>99</b>. The abnormal state of the driver in the following description indicates a state in which the posture of the driver collapses into an inappropriate posture.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0187">The HCU <b>10</b> further includes a driver information acquisition unit X<b>9</b> in addition to the function units that confirm the driver requirements in the autonomous driving at level 3. The driver information acquisition unit X<b>9</b> acquires the detection result of the abnormal state by the deadman function unit Z<b>1</b>, and grasps the state of the driver along with the awakeness level estimation unit X<b>2</b>, the stress estimation unit X<b>3</b>, the occupant monitoring unit X<b>5</b>, and the like. When the driver information acquisition unit X<b>9</b> grasps the driver's difficult-to-drive state, the driver information acquisition unit X<b>9</b> requests the information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> to make notification that an abnormal state has been detected. The information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> notifies the driver and the fellow passenger in the vehicle interior that the abnormality is being detected by voice, display, or the like.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">Here, in the autonomous driving period at level 3 in which there is no surroundings monitoring obligation, as described above, the driver in the vehicle interior is permitted to take an action, other than driving, except for a peculiar action such as sleeping, drinking, and seat belt disengagement. Therefore, during the autonomous driving period, for example, the driver may recline the backrest of the driver seat and spend time in a relaxed posture. Such a posture has no problem as a driver requirement during autonomous driving, but is in a bad state as a driving posture. Thus, there is a possibility that the deadman function unit Z<b>1</b> erroneously recognizes the relaxed posture state of the driver during the autonomous driving as a state in which the driver is in collapse of a posture and it is difficult to perform driving, and outputs a detection result indicating an abnormal state.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0189">In order to cope with such a problem, when the driver information acquisition unit X<b>9</b> acquires a detection result indicating an abnormal state (collapse of a posture) during the autonomous driving period at level 3, the HCU <b>10</b> performs a notification process different from that at the time of the manual driving or the time of the autonomous driving at level 2 or lower. Hereinafter, an operation example of the HCU <b>10</b> and the autonomous driving ECU <b>40</b> when a detection result indicating an abnormal state is acquired during the autonomous driving at level 3 will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0190">In a case where the shift to the level 3 autonomous driving is performed in a state where the abnormality detection of the driver by the cooperation of the DSM <b>31</b> and the deadman function unit Z<b>1</b> is enabled, the information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> performs an event N<b>1</b> as the information presentation event by the information presentation device <b>20</b>. The event N<b>1</b> is started before or substantially at the same time as the event P<b>1</b> for making notification of the shift to the level 3 autonomous driving. The information presentation of the event N<b>1</b> may be performed in parallel with the information presentation of the event P<b>1</b>.

In the event N<b>2</b>, even when a collapsed posture of the driver is within a range permitted as a permissible action during level 3 autonomous driving, posture abnormality information about collapse of a posture of the driver is presented to occupants including a fellow passenger.

Specifically, the evacuation restriction request unit X<b>7</b><i>a </i>outputs a speed suppression request to the autonomous driving ECU <b>40</b>. Based on the speed suppression request, the autonomous driving ECU <b>40</b> switches to a (low) set speed lower than the normal set speed of the autonomous driving at level 3, and attempts deceleration control. Even when the deceleration control is performed due to the bad driving posture of the driver, the autonomous driving at level 3 is continued.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0193">The information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> determines the presence or absence of the input of the user operation to the operation device <b>24</b> after presenting the request for replying the presence or absence of the abnormality by the event N<b>2</b>. An operation device <b>24</b> is an input unit that receives a user operation by a driver, a fellow passenger, or the like, and is, for example, a steer switch, an operation lever, a voice input device, or the like. An occupant such as a driver and a fellow passenger can input, to the operation device <b>24</b>, a user operation of replying that there is no abnormality in the driver or a user operation of replying that there is an abnormality in the driver.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0194">In a case where the information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> acquires the input information of the user operation of replying that there is no abnormality in the driver, the information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> performs an information presentation event N<b>3</b> by the information presentation device <b>20</b>. In the event N<b>3</b>, the information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> makes a notification indicating continuation of the autonomous driving at level 3 and a notification prompting improvement in the driving posture.

When the information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> determines that the driving posture of the driver is improved, a request to cancel the speed suppression is output from the evacuation restriction request unit X<b>7</b><i>a </i>to the autonomous driving ECU <b>40</b>. As a result, the autonomous driving ECU <b>40</b> ends the deceleration control and starts traveling at a normal set speed.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0196">On the other hand, when the driver's driving posture is not improved, the information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> repeatedly presents the request for improvement in the driving posture. In this case, the speed suppression control by the autonomous driving ECU <b>40</b> is also continued. When the driver does not respond to the improvement request by the information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b>, the evacuation restriction request unit X<b>7</b><i>a </i>determines that improvement in the driving posture cannot be expected, and requests the autonomous driving ECU <b>40</b> to shift to the MRM control. The information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> performs an information presentation event M<b>1</b> based on the MRM control start determination by the evacuation restriction request unit X<b>7</b><i>a, </i>and presents, to the driver, information indicating that the driving control has shifted to the MRM control.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197">After the presentation of the request for replying the presence or absence of the abnormality by the event N<b>2</b>, the information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> performs a confirmation determination that the driver is in the difficult-to-drive state when the information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> acquires the input information of the user operation of replying that the driver has an abnormality, or when there is no reply from the occupant. The evacuation restriction request unit X<b>7</b><i>a </i>requests the autonomous driving ECU <b>40</b> to shift to the MRM control based on the confirmation determination by the information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b>.

That is, the information presentation content control unit X<b>8</b> cancels the suspension of the presentation of the posture abnormality information based on the continuation of the state in which the improvement in the posture of the driver is not grasped by the driver information acquisition unit X<b>9</b>. Information presentation in this case is performed not only for the driver but also for the fellow passenger in the passenger seat. As in the information presentation when there is no fellow passenger, the fellow passenger in the passenger seat is notified of the reason why it is determined that there is a possibility of abnormality in the driver together with the reply request.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0201">When the driver requirement level is set to any of levels 1 to 3 during the autonomous driving period at level 3, the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> requests the deadman function unit Z<b>1</b> to relax the criteria for determining that the driver is in the abnormal state based on the determination result of the permissible action. Based on the relaxation request from the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b>, the deadman function unit Z<b>1</b> adjusts a threshold value serving as a determination reference so as to make it difficult to determine that the driver is in an abnormal state during the autonomous driving period at level 3. As an example, in a case where it has been determined that the driver is in an abnormal state due to continuation of collapse of a posture for a predetermined time (for example, 5 seconds), the deadman function unit Z<b>1</b> performs a threshold value adjustment for changing the predetermined time to a longer time (for example, 10 seconds). As described above, the determination criteria by the deadman function unit Z<b>1</b> is optimized for the autonomous driving at level 3. Note that it is desirable that the determination criteria (threshold value) be relaxed within the scope of laws, regulations, and guidelines related to the deadman device in the country or the region where the vehicle <b>1</b> is used.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0202">Next, details of the information presentation processing for presenting information about each event related to the deadman described above will be described below based on the flowcharts illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b> and <b>14</b></figref> and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref>.

When it is determined in S<b>54</b> that the predetermined time has not elapsed since collapse of a posture was detected, the process returns to S<b>53</b>. On the other hand, in S<b>54</b>, when it is determined that the predetermined time has elapsed since collapse of a posture was detected, in other words, when it is determined that the state in which the posture of the driver improvement is not grasped has continued for the predetermined time, the process proceeds to S<b>55</b>.

In addition, in S<b>55</b>, an execution request for deceleration control of suppressing the set speed is output to the autonomous driving ECU <b>40</b>. The information presentation of the event N<b>2</b> and the output of the deceleration control execution request may be performed at different timings. As an example, after the information presentation of the event N<b>2</b>, the deceleration control execution request is output. In such a modification, the occupant senses the deceleration control after being aware of the detection of the abnormal state of the driver.

Specifically, in S<b>58</b>, the notification indicating the continuation of the autonomous driving at level 3 and the notification for prompting the improvement in the driving posture are sequentially performed, and the process proceeds to S<b>59</b>. The execution order of the autonomous driving continuation notification and the driving posture improvement request may be appropriately switched.

As a result, even when it is difficult for the driver to perform driving due to a sudden illness or the like during the autonomous driving at level 3, it is possible to reliably shift from the autonomous driving at level 3 to the MRM control.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0213">Further, according to the fifth embodiment, when the detection result indicating collapse of a posture of the driver at the time of the operation of the autonomous driving function at level 3 is acquired, the posture abnormality information is presented to the information presentation device even when the collapsed posture of the driver is within the range permitted as the permissible action. Therefore, even when collapse of a posture due to a sudden illness satisfies the driver requirements during autonomous driving, an inquiry about physical condition can be made to the occupant such as the driver. As a result, it is possible to normally operate the deadman system mainly including the deadman function unit Z<b>1</b> even during the autonomous driving at level 3.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0214">Furthermore, according to the fifth embodiment, after the occupant is requested to input a reply as to whether the driver is in a difficult-to-drive state, the presentation of the posture abnormality information is terminated when there is a reply to the request for the input. Therefore, after the driver's difficult-to-drive state is confirmed, highly useful information such as the state of MRM control can be presented to the fellow passenger having anxiety in an easy-to-understand manner.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0215">In addition, according to the fifth embodiment, when the detection result indicating collapse of a posture of the driver during the operation of the autonomous driving function at level 3 is acquired, functional restriction is imposed on the travel control even when collapse of a posture of the driver is within a range permitted as a permissible action. Therefore, even when collapse of a posture due to a sudden illness satisfies the driver requirements during autonomous driving, the autonomous driving ECU <b>40</b> can shift in advance to a traveling state in which it is easy to shift to the MRM control while continuing the autonomous driving. As a result, when it is really difficult for the driver to perform driving, the transition from the autonomous driving at level 3 to the MRM control can be smoothly performed.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0216">According to the fifth embodiment, when the driver information acquisition unit X<b>9</b> grasps improvement in a posture of the driver, the autonomous driving ECU <b>40</b> is requested to release the functional restriction on the travel control. Therefore, when collapse of a posture of the driver is improved, the traveling state of the vehicle <b>1</b> returns to the traveling state by the normal level 3 autonomous driving. Therefore, even in the in-vehicle system in which the deadman system is effective, the convenience of the autonomous driving function is hardly impaired.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0217">Further, according to the fifth embodiment, when the presence of the fellow passenger is grasped, the presentation of the posture abnormality information including the request for replying whether the state is the abnormal state is suspended. Thus, when a fellow passenger is present, the fellow passenger can see the driver. Therefore, it is possible to quickly respond to an unexpected situation occurring in the driver without strictly making notification of collapse of a posture of the driver. According to the above, it is possible to avoid a situation in which the occupant feels annoyed by frequent reply requests.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0218">In addition, according to the fifth embodiment, even when the presence of the fellow passenger is grasped, the suspension of the presentation of the posture abnormality information is cancelled when the state in which the posture of the driver is not improved continues. Therefore, in a case where the driver is seized with a sudden illness and it is difficult for the fellow passenger to handle the case, it is possible to normally operate the deadman system and shift to the MRM control as in the case where there is no fellow passenger.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0219">In addition, according to the fifth embodiment, the permissible action determination unit X<b>4</b> requests the deadman function unit Z<b>1</b> to relax the criteria for determining the abnormal state based on the determination result of the permissible action, which is permitted for the driver to take, during the autonomous driving at level 3. According to the adjustment process of the determination criteria, the relaxed posture of the driver during the autonomous driving is hardly erroneously recognized as collapse of a posture due to a sudden illness.
