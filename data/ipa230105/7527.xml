These systems may be capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing the available system resources (e.g., time, frequency, and power). Examples of such multiple-access systems include fourth generation (4G) systems such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems, LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) systems, or LTE-A Pro systems, and fifth generation (5G) systems which may be referred to as New Radio (NR) systems. These systems may employ technologies such as code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), or discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DFT-S-OFDM). A wireless multiple-access communications system may include one or more base stations or one or more network access nodes, each simultaneously supporting communication for multiple communication devices, which may be otherwise known as user equipment (UE).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some wireless systems may support sidelink communications (e.g., vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-everything (V2X) systems, etc.), where a UE may communicate with other UEs on allocated sidelink resources. As information sharing between sidelink devices increases and more UEs use sidelink communications, improved techniques for managing sidelink congestion may be desired for ensuring efficient sidelink service application usage within the system.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The described techniques relate to improved methods, systems, devices, and apparatuses that support congestion control by a sidelink midlayer framework. Generally, the described techniques provide for the collection and analysis of sidelink communication status in a system to enable a user equipment (UE) or a midlayer at the network (e.g., based on functions associated with the midlayer performed by a server or network node) to better determine if a sidelink communication is experiencing congestion and how to mitigate congestion if present. The congestion monitoring may occur for sidelink resources, for example, sidelink resources used by devices in a vehicle-to-everything (V2X) system. The network midlayers used to monitor and manage congestion may include at least a V2X Application enabler (VAE) layer, a Service Enabler Architecture Layer for Verticals (SEAL) layer, or both.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As described herein, the VAE and SEAL enhanced framework may introduce support for the detection of sidelink congestion as well as the management of the congestion. The described techniques may include the VAE layer understanding and collecting information on one or more applications running at a specific location, among a specific group, for a particular service (e.g., platooning, sensor sharing, or intersection assistance, etc.), and also collect information regarding UE (e.g., vehicle) maneuvers (such as a left turn, right turn, going straight, lane change, merge, etc.). Further, the SEAL layer may manage and monitor resources based on PC5 communication status, PC5 communication statistics, number of unicast links, PC5 quality of service (QoS) information, or the like. Based on the collected information, the VAE layer may determine if a service type may be subject to congestion control according to a determined algorithm. Additionally, based on the collected information, the SEAL layer may also perform analytics to determine if certain type of communication is facing problem or may face a problem in the future, and provides such information to the VAE layer.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The described techniques may support status monitoring and congestion detection when some UEs are not in coverage but communicating with other UEs (e.g., via PC5). In cases were a UE is out of coverage, the VAE may indicate relaying or aggregation of service level status reporting to a UE in coverage, such that out-of-coverage UEs may report congestion information to the in-coverage UE. The VAE may also configure how congestion control instructions may be distributed through the system. Other considerations for the congestion service at the VAE and SEAL include the use of different Public Land Mobile Networks (PLMNs) by different UEs. In such cases, the VAE or SEAL server may be either common or may be placed on the user plane and accessible from different PLMNs. Alternatively, an inter-SEAL server interface can be created, such that an out-of-coverage UE may communicate with its home PLMN (HPLMN) VAE or SEAL server via an in-coverage UE and its corresponding SEAL server. Accordingly, sidelink congestion may be detected and managed efficiently.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A method of wireless communications is described.

id="p-0050" num="0049">A user equipment (UE) may be capable of directly communicating with other UEs via sidelink communications. For example, the UE may communicate with a second UE via sidelink in a vehicle-to-everything (V2X) system. In some cases, sidelink communications, more specifically V2X communication may become congested. The techniques described herein relate to the introduction of a congestion control service for sidelink (e.g., PC5) communications as previous designs of the V2X Application enabler (VAE) and the Service Enabler Architecture Layer for Verticals (SEAL) framework do not address congestion monitoring or management. Previous design of the VAE and SEAL framework focus on safety services. Such congestion control aspects should be incorporated properly into VAE and SEAL framework to make the system usable in congested areas because as the number of UEs increases, the important times and locations for V2X service use is likely in high congestion areas (e.g., traffic at rush hour, intersections, etc.). Current V2X midlayer (i.e., VAE and SEAL) framework may not include a service for UE communication status monitoring and congestion detection or a resulting congestion management.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">According to the techniques described herein, the VAE and SEAL framework may be enhanced to support the detection of the congestion as well as the management of the congestion. The described techniques relate to the introduction of congestion monitoring and management for both the VAE and SEAL layers (e.g., based on functions associated with the layers as performed by a server, a device, or network node). Due to the nature of sidelink (e.g., PC5) communication, status monitoring and congestion detection may support scenarios when some UEs are not in coverage but communicating with other UEs via PC5. Specifically, the VAE layer understands and should collect information on application running at a specific location, among a specific group, for a particular service (e.g., platooning, sensor sharing, or intersection assistance, etc.), and also collect information regarding UE (e.g., vehicle) velocity and/or directional maneuvers (such as a left turn, right turn, moving in a straight line, a lane change, merging, etc.). The SEAL layer may manage and monitor resources based on PC5 communication status, PC5 communication statistics, number of unicast links, PC5 quality of service (QoS) information, or the like. Based on the collected information, the VAE layer may determine if a service type may be subject to congestion control (and message generation rate is adjusted) according to a determined algorithm. Additionally, based on the collected information, the SEAL layer may also perform analytics to determine if certain type of communication is facing problem or may face an upcoming problem, and provides such information to the VAE layer.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In cases were a UE is out of coverage from a base station, the VAE server may indicate relaying or aggregation of service level status reporting to a UE in coverage to be conveyed to out-of-coverage UEs, such that out-of-coverage UEs may report congestion information to the in-coverage UE according to the indication. The VAE may also configure how congestion control instructions should be distributed through the V2X system (e.g., an in-coverage UE may groupcast the instructions to out-of-coverage UEs). Other considerations for the congestion service at the VAE and SEAL include the use of different Public Land Mobile Networks (PLMNs) by different UEs. In such cases, the VAE or SEAL server may be either common (e.g., placed into the V2X Slice that is shared by multiple PLMNs) or may be placed on the user plane and accessible from different PLMNs. Alternatively, an inter-SEAL server interface can be created, such that an out-of-coverage UE may communicate with its home PLMN (HPLMN) VAE or SEAL server via an in-coverage UE and its SEAL server.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">According to the techniques described herein, the VAE may identify a congestion control configuration including capabilities for collecting operation information from sidelink UEs. Then, the VAE may receive, from a plurality of UEs, the operation information in accordance with the capabilities, and the VAE may generate congestion control instructions for one or more UEs of the plurality of UEs based on the received operation information. Additionally, the SEAL may identify a congestion control configuration including capabilities for collecting operation information from sidelink UEs, may monitor sidelink performance for a plurality of UEs in accordance with the capabilities, and may identify a congestion status for a communication type based on monitoring the sidelink performance. Accordingly, the VAE and SEAL framework enhancements may improve congestion mitigation in sidelink communications by using the congestion control service to properly collect communication status information as well as conveying congestion mitigation parameters to a distributed system. It is noted that, while the collection and mitigation of congestion for sidelink communications is described herein with reference to a V2X system, the aspects of the present disclosure may also apply to other systems that support sidelink communications or other systems where various UEs communicate directly with each other.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Aspects of the disclosure are initially described in the context of wireless communications systems. Aspects of the disclosure are further illustrated by and described with reference to apparatus diagrams, system diagrams, and flowcharts that relate to reclaiming resources based on sidelink feedback.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example of a wireless communications system <b>100</b> in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure. The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include one or more base stations <b>105</b>, one or more UEs <b>115</b>, and a core network <b>130</b>. In some examples, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be a Long Term Evolution (LTE) network, an LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) network, an LTE-A Pro network, or a New Radio (NR) network. In some examples, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support enhanced broadband communications, ultra-reliable (e.g., mission critical) communications, low latency communications, communications with low-cost and low-complexity devices, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The base stations <b>105</b> may be dispersed throughout a geographic area to form the wireless communications system <b>100</b> and may be devices in different forms or having different capabilities. The base stations <b>105</b> and the UEs <b>115</b> may wirelessly communicate via one or more communication links <b>125</b>. Each base station <b>105</b> may provide a coverage area <b>110</b> over which the UEs <b>115</b> and the base station <b>105</b> may establish one or more communication links <b>125</b>. The coverage area <b>110</b> may be an example of a geographic area over which a base station <b>105</b> and a UE <b>115</b> may support the communication of signals according to one or more radio access technologies.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The UEs <b>115</b> may be dispersed throughout a coverage area <b>110</b> of the wireless communications system <b>100</b>, and each UE <b>115</b> may be stationary, or mobile, or both at different times. The UEs <b>115</b> may be devices in different forms or having different capabilities. Some example UEs <b>115</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The UEs <b>115</b> described herein may be able to communicate with various types of devices, such as other UEs <b>115</b>, the base stations <b>105</b>, or network equipment (e.g., core network nodes, relay devices, integrated access and backhaul (IAB) nodes, or other network equipment), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The base stations <b>105</b> may communicate with the core network <b>130</b>, or with one another, or both. For example, the base stations <b>105</b> may interface with the core network <b>130</b> through one or more backhaul links <b>120</b> (e.g., via an S1, N2, N3, or other interface). The base stations <b>105</b> may communicate with one another over the backhaul links <b>120</b> (e.g., via an X2, Xn, or other interface) either directly (e.g., directly between base stations <b>105</b>), or indirectly (e.g., via core network <b>130</b>), or both. In some examples, the backhaul links <b>120</b> may be or include one or more wireless links.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">One or more of the base stations <b>105</b> described herein may include or may be referred to by a person having ordinary skill in the art as a base transceiver station, a radio base station, an access point, a radio transceiver, a NodeB, an eNodeB (eNB), a next-generation NodeB or a giga-NodeB (either of which may be referred to as a gNB), a Home NodeB, a Home eNodeB, or other suitable terminology.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">A UE <b>115</b> may include or may be referred to as a mobile device, a wireless device, a remote device, a handheld device, or a subscriber device, or some other suitable terminology, where the &#x201c;device&#x201d; may also be referred to as a unit, a station, a terminal, or a client, among other examples. A UE <b>115</b> may also include or may be referred to as a personal electronic device such as a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a tablet computer, a laptop computer, or a personal computer. In some examples, a UE <b>115</b> may include or be referred to as a wireless local loop (WLL) station, an Internet of Things (IoT) device, an Internet of Everything (IoE) device, or a machine type communications (MTC) device, among other examples, which may be implemented in various objects such as appliances, or vehicles, meters, among other examples.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The UEs <b>115</b> described herein may be able to communicate with various types of devices, such as other UEs <b>115</b> that may sometimes act as relays as well as the base stations <b>105</b> and the network equipment including macro eNBs or gNBs, small cell eNBs or gNBs, or relay base stations, among other examples, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The UEs <b>115</b> and the base stations <b>105</b> may wirelessly communicate with one another via one or more communication links <b>125</b> over one or more carriers. The term &#x201c;carrier&#x201d; may refer to a set of radio frequency spectrum resources having a defined physical layer structure for supporting the communication links <b>125</b>. For example, a carrier used for a communication link <b>125</b> may include a portion of a radio frequency spectrum band (e.g., a bandwidth part (BWP)) that is operated according to one or more physical layer channels for a given radio access technology (e.g., LTE, LTE-A, LTE-A Pro, NR). Each physical layer channel may carry acquisition signaling (e.g., synchronization signals, system information), control signaling that coordinates operation for the carrier, user data, or other signaling. The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support communication with a UE <b>115</b> using carrier aggregation or multi-carrier operation. A UE <b>115</b> may be configured with multiple downlink component carriers and one or more uplink component carriers according to a carrier aggregation configuration. Carrier aggregation may be used with both frequency division duplexing (FDD) and time division duplexing (TDD) component carriers.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some examples (e.g., in a carrier aggregation configuration), a carrier may also have acquisition signaling or control signaling that coordinates operations for other carriers. A carrier may be associated with a frequency channel (e.g., an evolved universal mobile telecommunication system terrestrial radio access (E-UTRA) absolute radio frequency channel number (EARFCN)) and may be positioned according to a channel raster for discovery by the UEs <b>115</b>. A carrier may be operated in a standalone mode where initial acquisition and connection may be conducted by the UEs <b>115</b> via the carrier, or the carrier may be operated in a non-standalone mode where a connection is anchored using a different carrier (e.g., of the same or a different radio access technology).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The communication links <b>125</b> shown in the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include uplink transmissions from a UE <b>115</b> to a base station <b>105</b>, or downlink transmissions from a base station <b>105</b> to a UE <b>115</b>. Carriers may carry downlink or uplink communications (e.g., in an FDD mode) or may be configured to carry downlink and uplink communications (e.g., in a TDD mode).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">A carrier may be associated with a particular bandwidth of the radio frequency spectrum, and in some examples the carrier bandwidth may be referred to as a &#x201c;system bandwidth&#x201d; of the carrier or the wireless communications system <b>100</b>. For example, the carrier bandwidth may be one of a number of determined bandwidths for carriers of a particular radio access technology (e.g., 1.4, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, or 80 megahertz (MHz)). Devices of the wireless communications system <b>100</b> (e.g., the base stations <b>105</b>, the UEs <b>115</b>, or both) may have hardware configurations that support communications over a particular carrier bandwidth or may be configurable to support communications over one of a set of carrier bandwidths. In some examples, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include base stations <b>105</b> or UEs <b>115</b> that support simultaneous communications via carriers associated with multiple carrier bandwidths. In some examples, each served UE <b>115</b> may be configured for operating over portions (e.g., a sub-band, a BWP) or all of a carrier bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Signal waveforms transmitted over a carrier may be made up of multiple subcarriers (e.g., using multi-carrier modulation (MCM) techniques such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) or discrete Fourier transform spread OFDM (DFT-S-OFDM)). In a system employing MCM techniques, a resource element may consist of one symbol period (e.g., a duration of one modulation symbol) and one subcarrier, where the symbol period and subcarrier spacing are inversely related. The number of bits carried by each resource element may depend on the modulation scheme (e.g., the order of the modulation scheme, the coding rate of the modulation scheme, or both). Thus, the more resource elements that a UE <b>115</b> receives and the higher the order of the modulation scheme, the higher the data rate may be for the UE <b>115</b>. A wireless communications resource may refer to a combination of a radio frequency spectrum resource, a time resource, and a spatial resource (e.g., spatial layers or beams), and the use of multiple spatial layers may further increase the data rate or data integrity for communications with a UE <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">One or more numerologies for a carrier may be supported, where a numerology may include a subcarrier spacing (&#x394;f) and a cyclic prefix. A carrier may be divided into one or more BWPs having the same or different numerologies. In some examples, a UE <b>115</b> may be configured with multiple BWPs. In some examples, a single BWP for a carrier may be active at a given time and communications for the UE <b>115</b> may be restricted to one or more active BWPs.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The time intervals for the base stations <b>105</b> or the UEs <b>115</b> may be expressed in multiples of a basic time unit which may, for example, refer to a sampling period of T<sub>s</sub>=1/(&#x394;f<sub>max</sub>&#xb7;N<sub>f</sub>) seconds, where &#x394;f<sub>max </sub>may represent the maximum supported subcarrier spacing, and N<sub>f </sub>may represent the maximum supported discrete Fourier transform (DFT) size. Time intervals of a communications resource may be organized according to radio frames each having a specified duration (e.g., 10 milliseconds (ms)). Each radio frame may be identified by a system frame number (SFN) (e.g., ranging from 0 to 1023).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Each frame may include multiple consecutively numbered subframes or slots, and each subframe or slot may have the same duration. In some examples, a frame may be divided (e.g., in the time domain) into subframes, and each subframe may be further divided into a number of slots. Alternatively, each frame may include a variable number of slots, and the number of slots may depend on subcarrier spacing. Each slot may include a number of symbol periods (e.g., depending on the length of the cyclic prefix prepended to each symbol period). In some wireless communications systems <b>100</b>, a slot may further be divided into multiple mini-slots containing one or more symbols. Excluding the cyclic prefix, each symbol period may contain one or more (e.g., N<sub>f</sub>) sampling periods. The duration of a symbol period may depend on the subcarrier spacing or frequency band of operation.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">A subframe, a slot, a mini-slot, or a symbol may be the smallest scheduling unit (e.g., in the time domain) of the wireless communications system <b>100</b> and may be referred to as a transmission time interval (TTI). In some examples, the TTI duration (e.g., the number of symbol periods in a TTI) may be variable. Additionally or alternatively, the smallest scheduling unit of the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be dynamically selected (e.g., in bursts of shortened TTIs (sTTIs)).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Physical channels may be multiplexed on a carrier according to various techniques. A physical control channel and a physical data channel may be multiplexed on a downlink carrier, for example, using one or more of time division multiplexing (TDM) techniques, frequency division multiplexing (FDM) techniques, or hybrid TDM-FDM techniques. A control region (e.g., a control resource set (CORESET)) for a physical control channel may be defined by a number of symbol periods and may extend across the system bandwidth or a subset of the system bandwidth of the carrier. One or more control regions (e.g., CORESETs) may be configured for a set of the UEs <b>115</b>. For example, one or more of the UEs <b>115</b> may monitor or search control regions for control information according to one or more search space sets, and each search space set may include one or multiple control channel candidates in one or more aggregation levels arranged in a cascaded manner. An aggregation level for a control channel candidate may refer to a number of control channel resources (e.g., control channel elements (CCEs)) associated with encoded information for a control information format having a given payload size. Search space sets may include common search space sets configured for sending control information to multiple UEs <b>115</b> and UE-specific search space sets for sending control information to a specific UE <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Each base station <b>105</b> may provide communication coverage via one or more cells, for example a macro cell, a small cell, a hot spot, or other types of cells, or any combination thereof. The term &#x201c;cell&#x201d; may refer to a logical communication entity used for communication with a base station <b>105</b> (e.g., over a carrier) and may be associated with an identifier for distinguishing neighboring cells (e.g., a physical cell identifier (PCID), a virtual cell identifier (VCID), or others). In some examples, a cell may also refer to a geographic coverage area <b>110</b> or a portion of a geographic coverage area <b>110</b> (e.g., a sector) over which the logical communication entity operates. Such cells may range from smaller areas (e.g., a structure, a subset of structure) to larger areas depending on various factors such as the capabilities of the base station <b>105</b>. For example, a cell may be or include a building, a subset of a building, or exterior spaces between or overlapping with geographic coverage areas <b>110</b>, among other examples.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">A macro cell generally covers a relatively large geographic area (e.g., several kilometers in radius) and may allow unrestricted access by the UEs <b>115</b> with service subscriptions with the network provider supporting the macro cell. A small cell may be associated with a lower-powered base station <b>105</b>, as compared with a macro cell, and a small cell may operate in the same or different (e.g., licensed, unlicensed) frequency bands as macro cells. Small cells may provide unrestricted access to the UEs <b>115</b> with service subscriptions with the network provider or may provide restricted access to the UEs <b>115</b> having an association with the small cell (e.g., the UEs <b>115</b> in a closed subscriber group (CSG), the UEs <b>115</b> associated with users in a home or office). A base station <b>105</b> may support one or multiple cells and may also support communications over the one or more cells using one or multiple component carriers.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some examples, a carrier may support multiple cells, and different cells may be configured according to different protocol types (e.g., MTC, narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB)) that may provide access for different types of devices.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some examples, a base station <b>105</b> may be movable and therefore provide communication coverage for a moving geographic coverage area <b>110</b>. In some examples, different geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> associated with different technologies may overlap, but the different geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> may be supported by the same base station <b>105</b>. In other examples, the overlapping geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> associated with different technologies may be supported by different base stations <b>105</b>. The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include, for example, a heterogeneous network in which different types of the base stations <b>105</b> provide coverage for various geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> using the same or different radio access technologies.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support synchronous or asynchronous operation. For synchronous operation, the base stations <b>105</b> may have similar frame timings, and transmissions from different base stations <b>105</b> may be approximately aligned in time. For asynchronous operation, the base stations <b>105</b> may have different frame timings, and transmissions from different base stations <b>105</b> may, in some examples, not be aligned in time. The techniques described herein may be used for either synchronous or asynchronous operations.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Some UEs <b>115</b>, such as MTC or IoT devices, may be low cost or low complexity devices and may provide for automated communication between machines (e.g., via Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication). M2M communication or MTC may refer to data communication technologies that allow devices to communicate with one another or a base station <b>105</b> without human intervention. In some examples, M2M communication or MTC may include communications from devices that integrate sensors or meters to measure or capture information and relay such information to a central server or application program that makes use of the information or presents the information to humans interacting with the application program. Some UEs <b>115</b> may be designed to collect information or enable automated behavior of machines or other devices. Examples of applications for MTC devices include smart metering, inventory monitoring, water level monitoring, equipment monitoring, healthcare monitoring, wildlife monitoring, weather and geological event monitoring, fleet management and tracking, remote security sensing, physical access control, and transaction-based business charging.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Some UEs <b>115</b> may be configured to employ operating modes that reduce power consumption, such as half-duplex communications (e.g., a mode that supports one-way communication via transmission or reception, but not transmission and reception simultaneously). In some examples, half-duplex communications may be performed at a reduced peak rate. Other power conservation techniques for the UEs <b>115</b> include entering a power saving deep sleep mode when not engaging in active communications, operating over a limited bandwidth (e.g., according to narrowband communications), or a combination of these techniques. For example, some UEs <b>115</b> may be configured for operation using a narrowband protocol type that is associated with a defined portion or range (e.g., set of subcarriers or resource blocks (RBs)) within a carrier, within a guard-band of a carrier, or outside of a carrier.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be configured to support ultra-reliable communications or low-latency communications, or various combinations thereof. For example, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be configured to support ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) or mission critical communications. The UEs <b>115</b> may be designed to support ultra-reliable, low-latency, or critical functions (e.g., mission critical functions). Ultra-reliable communications may include private communication or group communication and may be supported by one or more mission critical services such as mission critical push-to-talk (MCPTT), mission critical video (MCVideo), or mission critical data (MCData). Support for mission critical functions may include prioritization of services, and mission critical services may be used for public safety or general commercial applications. The terms ultra-reliable, low-latency, mission critical, and ultra-reliable low-latency may be used interchangeably herein.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some examples, a UE <b>115</b> may also be able to communicate directly with other UEs <b>115</b> over a device-to-device (D2D) communication link <b>135</b> (e.g., using a peer-to-peer (P2P) or D2D protocol). One or more UEs <b>115</b> utilizing D2D communications may be within the geographic coverage area <b>110</b> of a base station <b>105</b>. Other UEs <b>115</b> in such a group may be outside the geographic coverage area <b>110</b> of a base station <b>105</b> or be otherwise unable to receive transmissions from a base station <b>105</b>. In some examples, groups of the UEs <b>115</b> communicating via D2D communications may utilize a one-to-many (1:M) system in which each UE <b>115</b> transmits to every other UE <b>115</b> in the group. In some examples, a base station <b>105</b> facilitates the scheduling of resources for D2D communications. In other cases, D2D communications are carried out between the UEs <b>115</b> without the involvement of a base station <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some systems, the D2D communication link <b>135</b> may be an example of a communication channel, such as a sidelink communication channel, between vehicles (e.g., UEs <b>115</b>). In some examples, vehicles may communicate using vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, or some combination of these. A vehicle may signal information related to traffic conditions, signal scheduling, weather, safety, emergencies, or any other information relevant to a V2X system. In some examples, vehicles in a V2X system may communicate with roadside infrastructure (V2I), such as roadside units (RSU), or with the network via one or more network nodes (e.g., base stations <b>105</b>) using vehicle-to-network (V2N) communications, or with both. In some examples, vehicles in the V2X system may communicate with pedestrians or other vulnerable road users, using vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) communications.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The core network <b>130</b> may provide user authentication, access authorization, tracking, Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity, and other access, routing, or mobility functions. The core network <b>130</b> may be an evolved packet core (EPC) or 5G core (5GC), which may include at least one control plane entity that manages access and mobility (e.g., a mobility management entity (MME), an access and mobility management function (AMF)) and at least one user plane entity that routes packets or interconnects to external networks (e.g., a serving gateway (S-GW), a Packet Data Network (PDN) gateway (P-GW), or a user plane function (UPF)). The control plane entity may manage non-access stratum (NAS) functions such as mobility, authentication, and bearer management for the UEs <b>115</b> served by the base stations <b>105</b> associated with the core network <b>130</b>. User IP packets may be transferred through the user plane entity, which may provide IP address allocation, routing, filtering, QoS enforcement, as well as other functions. The user plane entity may be connected to the network operators IP services <b>150</b>. The operators IP services <b>150</b> may include access to the Internet, Intranet(s), an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), or a Packet-Switched Streaming Service. In some examples, the user plane entity may also provide non-IP based services to the UE <b>115</b> (e.g. unstructured PDU session type, Ethernet PDU sessions type, or non-IP PDN connections).</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Some of the network devices, such as a base station <b>105</b>, may include subcomponents such as an access network entity <b>140</b>, which may be an example of an access node controller (ANC). Each access network entity <b>140</b> may communicate with the UEs <b>115</b> through one or more other access network transmission entities <b>145</b>, which may be referred to as radio heads, smart radio heads, or transmission/reception points (TRPs). Each access network transmission entity <b>145</b> may include one or more antenna panels. In some configurations, various functions of each access network entity <b>140</b> or base station <b>105</b> may be distributed across various network devices (e.g., radio heads and ANCs) or consolidated into a single network device (e.g., a base station <b>105</b>).</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may operate using one or more frequency bands, typically in the range of 300 megahertz (MHz) to 300 gigahertz (GHz). Generally, the region from 300 MHz to 3 GHz is known as the ultra-high frequency (UHF) region or decimeter band because the wavelengths range from approximately one decimeter to one meter in length. The UHF waves may be blocked or redirected by buildings and environmental features, but the waves may penetrate structures sufficiently for a macro cell to provide service to the UEs <b>115</b> located indoors. The transmission of UHF waves may be associated with smaller antennas and shorter ranges (e.g., less than 100 kilometers) compared to transmission using the smaller frequencies and longer waves of the high frequency (HF) or very high frequency (VHF) portion of the spectrum below 300 MHz.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may also operate in a super high frequency (SHF) region using frequency bands from 3 GHz to 30 GHz, also known as the centimeter band, or in an extremely high frequency (EHF) region of the spectrum (e.g., from 30 GHz to 300 GHz), also known as the millimeter band. In some examples, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support millimeter wave (mmW) communications between the UEs <b>115</b> and the base stations <b>105</b>, and EHF antennas of the respective devices may be smaller and more closely spaced than UHF antennas. In some examples, this may facilitate use of antenna arrays within a device. The propagation of EHF transmissions, however, may be subject to even greater atmospheric attenuation and shorter range than SHF or UHF transmissions. The techniques disclosed herein may be employed across transmissions that use one or more different frequency regions, and designated use of bands across these frequency regions may differ by country or regulating body.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may utilize both licensed and unlicensed radio frequency spectrum bands. For example, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may employ License Assisted Access (LAA), LTE-Unlicensed (LTE-U) radio access technology, or NR technology in an unlicensed band such as the 5 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band. When operating in unlicensed radio frequency spectrum bands, devices such as the base stations <b>105</b> and the UEs <b>115</b> may employ carrier sensing for collision detection and avoidance. In some examples, operations in unlicensed bands may be based on a carrier aggregation configuration in conjunction with component carriers operating in a licensed band (e.g., LAA). Operations in unlicensed spectrum may include downlink transmissions, uplink transmissions, P2P transmissions, or D2D transmissions, among other examples.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">A base station <b>105</b> or a UE <b>115</b> may be equipped with multiple antennas, which may be used to employ techniques such as transmit diversity, receive diversity, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications, or beamforming. The antennas of a base station <b>105</b> or a UE <b>115</b> may be located within one or more antenna arrays or antenna panels, which may support MIMO operations or transmit or receive beamforming. For example, one or more base station antennas or antenna arrays may be co-located at an antenna assembly, such as an antenna tower. In some examples, antennas or antenna arrays associated with a base station <b>105</b> may be located in diverse geographic locations. A base station <b>105</b> may have an antenna array with a number of rows and columns of antenna ports that the base station <b>105</b> may use to support beamforming of communications with a UE <b>115</b>. Likewise, a UE <b>115</b> may have one or more antenna arrays that may support various MIMO or beamforming operations. Additionally or alternatively, an antenna panel may support radio frequency beamforming for a signal transmitted via an antenna port.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The base stations <b>105</b> or the UEs <b>115</b> may use MIMO communications to exploit multipath signal propagation and increase the spectral efficiency by transmitting or receiving multiple signals via different spatial layers. Such techniques may be referred to as spatial multiplexing. The multiple signals may, for example, be transmitted by the transmitting device via different antennas or different combinations of antennas. Likewise, the multiple signals may be received by the receiving device via different antennas or different combinations of antennas. Each of the multiple signals may be referred to as a separate spatial stream and may carry bits associated with the same data stream (e.g., the same codeword) or different data streams (e.g., different codewords). Different spatial layers may be associated with different antenna ports used for channel measurement and reporting. MIMO techniques include single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO), where multiple spatial layers are transmitted to the same receiving device, and multiple-user MIMO (MU-MIMO), where multiple spatial layers are transmitted to multiple devices.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Beamforming, which may also be referred to as spatial filtering, directional transmission, or directional reception, is a signal processing technique that may be used at a transmitting device or a receiving device (e.g., a base station <b>105</b>, a UE <b>115</b>) to shape or steer an antenna beam (e.g., a transmit beam, a receive beam) along a spatial path between the transmitting device and the receiving device. Beamforming may be achieved by combining the signals communicated via antenna elements of an antenna array such that some signals propagating at particular orientations with respect to an antenna array experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. The adjustment of signals communicated via the antenna elements may include a transmitting device or a receiving device applying amplitude offsets, phase offsets, or both to signals carried via the antenna elements associated with the device. The adjustments associated with each of the antenna elements may be defined by a beamforming weight set associated with a particular orientation (e.g., with respect to the antenna array of the transmitting device or receiving device, or with respect to some other orientation).</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">A base station <b>105</b> or a UE <b>115</b> may use beam sweeping techniques as part of beam forming operations. For example, a base station <b>105</b> may use multiple antennas or antenna arrays (e.g., antenna panels) to conduct beamforming operations for directional communications with a UE <b>115</b>. Some signals (e.g., synchronization signals, reference signals, beam selection signals, or other control signals) may be transmitted by a base station <b>105</b> multiple times in different directions. For example, the base station <b>105</b> may transmit a signal according to different beamforming weight sets associated with different directions of transmission. Transmissions in different beam directions may be used to identify (e.g., by a transmitting device, such as a base station <b>105</b>, or by a receiving device, such as a UE <b>115</b>) a beam direction for later transmission or reception by the base station <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Some signals, such as data signals associated with a particular receiving device, may be transmitted by a base station <b>105</b> in a single beam direction (e.g., a direction associated with the receiving device, such as a UE <b>115</b>). In some examples, the beam direction associated with transmissions along a single beam direction may be determined based on a signal that was transmitted in one or more beam directions. For example, a UE <b>115</b> may receive one or more of the signals transmitted by the base station <b>105</b> in different directions and may report to the base station <b>105</b> an indication of the signal that the UE <b>115</b> received with a highest signal quality or an otherwise acceptable signal quality.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In some examples, transmissions by a device (e.g., by a base station <b>105</b> or a UE <b>115</b>) may be performed using multiple beam directions, and the device may use a combination of digital precoding or radio frequency beamforming to generate a combined beam for transmission (e.g., from a base station <b>105</b> to a UE <b>115</b>). The UE <b>115</b> may report feedback that indicates precoding weights for one or more beam directions, and the feedback may correspond to a configured number of beams across a system bandwidth or one or more sub-bands. The base station <b>105</b> may transmit a reference signal (e.g., a cell-specific reference signal (CRS), a channel state information reference signal (CSI-RS)), which may be precoded or unprecoded. The UE <b>115</b> may provide feedback for beam selection, which may be a precoding matrix indicator (PMI) or codebook-based feedback (e.g., a multi-panel type codebook, a linear combination type codebook, a port selection type codebook). Although these techniques are described with reference to signals transmitted in one or more directions by a base station <b>105</b>, a UE <b>115</b> may employ similar techniques for transmitting signals multiple times in different directions (e.g., for identifying a beam direction for subsequent transmission or reception by the UE <b>115</b>) or for transmitting a signal in a single direction (e.g., for transmitting data to a receiving device).</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">A receiving device (e.g., a UE <b>115</b>) may try multiple receive configurations (e.g., directional listening) when receiving various signals from the base station <b>105</b>, such as synchronization signals, reference signals, beam selection signals, or other control signals. For example, a receiving device may try multiple receive directions by receiving via different antenna subarrays, by processing received signals according to different antenna subarrays, by receiving according to different receive beamforming weight sets (e.g., different directional listening weight sets) applied to signals received at multiple antenna elements of an antenna array, or by processing received signals according to different receive beamforming weight sets applied to signals received at multiple antenna elements of an antenna array, any of which may be referred to as &#x201c;listening&#x201d; according to different receive configurations or receive directions. In some examples, a receiving device may use a single receive configuration to receive along a single beam direction (e.g., when receiving a data signal). The single receive configuration may be aligned in a beam direction determined based on listening according to different receive configuration directions (e.g., a beam direction determined to have a highest signal strength, highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), or otherwise acceptable signal quality based on listening according to multiple beam directions).</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be a packet-based network that operates according to a layered protocol stack. In the user plane, communications at the bearer or Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) layer may be IP-based. A Radio Link Control (RLC) layer may perform packet segmentation and reassembly to communicate over logical channels. A Medium Access Control (MAC) layer may perform priority handling and multiplexing of logical channels into transport channels. The MAC layer may also use error detection techniques, error correction techniques, or both to support retransmissions at the MAC layer to improve link efficiency. In the control plane, the Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol layer may provide establishment, configuration, and maintenance of an RRC connection between a UE <b>115</b> and a base station <b>105</b> or a core network <b>130</b> supporting radio bearers for user plane data. At the physical layer, transport channels may be mapped to physical channels.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The UEs <b>115</b> and the base stations <b>105</b> may support retransmissions of data to increase the likelihood that data is received successfully. Hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) feedback is one technique for increasing the likelihood that data is received correctly over a communication link <b>125</b>. HARQ may include a combination of error detection (e.g., using a cyclic redundancy check (CRC)), forward error correction (FEC), and retransmission (e.g., automatic repeat request (ARQ)). HARQ may improve throughput at the MAC layer in poor radio conditions (e.g., low signal-to-noise conditions). In some examples, a device may support same-slot HARQ feedback, where the device may provide HARQ feedback in a specific slot for data received in a previous symbol in the slot. In other cases, the device may provide HARQ feedback in a subsequent slot, or according to some other time interval.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be a distributed systems where UEs <b>115</b> monitor for and receive packets from one or more other UEs <b>115</b>. For example, while two UEs <b>115</b> communicate with each other, a third UE <b>115</b> may be capable of monitoring transmissions between the two UEs <b>115</b>. Additionally, such systems may support the use of midlayers such as the VAE and SEAL to coordinate services and application specific functions between the network and UEs <b>115</b> as well as between UEs <b>115</b>. The VAE and SEAL framework may include a congestion control service for communication on sidelinks between UEs <b>115</b>. The congestion control service may include VAE and SEAL functions to deal with distributed communication for sidelink communication where not all UEs <b>115</b> are in coverage by providing a relaying and aggregation service at SEAL and VAE nodes.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The resources reserved for sidelink communication may be in high demand based on the limited spectrum allocated for V2X and the large amount of UEs <b>115</b> that may congregate in a certain area, which is most likely when V2X communication is most desired. For example, V2X communication is useful at peak traffic times in congested locations, when an accident occurs, at a busy intersection, and the like. With the new services enabled by the advanced new radio (NR) V2X over PC5 links, a large amount of traffic (e.g., sensor data or video data) may be transmitted between UEs <b>115</b>, which may use more sophisticated control in case of congestion based on the application characteristics and requirements, instead of simple rules that applies to all. Thus, techniques to further assist the VAE and SEAL in determining whether congestion is occurring and mitigation options may be desirable.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">According to the techniques described herein, a VAE and SEAL enhanced framework may include support for the detection of sidelink congestion as well as the mitigation of the congestion between UEs <b>115</b>. The described techniques may include the VAE layer collecting information on one or more applications running at a UE <b>115</b> at a specific location, among a specific group of UEs <b>115</b>, for a particular service (e.g., platooning, sensor sharing, or intersection assistance, etc.), and also collect information regarding UE <b>115</b> maneuvers, such as a left turn, right turn, going straight, lane change, merge, etc. Further, the SEAL layer may manage and monitor resources based on PC5 communication status, PC5 communication statistics, number of unicast links, PC5 QoS information, or the like. Based on the collected information, the VAE layer may determine if a service type may be subject to congestion control according to a determined algorithm, which may include adjusting the message generation rate at a UE <b>115</b>. Additionally, based on the collected information, the SEAL layer may also perform analytics to determine if certain type of communication is facing problem or may predict if certain type of communication may face a problem in the future, and provides such information to the VAE layer.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In some cases, status monitoring and congestion detection may support scenarios when some UEs <b>115</b> are not in coverage but communicating with other UEs <b>115</b> via PC5. In cases were a UE <b>115</b> is out of coverage, the VAE may indicate relaying or aggregation of service level status reporting to a UE <b>115</b> in coverage, such that out-of-coverage UEs <b>115</b> may report congestion information to the in-coverage UE <b>115</b>. The VAE may also configure how congestion control instructions should be distributed through the V2X system. Other considerations for the congestion service at the VAE and SEAL include the use of different PLMNs by different UEs <b>115</b>. In such cases, the VAE or SEAL server may be either common or may be placed on the user plane and accessible from different PLMNs. Alternatively, an inter-SEAL server interface can be created, such that an out-of-coverage UE <b>115</b> may communicate with its HPLMN VAE or SEAL server via an in-coverage UE <b>115</b> and its SEAL server. Accordingly, sidelink congestion may be detected and managed efficiently.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example of a distributed wireless communications system <b>200</b> in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure. In some examples, distributed wireless communications system <b>200</b> may implement aspects of wireless communications system <b>100</b>. Distributed wireless communications system <b>200</b> may be an NR V2X system and may include UEs <b>115</b>-<i>a, </i><b>115</b>-<i>b, </i><b>115</b>-<i>c, </i>and <b>115</b>-<i>d, </i>which may be examples of a UE <b>115</b>, as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. UEs <b>115</b>-<i>a, </i><b>115</b>-<i>b, </i><b>115</b>-<i>c, </i>and <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>may support a congestion control service at the VAE server <b>220</b> and SEAL server <b>225</b> based on enhanced VAE and SEAL midlayer framework. The techniques described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> may also apply to communications in a system other than a V2X system.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">UEs <b>115</b> in wireless communications system <b>200</b> may be distributed throughout the system and communicate via sidelinks <b>205</b>. In some examples, UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may be within coverage area <b>110</b>-<i>a </i>of base station <b>105</b>-<i>a. </i>Accordingly, UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>and base station <b>105</b>-<i>a </i>may communicate via link <b>210</b>. UEs <b>115</b>-<i>b, </i><b>115</b>-<i>c, </i>and <b>115</b>-<i>d, </i>however, may be outside of coverage area <b>110</b>-<i>a </i>of base station <b>105</b>-<i>a </i>and may not be in direct communication with base station <b>105</b>-<i>a. </i>Instead, UEs <b>115</b>-<i>b, </i><b>115</b>-<i>c, </i>and <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>may indirectly communicate with base station <b>105</b>-<i>a </i>through UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>via sidelinks <b>205</b>. For example, UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>may transmit congestion information intended for VAE <b>220</b> to UE <b>115</b>-<i>b </i>over sidelink <b>205</b>. Then, UE <b>115</b>-<i>b </i>may forward the transmissions to UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>over a sidelink <b>205</b>, and UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may forward the transmissions to base station <b>105</b>-<i>a </i>over link <b>210</b>, where the base station <b>105</b>-<i>a </i>may be in communication with VAE <b>220</b> and SEAL <b>225</b> via links <b>215</b>. Additionally, VAE server <b>220</b> and SEAL server <b>225</b> may be in communication with each other via link <b>217</b> and may be configured to support a congestion control service for communication by one or more UEs <b>115</b> communicating on sidelinks <b>205</b>. In some examples, the UE <b>115</b>-<i>a, </i>within the coverage area <b>110</b>-<i>a, </i>may be a roadside unit (RSU) strategically located at a certain position to provide the assistance for other UEs <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Sidelink <b>205</b> communications, such as V2X communications, may become congested, for example, due to limited spectrum (e.g., 30 MHz), limited radio resources, and large amount of UEs <b>115</b> that may congregate in a certain area. In some cases, sidelink <b>205</b> congestion may occur when V2X communications are critical for UE <b>115</b> behavior (e.g., for safety, such as avoiding situations that may be potentially dangerous of may otherwise impact a user). For example, when UEs <b>115</b> are in traffic, near an intersection, approaching an accident, or another UE <b>115</b> dense area, communications congestion may occur. Additionally, sidelink <b>205</b> congestion may be the result of increasing data transfer rates between UEs <b>115</b>. For instance, some V2X services enabled by advanced NR V2X over sidelink <b>205</b> (e.g., PC5) may transmit a large amount of traffic to enable sensor sharing or raw video data sharing for safety services determinations. Such advanced services may demand sophisticated control when congestion occurs, such as service prioritization based on a location of a UE <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">As described herein, the VAE <b>220</b> and SEAL <b>225</b> framework may be enhanced to support the detection of the congestion and the management of the congestion on sidelinks <b>205</b>. In some cases, all V2X applications may use congestion control, and it is desirable to implement the congestion control at the VAE <b>220</b> layer for V2X so that all applications may be handled with consistent manner at each UE <b>115</b>. As such, congestion control and coordination of sidelink communications may be implemented through functions performed by a server associated with the VAE layer (such as by the VAE server <b>220</b>). Likewise, congestion control and management may additionally or alternatively be implemented through functions performed by a server associated with the SEAL (such as by the SEAL server <b>225</b>). The techniques described herein address aspects of V2X sidelink congestion control at both VAE and SEAL layer, including communication status monitoring for congestion detection and congestion management. Due to the nature of sidelink <b>205</b> communication, the status monitoring and congestion detection may support PC5 case when not all UEs <b>115</b> are in coverage (e.g., UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>is in coverage while UEs <b>115</b>-<i>b, </i><b>115</b>-<i>c, </i>and <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>may be out-of-coverage). The VAE <b>220</b> and SEAL <b>225</b> may work together to control congestion at sidelinks <b>205</b>. In some, cases each layer may be responsible for overlapping and/or unique congestion control functions.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">The VAE <b>220</b> may enable intelligent congestion control by understanding, for each UE <b>115</b>, which application is running at a specific location, specific UE <b>115</b> groupings or zones, particular services (e.g., platooning, sensor sharing, or intersection assistance), and the maneuvers and/or movement of different UEs <b>115</b> (e.g., turning left, turning right, moving straight, lane changes, merging, or other like maneuvers). The VAE <b>220</b> may also collect operation information for each of these categories. Based on the collected information, the VAE <b>220</b> may determine if a service type (e.g., provider service identifier (PSID) or intelligent transport system (ITS) application identifier (AID) (ITS-AID)) may be subject to congestion control, for example, an adjusted message generation rate. This determination may be made according to a determined algorithm. Some example control mechanisms may be based on V2X specific logic, such as service priority logic based on situation awareness or motion state of the UE <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The SEAL <b>225</b> may enable intelligent congestion control by monitoring and managing sidelink <b>205</b> (e.g., PC5) communication status, such as Channel Busy Ratio (CBR) or reference signal receive power (RSRP). Additionally or alternatively, the SEAL <b>225</b> may monitor and manage sidelink <b>205</b> (e.g., PC5) communication statistics, such as the number of UE <b>115</b> groups (e.g., layer two (L2) IDs) or the number of unicast links. Additionally or alternatively, the SEAL <b>225</b> may monitor and manage sidelink <b>205</b> (e.g., PC5) QoS information including, for example, packet error rate, packet delay observed, HARQ feedback error counts, groupcast range, unicast bitrate, and a prevention quality indicator (PQI). Based on the monitored information, the SEAL <b>225</b> may perform analytics to determine if certain type of communication is facing problem and provides such information to VAE <b>220</b>. In some cases, the determination may be based on data statistics and/or analytics, or some machine learning or artificial intelligence (AI)-based prediction. The SEAL <b>225</b> sharing this determination with the VAE <b>220</b> allows the VAE <b>220</b> to exercise congestion control based on lower layer communication type to adjust an application communication mode.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">The VAE <b>220</b> and SEAL <b>225</b> may collect information from UEs <b>115</b>. In some cases, information may have to be relayed to the servers. As shown, UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>may not have direct communication with UE <b>115</b>-<i>a, </i>which is in coverage, and therefore, UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>cannot directly monitor and report the information from UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>to the VAE <b>220</b> and SEAL <b>225</b> (which may be referred to as a SEAL network resource management (NRM) server). In order to support this common case of out-of-coverage UEs <b>115</b> for V2X, UE <b>115</b>-<i>b </i>or <b>115</b>-<i>c </i>may help in providing the information from UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>to the network side (e.g., VAE <b>220</b> or SEAL <b>225</b>) via UE <b>115</b>-<i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In some examples, UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may serve as a UE-to-network relay for the out of coverage UEs <b>115</b> (e.g., UEs <b>115</b>-<i>b, </i><b>115</b>-<i>c, </i>and <b>115</b>-<i>d</i>), and each UE <b>115</b>-<i>a, </i><b>115</b>-<i>b, </i><b>115</b>-<i>c, </i>and <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>reports to the server individually. Accordingly, repeated information may be sent to the VAE <b>220</b> and SEAL <b>225</b>. The UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may provide the relay or proxy operation to the VAE <b>220</b> and SEAL <b>225</b>, and the VAE <b>220</b> and SEAL <b>225</b> may organize and aggregate the information.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In other examples, each of the UEs <b>115</b> may forward the report information with associated location information.

UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may be in coverage area <b>110</b>-<i>a </i>and may not further groupcast the information. Instead, UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may trim the overlapping information and directly report the aggregated information to VAE <b>220</b> and SEAL <b>225</b> (e.g., via base station <b>105</b>-<i>a</i>).</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">To limit the unnecessary propagation of information, UE <b>115</b>-<i>b </i>or <b>115</b>-<i>c </i>may limit re-groupcast information to information within limited UE <b>115</b> zones (e.g., geographic areas, locations, or the like), which may be pre-configured, signaled to UEs <b>115</b>-<i>b </i>or <b>115</b>-<i>c </i>while in network coverage, or relayed to UEs <b>115</b>-<i>b </i>or <b>115</b>-<i>c </i>by UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>that is in coverage. The VAE <b>220</b> and SEAL <b>225</b> may configure the UEs <b>115</b> in a particular region to increase the zones if the VAE <b>220</b> or SEAL <b>225</b> determines one or more holes in the collected information. For example. VAE <b>220</b> may request more information from UE <b>115</b>-<i>b </i>via UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>based on a lack of complete congestion information.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Similar to information collection, VAE <b>220</b> and SEAL <b>225</b> may distribute congestion controls to UEs <b>115</b>. In some examples, the layers may work together for cross-layer congestion management. As described above, VAE <b>220</b> and SEAL <b>225</b> may exercise congestion control management at different levels. For example, VAE <b>220</b> may determine that a certain service (e.g., a safety service) should be prioritized and therefore request that to the SEAL <b>225</b>. An NRM server may generate the corresponding policies to be delivered to all the UEs <b>115</b> in a particular region.
