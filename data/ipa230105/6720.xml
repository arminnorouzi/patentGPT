num="0000">Methods, systems, and devices for wireless communications are described. A codebook adaptation may be performed for a flexible user equipment (UEs) to determine a codebook for a physical configuration of the UE. For example, if the UE determines that the physical configuration does not correspond to a pre-loaded codebook in its memory, the UE may provide information about the physical configuration to a base station to determine a corresponding codebook. Additionally, the UE may request that the base station provide channel information to assist with the codebook determination. In some cases, this request may indicate for the base station to allocate a specific number of channel state information reference signal symbols that the UE can use for the codebook determination. Additionally or alternatively, the UE may generate the codebook internally and then signal to the base station a request for a beam refinement procedure with the generated codebook.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="212.68mm" wi="153.75mm" file="US20230006721A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="252.22mm" wi="164.76mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230006721A1-20230105-D00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-D00002" he="223.52mm" wi="155.79mm" file="US20230006721A1-20230105-D00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-D00003" he="223.52mm" wi="157.82mm" file="US20230006721A1-20230105-D00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-D00004" he="238.59mm" wi="150.96mm" file="US20230006721A1-20230105-D00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-D00005" he="259.50mm" wi="124.88mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230006721A1-20230105-D00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-D00006" he="211.07mm" wi="145.46mm" file="US20230006721A1-20230105-D00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00007" num="00007"><img id="EMI-D00007" he="255.35mm" wi="141.82mm" file="US20230006721A1-20230105-D00007.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00008" num="00008"><img id="EMI-D00008" he="159.94mm" wi="171.28mm" file="US20230006721A1-20230105-D00008.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00009" num="00009"><img id="EMI-D00009" he="213.95mm" wi="171.28mm" file="US20230006721A1-20230105-D00009.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00010" num="00010"><img id="EMI-D00010" he="198.04mm" wi="161.37mm" file="US20230006721A1-20230105-D00010.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00011" num="00011"><img id="EMI-D00011" he="254.51mm" wi="156.89mm" file="US20230006721A1-20230105-D00011.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00012" num="00012"><img id="EMI-D00012" he="159.94mm" wi="171.28mm" file="US20230006721A1-20230105-D00012.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00013" num="00013"><img id="EMI-D00013" he="188.55mm" wi="171.28mm" file="US20230006721A1-20230105-D00013.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00014" num="00014"><img id="EMI-D00014" he="170.10mm" wi="161.37mm" file="US20230006721A1-20230105-D00014.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00015" num="00015"><img id="EMI-D00015" he="254.42mm" wi="150.62mm" file="US20230006721A1-20230105-D00015.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00016" num="00016"><img id="EMI-D00016" he="220.98mm" wi="111.17mm" file="US20230006721A1-20230105-D00016.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00017" num="00017"><img id="EMI-D00017" he="221.15mm" wi="146.64mm" file="US20230006721A1-20230105-D00017.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00018" num="00018"><img id="EMI-D00018" he="253.49mm" wi="146.64mm" file="US20230006721A1-20230105-D00018.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00019" num="00019"><img id="EMI-D00019" he="173.65mm" wi="111.17mm" file="US20230006721A1-20230105-D00019.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00020" num="00020"><img id="EMI-D00020" he="191.69mm" wi="111.17mm" file="US20230006721A1-20230105-D00020.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><description id="description"><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application for patent is a Continuation of U.S. patent application Ser.

end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0050" num="0049">A wireless device such as a UE may include multiple antenna modules each with multiple antenna arrays used to support communications between the UE and other wireless devices (e.g., a base station). The multiple antenna arrays may each include a set of antenna elements, each of which may be separately or jointly configured to transmit or receive wireless signals. The multiple antenna arrays may be located or positioned at different parts or along different portions of the UE and may allow the UE to flexibly perform beamforming communications.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">When performing communications, the multiple antenna arrays may be configured individually or jointly as antenna sets or groups, and the size of each antenna set or group (including the number of antenna arrays in the antenna set or group) may vary based on a physical configuration of the UE. Recently, UEs with foldable or flexible displays have increased in popularity. For example, a UE may include a flexible (e.g., foldable) display having different physical configurations (e.g., multiple independent foldable display units, flexible displays, bendable displays, rollable displays, additional unique form factors, etc.), and the communication parameters used for transmission and reception of signals via the multiple antenna arrays (or a portion of the multiple antenna arrays) may depend on the physical configuration of the flexible display. In some aspects, a state of the physical configuration of the flexible display (e.g., a closed state, a partially open state, a fully open state, etc.) or the arrangement of the multiple antenna arrays relative to one another may be used to configure and perform beamforming communications between the UE and a base station.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">While form factor and cost considerations result in most UEs having a non-foldable display, UEs with foldable displays have gained increasing traction as design complexity has decreased. UEs with foldable displays may present new challenges in wireless communications. For example, depending on a configuration of the foldable displays of a UE, traditional techniques may be unsuitable or may need to be enhanced for improving beamforming communications between the UE and other wireless devices (e.g., a base station). For existing systems and UEs, antenna arrays (e.g., shapes and sizes) may be known and fixed (e.g., linear arrays, planar arrays, etc.). As such, analog beamforming codebooks may be generated beforehand and stored in local memory (e.g., RFIC memory) of the UEs. These analog beamforming codebooks may be used to enable beamforming communications between the UEs and other wireless devices (e.g., other UEs, base stations, etc.). For example, the analog beamforming codebooks may enable the UEs to determine characteristics about the beams (e.g., beamwidth, size, direction, gain in a certain direction, etc.) prior to transmitting information and messages on the beams.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Currently, a link budget (e.g., an amount of received power based on a transmitted power and considering any gains and losses during transmission) may be met for flexible UEs through different beamforming techniques. For example, multi-antenna analog beamforming with directional codebooks of beams may be used to increase antenna array gains for the link budget. Such codebooks may be designed prior to the communications (e.g., a priori) according to different design criteria of the flexible UEs and stored in the flexible UEs (e.g., in local memory). However, all of the codebooks that correspond to the different foldable states may not be calculated beforehand (e.g., since the codebooks depend on a specific device use or form factor which may change in time). Additionally, the flexible UEs may have limited local memory storage such that not all of the analog beamforming codebooks corresponding to all possible different foldable states of the flexible UE can be stored for use at all times.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">As described herein, a flexible UE may perform a codebook adaptation based on an identified foldable state for itself. For example, if the flexible UE determines that a current or upcoming foldable state does not correspond to a codebook that has been determined prior to the foldable state and is not stored in the local memory (e.g., pre-loaded), the flexible UE may provide information about the folding state to a base station and an indication that a codebook is currently undetermined or unavailable for the foldable state. Additionally, when providing this information to the base station, the flexible UE may also request that the base station provide channel information to assist with the codebook determination. In some cases, this request may indicate to the base station to allocate a specific number of contiguous CSI-RS symbols that the UE can use for the codebook determination. Additionally or alternatively, the UE may generate the codebook internally and then signal to the base station a request for a beam refinement procedure with the generated codebook. This beam refinement procedure request may also indicate to the base station to transmit a set of contiguous CSI-RS symbols to determine beams for subsequent communication.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Aspects of the disclosure are initially described in the context of a wireless communications system. Examples of additional wireless communications systems, flexible wireless devices, and a process flow are then provided to illustrate aspects of the disclosure. Aspects of the disclosure are further illustrated by and described with reference to apparatus diagrams, system diagrams, and flowcharts that relate to beamforming codebook adaptation for flexible wireless devices.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example of a wireless communications system <b>100</b> that supports beamforming codebook adaptation for flexible wireless devices in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure. The wireless communications system <b>100</b> includes network devices <b>105</b>, UEs <b>115</b>, and a core network <b>130</b>. In some examples, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be an LTE network, an LTE-A network, an LTE-A Pro network, or an NR network. In some cases, wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support enhanced broadband communications, ultra-reliable (e.g., mission critical) communications, low latency communications, or communications with low-cost and low-complexity devices.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The core network <b>130</b> may provide user authentication, access authorization, tracking, Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity, and other access, routing, or mobility functions. The core network <b>130</b> may be an evolved packet core (EPC), which may include at least one mobility management entity (MME), at least one serving gateway (S-GW), and at least one Packet Data Network (PDN) gateway (P-GW). The MME may manage non-access stratum (e.g., control plane) functions such as mobility, authentication, and bearer management for UEs <b>115</b> served by network devices <b>105</b> associated with the EPC. User IP packets may be transferred through the S-GW, which itself may be connected to the P-GW. The P-GW may provide IP address allocation as well as other functions. The P-GW may be connected to the network operators IP services. The operators IP services may include access to the Internet, Intranet(s), an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), or a Packet-Switched (PS) Streaming Service.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">At least some of the network devices <b>105</b> (e.g., network device <b>105</b>-<i>a</i>), which may be an example of a base station (e.g., eNB, network access devices, gNB), or network device <b>105</b>-<i>b</i>, which may be an example of an access node controller (ANC)), may interface with the core network <b>130</b> through backhaul links <b>132</b> (e.g., S1, S2) and may perform radio configuration and scheduling for communication with the UEs <b>115</b>. In various examples, the network devices <b>105</b>-<i>b </i>may communicate, either directly or indirectly (e.g., through core network <b>130</b>), with each other over backhaul links <b>134</b> (e.g., X1, X2), which may be wired or wireless communication links.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Each network device <b>105</b>-<i>b </i>may also additionally or alternatively communicate with a number of UEs <b>115</b> through a number of other network devices <b>105</b>-<i>c</i>, where network device <b>105</b>-<i>c </i>may be an example of a smart radio head (or through a number of smart radio heads). In alternative configurations, various functions of each network device <b>105</b> may be distributed across various network devices <b>105</b> (e.g., radio heads and access network controllers) or consolidated into a single network device <b>105</b> (e.g., a base station).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Network device <b>105</b> may wirelessly communicate with UEs <b>115</b> via one or more base station antennas. Network device <b>105</b> described herein may include or may be referred to by those skilled in the art as a base transceiver station, a radio base station, an access point, a radio transceiver, a NodeB, an eNodeB (eNB), a 5G or a next-generation NodeB or giga-NodeB (either of which may be referred to as a gNB), a Home NodeB, a Home eNodeB, or some other suitable terminology. Wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include network devices <b>105</b> of different types (e.g., macro or small cell base stations). The UEs <b>115</b> described herein may be able to communicate with various types of network devices <b>105</b> and network equipment including macro eNBs, small cell eNBs, gNBs, relay base stations, and the like.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Each network device <b>105</b> may be associated with a particular geographic coverage area <b>110</b> in which communications with various UEs <b>115</b> is supported. Each network device <b>105</b> may provide communication coverage for a respective geographic coverage area <b>110</b> via communication links <b>125</b>, and communication links <b>125</b> between a network device <b>105</b> and a UE <b>115</b> may utilize one or more carriers. Communication links <b>125</b> shown in wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include uplink transmissions from a UE <b>115</b> to a network device <b>105</b>, or downlink transmissions from a network device <b>105</b> to a UE <b>115</b>. Downlink transmissions may also be called forward link transmissions while uplink transmissions may also be called reverse link transmissions.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The geographic coverage area <b>110</b> for a network device <b>105</b> may be divided into sectors making up only a portion of the geographic coverage area <b>110</b>, and each sector may be associated with a cell. For example, each network device <b>105</b> may provide communication coverage for a macro cell, a small cell, a hot spot, or other types of cells, or various combinations thereof. In some examples, a network device <b>105</b> may be movable and therefore provide communication coverage for a moving geographic coverage area <b>110</b>. In some examples, different geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> associated with different technologies may overlap, and overlapping geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> associated with different technologies may be supported by the same network device <b>105</b> or by different network devices <b>105</b>. The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include, for example, a heterogeneous LTE/LTE-A/LTE-A Pro or NR network in which different types of network devices <b>105</b> provide coverage for various geographic coverage areas <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The term &#x201c;cell&#x201d; refers to a logical communication entity used for communication with a network device <b>105</b> (e.g., over a carrier), and may be associated with an identifier for distinguishing neighboring cells (e.g., a physical cell identifier (PCID), a virtual cell identifier (VCID)) operating via the same or a different carrier. In some examples, a carrier may support multiple cells, and different cells may be configured according to different protocol types (e.g., machine-type communication (MTC), narrowband Internet-of-Things (NB-IoT), enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), or others) that may provide access for different types of devices. In some cases, the term &#x201c;cell&#x201d; may refer to a portion of a geographic coverage area <b>110</b> (e.g., a sector) over which the logical entity operates.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">UEs <b>115</b> may be dispersed throughout the wireless communications system <b>100</b>, and each UE <b>115</b> may be stationary or mobile. A UE <b>115</b> may also be referred to as a mobile device, a wireless device, a remote device, a handheld device, or a subscriber device, or some other suitable terminology, where the &#x201c;device&#x201d; may also be referred to as a unit, a station, a terminal, or a client. A UE <b>115</b> may be a personal electronic device such as a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a tablet computer, a laptop computer, or a personal computer. Additionally, as described herein, a UE <b>115</b> may be a flexible wireless device with a foldable display. For example, a UE <b>115</b> may have multiple independent foldable display units, flexible displays, bendable displays, rollable displays, or other unique form factors. As used herein, the descriptors &#x201c;foldable display&#x201d;, &#x201c;flexible display&#x201d;, &#x201c;bendable display&#x201d;, and &#x201c;rollable display&#x201d; may be used interchangeably, where each of the descriptors relates to a UE <b>115</b> that includes one or more antenna arrays that can change based on an adjustable physical configuration of the UE <b>115</b>. In some examples, a UE <b>115</b> may also refer to a wireless local loop (WLL) station, an Internet of Things (IoT) device, an Internet of Everything (IoE) device, or an MTC device, or the like, which may be implemented in various articles such as appliances, vehicles, meters, or the like. A UE <b>115</b> may communicate with the core network <b>130</b> through communication link <b>135</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Some UEs <b>115</b>, such as MTC or IoT devices, may be low cost or low complexity devices, and may provide for automated communication between machines (e.g., via Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication). M2M communication or MTC may refer to data communication technologies that allow devices to communicate with one another or a network device <b>105</b> without human intervention. In some examples, M2M communication or MTC may include communications from devices that integrate sensors or meters to measure or capture information and relay that information to a central server or application program that can make use of the information or present the information to humans interacting with the program or application. Some UEs <b>115</b> may be designed to collect information or enable automated behavior of machines. Examples of applications for MTC devices include smart metering, inventory monitoring, water level monitoring, equipment monitoring, healthcare monitoring, wildlife monitoring, weather and geological event monitoring, fleet management and tracking, remote security sensing, physical access control, and transaction-based business charging.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Some UEs <b>115</b> may be configured to employ operating modes that reduce power consumption, such as half-duplex communications (e.g., a mode that supports one-way communication via transmission or reception, but not transmission and reception simultaneously). In some examples half-duplex communications may be performed at a reduced peak rate. Other power conservation techniques for UEs <b>115</b> include entering a power saving &#x201c;deep sleep&#x201d; mode when not engaging in active communications, or operating over a limited bandwidth (e.g., according to narrowband communications). In some cases, UEs <b>115</b> may be designed to support critical functions (e.g., mission critical functions), and a wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be configured to provide ultra-reliable communications for these functions.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some cases, a UE <b>115</b> may also be able to communicate directly with other UEs <b>115</b> (e.g., using a peer-to-peer (P2P) or device-to-device (D2D) protocol). One or more of a group of UEs <b>115</b> utilizing D2D communications may be within the geographic coverage area <b>110</b> of a network device <b>105</b>. Other UEs <b>115</b> in such a group may be outside the geographic coverage area <b>110</b> of a network device <b>105</b>, or be otherwise unable to receive transmissions from a network device <b>105</b>. In some cases, groups of UEs <b>115</b> communicating via D2D communications may utilize a one-to-many (1:M) system in which each UE <b>115</b> transmits to every other UE <b>115</b> in the group. In some cases, a network device <b>105</b> facilitates the scheduling of resources for D2D communications. In other cases, D2D communications are carried out between UEs <b>115</b> without the involvement of a network device <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Network devices <b>105</b> may communicate with the core network <b>130</b> and with one another. For example, network devices <b>105</b> may interface with the core network <b>130</b> through backhaul links <b>132</b> (e.g., via an S1, N2, N3, or other interface). Network devices <b>105</b> may communicate with one another over backhaul links <b>134</b> (e.g., via an X2, Xn, or other interface) either directly (e.g., directly between network devices <b>105</b>) or indirectly (e.g., via core network <b>130</b>).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The core network <b>130</b> may provide user authentication, access authorization, tracking, IP connectivity, and other access, routing, or mobility functions. The core network <b>130</b> may be an evolved packet core (EPC), which may include at least one mobility management entity (MME), at least one serving gateway (S-GW), and at least one Packet Data Network (PDN) gateway (P-GW). The MME may manage non-access stratum (e.g., control plane) functions such as mobility, authentication, and bearer management for UEs <b>115</b> served by network devices <b>105</b> associated with the EPC. User IP packets may be transferred through the S-GW, which itself may be connected to the P-GW. The P-GW may provide IP address allocation as well as other functions. The P-GW may be connected to the network operators IP services. The operators IP services may include access to the Internet, Intranet(s), an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), or a Packet-Switched (PS) Streaming Service.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">At least some of the network devices, such as a network device <b>105</b>, may include subcomponents such as an access network entity, which may be an example of an access node controller (ANC). Each access network entity may communicate with UEs <b>115</b> through a number of other access network transmission entities, which may be referred to as a radio head, a smart radio head, or a transmission/reception point (which may be known as a TRP; however, in the present disclosure, TRP will be assumed to stand for total radiated power unless otherwise specified). In some configurations, various functions of each access network entity or network device <b>105</b> may be distributed across various network devices (e.g., radio heads and access network controllers) or consolidated into a single network device (e.g., a network device <b>105</b>).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Wireless communications system <b>100</b> may operate using one or more frequency bands, typically in the range of 300 megahertz (MHz) to 300 gigahertz (GHz). Generally, the region from 300 MHz to 3 GHz is known as the ultra-high frequency (UHF) region or decimeter band, since the wavelengths range from approximately one decimeter to one meter in length. UHF waves may be blocked or redirected by buildings and environmental features. However, the waves may penetrate structures sufficiently for a macro cell to provide service to UEs <b>115</b> located indoors. Transmission of UHF waves may be associated with smaller antennas and shorter range (e.g., less than 100 km) compared to transmission using the smaller frequencies and longer waves of the high frequency (HF) or very high frequency (VHF) portion of the spectrum below 300 MHz.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Wireless communications system <b>100</b> may also operate in a super high frequency (SHF) region using frequency bands from 3 GHz to 30 GHz, also known as the centimeter band. The SHF region includes bands such as the 5 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) bands, which may be used opportunistically by devices that can tolerate interference from other users.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Wireless communications system <b>100</b> may also operate in an extremely high frequency (EHF) region of the spectrum (e.g., from 30 GHz to 300 GHz), also known as the millimeter band. In some examples, wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support millimeter wave (mmW) communications between UEs <b>115</b> and network devices <b>105</b>, and EHF antennas of the respective devices may be even smaller and more closely spaced than UHF antennas. In some cases, this may facilitate use of antenna arrays within a UE <b>115</b>. However, the propagation of EHF transmissions may be subject to even greater atmospheric attenuation and shorter range than SHF or UHF transmissions. Techniques disclosed herein may be employed across transmissions that use one or more different frequency regions, and designated use of bands across these frequency regions may differ by country or regulating body.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some cases, wireless communications system <b>100</b> may utilize both licensed and unlicensed radio frequency spectrum bands. For example, wireless communications system <b>100</b> may employ License Assisted Access (LAA), LTE-Unlicensed (LTE-U) radio access technology, or NR technology in an unlicensed band such as the 5 GHz ISM band. When operating in unlicensed radio frequency spectrum bands, wireless devices such as network devices <b>105</b> and UEs <b>115</b> may employ listen-before-talk (LBT) procedures to ensure a frequency channel is clear before transmitting data. In some cases, operations in unlicensed bands may be based on a CA configuration in conjunction with CCs operating in a licensed band (e.g., LAA). Operations in unlicensed spectrum may include downlink transmissions, uplink transmissions, peer-to-peer transmissions, or a combination of these. Duplexing in unlicensed spectrum may be based on frequency division duplexing (FDD), time division duplexing (TDD), or a combination of both.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some examples, network device <b>105</b> or UE <b>115</b> may be equipped with multiple antennas, which may be used to employ techniques such as transmit diversity, receive diversity, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications, or beamforming. For example, wireless communications system <b>100</b> may use a transmission scheme between a transmitting device (e.g., a network device <b>105</b>) and a receiving device (e.g., a UE <b>115</b>), where the transmitting device is equipped with multiple antennas and the receiving devices are equipped with one or more antennas.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">MIMO communications may employ multipath signal propagation to increase the spectral efficiency by transmitting or receiving multiple signals via different spatial layers, which may be referred to as spatial multiplexing. The multiple signals may, for example, be transmitted by the transmitting device via different antennas or different combinations of antennas. Likewise, the multiple signals may be received by the receiving device via different antennas or different combinations of antennas. Each of the multiple signals may be referred to as a separate spatial stream, and may carry bits associated with the same data stream (e.g., the same codeword) or different data streams. Different spatial layers may be associated with different antenna ports used for channel measurement and reporting. MIMO techniques include single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO) where multiple spatial layers are transmitted to the same receiving device, and multiple-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) where multiple spatial layers are transmitted to multiple devices.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Beamforming, which may also be referred to as spatial filtering, directional transmission, or directional reception, is a signal processing technique that may be used at a transmitting device or a receiving device (e.g., a network device <b>105</b> or a UE <b>115</b>) to shape or steer an antenna beam (e.g., a transmit beam or receive beam) along a spatial path between the transmitting device and the receiving device. Beamforming may be achieved by combining the signals communicated via antenna elements of an antenna array such that signals propagating at particular orientations with respect to an antenna array experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. The adjustment of signals communicated via the antenna elements may include a transmitting device or a receiving device applying certain amplitude and phase offsets to signals carried via each of the antenna elements associated with the device. The adjustments associated with each of the antenna elements may be defined by a beamforming weight set associated with a particular orientation (e.g., with respect to the antenna array of the transmitting device or receiving device, or with respect to some other orientation).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In one example, a network device <b>105</b> may use multiple antennas or antenna arrays to conduct beamforming operations for directional communications with a UE <b>115</b>. For instance, some signals (e.g., synchronization signals, reference signals, beam selection signals, or other control signals) may be transmitted by a network device <b>105</b> multiple times in different directions, which may include a signal being transmitted according to different beamforming weight sets associated with different directions of transmission. Transmissions in different beam directions may be used to identify (e.g., by the network device <b>105</b> or a receiving device, such as a UE <b>115</b>) a beam direction for subsequent transmission or reception by the network device <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Some signals, such as data signals associated with a particular receiving device, may be transmitted by a network device <b>105</b> in a single beam direction (e.g., a direction associated with the receiving device, such as a UE <b>115</b>). In some examples, the beam direction associated with transmissions along a single beam direction may be determined based at least in part on a signal that was transmitted in different beam directions. For example, a UE <b>115</b> may receive one or more of the signals transmitted by the network device <b>105</b> in different directions, and the UE <b>115</b> may report to the network device <b>105</b> an indication of the signal it received with a highest signal quality, or an otherwise acceptable signal quality. Although these techniques are described with reference to signals transmitted in one or more directions by a network device <b>105</b>, a UE <b>115</b> may employ similar techniques for transmitting signals multiple times in different directions (e.g., for identifying a beam direction for subsequent transmission or reception by the UE <b>115</b>), or transmitting a signal in a single direction (e.g., for transmitting data to a receiving device).</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">A receiving device (e.g., a UE <b>115</b>, which may be an example of a mmW receiving device) may try multiple receive beams when receiving various signals from the network device <b>105</b>, such as synchronization signals, reference signals, beam selection signals, or other control signals. For example, a receiving device may try multiple receive directions by receiving via different antenna subarrays, by processing received signals according to different antenna subarrays, by receiving according to different receive beamforming weight sets applied to signals received at a plurality of antenna elements of an antenna array, or by processing received signals according to different receive beamforming weight sets applied to signals received at a plurality of antenna elements of an antenna array, any of which may be referred to as &#x201c;listening&#x201d; according to different receive beams or receive directions. In some examples a receiving device may use a single receive beam to receive along a single beam direction (e.g., when receiving a data signal). The single receive beam may be aligned in a beam direction determined based at least in part on listening according to different receive beam directions (e.g., a beam direction determined to have a highest signal strength, highest signal-to-noise ratio, or otherwise acceptable signal quality based at least in part on listening according to multiple beam directions).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some cases, the antennas of a network device <b>105</b> or UE <b>115</b> may be located within one or more antenna arrays, which may support MIMO operations, or transmit or receive beamforming. For example, one or more base station antennas or antenna arrays may be co-located at an antenna assembly, such as an antenna tower. In some cases, antennas or antenna arrays associated with a network device <b>105</b> may be located in diverse geographic locations. A network device <b>105</b> may have an antenna array with a number of rows and columns of antenna ports that the network device <b>105</b> may use to support beamforming of communications with a UE <b>115</b>. Likewise, a UE <b>115</b> may have one or more antenna arrays that may support various MIMO or beamforming operations.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In some cases, wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be a packet-based network that operate according to a layered protocol stack. In the user plane, communications at the bearer or Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) layer may be IP-based. A Radio Link Control (RLC) layer may in some cases perform packet segmentation and reassembly to communicate over logical channels. A Medium Access Control (MAC) layer may perform priority handling and multiplexing of logical channels into transport channels. The MAC layer may also use hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) to provide retransmission at the MAC layer to improve link efficiency. In the control plane, the Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol layer may provide establishment, configuration, and maintenance of an RRC connection between a UE <b>115</b> and a network device <b>105</b> or core network <b>130</b> supporting radio bearers for user plane data. At the Physical layer, transport channels may be mapped to physical channels.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In some cases, UEs <b>115</b> and network devices <b>105</b> may support retransmissions of data to increase the likelihood that data is received successfully. HARQ feedback is one technique of increasing the likelihood that data is received correctly over a communication link <b>125</b>. HARQ may include a combination of error detection (e.g., using a cyclic redundancy check (CRC)), forward error correction (FEC), and retransmission (e.g., automatic repeat request (ARQ)). HARQ may improve throughput at the MAC layer in poor radio conditions (e.g., signal-to-noise conditions). In some cases, a wireless device may support same-slot HARQ feedback, where the device may provide HARQ feedback in a specific slot for data received in a previous symbol in the slot. In other cases, the device may provide HARQ feedback in a subsequent slot, or according to some other time interval.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Time intervals in LTE or NR may be expressed in multiples of a basic time unit, which may, for example, refer to a sampling period of T<sub>s</sub>= 1/30,720,000 seconds. Time intervals of a communications resource may be organized according to radio frames each having a duration of 10 milliseconds (ms), where the frame period may be expressed as T<sub>f</sub>=307,200 T<sub>s</sub>. The radio frames may be identified by a system frame number (SFN) ranging from 0 to 1023. Each frame may include 10 subframes numbered from 0 to 9, and each subframe may have a duration of 1 ms. A subframe may be further divided into 2 slots each having a duration of 0.5 ms, and each slot may contain 6 or 7 modulation symbol periods (e.g., depending on the length of the cyclic prefix prepended to each symbol period). Excluding the cyclic prefix, each symbol period may contain 2048 sampling periods. In some cases, a subframe may be the smallest scheduling unit of the wireless communications system <b>100</b>, and may be referred to as a transmission time interval (TTI). In other cases, a smallest scheduling unit of the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be shorter than a subframe or may be dynamically selected (e.g., in bursts of shortened TTIs (sTTIs) or in selected component carriers (CCs) using sTTIs).</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In some wireless communications systems, a slot may further be divided into multiple mini-slots containing one or more symbols. In some instances, a symbol of a mini-slot or a mini-slot may be the smallest unit of scheduling. Each symbol may vary in duration depending on the subcarrier spacing or frequency band of operation, for example. Further, some wireless communications systems may implement slot aggregation in which multiple slots or mini-slots are aggregated together and used for communication between a UE <b>115</b> and a network device <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The term &#x201c;carrier&#x201d; refers to a set of radio frequency spectrum resources having a defined physical layer structure for supporting communications over a communication link <b>125</b>. For example, a carrier of a communication link <b>125</b> may include a portion of a radio frequency spectrum band that is operated according to physical layer channels for a given radio access technology. Each physical layer channel may carry user data, control information, or other signaling. A carrier may be associated with a pre-defined frequency channel (e.g., an Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) absolute radio frequency channel number (EARFCN)), and may be positioned according to a channel raster for discovery by UEs <b>115</b>. Carriers may be downlink or uplink (e.g., in an FDD mode), or be configured to carry downlink and uplink communications (e.g., in a TDD mode). In some examples, signal waveforms transmitted over a carrier may be made up of multiple sub-carriers (e.g., using multi-carrier modulation (MCM) techniques such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) or DFT-s-OFDM).</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The organizational structure of the carriers may be different for different radio access technologies (LTE, LTE-A, LTE-A Pro, NR, etc.). For example, communications over a carrier may be organized according to TTIs or slots, each of which may include user data as well as control information or signaling to support decoding the user data. A carrier may also include dedicated acquisition signaling (e.g., synchronization signals or system information, etc.) and control signaling that coordinates operation for the carrier. In some examples (e.g., in a carrier aggregation configuration), a carrier may also have acquisition signaling or control signaling that coordinates operations for other carriers.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Physical channels may be multiplexed on a carrier according to various techniques. A physical control channel and a physical data channel may be multiplexed on a downlink carrier, for example, using time division multiplexing (TDM) techniques, frequency division multiplexing (FDM) techniques, or hybrid TDM-FDM techniques. In some examples, control information transmitted in a physical control channel may be distributed between different control regions in a cascaded manner (e.g., between a common control region or common search space and one or more UE-specific control regions or UE-specific search spaces).</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">A carrier may be associated with a particular bandwidth of the radio frequency spectrum, and in some examples the carrier bandwidth may be referred to as a &#x201c;system bandwidth&#x201d; of the carrier or the wireless communications system <b>100</b>. For example, the carrier bandwidth may be one of a number of predetermined bandwidths for carriers of a particular radio access technology (e.g., 1.4, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, or 80 MHz). In some examples, each served UE <b>115</b> may be configured for operating over portions or all of the carrier bandwidth. In other examples, some UEs <b>115</b> may be configured for operation using a narrowband protocol type that is associated with a predefined portion or range (e.g., set of subcarriers or resource blocks (RBs)) within a carrier (e.g., &#x201c;in-band&#x201d; deployment of a narrowband protocol type).</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In a system employing MCM techniques, a resource element may consist of one symbol period (e.g., a duration of one modulation symbol) and one subcarrier, where the symbol period and subcarrier spacing are inversely related. The number of bits carried by each resource element may depend on the modulation scheme (e.g., the order of the modulation scheme). Thus, the more resource elements that a UE <b>115</b> receives and the higher the order of the modulation scheme, the higher the data rate may be for the UE <b>115</b>. In MIMO systems, a wireless communications resource may refer to a combination of a radio frequency spectrum resource, a time resource, and a spatial resource (e.g., spatial layers), and the use of multiple spatial layers may further increase the data rate for communications with a UE <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Devices of the wireless communications system <b>100</b> (e.g., network devices <b>105</b> or UEs <b>115</b>) may have a hardware configuration that supports communications over a particular carrier bandwidth, or may be configurable to support communications over one of a set of carrier bandwidths. In some examples, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include network devices <b>105</b> or UEs <b>115</b> that can support simultaneous communications via carriers associated with more than one different carrier bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support communication with a UE <b>115</b> on multiple cells or carriers, a feature which may be referred to as carrier aggregation (CA) or multi-carrier operation. A UE <b>115</b> may be configured with multiple downlink CCs and one or more uplink CCs according to a carrier aggregation configuration. Carrier aggregation may be used with both FDD and TDD CCs.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In some cases, wireless communications system <b>100</b> may utilize enhanced CCs (eCCs). An eCC may be characterized by one or more features including wider carrier or frequency channel bandwidth, shorter symbol duration, shorter TTI duration, or modified control channel configuration. In some cases, an eCC may be associated with a carrier aggregation configuration or a dual connectivity configuration (e.g., when multiple serving cells have a suboptimal or non-ideal backhaul link). An eCC may also be configured for use in unlicensed spectrum or shared spectrum (e.g., where more than one operator is allowed to use the spectrum). An eCC characterized by wide carrier bandwidth may include one or more segments that may be utilized by UEs <b>115</b> that are not capable of monitoring the whole carrier bandwidth or are otherwise configured to use a limited carrier bandwidth (e.g., to conserve power).</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In some cases, an eCC may utilize a different symbol duration than other CCs, which may include use of a reduced symbol duration as compared with symbol durations of the other CCs. A shorter symbol duration may be associated with increased spacing between adjacent subcarriers. A device, such as a UE <b>115</b> or network device <b>105</b>, utilizing eCCs may transmit wideband signals (e.g., according to frequency channel or carrier bandwidths of 20, 40, 60, 80 MHz, etc.) at reduced symbol durations (e.g., 16.67 microseconds). A TTI in eCC may consist of one or multiple symbol periods. In some cases, the TTI duration (that is, the number of symbol periods in a TTI) may be variable.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Wireless communications systems such as an NR system may utilize any combination of licensed, shared, and unlicensed spectrum bands, among others. The flexibility of eCC symbol duration and subcarrier spacing may allow for the use of eCC across multiple spectrums. In some examples, NR shared spectrum may increase spectrum utilization and spectral efficiency, specifically through dynamic vertical (e.g., across the frequency domain) and horizontal (e.g., across the time domain) sharing of resources.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In some cases, a UE <b>115</b> may have multiple antenna arrays for wireless communication between the UE <b>115</b> and other wireless devices (e.g., a network device <b>105</b>). Additionally, the UE <b>115</b> may include a flexible display with multiple foldable states (e.g., different physical configurations). For example, the multiple foldable states may include flexible, bendable, or rollable displays that can result in the UE <b>115</b> being used for different functions (e.g., a mobile device, a phone, a tablet, or other devices with different form factors). These flexible UEs <b>115</b> may be utilized in wireless communications system <b>100</b> (e.g., 5G or NR system), where performance is maintained for different types of communications on different frequencies. For example, beamforming techniques may be used for communications between the flexible UEs <b>115</b> and network devices <b>105</b> in a mmW regime/frequency range (e.g., greater than 24 GHz).</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Currently, a link budget (e.g., an amount of received power based on a transmitted power and considering any gains and losses during transmission) may be met in wireless communications system <b>100</b> for the flexible UEs <b>115</b> through different beamforming techniques. For example, multi-antenna beamforming with directional codebooks of beams may be used to increase antenna array gains for the link budget. Such codebooks may be designed prior to the communications (e.g., a priori) according to different design criteria of the flexible UEs <b>115</b> and stored in a local memory of the flexible UEs <b>115</b> (e.g., RFIC memory). In some cases, the codebooks may be used by the flexible UEs <b>115</b> to determine different beam weights to apply to different antenna arrays in the flexible UEs <b>115</b> for creating one or more beams in a particular direction, a size of the one or more beams (e.g., beamwidth), or additional parameters of the one or more beams.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Additionally, different foldable states of the flexible UEs <b>115</b> (e.g., mobile/tablet/intermediate state, rolled up, etc.) may lead to different antenna subarrays that can be used for the communications (e.g., useful subarrays with different shapes and antenna dimensions). Accordingly, since the antenna subarrays available for communications can change, different hierarchical analog beamforming codebooks (e.g., wider or narrower beams) may be needed based on a current foldable state or upcoming (e.g., emerging) foldable state of the flexible UEs <b>115</b> (e.g., at different points in time). However, all of the analog beamforming codebooks that correspond to the different foldable states of the flexible UEs <b>115</b> may not be calculated beforehand (e.g., since the codebooks depend on a specific device use or form factor). Additionally, the flexible UEs <b>115</b> may have limited local storage such that not all of the analog beamforming codebooks can be stored for use at all times.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support efficient techniques for performing codebook adaptation for flexible UEs <b>115</b>. For example, if a flexible UE <b>115</b> determines that a current or upcoming foldable state does not correspond to a codebook that has been determined prior to the foldable state and is not stored in the local memory (e.g., pre-loaded), the flexible UE <b>115</b> may provide information about the folding state to a base station <b>105</b> and an indication that a codebook is currently undetermined or unavailable for the folding state. Additionally, when providing this information to the base station <b>105</b>, the flexible UE <b>115</b> may also request that the base station <b>105</b> provide channel information to assist with the codebook determination. In some cases, this request may indicate for the base station <b>105</b> to allocate a specific number of CSI-RS symbols that the UE can use for codebook determination. Additionally or alternatively, the UE <b>115</b> may generate the codebook internally and then signal to the base station <b>105</b> a request for a beam refinement procedure with the generated codebook. This beam refinement procedure request may also indicate to for the base station <b>105</b> to transmit a set of CSI-RS symbols to determine beam weights for subsequent communication.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">UEs <b>115</b> (e.g., wireless devices) may include a UE communications manager <b>101</b> for enabling a codebook determination for beamformed communications with a network device <b>105</b> (e.g., base station <b>105</b>). The UE communications manager <b>101</b> may enable a UE <b>115</b> to identify a physical configuration (e.g., foldable state) of itself and determine if an analog beamforming codebook that corresponds to the identified physical configuration is currently pre-loaded in its memory. If the UE <b>115</b> determines that a corresponding analog beamforming codebook is not pre-loaded in its memory, the UE communications manager <b>101</b> may enable the UE <b>115</b> to transmit signaling to the network device <b>105</b> that includes an indication of the physical configuration of the UE <b>115</b> and a request for channel information for a subsequent communication with the base station. The UE communications manager <b>101</b> may then enable the UE <b>115</b> to receive this channel information from the network device <b>105</b> based on the request and determine an analog beamforming codebook for the subsequent communication. In some cases, the channel information may include a set of contiguous CSI-RS resources that the UE <b>115</b> uses to determine the analog beamforming codebook.

These analog beamforming codebooks may be used to enable beamforming communications between the UEs <b>115</b> and other wireless devices (e.g., other UEs <b>115</b>, base stations <b>105</b>, etc.). For example, the analog beamforming codebooks may enable the UEs <b>115</b> to determine characteristics about the beams (e.g., beamwidth, size, direction, gain in a certain direction, etc.) prior to transmitting information and messages on the beams. Additionally, the analog beamforming codebooks may be determined and used based on a number of available radio frequency chains available for communications.
