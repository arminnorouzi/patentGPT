A health management system utilizing the MFP therefore would enable health management in daily life.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, collecting health management data via MFPs and storing the collected health management data in bulk enables statistical data aggregation, which is expected to contribute to more advanced health management.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A health management system using functions of the MFP installed in an office, for example, is capable of storing and outputting health data voluntarily measured by users.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment of this invention, there is provided a health data management system that includes, for example, a health data measurement apparatus and a health management server. The health data measurement apparatus includes medical and health equipment and first circuitry. The medical and health equipment measures health data related to a body of a user using the medical and health equipment. The first circuitry collects the health data of the user from the medical and health equipment. The health management server is communicable with the health data measurement apparatus, and includes a first memory and second circuitry. The first memory stores the health data of the user from the health data measurement apparatus. Based on the health data of the user stored in the first memory, the second circuitry generates health management data representing a health state of the user. Based on the generated health management data, the second circuitry analyzes at least one of an item indicating a worsening health state of the user, an item with insufficient measurement data, or an item lacking measurement data as a required check item. Based on the analysis, the second circuitry determines whether the health management data includes the required check item. Based on a determination that the health management data includes the required check item, the second circuitry transmits to the health data measurement apparatus a message prompting the user to take a measurement of the required check item, and requests the health data measurement apparatus to transmit the health data of the user collected from the medical and health equipment to the health management server.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment of this invention, there is provided a health data measurement apparatus connected to a health management server via a network. The health data measurement apparatus includes, for example, a display, medical and health equipment, and circuitry. The medical and health equipment measures health data related to a body of a user. The circuitry controls measurement of the medical and health equipment. In response to receipt of a request from the health management server, the circuitry controls the display to display a message prompting the user to take a measurement of a required check item, and transmits the health data of the user measured by the medical and health equipment to the health management server. The required check item is at least one of an item indicating a worsening health state of the user, an item with insufficient measurement data, or an item lacking measurement data.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment of this invention, there is provided a health data management method that includes, for example, storing health data of a user in a memory from a health data measurement apparatus. The health data of the user is collected to the health data measurement apparatus from medical and health equipment. The health data management method further includes generating, based on the health data of the user stored in the memory, health management data representing a health state of the user, analyzing, based on the generated health management data, at least one of an item indicating a worsening health state of the user, an item with insufficient measurement data, or an item lacking measurement data as a required check item, determining, based on the analysis, whether the health management data includes the required check item, and based on a determination that the health management data includes the required check item, transmitting to the health data measurement apparatus a message prompting the user to take a measurement of the required check item, and requesting the health data measurement apparatus to transmit the health data of the user collected from the medical and health equipment to the health management server.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION I/F THE SEVERAL VIEWS I/F THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A more complete appreciation of the disclosure and many of the attendant advantages and features thereof can be readily obtained and understood from the following detailed description with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration of a health management system according to a first embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a hardware configuration of a health data measurement apparatus included in the health management system of the first embodiment;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a hardware configuration of a health management server included in the health management system of the first embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a functional configuration of the health management system of the first embodiment;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating an operation of the health management system of the first embodiment;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a series of user interfaces displayed on a front surface of the health data measurement apparatus in the first embodiment to prompt a user to take a measurement of body composition based on a determination that the measurement by the user is necessary, and guide the user to complete the measurement;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a series of user interfaces displayed on the front surface of the health data measurement apparatus in a second embodiment of the present invention to notify the user of a determination that the measurement of an item measurable by the user with a smartwatch is necessary and guide the user to complete data reading; and</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a series of user interfaces displayed on the front surface of the health data measurement apparatus in a third embodiment of the present invention to guide the user to use the health data measurement apparatus when there is no item for which the measurement or data reading is necessary.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The accompanying drawings are intended to depict embodiments of the present invention and should not be interpreted to limit the scope thereof.
