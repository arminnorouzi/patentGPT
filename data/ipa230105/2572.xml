Specifically, the present invention relates to a polyolefin film that is readily molded and has excellent heat seal strength, in particular, low-temperature heat seal strength, and to a process for preparing the same.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A metallocene catalyst, which is one of the catalysts used in the polymerization of olefins, is a compound in which a ligand such as cyclopentadienyl, indenyl, and cycloheptadienyl is coordinated to a transition metal or a transition metal halide compound. It has a sandwich structure in its basic form.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a Ziegler-Natta catalyst, which is another catalyst used in the polymerization of olefins, the metal component serving as the active sites is dispersed on an inert solid surface, whereby the properties of the active sites are not uniform. On the other hand, since a metallocene catalyst is a single compound having a specific structure, it is known as a single-site catalyst in which all active sites have the same polymerization characteristics. A polymer prepared by such a metallocene catalyst is characterized by a narrow molecular weight distribution, a uniform distribution of comonomers, and a higher copolymerization activity than Ziegler-Natta catalysts.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Meanwhile, a linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) is produced by copolymerizing ethylene and an alpha-olefin at a low pressure using a polymerization catalyst. It has a narrow molecular weight distribution and short chain branches (SCBs) having a certain length, but generally does not have long chain branches (LCBs). Films prepared from a linear low-density polyethylene have high strength at breakage, elongation, tear strength, and impact strength in addition to the characteristics of common polyethylene. They are widely used for stretch films and overlap films to which conventional low-density polyethylene or high-density polyethylene is hardly applicable.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, a linear low-density polyethylene produced by a metallocene catalyst has a narrow molecular weight distribution, resulting in poor processability, and a film produced therefrom tends to have deteriorated heat seal characteristics.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, there is a demand for a polyolefin film that is readily molded and has excellent mechanical strength and excellent heat seal characteristics, in particular, excellent low-temperature heat seal characteristics.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0004"
