As a result, it was found that, when the blending amount of the plant extract was small, the granules needed to be ingested in a large amount at one time in order for a physiologically functional substance to be ingested in an effective amount, and hence were difficult to be ingested, thereby being liable to cause an obstacle to daily and continuous ingestion. In view of this, when the concentration of the plant extract was increased in order to ameliorate the difficulty in ingestion, there arose a problem that a granulation load was too large to allow formation into granules. As just described, the plant extract, which is generally viscous, has an inherent problem of being liable to cause a load at the time of granulation, thereby being difficult to form into granules.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0020">The present invention relates to a granular composition having a good granulation property despite containing a plant extract, which is difficult to form into granules, at a high concentration.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0021">The inventor of the present invention made extensive investigations in view of the above-mentioned problem. As a result, it found that a quick-soluble granular composition that can be formed into granules despite containing a plant extract at a high concentration, and is capable of instantly dissolving in the mouth, is obtained by incorporating starch, a sugar alcohol, and a cellulose derivative into a high-concentration plant extract.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0022">Thus, the present invention was completed.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0023">According to the present invention, there can be provided a granular composition that has a good granulation property despite containing a plant extract, which is difficult to form into granules, at a high concentration, and that is capable of instantly dissolving in the mouth. In addition, the granular composition of the present invention, when orally ingested, can significantly reduce an ingestion amount at one time, and can be simply ingested without water. Accordingly, the granular composition hardly causes an obstacle to daily and continuous ingestion, and hence can be expected to improve medication adherence.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0024">&#x3c;Granular Composition&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0025">The granular composition of the present invention is solid at ordinary temperature (20&#xb0; C.&#xb1;15&#xb0; C.), and its form is granular.

The powder mixture after the kneading was granulated through use of an extrusion granulator (manufactured by Dalton Corporation, Multigran MG-55-1) with a screen having a hole size of 0.8 mm, and the resultant granulated product was dried by being left to stand in a thermostatic chamber at 55&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes to provide a granular composition. Then, the resultant granular composition was analyzed and evaluated. The results are shown in Table 2. Aspartame was used as a taste masking agent (balance), because aspartame had a particle size comparable to those of the other raw materials in the formulation, and aspartame was conceived to be relatively less liable to affect the granulation property than any other masking agent.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00004" num="00004"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="147pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" rowsep="1">TABLE 2</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Example 1</entry><entry>Example 2</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Formulation</entry><entry>Plant extract I</entry><entry>mass %</entry><entry>50.7</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Plant extract II</entry><entry>mass %</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>50.7</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>HPMC</entry><entry>mass %</entry><entry>2.0</entry><entry>2.0</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Maltitol</entry><entry>mass %</entry><entry>26.4</entry><entry>26.4</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Dextrin</entry><entry>mass %</entry><entry>13.3</entry><entry>13.3</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Taste masking </entry><entry>mass %</entry><entry>7.6</entry><entry>7.6</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>agent (balance)</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>Total</entry><entry>mass %</entry><entry>100</entry><entry>100</entry></row><row><entry>Analysis </entry><entry>(A) Plant extract</entry><entry>mass %<sup>*1</sup></entry><entry>48.4</entry><entry>48.7</entry></row><row><entry>or</entry><entry>(B) Starch</entry><entry>mass %<sup>*1</sup></entry><entry>13.3</entry><entry>13.3</entry></row><row><entry>calculation</entry><entry>(C) Sugar alcohol</entry><entry>mass %<sup>*1</sup></entry><entry>26.4</entry><entry>26.4</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(D) Cellulose </entry><entry>mass %<sup>*1</sup></entry><entry>2.0</entry><entry>2.0</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>derivative</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>Mass ratio </entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>0.8</entry><entry>0.8</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>{(B) + (C)}/(A)</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>Mass ratio [(C)/(A)]</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>0.55</entry><entry>0.54</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Mass ratio [(C)/(D)]</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>13.2</entry><entry>13.2</entry></row><row><entry>Evaluation</entry><entry>Granulation</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>Acceptable</entry><entry>Acceptable</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Granulation load</entry><entry>[A]</entry><entry>2.7</entry><entry>3</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Median diameter</entry><entry>[mm]</entry><entry>0.76</entry><entry>0.74</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Yield</entry><entry>[%]</entry><entry>93.0</entry><entry>94.6</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>90% dissolution time</entry><entry>[sec]</entry><entry>12</entry><entry>14</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="left" id="FOO-00001"><sup>*1</sup>Solids with respect to the granular composition</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Examples 3 to 5</heading><p id="p-0174" num="0207">Granular compositions were obtained by the same operations as in Example 2 except that the blending amounts of the powdered plant extract II, maltitol, dextrin, HPMC, and the taste masking agent (balance) were changed to amounts shown in Table 3.
