It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figure.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A mask-programmed ROM is very compact and thus relatively-low cost as compared to other types of memories. By adjusting the photolithography during the manufacture of a mask-programmed ROM, a designer may encode the mask-programmed ROM with the desired data. As semiconductor manufacturing technology has progressed from one technology node to another to produce ever-more miniaturized devices, the layout requirements of a mask-programmed ROM has led to the use of a source-programmed implementation as will be explained further herein.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a source-programmed ROM, each bit is written to the source-programmed ROM by the source programming of a corresponding transistor. In an n-type metal-oxide-semiconductor (NMOS) source-programmed ROM, the source programming for each transistor determines whether the transistor has a source coupled to ground. In general, one binary state for a stored bit may be represented by programing a transistor to have its source coupled to ground. Conversely, a complementary binary state for a stored bit may be represented by programming a transistor to have its source electrically isolated from ground.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">To provide a better understanding of why modern mask-programmed ROMs are source-programmed, a typical source-programmed NMOS ROM <b>100</b> will be discussed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. ROM <b>100</b> includes an NMOS transistor M<b>1</b> and an NMOS transistor M<b>2</b> that are each included within the height and width of a bitcell. In that regard, the term bitcell as used herein refers to the semiconductor area for a pair of neighboring transistors and the associated dummy gates. A bitcell as that term is used herein thus stores two bits. Since the storage of each bit requires only one transistor, ROM <b>100</b> has an advantageously-high density as compared to memories that require more than one transistor per stored bit. The drain of each transistor M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> couples to a bit line (BL). The source programming determines whether transistors M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> each has a source coupled to ground. In the following discussion, it will be assumed that a transistor with a source coupled to ground represents a binary zero. Conversely, a transistor with a source isolated from ground represents a binary one. However, the binary convention may be reversed in other implementations. During a read operation for ROM <b>100</b>, bit line BL is first pre-charged through a coupling to a power supply node (not illustrated) for a power supply voltage VDD. Bit line BL is then isolated from the power supply node so that the pre-charged bit line BL floats prior to the read operation.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">To read the binary content stored by transistor M<b>1</b>, a word line W<b>1</b> that couples to a gate of transistor M<b>1</b> is asserted to the power supply voltage VDD. Since transistor M<b>1</b> has a source connection to ground, the assertion of the gate voltage for transistor M<b>1</b> discharges the pre-charged bit line to ground so that a sense amplifier (e.g., an inverter) may sense the binary zero encoded by the source programming of transistor M<b>1</b>. Similarly, a word line W<b>2</b> is asserted to the power supply voltage VDD during a read operation to transistor M<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">ROM <b>100</b> is integrated into an active surface of a semiconductor die as known in the integrated circuit arts. Signals, power, and ground for the ROM are carried in leads formed in metal layers adjacent the active surface. A ROM integrated circuit will include a plurality of metal layers, ranging from a first metal layer that is closest to the active surface of the semiconductor die to a final metal layer that is furthest from the active surface. A layout for the first metal layer is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Transistors M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> are adjacent to each other. Each transistor fits within a common bitcell height. During the integrated circuit manufacturing process, the first metal layer is patterned into a bit line lead to form the bit line and also into two tracks or leads for ground. A ground lead VSSX<b>2</b> near the bottom of the bitcell height is the ground for transistor M<b>1</b> depending upon the source programming. Similarly, a ground lead VSSX<b>1</b> near the top of the bitcell height is the ground for transistor M<b>2</b> depending upon the source programming. Since transistor M<b>1</b> is source programmed to store a binary zero, a via <b>110</b> couples from VSSX<b>2</b> to the source of transistor M<b>1</b>. Should transistor M<b>2</b> be similarly source programmed to couple its source to ground, a via <b>105</b> couples from ground VSSX<b>1</b> to the source of transistor M<b>2</b>. In this example, it is assumed that transistor M<b>2</b> is programmed to store a binary one so that via <b>105</b> would not be present for such a programming. Both transistors M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> have a shared drain couple to the bit line through a via <b>115</b>. Note the challenge in the metal layer layout for ROM <b>100</b>. Each transistor M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> must fit within a relatively short bitcell height and requires its own ground. These design constraints have generally forced designers into a source programming implementation as opposed to a drain programming implementation in which the transistor drains are selectively coupled (or not coupled) to the bit line.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The device layer (active semiconductor surface) layout for ROM <b>100</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. An n-doped diffusion region <b>305</b> forms from left to right the source of transistor M<b>1</b>, a shared drain of transistors M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b>, and the source of transistor M<b>2</b>. Diffusion region <b>305</b> is shown extending across only the bitcell width but it will be appreciated that diffusion region <b>305</b> may extend to additional bitcells. Transistor M<b>1</b> is isolated from any neighboring bitcell (not illustrated) by a first dummy gate <b>1</b> that traverses diffusion region <b>305</b>. A gate of transistor M<b>1</b> and a gate of transistor M<b>2</b> also traverse diffusion region <b>305</b>. A second dummy gate <b>2</b> isolates the source of transistor M<b>2</b> from any neighboring bitcell (not illustrated) in the same bitcell height. The source via <b>110</b> (when present) for transistor M<b>1</b> couples to a column <b>310</b> of local interconnect that extends across the source of transistor M<b>1</b>. As known in the local interconnect arts, column <b>310</b> may be formed from a deposition of a metal such as copper. Via <b>115</b> couples to the shared drain of transistors M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> through a similar column <b>315</b> of local interconnect. Finally, via <b>105</b> (when present) couples to the source of transistor M<b>2</b> through another column <b>320</b> of local interconnect.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Although this source programming is driven by the layout needs of fitting the pair of transistors within such a relatively-short bitcell height, leakage remains a problem. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a transistor such as M<b>1</b> that has its source coupled to ground may conduct a sub-threshold leakage current to ground when the bit line is charged despite the word line W<b>1</b> being discharged. This sub-threshold leakage may be mitigated or reduced by constructing transistors M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> to be thick-gate-oxide devices. The resulting high threshold voltage (high-VT) for the bitcell transistors may significantly reduce sub-threshold leakage currents for those transistors having their sources coupled to ground. But gate-induced drain leakage (GIDL) may still flow from the drain of transistors to their word lines even though their sources are disconnected from ground as shown for transistor M<b>2</b>. The GIDL currents undesirably may dominate the leakage budget of a ROM despite the use of high-VT transistors.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A drain-programmed ROM bitcell is disclosed that advantageously fits within the constrained bitcell height of modern process nodes and eliminates or reduces GIDL currents. Sub-threshold leakage is also reduced through the use of high-VT transistors. An example drain-programmed ROM <b>400</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> that includes two high-VT NMOS transistors M<b>3</b> and M<b>4</b>. Each transistor M<b>3</b> and M<b>4</b> may or may not have its drain coupled to a bit line (BL) depending upon its drain programming. The source of each transistor M<b>3</b> and M<b>4</b> is coupled to ground. In ROM <b>400</b>, transistor M<b>3</b> is drain programmed to couple to the bit line whereas transistor M<b>4</b> has its drain electrically isolated from the bit line (there being no via to couple the isolated drain to the bit line). A word line W<b>1</b> couples to the gate of transistor M<b>3</b> whereas a word line W<b>2</b> couples to the gate of transistor M<b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A read operation occurs analogously as discussed for ROM <b>100</b>. The bit line is pre-charged to the power supply voltage VDD and then floats while the appropriate word line is asserted. For transistor M<b>3</b>, the assertion of word line W<b>1</b> during a read operation causes transistor M<b>3</b> to switch on and discharge the bit line towards ground. A sense amplifier (not illustrated) such as an inverter may then sense the discharging of the bit line to make a bit decision and read the stored binary content of transistor M<b>3</b>. In one implementation, the drain programming of transistor M<b>3</b> to couple to the bit line may be deemed to represent a binary zero although this convention may be reversed in alternative implementations. Conversely, the drain programming of transistor M<b>4</b> that isolates the drain of transistor M<b>4</b> from the bit line may be deemed to represent a stored binary one. During a read operation in which the word line W<b>2</b> voltage is asserted to the power supply voltage VDD, the bit line remains pre-charged since the drain of transistor M<b>4</b> is isolated from the bit line. A sense amplifier may then sense this binary one value stored in transistor M<b>4</b> by sensing that the bit line remained pre-charged during the read operation. As discussed with transistor M<b>3</b>, the binary convention of whether transistor M<b>4</b> stores a binary one may be reversed in alternative implementations such that a drain isolated from ground would instead represent a binary zero.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As discussed previously for the source-programmed ROM <b>100</b>, each bitcell for ROM <b>400</b> should fit within the bitcell height for a particular process node. As the bitcell height has become smaller and smaller, mask-programmed ROMs were forced to be source-programmed ROMs to satisfy the necessary bitcell height. Note that it would be very expensive for a process node to vary from the required bitcell height as the semiconductor manufacturing for that process node has been designed around implementing such a bitcell height. A first metal layer (M<b>1</b>) layout for ROM <b>400</b> that advantageously satisfies the desired bitcell height is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A bit line is shown extending only across the bitcell width for illustration purposes. However, the bit line lead may extend to bitcells (not illustrated) to the left of transistor M<b>3</b> and to bitcells (not illustrated) to the right of transistor M<b>4</b>. These additional bitcells also fit within the bitcell height for transistors M<b>3</b> and M<b>4</b>. A drain via <b>510</b> couples from the bit line lead to a drain of transistor M<b>3</b>. If transistor M<b>3</b> is programmed to be isolated from the bit line, drain via <b>510</b> would be absent. Similarly, a drain via <b>505</b> couples form the bit line to a drain of transistor M<b>4</b>. Since transistor M<b>4</b> is assumed to be drain programmed so as to be isolated from the bit line, drain via <b>505</b> is absent and thus denoted by a dotted line. To permit both transistors to have drain programming, the bit line metal lead has a width (which may also be denoted as a height) that may be more than twice the height of each of vias <b>510</b> and <b>505</b>. Note that the via height is set by the process node and would be the same as in source-programmed ROM <b>100</b> for the same process node. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the bit line for source-programmed ROM <b>100</b> has a width that is approximately the same height as via <b>115</b>. But such a bit line width would result in a manufacturing conflict for drain vias <b>510</b> and <b>505</b> in drain-programmed ROM <b>400</b>. But increasing the bit line width would be untenable for source-programmed ROM <b>100</b> as there must be a minimum spacing between the bit line and the source leads VSSX<b>1</b> and VSSX<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a ground lead VSSX<b>3</b> is shared with a bitcell (not illustrated) above the bitcell height for transistors M<b>3</b> and M<b>4</b>. A ground via <b>515</b> couples from ground lead VSSX<b>3</b> to a shared source region (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> but discussed further below) for transistors M<b>3</b> and M<b>4</b>. Since ground lead VSSX<b>3</b> is shared with the bitcells above, only a bottom half of ground lead VSSX<b>3</b> is within the bitcell height for transistors M<b>3</b> and M<b>4</b>. A central longitudinal axis <b>526</b> of ground lead VSSX<b>3</b> is thus aligned with an upper boundary of the bitcell height for transistors M<b>3</b> and M<b>4</b>. Similarly, a ground lead VSSX<b>4</b> is shared with a bitcell pair (not illustrated) below the bitcell height for transistors M<b>3</b> and M<b>4</b>. A ground via <b>520</b> couples from ground lead VSSX<b>4</b> to the shared source region for transistors M<b>3</b> and M<b>4</b>. Since ground lead VSSX<b>4</b> is shared with the bitcell pair below, only the top half of ground lead VSSX<b>4</b> is within the bitcell height for transistors M<b>3</b> and M<b>4</b>. The bottom half is within the bitcell height for the neighboring bitcells. A central longitudinal axis <b>531</b> of ground lead VSSX<b>4</b> is thus aligned with the lower boundary of the bitcell height. Longitudinal axes <b>526</b> and <b>531</b> as well as a central longitudinal axis (not illustrated) of the bit line may all be in parallel with each other. The sharing of the ground leads VSSX<b>3</b> and VSSX<b>4</b> between the bitcells is advantageous as it allows the bit line lead to be widened (increased in height) to accept both drain vias <b>505</b> and <b>510</b>. Drain via <b>505</b> (if present) may thus be positioned in an upper half of the bit line lead whereas drain via <b>510</b> is positioned in a lower half of the bit line lead. In this fashion, ROM <b>400</b> may be drain programmed with high-VT transistors and thus mitigate both sub-threshold and GIDL leakage. GIDL leakage is reduced since the charged bit line is isolated from the drain of transistors such as transistor M<b>4</b> that are drain programmed to be isolated from the bit line.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A device layer (active semiconductor surface layer) layout for ROM <b>400</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. A diffusion region <b>525</b> on a semiconductor die may have the same dimensions as discussed for ROM <b>100</b> because the bitcell width and height is unchanged. The doping of diffusion region <b>525</b> depends upon the transistor polarity. In an NMOS implementation, diffusion region <b>525</b> is doped n-type but would instead be doped p-type in a p-type metal-oxide-semiconductor (PMOS) implementation. Dummy gate <b>1</b>, the gate of transistor M<b>3</b>, the gate of transistor M<b>4</b>, and dummy gate <b>2</b> are arranged as discussed for ROM <b>100</b>.

The first row of bitcells begins with a first bitcell in which only the second transistor has a drain via to the first row's bit line lead. A ninth bitcell in the third row has the same drain programming. A second bitcell in the first row, a sixth bitcell in the second row, a seventh bitcell in the third row, and an eighth bitcell in the third row are all programmed to have no drain vias for their first and second transistors coupling to the bit line lead. The drains for the first and second transistors in these bitcells are thus electrically isolated from their respective bit line leads. A third bitcell in the first row and a fifth bitcell in the second row are both programmed to have the drains of their first and second transistors coupled to their respective bit line leads through corresponding drain vias. The upper (or lower) boundary for each bitcell is aligned with the central longitudinal axis of the corresponding ground lead.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">A method of operating a ROM in accordance with the disclosure will now be discussed with reference to the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.
