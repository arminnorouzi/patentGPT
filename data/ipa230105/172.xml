The smoking articles may be configured to heat an aerosol precursor, which may incorporate materials that may be made or derived from, or otherwise incorporate tobacco, the precursor being capable of forming an inhalable substance for human consumption.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many smoking devices have been proposed through the years as improvements upon, or alternatives to, smoking products that require combusting tobacco for use. Many of those devices purportedly have been designed to provide the sensations associated with cigarette, cigar or pipe smoking, but without delivering considerable quantities of incomplete combustion and pyrolysis products that result from the burning of tobacco. To this end, there have been proposed numerous smoking products, flavor generators and medicinal inhalers that utilize electrical energy to vaporize or heat a volatile material, or attempt to provide the sensations of cigarette, cigar or pipe smoking without burning tobacco to a significant degree. See, for example, the various alternative smoking articles, aerosol delivery devices and heat generating sources set forth in the background art described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,726,320 to Robinson et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 8,881,737 to Collett et al., which are incorporated herein by reference. See also, for example, the various types of smoking articles, aerosol delivery devices and electrically-powered heat generating sources referenced by brand name and commercial source in U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2015/0216232 to Bless et al., which is incorporated herein by reference. Additionally, various types of electrically powered aerosol and vapor delivery devices also have been proposed in U.S. Pat. Pub. Nos. 2014/0096781 to Sears et al. and 2014/0283859 to Minskoff et al., as well as U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/282,768 to Sears et al., filed May 20, 2014; Ser.

No. 14/465,167 to Worm et al., filed Aug. 21, 2014; all of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Ongoing developments in the field of aerosol delivery devices have resulted in increasingly sophisticated aerosol delivery devices. For example, some aerosol delivery devices utilize user interfaces (e.g., a pushbutton, a display, and the like) to facilitate user interaction with the aerosol delivery device. However, the user interfaces, as currently configured, provide limited control of functions for the aerosol delivery device. Therefore, a need exist for a user interface that provides comprehensive options for controlling functions of an aerosol delivery device and further simplifies user interaction with the aerosol delivery device.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure relates to aerosol delivery devices, methods of forming such devices, and elements of such devices.

These example implementations are described so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the disclosure to those skilled in the art. Indeed, the disclosure may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the implementations set forth herein; rather, these implementations are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. As used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; &#x201c;the&#x201d; and the like include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As described hereinafter, example implementations of the present disclosure relate to aerosol delivery systems. Aerosol delivery systems according to the present disclosure use electrical energy to heat a material (preferably without combusting the material to any significant degree) to form an inhalable substance; and components of such systems have the form of articles most preferably are sufficiently compact to be considered hand-held devices. That is, use of components of preferred aerosol delivery systems does not result in the production of smoke in the sense that aerosol results principally from by-products of combustion or pyrolysis of tobacco, but rather, use of those preferred systems results in the production of vapors resulting from volatilization or vaporization of certain components incorporated therein. In some example implementations, components of aerosol delivery systems may be characterized as electronic cigarettes, and those electronic cigarettes most preferably incorporate tobacco and/or components derived from tobacco, and hence deliver tobacco derived components in aerosol form.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Aerosol generating pieces of certain preferred aerosol delivery systems may provide many of the sensations (e.g., inhalation and exhalation rituals, types of tastes or flavors, organoleptic effects, physical feel, use rituals, visual cues such as those provided by visible aerosol, and the like) of smoking a cigarette, cigar or pipe that is employed by lighting and burning tobacco (and hence inhaling tobacco smoke), without any substantial degree of combustion of any component thereof. For example, the user of an aerosol generating piece of the present disclosure can hold and use that piece much like a smoker employs a traditional type of smoking article, draw on one end of that piece for inhalation of aerosol produced by that piece, take or draw puffs at selected intervals of time, and the like.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Aerosol delivery systems of the present disclosure also can be characterized as being vapor-producing articles or medicament delivery articles. Thus, such articles or devices can be adapted so as to provide one or more substances (e.g., flavors and/or pharmaceutical active ingredients) in an inhalable form or state. For example, inhalable substances can be substantially in the form of a vapor (i.e., a substance that is in the gas phase at a temperature lower than its critical point). Alternatively, inhalable substances can be in the form of an aerosol (i.e., a suspension of fine solid particles or liquid droplets in a gas). For purposes of simplicity, the term &#x201c;aerosol&#x201d; as used herein is meant to include vapors, gases and aerosols of a form or type suitable for human inhalation, whether or not visible, and whether or not of a form that might be considered to be smoke-like.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Aerosol delivery systems of the present disclosure generally include a number of components provided within an outer body or shell, which may be referred to as a housing. The overall design of the outer body or shell can vary, and the format or configuration of the outer body that can define the overall size and shape of the aerosol delivery device can vary. Aerosol delivery devices are often configured in a manner that mimics aspects of certain traditional smoking devices such as cigarettes or cigars. In this regard, aerosol delivery devices typically define a substantially cylindrical configuration. Typically, an elongated body resembling the shape of a cigarette or cigar can be a formed from a single, unitary housing or the elongated housing can be formed of two or more separable bodies. For example, an aerosol delivery device can comprise an elongated shell or body that can be substantially tubular in shape and, as such, resemble the shape of a conventional cigarette or cigar. Aerosol delivery devices often include a control body and a cartridge which attach in an end-to-end relationship to define the substantially cylindrical configuration.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">While such configurations may provide a look and feel that is similar to traditional smoking articles, these configurations may suffer from certain detriments. For example, cylindrically-configured aerosol delivery devices may not define attachment points usable to retain the aerosol delivery device in a desired position when not in use. Further, the cylindrical configuration may result in the mouthpiece being exposed to the surrounding environment and therefore susceptible to contamination. Accordingly, it may be desirable to provide aerosol delivery devices in configurations that differ from shapes associated with traditional smoking articles.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one example, all of the components of the aerosol delivery device are contained within one housing. Alternatively, an aerosol delivery device can comprise two or more housings that are joined and are separable. For example, an aerosol delivery device can possess at one end a control body comprising a housing containing one or more reusable components (e.g., a rechargeable battery and various electronics for controlling the operation of that article), and at the other end and integral with or removably coupled thereto, an outer body or shell containing a disposable portion (e.g., a disposable flavor-containing cartridge).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Aerosol delivery systems of the present disclosure most preferably comprise some combination of a power source (i.e., an electrical power source), at least one control component (e.g., means for actuating, controlling, regulating and ceasing power for heat generation, such as by controlling electrical current flow the power source to other components of the article&#x2014;e.g., a microprocessor, individually or as part of a microcontroller component), a heating element or heat generation member (e.g., an electrical resistance heating element or other component, which alone or in combination with one or more further elements may be commonly referred to as an &#x201c;atomizer&#x201d;), an aerosol precursor composition (e.g., commonly a liquid capable of yielding an aerosol upon application of sufficient heat, such as ingredients commonly referred to as &#x201c;smoke juice,&#x201d; &#x201c;e-liquid&#x201d; and &#x201c;e-juice&#x201d;), and a mouth end region or tip for allowing draw upon the aerosol delivery device for aerosol inhalation (e.g., a defined airflow path through the article such that aerosol generated can be withdrawn therefrom upon draw).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In various examples, an aerosol delivery device can comprise a reservoir configured to retain the aerosol precursor composition. The reservoir particularly can be formed of a porous material (e.g., a fibrous material) and thus may be referred to as a porous substrate (e.g., a fibrous substrate). A fibrous substrate useful as a reservoir in an aerosol delivery device can be a woven or nonwoven material formed of a plurality of fibers or filaments and can be formed of one or both of natural fibers and synthetic fibers. For example, a fibrous substrate may comprise a fiberglass material. In particular examples, a cellulose acetate material can be used. In other example implementations, a carbon material can be used. A reservoir may be substantially in the form of a container and may include a fibrous material included therein.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some implementations, the aerosol delivery device can include an indicator, which may comprise one or more light emitting diodes or a graphical user interface via a display. The indicator can be in communication with the control component through a connector circuit and illuminate, for example, during a user draw on the mouthend as detected by the flow sensor.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">More specific formats, configurations and arrangements of components within the aerosol delivery systems of the present disclosure will be evident in light of the further disclosure provided hereinafter. Additionally, the selection and arrangement of various aerosol delivery system components can be appreciated upon consideration of the commercially available electronic aerosol delivery devices, such as those representative products referenced in background art section of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a front view of an aerosol delivery device <b>100</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a modified sectional view through the aerosol delivery device, according to an example implementation of the present disclosure. As illustrated, the aerosol delivery device <b>100</b> may comprise a housing <b>102</b> and a cartridge <b>200</b>. The cartridge may be moveable with respect to at least a portion of, or an entirety of, the housing. In particular, the cartridge may be moveable relative to at least a portion of the housing between an extended configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and a retracted configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Details with respect to the mechanisms and manners associated with movement of the cartridge relative to the housing are described hereinafter.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some example implementations, one or both of the housing <b>102</b> and the cartridge <b>200</b> of the aerosol delivery device <b>100</b> may be referred to as being disposable or as being reusable. The aerosol delivery device may include various other components disposed within the housing <b>102</b> or the cartridge <b>200</b> or otherwise coupled thereto. These components may be distributed between the housing and the cartridge in any of various manners. For example, the housing may include a replaceable battery or a rechargeable battery and thus may be combined with any type of recharging technology, including connection to a typical alternating current electrical outlet, connection to a car charger (i.e., a cigarette lighter receptacle), and connection to a computer, such as through a universal serial bus (USB) cable or connector. Further, in some example implementations, the cartridge may comprise a single-use cartridge, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 8,910,639 to Chang et al., which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Accordingly, it should be understood that the described implementations are provided for example purposes only.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one example implementation, the housing <b>102</b> and cartridge <b>200</b> forming the aerosol delivery device <b>100</b> may be permanently coupled to one another. Examples of aerosol delivery devices that may be configured to be disposable and/or which may include first and second outer bodies that are configured for permanent coupling are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/170,838 to Bless et al., filed Feb. 3, 2014, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In another example implementation, the cartridge and control body may be configured in a single-piece, non-detachable form and may incorporate the components, aspects, and features disclosed herein. However, in another example implementation, the control body and cartridge may be configured to be separable such that, for example, the cartridge may be refilled or replaced.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">By way of example, in the illustrated implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the aerosol delivery device <b>100</b> includes a power source <b>104</b> (e.g., a battery) positioned within the housing <b>102</b>. Further, a connector <b>106</b> may be moveably attached to the housing. The cartridge <b>200</b> may be engaged with the connector so as to be moveable relative to at least a portion of the housing. In some implementations, the cartridge may be removably engaged with the connector and replaceable.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The aerosol delivery device <b>100</b> may additionally include a control component <b>108</b> received therein. The control component may be configured to direct electrical power from the power source <b>104</b> to the cartridge <b>200</b> to heat the aerosol precursor composition retained in the reservoir <b>214</b> with the atomizer <b>212</b> to produce a vapor, which may occur during a user draw on the mouthpiece <b>220</b> of the cartridge. The control component includes a number of electronic components, and in some examples may be formed of a printed circuit board (PCB) that supports and electrically connects the electronic components. Examples of suitable electronic components include a microprocessor or processor core, an integrated circuit (IC), a memory, and the like. In some examples, the control component may include a microcontroller with an integrated processor core and memory, and which may further include one or more integrated input/output peripherals.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">As noted above, the cartridge <b>200</b> may be moveable relative to the housing <b>102</b>. In this regard, the aerosol delivery device <b>100</b> may further comprise an actuator <b>110</b>. In particular, the actuator may be coupled to the connector <b>106</b>. Thereby, the actuator may be operatively engaged with the cartridge and configured to move the cartridge between the extended configuration and the retracted configuration.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the mouthpiece <b>220</b> may be exposed when the cartridge <b>200</b> is in the extended configuration. In other words the mouthpiece may be positioned outside of the housing <b>102</b> when the cartridge is in the extended configuration such that a user may engage the mouthpiece with his or her lips. Thus, the extended configuration of the cartridge is a configuration in which the aerosol delivery device <b>100</b> is configured to receive a draw on the mouthpiece <b>220</b> such that the aerosol delivery device may produce and deliver an aerosol to a user in the manner described above.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Conversely, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in the retracted configuration the mouthpiece <b>220</b> is relatively closer to the housing <b>102</b> than in the extended configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In the retracted configuration, the mouthpiece may be flush with respect to the housing. In other words, an outer surface of the mouthpiece may substantially align with an outer surface of the housing. In another implementation the mouthpiece may be recessed with respect to the housing. In other words, a gap may be provided between the outer surface of the mouthpiece and the outer surface of the housing.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a more particular example of the cartridge <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>. As illustrated, the cartridge may comprise a base shipping plug <b>202</b>, a base <b>204</b>, a control component terminal <b>206</b>, an electronic control component <b>208</b>, a flow tube <b>210</b>, an atomizer <b>212</b>, a reservoir <b>214</b>, an outer body <b>216</b>, a label <b>218</b>, a mouthpiece <b>220</b>, and a mouthpiece shipping plug <b>222</b> according to an example implementation of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The base <b>204</b> may be coupled to a first end of the outer body <b>216</b> and the mouthpiece <b>220</b> may be coupled to an opposing second end of the outer body to at least partially enclose the remaining components of the cartridge <b>200</b> therein, with the exception of the label <b>218</b>, the mouthpiece shipping plug <b>222</b>, and the base shipping plug <b>202</b>. The base may be configured to engage an associated device including a power source <b>104</b>. In some implementations, the base may comprise anti-rotation features that substantially prevent relative rotation between the cartridge and associated device including the power source. The base shipping plug may be configured to engage and protect the base prior to use of the cartridge. Similarly, the mouthpiece shipping plug may be configured to engage and protect the mouthpiece prior to use of the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The control component terminal <b>206</b>, the electronic control component <b>208</b>, the flow tube <b>210</b>, the atomizer <b>212</b>, and the reservoir substrate <b>214</b> may be retained within the outer body <b>216</b>. The label <b>218</b> may at least partially surround the outer body and include information such as a product identifier thereon. The atomizer <b>212</b> may comprise a first heating terminal <b>234</b><i>a </i>and a second heating terminal <b>234</b><i>b</i>, a liquid transport element <b>238</b> and a heating element <b>240</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some example, a valve may be positioned between the reservoir and the heating element, and configured to control an amount of aerosol precursor composition passed or delivered from the reservoir to the heating element.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The reservoir <b>214</b> may be a container or can be a fibrous reservoir, as presently described. For example, the reservoir may comprise one or more layers of nonwoven fibers substantially formed into the shape of a tube encircling the interior of the cartridge <b>200</b>. An aerosol precursor composition can be retained in the reservoir. Liquid components, for example, can be sorptively retained by the reservoir. The reservoir can be in fluid connection with the liquid transport element <b>238</b> adapted to wick or otherwise transport an aerosol precursor composition stored in the reservoir housing to the heating element <b>240</b>. In particular, the liquid transport element can transport the aerosol precursor composition stored in the reservoir via capillary action to the heating element that is in the form of a metal wire coil in this example. As such, the heating element is in a heating arrangement with the liquid transport element. Example implementations of reservoirs and transport elements useful in aerosol delivery devices according to the present disclosure are further described below, and such reservoirs and/or transport elements can be incorporated into devices such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> as described herein. In particular, specific combinations of heating members and transport elements as further described below may be incorporated into devices such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> as described herein.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Various examples of materials configured to produce heat when electrical current is applied therethrough may be employed to form the heating element <b>240</b>. The heating element in these examples may be resistive heating element such as a wire coil. Example materials from which the wire coil may be formed include Kanthal (FeCrAl), Nichrome, Molybdenum disilicide (MoSi<sub>2</sub>), molybdenum silicide (MoSi), Molybdenum disilicide doped with Aluminum (Mo(Si,Al)<sub>2</sub>), graphite and graphite-based materials (e.g., carbon-based foams and yarns) and ceramics (e.g., positive or negative temperature coefficient ceramics). Example implementations of heating elements or heating members useful in aerosol delivery devices according to the present disclosure are further described below, and can be incorporated into devices such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> as described herein.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The cartridge <b>200</b> may include a flow director defining a non-tubular configuration, an electronics compartment sealed with respect to a reservoir compartment, and/or any of the various other features and components disclosed therein. Accordingly, it should be understood that the particular implementation of the cartridge described herein is provided for example purposes only. In this regard, the cartridge is schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> as including only the outer body <b>216</b>, the mouthpiece <b>220</b>, the atomizer <b>212</b>, the reservoir <b>214</b>, and the base <b>204</b>, in light of the various alternate and additional components that may be included therein.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">One or more components of the cartridge <b>200</b> may be configured to form an electrical connection with the connector <b>106</b>. For example, referring to the cartridge implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the first heating terminal <b>234</b><i>a </i>and the second heating terminal <b>234</b><i>b </i>(e.g., positive and negative terminals) at the opposing ends of the heating element <b>240</b> are configured to form an electrical connection with the connector. Further, the electronic control component <b>208</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) may form an electrical connection with the connector through the control component terminal <b>206</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). Components within the housing <b>102</b> (e.g., the control component <b>108</b>) may thus employ the electronic control component to determine whether the cartridge is genuine and/or perform other functions. However, in other implementations the connection between the connector and the cartridge may not be electrical. In other words, the connection between the connector and the cartridge may be purely mechanical. In these implementations, atomization may occur outside of the cartridge or atomization may occur via other methods not requiring electrical connections between the cartridge and the housing such as via piezoelectric or radio frequency atomization. Alternatively, the power source may be positioned in the cartridge such that electrical connection with connector is not required.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In use, when a user draws on the aerosol delivery device <b>100</b>, the heating element <b>240</b> of the atomizer <b>212</b> is activated to vaporize components of the aerosol precursor composition. Drawing upon the mouthpiece <b>220</b> of the aerosol delivery device causes ambient air to enter and pass through an opening in the connector <b>106</b> or in the cartridge <b>200</b>. In the cartridge, the drawn air combines with the formed vapor to form an aerosol. The aerosol is whisked, aspirated or otherwise drawn away from the heating element and out the opening in the mouthpiece of the aerosol delivery device. However, the flow of air may be received through other parts of the aerosol delivery device in other implementations. As noted above, in some implementations the cartridge may include the flow tube <b>210</b>. The flow tube may be configured to direct the flow of air to the heating element.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In particular, a sensor in the aerosol delivery device <b>100</b> may detect the flow of air throughout the aerosol delivery device. When a flow of air is detected, the control component <b>108</b> may direct current to the heating element <b>240</b> through a circuit including the first heating terminal <b>234</b><i>a </i>and the second heating terminal <b>234</b><i>b</i>. Accordingly, the heating element may vaporize the aerosol precursor composition directed to an aerosolization zone from the reservoir <b>214</b> by the liquid transport element <b>238</b>. Thus, the mouthpiece <b>220</b> may allow passage of aerosol (i.e., the components of the aerosol precursor composition in an inhalable form) therethrough to a consumer drawing thereon.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of the aerosol delivery device <b>100</b> in the closed configuration, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of the aerosol delivery device in the extended configuration, having a particular form factor according to some example implementations. As illustrated, the housing <b>102</b> may define an ergonomic shape configured to comfortably fit within a user's hand. The shape of the housing, however, is not limited and may be any shape that accommodates the various elements as described herein. In some implementations, the housing may be expressly non-cylindrical.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the aerosol delivery device <b>100</b> may additionally include an attachment mechanism <b>112</b>. The attachment mechanism <b>112</b> may comprise a loop, a clip, a ring, or other mechanism configured to attach to another device such as a keychain, a carabineer, or a lanyard. Accordingly, the aerosol delivery device may be retained in a desired position. Thus, for example, a user may be able to more easily secure the aerosol delivery device in a desired position at which the aerosol delivery device may be less prone to damage or misplacement.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The aerosol delivery device <b>100</b> may additionally include an input mechanism <b>114</b>. The input mechanism may comprise a pushbutton or other switch configured to receive an input from a user. When the input mechanism is actuated, the aerosol delivery device may produce an output corresponding to a status of the aerosol delivery device. For example, the aerosol delivery device may output sound, vibration, or light. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the aerosol delivery device may further comprise an indicator <b>116</b>. The indicator may comprise a light transmitter (e.g., plastic or glass, which may be tinted a desired color).
