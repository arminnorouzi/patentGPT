In <b>2010</b>, the Shenhua Baotou methanol-to-olefin plant using DMTO technology was completed and put into operation. This is the world's first industrial application of MTO technology. As of the end of 2019, 14 DMTO industrial plants have been put into production, with a total production capacity of about 8 million tons of low-carbon olefins per year.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, DMTO technology has been further developed, and a new generation of DMTO catalyst with better performance have gradually begun industrial applications, creating higher benefits for DMTO plants. The new generation of DMTO catalyst has higher methanol processing capacity and low-carbon olefin selectivity. It is difficult for the existing DMTO industrial devices to take full advantage of the advantages of the new generation of DMTO catalyst. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a DMTO device and production method that can meet the needs of a new generation of DMTO catalyst with high methanol processing capacity and high selectivity of low-carbon olefins.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to one aspect of the present application, there is provided a fluidized bed reactor. The fluidized bed reactor can achieve online modification of the DMTO catalyst through coke control reaction. The modification in the present application refers to the control of coke content in the DMTO catalyst, coke content distribution and coke species, so as to control the performance of DMTO catalyst and improve the selectivity of low-carbon olefins.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The low-carbon olefins described in the present application refer to ethylene and propylene.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The applicant's research found that the main factors affecting the activity of the DMTO catalyst and the selectivity of low-carbon olefins are the coke content, coke content distribution and coke species in the catalyst. When the average coke content in the catalyst is the same, if the coke content distribution is narrow, the selectivity of low-carbon olefins and the activity of the catalyst are high. The coke species in the catalyst include polymethyl aromatic hydrocarbons and polymethyl cycloalkanes, among which polymethylbenzene and polymethylnaphthalene can promote the production of ethylene. Therefore, control of the coke content, the coke content distribution and the coke species in the catalyst is the key to controlling the activity of the DMTO catalyst and improving the selectivity of low-carbon olefins.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the first aspect of the present application, there is provided a fluidized bed reactor. The fluidized bed reactor includes a reactor shell, a reaction zone, a coke control zone and a delivery pipe;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">the reactor shell includes a lower shell and an upper shell, the lower shell enclose a reaction zone, the delivery pipe is disposed above the reaction zone and in communication with the reaction zone, the outer periphery of the delivery pipe is provided with the upper shell, the upper shell and the delivery pipe enclose to form a cavity including a coke control zone;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">the upper part of the delivery pipe is provided with a gas outlet; the reaction zone includes a reaction raw material inlet and a coke controlled catalyst inlet;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">the coke control zone includes a catalyst inlet, a coke controlled catalyst outlet, a coke control gas outlet, and a coke control raw material inlet;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">the coke control zone is an annular cavity; there are n baffles arranged in the coke control zone, and the n baffles divide the coke control zone into n sub-coke control zones which include a first sub-coke control zone, a second sub-coke control zone, and an nth sub-coke control zone;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">at least one catalyst circulation hole is provided on each of n&#x2212;1 baffles, so that the catalyst flows in an annular shape in the coke control zone, wherein n is an integer;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">the catalyst inlet is arranged in the first sub-coke control zone, the coke controlled catalyst outlet is arranged in the nth sub-coke control zone, and the coke control gas outlet is arranged between two adjacent baffles.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">When the coke control zone contains only one zone, the residence time distribution of the catalyst entering the coke control zone is similar to the residence time distribution in a perfectly mixed flow reactor. Under this condition, the coke content uniformity on the obtained coke controlled catalyst granules is poor. In other words, some catalyst granules have lower coke content while some other catalyst granules have higher coke content, resulting in lower average activity and lower average selectivity of the catalyst. In the present application, by configuring the coke control zone and installing baffles along the radial direction in the coke control zone to divide the coke control zone into several sub-coke control zones, thereby controlling the residence time distribution of the catalyst entering the coke control zone, making the coke content distribution in the coke controlled catalyst narrow, and possessing higher average activity and higher average selectivity. At the same time, the use of sub-zone control is also beneficial to control the coke species and coke content on the coke controlled catalyst.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Optionally, the first baffle is not provided with any catalyst circulation hole, while each one of the second baffle to the nth baffle is provided with catalyst circulation hole(s).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Optionally, the diameter of the coke control zone in the present application is smaller than the diameter of the reaction zone.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferably, the diameter of the coke control zone increases from bottom to top.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Optionally, the first sub-coke control zone divided by the first baffle and the second baffle is provided with a catalyst inlet for the coke control zone;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">the nth sub-coke control zone divided by the first baffle and the nth baffle is provided with a coke controlled catalyst delivery pipe, which is in communication with the reaction zone, one end of which is arranged at the outlet of the coke controlled catalyst, and the other end of which is arranged in the reaction zone.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Preferably, a coke controlled catalyst slide valve is further provided on the coke controlled catalyst delivery pipe to control the circulation of the catalyst.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A coke control zone distributor is arranged below the sub-coke control zone, and the coke control gas outlet is connected to the delivery pipe by a coke control zone gas delivery pipe.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the present application, by configuring the coke control zone, installing baffles arranged concentrically in sequence in the coke control zone and configuring circulation holes on the baffles, the coke control zone is divided into several sub-coke control zones so that the catalyst can flow in an annular shape in the coke control zone, thereby controlling the residence time of the catalyst entering the coke control zone and the way of coke control. That is to say, when coke control is performed in each sub-zone, the content of the catalyst in the control space is relatively uniform, so that the coke content distribution in the catalyst is narrow, and the coke species and coke content on the catalyst are also controlled. It is avoided that some catalyst granules have lower coke content, and some other catalyst granules have higher coke content, resulting in a wide distribution of catalyst coke content.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Optionally, 2&#x2264;n&#x2264;10.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Specifically, the number of catalyst circulation holes provided on the baffle may be one or more, which is not strictly limited in the present application.

For example, a plurality of catalyst circulation holes may be arranged in parallel, or may be arranged randomly.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the present application, the shape of the coke controlled catalyst delivery pipe is not strictly limited, as long as it can be ensured that the coke controlled catalyst delivery pipe can transport the coke controlled catalyst to the reaction zone. For example, the coke controlled catalyst delivery pipe can be a long pipe with a bent structure. Of course, the coke controlled catalyst delivery pipe can be in other suitable shapes.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Preferably, a coke control zone distributor is provided below each sub-coke control zone.
