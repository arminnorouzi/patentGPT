The size of the solar array may be limited by the volume (e.g., thickness or height) required for the multiple composite solar panels, when in the stowed position. For example, a typical composite solar panel may have a thickness of between about 1 centimeters (cm) and about 2 cm. Moreover, when in a stowed or folded position adjacent composite solar panels may require an additional 0.5 cm to about 1 cm of space between the adjacent composite solar panels.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The solar array may be deployed on equipment for use in space. The equipment may be transported to space on a vehicle configured to travel from the surface of the earth to space, such as a rocket or other spacecraft. The vehicle may have significant limitations on available payload volume and weight. The volume and weight restrictions may limit the size of the equipment or accessories that may be included with the equipment. Thus, reducing the volume, and specifically the height required by the solar arrays in a stowed position may allow additional accessories to be included on the equipment. The size of the equipment may also be able to increase if the volume required by the solar arrays in the stowed position is decreased. In other cases, reducing the volume and/or weight required for the solar arrays in the stowed position may allow additional equipment to be transported in the same vehicle.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a solar array <b>100</b> extending from a body <b>102</b> of a piece of equipment, such as a space craft, a satellite, etc. The solar array <b>100</b> may include a base composite panel <b>104</b>, a top composite panel <b>106</b>, and multiple panel modules <b>108</b> extending between the base composite panel <b>104</b> and the top composite panel <b>106</b>.
