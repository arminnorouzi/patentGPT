Starting from a non-deformed rest state of the latching elements, their respective latching portions are each movable in two opposite directions. In this context, the terms &#x201c;disassembly direction&#x201d; and &#x201c;assembly direction&#x201d; refer to movement of the second component relative to the first component, assuming that the first component is stationary. At least the first portion of the respective movement path of a latching portion of each of the latching elements, which first portion points in the direction of disassembly with respect to the rest state, is limited by a respective stop surface against which a respective latching element rests in the course of disassembling the components.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The two stop surfaces are formed by two separate portions of the first component which are disposed on opposite sides of the plane of relative movement. Advantageously, the stop surfaces extend transversely, preferably perpendicularly, to the plane of relative movement.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">By providing the mentioned movement possibilities for the latching portions of the two latching elements, the assembly forces required to join the connection assembly are relatively small. The provision of the stop surfaces makes it possible to hamper disassembly of the connection assembly in such a way that high holding forces act when the connection assembly is in the assembled state. Therefore, in order to release the connection assembly, relatively high disassembly forces must be exerted.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">It is advantageous if the length of the first portion of the movement path of a latching portion differs from the length of the second portion of the movement path of this latching portion, so that different assembly and disassembly forces can be predetermined by the lengths of the respective movement paths. It is particularly preferred if the length of the first portion of the movement path is shorter than the length of the second portion of the movement path. This is in particular associated with the disassembly forces for releasing the connection assembly being higher than the assembly forces for joining the connection assembly.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Advantageously, the latching elements are springy in their entirety or at least in a portion thereof. It is preferred that the latching elements, or at least portions thereof, be made of a springy material, for example of a thermoplastic elastomer. However, the latching elements may also be made of other plastic materials or also of metallic materials.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Furthermore, it is preferred if the latching elements, when in their rest state with respect to the plane of relative movement, extend along a plane that is oblique or perpendicular to the plane of relative movement.
