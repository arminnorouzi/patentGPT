They are particularly useful in forming key-importance structural parts, such as pillars, beams or truss members. I-profiles owe their name to a characteristic cross-section, which resembles two connected letters T. I-profiles consist of two flanges and the so-called web, which connects the flanges. There is available a wide range of I-profiles having various parameters and intended for a number of different applications, such as standard (INP), parallel (IPE), or wide-flange (HEB, HEA) I-profiles.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Utility model PL65088Y1 discloses an I-bar which consists of two flanges connected with a web, wherein the thickness of the second flange is smaller than the thickness of the first flange and preferably is from 0.75 to 0.95 of the thickness of the first flange. Such an I-bar having flanges of two different thicknesses is used as a track for an overhead rail system.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Polish patent PL206365B1 discloses a manufacturing method for an I-section which is used in the production of I-profiles being elements of civil-engineering structures, especially of buildings and houses.

In the method for manufacturing an I-section with sandwich flanges by bending a metal sheet known from patent PL213146B1, the metal sheet, having a width equal to the sum of the web width, four times the width of and double the thickness of both flanges, is bent on the two sides at a 90&#xb0; angle of the two edges which form the contour of the web, and subsequently the sheet is bent at a 90&#xb0; angle along the first edge line, and then the sheet is bent at a 90&#xb0; angle along the second edge line, and further the sheet is bent at a 90&#xb0; angle along the third edge line, and then the sheet is bent at a 90&#xb0; angle along the fourth edge line, and finally the sheet is bent on the two sides at a 90&#xb0; angle of the two edges which form the contour of the web. The space in the flanges is filled with a filler, particularly in the form of metal foam.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The technical problem of the present invention is to provide such a method for manufacturing an I-profile which will allow the manufacturing of an I-profile having desired properties, in particular with respect to the strength and the stiffness coefficient of the I-profile and to the load-bearing capacity to weight ratio, while maintaining high dimensional accuracy. It is desirable that the I-profile manufacturing method has a limited number of technological steps and is realized without the use of specialist and complicated apparatus, so as to directly provide economic benefits of a simplified, less time-consuming and thus cheaper I-profile manufacturing process. It is also desirable that the I-profile manufacturing method is of low material-consumption and allows the I-profile to be manufactured from adjusted materials having a wide range of geometrical parameters, and in particular to have different web heights and different flange widths both symmetrical and asymmetrical. It is also important to provide an I-profile manufacturing method which would allow the shape of the I-profile to be easily modified within a wide range of geometrical parameters and without the need to rearrange the apparatus used in the manufacturing process.

In particular, owing to the use of I-profile preforms manufactured largely from a relatively thin metal sheet, the I-profile manufactured with the method according to the invention allows a significantly increased load-bearing capacity to profile weight ratio in comparison to classic solutions known in the art. In addition, owing to the use of thicker flat bars as the outer walls of the first and/or second flange of the I-profile preform, it is possible to manufacture an I-profile having improved usefulness in these areas. Furthermore, the I-profile manufacturing method according to the invention is realized with the use of uncomplicated machinery park, which translates into economic benefits and a significantly simplified manufacturing process of the I-profile. A small number of seals improves the speed and lowers the labor-intensity of the I-profile manufacturing process. In addition, the I-profile manufacturing based on introducing pressurized fluid into the hermetic inner space of the I-profile preform allows the parameters of the manufactured I-profile to be modified within a wide range, in particular with respect to its final geometry.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0031" num="0029">The solution according to the present invention has been shown in the embodiments below and illustrated in the drawing, in which:</p><p id="p-0032" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A-C</figref> is an axonometric view of the subsequent steps of the I-profile manufacturing method according to an embodiment of the invention,</p><p id="p-0033" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A-C</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the subsequent steps of the I-profile manufacturing method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A-C</figref>,</p><p id="p-0034" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A-D</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the subsequent steps of manufacturing one part of the I-profile preform according to an embodiment of the invention,</p><p id="p-0035" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A-H</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the subsequent steps of manufacturing the I-profile preform according to another embodiment of the invention,</p><p id="p-0036" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A-F</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the subsequent steps of manufacturing the I-profile preform according to a further embodiment of the invention,</p><p id="p-0037" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>G</figref> is an axonometric view of the I-profile preform manufactured in the steps shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A-F</figref>,</p><p id="p-0038" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A-B</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the subsequent steps of manufacturing the I-profile preform according to a yet further embodiment of the invention,</p><p id="p-0039" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref> is an axonometric view of the I-profile preform manufactured in the steps shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A-B</figref>,</p><p id="p-0040" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A-F</figref> is an axonometric view and a cross-sectional view of further embodiments of the I-profile preform and also the respective I-profiles manufactured from the I-profile preforms,</p><p id="p-0041" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A-C</figref> is a cross-sectional view of further embodiments of the I-profile preform,</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A-C</figref> is an axonometric view of still further embodiments of the I-profile preform,</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A-B</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the subsequent steps of the I-profile manufacturing method according to a further embodiment of the invention,</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows one of the manufacturing steps of an I-profile according to one embodiment of the invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">EMBODIMENT 1</heading><p id="p-0045" num="0043">The I-profile manufacturing method according to the first embodiment of the invention is schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A-C</figref> and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A-C</figref>.

In particular, the preparation of the E-profile starts with providing a metal sheet of appropriate dimensions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>), the width of the metal sheet corresponding to the sum of the lengths of all sides forming the E-profile. Subsequently, the metal sheet is bent inwards along two parallel bending lines at an angle of 90&#xb0;, in the locations indicated with the arrows, thus forming the web of the E-profile between the bent parts, corresponding to the first web wall <b>3</b> of the I-profile preform (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>).

The C-profile is also formed of a metal sheet, although the C-profile manufacturing method has not been shown in detail due to the fact that the metal sheet only requires the repeating of the step shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>.

The location of the valve element <b>7</b> is not a limitation to the scope of the present invention, and in alternative embodiments the valve element <b>7</b> may be arranged in any location on the metal sheet of both the E-profile and the C-profile (or of any wall <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> in other embodiments), on condition that it allows a connection with the inner space of the I-profile preform.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> show the E-profile and the C-profile matched with each other. In the next step of the I-profile manufacturing method, the I-profile preform is sealed for creating a sealed hermetic inner space. The sealing is performed on the edges of the metal sheet forming the E-profile and the C-profile after the profiles have been matched with each other. In this embodiment, the sealing is therefore performed on the longitudinal edges of the E and C profiles matched with each other, as schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. In this embodiment, the sealing was performed by means of welding the corresponding edges together, forming inter alia longitudinal welds constituting the seal <b>8</b>. The sealing is moreover performed on the edges of the E and C profiles matched with each other, on the front and on the back of the I-profile preform. By sealing all of the above-listed edges, a leakproof hermetic inner space is formed in the I-profile preform, as schematically shown in the cross-section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. The type of seal <b>8</b> is in this case not a limitation to the scope of the invention, and it is possible in alternative embodiments to use any type of seal <b>8</b>, on condition that a leakproof inner space is formed in the I-profile preform, by means for example of pressure welding, soldering, gluing, bending or pressing.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">In the next step, an external source of fluid under pressure is connected to the valve element <b>7</b> through the supply duct <b>9</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>). In this embodiment, the fluid is air, the source of fluid under pressure is a compressor, and the supply duct <b>9</b> together with the valve element <b>7</b> form a pneumatic connection. The type of the external source of fluid under pressure and of the connection equipment is not a limitation to the scope of this invention and in alternative embodiments it is possible to use fluid in the form of water, fluid cement, machine oil, fluid plastic such as a one-, two- or three-component foam (e.g. a flex 140 type), etc. together with the connection equipment and the source of fluid under pressure appropriate for those fluids. The less compressible the fluid is, the more controllable the deformation conditions of the I-profile preform are.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">The next step of the I-profile manufacturing method according to the invention consists in placing the I-profile preform between the pressure plates so that the pressure plates are in contact with the I-profile preform flanges, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. The pressure plates may be the working elements of a mechanical press. In this case, a controlled force may be applied to the pressure plates, particularly in the direction towards the I-profile preform.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">In the subsequent step of the I-profile manufacturing method according to the present invention, a fluid under a defined pressure is delivered to the sealed inner space of the I-profile preform while keeping the I-profile preform between the pressure plates. The technology of introducing fluid under pressure into closed sealed chamber elements made of sheet metal for their deformation and providing them with the final form is known inter alia from patent application No. EP2110189A1. As a result of delivering a fluid under pressure into the inner space of the I-profile preform, the walls of the I-profile preform deform, with the greatest deformation level being located in the middle of the I-profile, in the web region, as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> schematically shows the cross-section of the I-profile manufactured from the I-profile preform. As can be observed, the first web wall <b>3</b> and the second web wall <b>4</b> of the I-profile preform are significantly deformed. Furthermore, the two inner walls <b>2</b> of the first flange and the two inner walls <b>6</b> of the second flange of the I-profile preform are also deformed. As a result, in the cross-section indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, the I-profile manufactured from the preform of the invention and with the method of the invention has a shape resembling a lantern. By keeping the I-profile preform between the pressure plates of the press during the step of delivering fluid under pressure into the inner space of the I-profile preform, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, it was possible to preserve a plane-parallel shape of the I-profile flanges, maintaining the functional characteristics of the I-profile thus manufactured.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">Note should be taken that although the introduction of fluid under pressure into the inner space of the I-profile preform is performed in cold technology (i.e. in room temperature), it is not a limitation to the scope of this invention, and in alternative embodiments the process may be performed in elevated or high temperatures.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">In one embodiment of the invention, the step of introducing fluid under pressure was performed with the following process parameters:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0054">process temperature&#x2014; 20&#xb0; C.,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0055">working pressure&#x2014; 5 bars,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0056">deformation time&#x2014;1 minute until pressure is equalized in the I-profile preform,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0057">pressure hold time&#x2014; 30 seconds,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0058">total deformation time&#x2014; 1.5 minute.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">EMBODIMENT 2</heading><p id="p-0056" num="0059">A further embodiment of the I-profile preform according to the invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A-H</figref>, in which further manufacturing, i.e. bending, steps of the I-profile preform are also illustrated.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0060">In general, the I-profile preform is a structure substantially similar to the structure of the I-profile preform shown in the first embodiment, the difference being that the I-profile preform according to this embodiment is formed of a complete intermediate I-profile, and not of two E- and C-profiles matched with each other.

It owes its higher torsional rigidity SSK to its spatial geometry, which has a greater resemblance to a closed profile. A significantly lower compressive rigidity SSC is the result of a lower mass, a smaller cross-sectional area of the IPEF profile, and a convex geometry. Lower bending rigidity SZ is also the result of a smaller cross-sectional area.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0083">In comparison to a standard IPE AA <b>100</b> I-profile, the situation is similar. The SSK, SSC and SZ rigidities of the IPE AA <b>100</b> I-profile are lower than the SSK, SSC and SZ rigidities of the IPE <b>100</b> I-profile, because the IPE AA <b>100</b> I-profile has the flanges and the web of a smaller thickness.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0084">When comparing I-profiles of identical length and very similar mass, a significant increase in the rigidity of the FIDU I-profile can be observed in relation to the standard I-profile.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0085">In turn, the IPEF* I-profile, with the outer wall <b>1</b> of the first flange and the outer wall <b>5</b> of the second flange being a flat bar 3 mm in thickness and with other walls <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>6</b> being made of steel sheet 1 mm in thickness (resulting in a total mass of 4.19 kg) has an almost 20 times greater torsional rigidity SSK than the I-profile IPE AA <b>80</b> (having a mass of 4.26 kg). This is due to a significantly greater cross-sectional moment of inertia with a very similar cross-sectional area. When subjected to compression, the IPEF* I-profile has an insignificantly lower rigidity, which is due to the convex geometry. The IPEF* I-profile shows 6.5 times higher bending rigidity SZ due to a better distribution of the wall thicknesses in the profile and to greater volumetric dimensions while preserving a similar mass.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0086">The IPEF I-profile is very prone to buckling W due to its non-uniform geometry and thin walls. The calculated critical force SK is 6.5 kN. On the other hand, the calculated critical force SK for the IPEF* I-profile is 75.6 kN. It is higher than the calculated critical force SK of the IPE AA <b>80</b> I-profile and insignificantly lower than the critical force SK of the IPE AA <b>100</b> I-profile, which has similar volumetric dimensions, but a greater mass.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0087">The calculations were based on actual geometries of the IPEF and IPEF* profiles, while the geometries of the standard IPE profiles did not account for the imperfections, which could negatively influence the rigidity values SSK, SSC and SZ and the calculated critical force values SK. When identifying the rigidity of the bent I-profiles, consideration was given to points located in lower tensioned layers, in which local deformations from the applied forces did not occur.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">LIST OF REFERENCE NUMERALS</heading><p id="p-0087" num="0000"><ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0088"><b>1</b>&#x2014; outer wall of the first flange of the I-profile</li>    <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0089"><b>2</b>&#x2014;inner wall of the first flange of the I-profile</li>    <li id="ul0003-0003" num="0090"><b>3</b>&#x2014;first web wall of the I-profile</li>    <li id="ul0003-0004" num="0091"><b>4</b>&#x2014;second web wall of the I-profile</li>    <li id="ul0003-0005" num="0092"><b>5</b>&#x2014;outer wall of the second flange of the I-profile</li>    <li id="ul0003-0006" num="0093"><b>6</b>&#x2014; inner wall of the second flange of the I-profile</li>    <li id="ul0003-0007" num="0094"><b>7</b>&#x2014;valve element</li>    <li id="ul0003-0008" num="0095"><b>8</b>&#x2014;seal</li>    <li id="ul0003-0009" num="0096"><b>9</b>&#x2014; supply duct</li></ul></p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
