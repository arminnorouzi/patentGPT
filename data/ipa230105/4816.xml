The systems and methods described herein can integrate into the visual display additional data obtained from multi-omic analysis of the microbiome, such as genomic sequence, gene expression, and metabolite concentrations, as well as information related to the host organism, such as gene expression data from the host organism.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Some exemplary embodiments of this disclosure include a display and a computer system configured to facilitate the interactive viewing of microbiome data of animals. As used herein, the term &#x201c;animal&#x201d; includes all farm animals. The examples of the animals include non-ruminants and ruminants. Ruminants include but are not limited to sheep, goat and cattle; and non-ruminants include but are not limited to horse; rabbit; pig including but not limited to infant pig, piglet, growing-fattening pig, sow and boar; and poultry such as turkey, duck and chicken (including but not limited to broiler chicken, egg-laying chicken) etc. The microbiome data contains information on a large number of different microbes, metabolites etc., which all may be affecting the condition of the host animal. A clear understanding of the entire microbiome, or at least a substantial part of the microbiome, can be very valuable for purposes such as diagnostics, drug discovery, identifying or establishing standards, etc.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In contrast to many conventional systems and techniques for visualizing genetic information, embodiments of the present invention enable the viewing of the entire microbiome of the animal. Embodiments use dynamic networks to efficiently represent the microbiome. In the dynamic network, microbes (also referred to interchangeably in this disclosure as &#x201c;organisms&#x201d;) and/or metabolites are represented as nodes. The edges of the dynamic network may be based on one or more of a correlation between microbes, an enzymatic reaction that transforms one metabolite to another, and/or other association between the aspects represented in the nodes.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Some embodiments provide systems and methods to extract mode of action related to taxonomic and functional information from animal microbiome samples derived from in-vivo, in-vitro, and ex-vivo screening systems where at least two conditions (e.g., control condition, treatments) can be compared. In some embodiments, the input takes nucleic acid compositions, for example, from a massively parallel sequencer and runs the output sequence files through a series of computational algorithms to establish taxonomic and functional classification of the input sequence files. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid compositions are genomic DNA compositions. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid compositions are cDNA compositions. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid compositions are RNA compositions. In some embodiments, the input takes protein compositions, for example, from a proteomic analysis and runs the output sequence files through a series of computational algorithms to establish taxonomic and functional classification of the input protein sequence files. The taxonomic output is associated with experimental metadata and converted into an interactive visualization. The functional output is referenced against a metabolic network. Relevant genomic fluctuations, statistics, enzyme information, compounds, treatments can be embedded into this dynamic network. The network can then be interactively visualized to show differences among the respective conditions. These techniques can be applied to both shotgun metagenomes (e.g., fragmented DNA sequenced using 2D reads) or shallow shotgun metagenomes (e.g., fragmented DNA sequenced using 1D reads).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As noted above, embodiments process input data (such as DNA, RNA or cDNA sequencing reads from a high-throughput sequencer or high-throughput protein data), and generate visualizations of taxonomic and functional changes between at least two samples derived from a similar environment but from differing conditions.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Some embodiments, may quantify genes to reactions identified between two compounds irrespective of a classified pathway. A re-association of sample metadata back into the process is made in order to allow for more useful visualization. This pipeline allows the flexibility to embed statistics and other metadata into the visualizations to facilitate simultaneous analysis across multiple dimensions.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, a gene catalog allows sufficient depth to properly observe function and make the statistical claims embedded in the functional visualizations. The use of a marker-gene based taxonomic prediction in some embodiments improves taxonomic information over kmer-based assignment of reads for animal microbiome studies.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a display <b>100</b> of a microbiome visualization system, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The display <b>100</b> includes a first display area <b>102</b> in which a dynamic network <b>104</b> corresponding to a microbiome, or apart thereof, is displayed based on the microbiome data corresponding to samples of genetic data collected from animals. The dynamic network <b>104</b> may be viewable in whole, so that the interactions of all the microbes, metabolites and/or enzymes that are present in the microbiome of the group of animals being investigated on a single screen, or may be viewable in part displaying only a part of the network containing certain microbes, metabolites, enzymes and/or their interactions of interest.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A second display area <b>106</b> may be used to display various information regarding the dynamic network and/or configuration of the visualization system. The second display area, for example, may be used to display calculated information such as various network statistics. Example network statistics that can be determined by the system by processing the data according to the dynamic network may include statistics such as eigenvector centrality (e.g., identifies an organism highly connected to its own sub-community) and betweenness centrality (e.g., identifies organisms highly connected to different sub-communities) with which a user can, among other things, identify keystone organisms. Keystone organisms are characterized by the connections they share to other organisms. There exist four general classifications of keystone organisms: network hubs, module hubs, connectors, and peripherals. These organisms are classically evaluated by a &#x201c;Zi&#x201d; parameter, a measure of connectedness to its own sub-community, and a &#x201c;Pi&#x201d; parameter, a probability that it is more highly connected to other sub-communities than to its own. Typical cut-offs for establishing a &#x2018;hub&#x2019; is that is has a &#x201c;Zi&#x201d; value greater than 2.5. A connector has a &#x201c;Pi&#x201d; value greater than 0.62. Generalists have both a &#x201c;Zi&#x201d; greater than 2.5 and a &#x201c;Pi&#x201d; greater than 0.62 whereas peripheral organisms meet none of these requirements.

Controls <b>108</b> may provide a slider or the like to select from the available samples. In some embodiments, a separate slider <b>108</b> may provide for each sample selection dimension, e.g., one slider enables the user to select a group and a second slider allows the user to select the timestamp of the sample for which the dynamic network is to be displayed.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Additional controls such as a cursor <b>110</b> may be provided in some embodiments.

Automated capabilities may be provided by calculating selected network statistics (e.g. eigenvector centrality, betweenness centrality, modularity, sub-community detection analysis (as characterized by different sub-community detection algorithms, meta-analysis parameters extended from databases (such as number of previously observed occasions outside of the current study: e.g. <i>Lactobacillus</i>; mean relative abundance: 2.5%), p-values for treatments, average relative abundances, etc.) for the dynamic network of the microbiome, in order to either identify or highlight for the user aspects of interest in the microbiome. The interactive capabilities provide the user with the capability to control the displayed network to rapidly view the network or portions thereof in order to observe areas/aspects of interest of the microbiome.

To construct the base network, each OTU serves as an independent node and no edges exist. A base network is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>.

Connections can, but do not have to be, identified as the weight. Multiple ways of connecting the organisms can be embedded in the same network graph. For example, in some embodiments, the dynamic network can have both absence/presence and correlation of those two organisms represented in the edges.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some embodiments, edges and/or nodes are associated with a variable that enable dynamic transitions. For example, such a variable may provide network visualization software to dynamically change the displayed network to clearly show differences in the network among the different conditions and/or samples of the microbiome.

Post-weaning diarrhea is an affliction that affects piglets and can result in increases in mortality of the piglets. Identifying changes in microbiome and potential metabolites can create an early warning diagnostic that could facilitate intervention. In a study of post-weaning diarrhea, a cohort of piglets was tracked over 20 days and samples were taken for microbiome sequencing, metabolite extraction, and a fecal score was recorded. A fecal score can be an integer between 0 (no diarrhea) to 3 (severe diarrhea) and these results are usually recorded currently by human observation. In an example embodiment, this data can be used after sequencing.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">After sequencing the microbiome and identifying genes present in the pathways, changes could be normalized to a fecal score of 0 (no diarrhea), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A</figref>, to look for changes. Examining the network at a fecal score of 3, a large shift in pathways can be seen to be both increasing (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>B</figref>; bottom right <b>1302</b>) and decreasing (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>B</figref>; top left <b>1302</b>). The increasing enzymatic reactions, edges <b>217</b> and <b>220</b>, can be further examined as a biomarker associated with increasing fecal score. On the inverse, examining decreased pathways can identify bottlenecks that can become potential treatment goals (probiotic containing missing/decreased pathways), or identify upstream metabolic markers that may serve as another diagnostic target. To prove this could be used to identify the metabolic markers and how the metabolic network is directly tied to these metabolites, metabolites were integrated into the metabolic network. Focusing on an area where reactions are decreasing (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>C, <b>1304</b></figref>), it would be expected that an accumulation of a metabolite would occur. With measured metabolites shown as <b>1306</b> and <b>1308</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>D</figref>, one metabolite can be visually described as decreasing that is also adjacent to decreased reactions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>E</figref>).

These available metabolic networks are also static and don't allow for transitions between different environments, times, or treatments that may be part of an experiment.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0219">In contrast, systems and methods described herein allow deep functional analysis of metagenomics data sets. The inventors constructed a gene-level metabolic network where the nodes were metabolites and the edges were enzymatic reactions between the metabolites. Next, the gene counts were matched against the edges of the network and the relative abundance of gene counts of each edge were normalized to the control such that our control edges all had a weight equal to one (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>). The static network graph was converted to a dynamic one and data from the additional treatments were added into the network. Looking at the treatment group, there was a clear increase in certain enzyme reactions and decrease in others, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref> (relative thickness of lines reflect relative abundance of gene/enzyme edges). There was a decrease in edges <b>197</b>, <b>166</b>, <b>167</b>, and <b>168</b> between nodes/metabolites 0, 48, 75, 76, and 90 (bordered area top left; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>). There was an increase in edges <b>232</b>, <b>233</b>, <b>235</b>, <b>268</b>, and <b>269</b> associated with nodes/metabolites 0, 28, 48, 106, 107, and 133 (bordered area in the center; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>). Running statistics, results were embedded in the same graph and p-values of the treatment relative to the control were visualized. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref> shows the statistical significance of the change in the reaction relative to the control as a function of color (black-&#x3e;white or darker.-&#x3e;lighter). This shows that the above discussed decreases and increases in edges were indeed significant. Relating information about the treatment and the animals within the study, the inventors were able to associate these pathways as protagonistic or antagonistic to swine.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example 3. Integrated Taxonomic and Metabolic Analysis</heading><p id="p-0221" num="0220">In another trial, two groups of pigs were subjected to two different doses of an enzyme (muramidase). Samples were collected from the two groups of swine by extracting DNA from the cecum. These samples were sequenced using a shotgun metagenome approach and the results were interpreted using MetaPhlan2 for taxonomy and KEGG for function. The analysis further included a third control dataset obtained from a group of pigs that were not treated with the enzyme.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0221">The enzyme treatment had an effect on the structure of the community by impacting two selected microorganisms differently (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>: 0&#x2014;Control, Low Dose, High Dose). Organism 1 increased while organism 2 decreased. The initial functional network visualized under control conditions showed a rather sparse network (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>). Focusing on the effect of the added enzyme, changes in the pathway were visualized (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref>). Using the reactions between the nodes included in the bordered area in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>, one enzymatic reaction is characterized as increasing (edge <b>200</b>) and one enzymatic reaction is characterized as decreasing (edge <b>178</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref>. Going back to the database from which the identified microbial genes were identified, organism information was coupled to the functional annotations to understand how the shift in metabolism was being derived from these organisms. The two organisms' metabolic network were first visualized (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>D</figref>) with the nodes highlighted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>B</figref> and C placed near each other in the center. It is interesting to note that one of the two enzymatic reactions being focused on did not exist in one of the two organisms suggesting that the entire contribution of this reaction came from an individual organism. Visualizing the change in the enzymatic reactions of the same edges but from two different organisms explains the changes in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref> more thoroughly. The decrease in edge <b>178</b> was derived from a decrease in organism 2. While edge <b>200</b> does increase overall, organism 1 contributed to an increase while organism 2 decreased at that edge. The edge that was decreasing likely did not confer a benefit to the organism and therefore did not provide organism 2 any fitness advantage. Adding in the metabolite at node could increase the fitness benefit of edge <b>178</b> and increase the relative abundance of this organism. This example shows how dynamic visualization of metabolic networks integrated with taxonomic information allows for the development of molecules to selectively manipulate different organisms within the overall population.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Example 4. Identification of Genes and/or Metabolites for Diagnostics Relative to a Control Condition</heading><p id="p-0223" num="0222">Post-weaning diarrhea is an affliction that affects piglets and can result in increases in mortality of the piglets. Identifying changes in microbiome and potential metabolites associated with post-weaning diarrhea can create an early warning diagnostic that could facilitate intervention and thus reduce mortality. In a study of post-weaning diarrhea, a cohort of piglets was tracked over 20 days. Samples were taken for microbiome sequencing, metabolite extraction, and a fecal score was recorded. A fecal score could be an integer between 0 (no diarrhea) to 3 (severe diarrhea). Fecal score is usually recorded currently by human observation.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0223">After sequencing the microbiome and identifying genes present in the pathways, changes were be normalized to a fecal score of 0 (no diarrhea) to look for changes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A</figref>). Examining the network at a fecal score of 3, a large shift in pathways were seen to be both increasing (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>B</figref>; bottom right) and decreasing (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>B</figref>; top left). The increasing enzymatic reactions, edges <b>217</b> and <b>220</b> were identified as candidate biomarkers and can be further examined as a biomarker associated with increasing fecal score.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0224">The systems and methods described herein can also be used to examine decreased pathways to identify bottlenecks that can become potential treatment goals for substitution therapy with probiotic containing missing/decreased pathways, or to identify upstream metabolic markers that can serve as diagnostic markers. To prove that the systems and methods described herein can be used to identify metabolic markers and how the metabolic network is directly tied to these metabolites, metabolite levels were integrated into the metabolic network. Focusing on an area where reactions were decreasing (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>C</figref>), the inventors expected that an accumulation of a metabolite would occur. With measured metabolites shown in red (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>D</figref> and E), one metabolite could be visually identified as decreasing that is also adjacent to decreased reactions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>E</figref>). Upstream of this metabolite where enzymatic reactions were still present, there was an accumulation of a metabolite. This sharp change in abundance of enzymatic reactions is known as a bottleneck (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>B, <b>13</b>D, and <b>13</b>E</figref>), where without measurement of metabolite data (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>B</figref>), one can generate hypothetical metabolic markers as targets. However, the step of incorporating measurements of metabolites (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>E</figref>) solidified the understanding of where the accumulation was actually occurring.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Example 5. Developing Internal Standards to Monitor Fluctuations in Microbiome</heading><p id="p-0226" num="0225">Samples were collected from four groups of swine (one control group and three treatments groups (arachidonic acid, docosahexenoic acid, and a combination) by extracting DNA from the cecum after 30 days post-natal. The samples were sequenced to produce OTU's. The samples were sequenced using a shotgun metagenomic approach. Sequence reads were aligned to a database of annotated gene sequences to produce a count table of genes for each sample from all groups. The inventors then constructed a gene-level metabolic network where the nodes are metabolites and the edges are enzymatic reactions between the metabolites. Next, the gene counts were matched against the edges of the network and the relative abundance of gene counts of each edge were normalized to control such that the control edges all had a weight equal to one (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref>). The static network graph was converted to a dynamic one and data from the additional treatments was added into the network. In this experiment, a desired phenotype was observed that was correlated with a change in a specific gene (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref>). Compared to control conditions, there was an edge increase due to a specific treatment that had a positive effect on the host animal. This gene/enzyme/reaction was therefore selected as a candidate diagnostic marker. Observing this change relative to the untreated control, there was a need to identify an internal standard that can be used in situations where every animal is being treated to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment without having to run a control untreated group of animals. A good control gene/reaction/enzyme that can serve as an internal standard is a gene/reaction/enzyme whose abundance is relatively constant and does not fluctuate. Additional criteria to consider for selecting an internal control for a particular candidate marker can includes competing pathway(s), reaction(s). To identify such an internal control, all edges/genes/reactions were examined for their standard deviation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>C</figref>). Using an edge with the lowest standard deviation as the internal control, the changes in the candidate diagnostic marker level were more efficiently visualized and monitored internal to a single treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>D</figref>).</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Example 6. Using Host Response Identified Targets to Infer Microbiota Produced Signaling Metabolites or Pathway Shared Intermediates</heading><p id="p-0227" num="0226">Molecules produced by the microbiome upon application of exogenous products majorly impact gene expression in host intestinal cells. It is known by people skilled in the art how to identify gene expression modification within eukaryotic cells. The systems and methods disclosed herein can be deployed to use the eukaryotic fluctuating internal host targets to identify corresponding dynamically changing microbiota metabolites. These microbiota metabolites identified by the dynamic microbiota model can either compensate for fluctuating intermediates within the host cell after uptake (direct effect on host target) (targeted application of the dynamic microbiota model), or induce indirectly a metabolic answer/response from the host (ligand to receptor classical cascade signaling) (untargeted approach of the dynamic microbiota model).</p><p id="p-0228" num="0227">Proline metabolism provides an example of the theoretical concept of metabolic compensation between host and microbiome (direct effect on host target). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, shows the combined proline metabolic network of host and its microbiome.
