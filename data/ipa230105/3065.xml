The aircraft <b>1</b> has a fuselage <b>2</b> having a fore end at which a cockpit is located, and an aft end supporting a tail assembly, with the cabin <b>7</b> generally located between the cockpit and the tail assembly. The tail assembly comprises a vertical stabilizer <b>3</b> with a rudder, and horizontal stabilizers <b>4</b> with elevators. The tail assembly has a fuselage-mounted tail, but other configurations may also be used for the aircraft <b>1</b>, such as cruciform, T-tail, etc. Wings <b>5</b> project laterally from the fuselage. The aircraft <b>1</b> has engines <b>6</b> supported by the wings <b>5</b>, although the engines <b>6</b> could also be mounted to the fuselage <b>2</b>.

The hinge arm <b>54</b> has a rigid structure, and is pivotable about the pivot axis <b>52</b> to move between the open and closed positions of the door <b>20</b>. The hinge arm <b>54</b> extends away from the wall panels <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> for connection to the door <b>20</b>. Throughout its pivoting motion, the hinge arm <b>54</b> remains within a space defined between a plane of the inner surface <b>22</b><i>i </i>of the wall <b>22</b> and a plane of the outer surface <b>22</b><i>o </i>of the wall <b>22</b>. In other words, the hinge arm <b>54</b> pivots in plane P (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) which is aligned with the wall <b>22</b>, i.e. a plane P extending between the inner and outer surfaces <b>22</b><i>i, </i><b>22</b><i>o </i>of the wall <b>22</b> at least in proximity of the opening <b>18</b>, and in a particular embodiment for the entirety of the wall <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0044">In the embodiment shown, the plane P of movement of the hinge arm <b>54</b> is vertical, and the door <b>20</b> moves upwardly from the closed position to the open position. Other configurations are also possible.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0045">The hinge arm <b>54</b> is connected to the door <b>20</b> using any suitable type of connection. For example, in a particular embodiment the hinge arm <b>54</b> includes a connection portion extending parallel to the door <b>20</b>, having a U-shaped cross-section which defines a recess sized to receive an edge of the door <b>20</b>, and the edge of the door <b>20</b> is slidingly engaged in this complementary recess (not shown). Other configurations are also possible.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0046">In the embodiment shown and referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the outer wall panel <b>34</b> defines a stop <b>56</b> for abutting the hinge arm <b>54</b> when the door <b>20</b> is in the open position. The cut-out edge of the wall body <b>36</b> defines another stop <b>58</b> for abutting the hinge arm <b>54</b> when the door <b>20</b> is in the closed position. Alternately, one or both of the stops <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> may be defined by the inner wall panel <b>32</b>, or both stops <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> may be defined by the outer wall panel <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0047">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>-<b>5</b></figref>, a damper <b>60</b> is pivotally connected to the hinge arm <b>54</b> and to one or both of the wall panels <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, and is located in the receiving space <b>44</b> between the wall panels <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. The hinge arm <b>54</b> is configured so that its connection with the damper <b>60</b> and its connection with the pivot <b>50</b> are appropriately spaced apart to allow the damper <b>60</b> to act on the motion of the hinge arm <b>54</b> about the pivot <b>50</b>. In the embodiment shown, the damper <b>60</b> biases the door <b>20</b> in the open position, i.e. provides sufficient resistance so as to counteract the weight of the door <b>20</b> and allow the door <b>20</b> to remain in the open position unless a sufficient force toward the closed position is applied to it. The damper <b>60</b> may have any suitable configuration, including, but not limited to, any suitable type of rate control damper which can control motion through tension and compression. Suitable rate control dampers may be fully mechanical, gas-charged or hydraulic, among other possibilities.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0048">In a particular embodiment, a similar hinge assembly <b>30</b> is provided in the opposite side wall of the bin <b>10</b>, so that the door <b>20</b> is retained by two hinge arms <b>54</b>, i.e. on hinge arm <b>54</b> on each side of the door <b>20</b>. The additional hinge assembly includes wall panels <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, a pivot <b>50</b> and a hinge arm <b>54</b> similar to that previously described and shown.

One or both of the wall panels <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> (only one being visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) accordingly define the stop <b>158</b> abutting the hinge arm <b>154</b> at the closed position. The stop <b>156</b> abutting the hinge arm <b>154</b> at the open position is defined by one or both of the wall panels <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, in proximity of the edge of the cut-out <b>138</b> in the wall body <b>36</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0051">In this embodiment, the wall panels <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> are integrally connected to each other, forming part of a monolithic structure.

The hinge arm <b>54</b>, <b>154</b> is pivotally connected to the pivot <b>50</b> extending within the receiving space <b>44</b> so that the hinge arm <b>54</b>, <b>154</b> is pivotable within a plane aligned with the wall <b>22</b>.

The door <b>20</b> is connected to both hinge arms <b>54</b>, <b>154</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0056">In a particular embodiment, the hinge assembly <b>30</b>, <b>130</b> advantageously allows for support of the door <b>20</b> without causing an obstruction in the storage space <b>16</b>, since the hinge arm <b>54</b>, <b>154</b> remains outward of the inner wall surface <b>22</b><i>i </i>of the corresponding wall <b>22</b>, and the structure supporting the hinge arm <b>54</b>, <b>154</b> is also provided outward of the inner wall surface <b>22</b><i>i. </i>The only protrusion of the hinge assembly <b>30</b>, <b>130</b> within the storage space <b>16</b> corresponds to the thickness of the inner wall panel <b>32</b> where it is attached to the inner surface <b>22</b><i>i </i>of the wall body <b>36</b>. However, the panel thickness is a negligible dimension when compared to the width W of the storage space <b>16</b>. Accordingly, substantially the entire width W of the storage space <b>16</b> remains available for storage.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0057">Alternately, an indentation may be defined in the wall body <b>36</b> at the connection with the inner wall panel <b>32</b>, so that the inner surface of the inner wall panel <b>32</b> is aligned with the inner surface <b>22</b><i>i </i>of the wall body <b>36</b>. In that case, the entire width W of the storage space <b>16</b> remains available for storage.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0058">By contrast, prior art hinges connected to the inner surface of the wall and protruding within the storage space can have a width of for example 1 inch, which for an embodiment where hinges are provided on both sides of the door, creates a 2 inch obstruction to the usable width of the storage space <b>16</b>.
