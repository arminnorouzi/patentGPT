The invention also relates with implantable and biocompatible corneal grafts compositions, to methods for their production and grafting into the cornea and to methods for treating a medical condition of a patient.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Current vision correction techniques include eyeglasses, contact lenses and surgical methodologies which involve cutting and/or removal of tissue, such as laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) and photorefractive keratectomy (PRK). However, surgical methodologies require partially removement of the corneal stroma, which is an irreversible process, might induce complications such as scarring and hazing of the cornea, infections and glary vision. Furthermore, laser surgeries cannot address severe cases of hyperopia, as it requires the removal of a too thick layer from the corneal stroma.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another approach for optical correction is by adding material to the eye by placing a permanent graft in or on the cornea. A corneal Onlay is a transparent refraction-corrective lens placed near the surface of the eye, directly below the epithelium. Vision correction using Onlay lenses may be preferable to LASIK and/or PRK since it is reversible, repeatable, minimally invasive and easily modifiable. Onlay can serve as an alternative for people whose corneas are too thin for LASIK and/or PRK. Also, in severe cases, Onlay can be combined with LASIK and/or PRK. The Onlay is a thin lenticule (50 to 150 microns thick), which is placed on top of the corneal Bowman's layer, below the epithelium. To some extent, the Onlay is similar to a commercial contact lens, but should not generate an immune response and should promote the growth of a healthy epithelium on top.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Onlay technology, see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 9,125,735 which is incorporated herein as a reference, is focusing in the vision-correction market, but since it is less invasive than existing laser treatments, it may compete also with contact lenses and eyeglasses solutions.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Several attempts were made to address the Onlay refraction-correction solution. However, they suffer from lack of sufficient permeability or degradation or insufficient epithelium growth on top induce an immune response, and therefore failed in being a satisfying vision-correction solution. Currently, no corneal Onlays are FDA approved in the U.S.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An Onlay, made of a biocompatible material that is highly permeable yet has sufficient surface characteristics to stimulate stable and confirm growth and attachment of the corneal epithelium over its outer surface is still a long-felt need. Also, a stable Onlay which does not to degrade over time, does not induce immune response or scarring of the cornea and administrated via a minimal surgical invasiveness is still required.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Keratoconus is an illness of the cornea, which usually causes a weakening and thinning of the corneal stroma and leads to vision disorders. It affects about 200,000 patients in the US alone. Several treatments exist for Keratoconus, including contact lenses for early stages of the disease, methods of stiffening of the cornea, and corneal transplantation for patients with progressive keratoconus. Other treatments involve the grafting of a synthetic and rigid ring-shaped graft into the corneal stroma.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Hyperopia is the refractive disorder of the human eye, leading to the inability to focus on close objects and therefore results in far-sightless. It affects about 50% of the population in the US above the age of 40, and about 8% of children at age 6. The treatments of hyperopia include regular wearing of eyeglasses or contact lenses, or alternatively, vision-correction laser surgeries as PRK, LASIK, SMILE, and RLE, see e.g., Tran, Khai, and Andrea Ryce. &#x201c;Laser Refractive Surgery for Vision Correction: A Review of Clinical Effectiveness and Cost-effectiveness.&#x201d; (2018). However, laser subtractive treatments for hyperopia are limited to low refractive errors patients only, due to the limited thickness of the corneal stroma, see Corbett, Melanie, et al. &#x201c;Refractive Laser Surgery.&#x201d; <i>Corneal Topography</i>. Springer, Cham, 2019. 235-268.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Hence, affordable, stable, biocompatible, easily-implantable and patient-tailored corneal grafts are still a long-felt need.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The technology of present invention is generally directed to a corneal graft for treating either or both Keratoconus and visual impairment, and selected from (i) an Onlay comprises or coated by at least one member of Group A, consisting of biocompatible synthetic materials; at least one member of Group B, consisting of at least one type of biological polymer; and optionally, at least one member of Group C, consisting of at least one type of protein and (ii) an intrastromal corneal lenticule graft, configured to mimic native corneal stroma tissue by means of its optical properties, mechanical properties, permeability and interaction with corneal stromal cells; wherein at least one portion of the lenticule comprises or coated by at least one member of Group D, consisting of transparent crosslinked hydrogel; at least one member of Group E, consisting of collagen; collagen methacrylate, recombinant mammal collagen, mammal-sourced collagen; and optionally, at least one member of Group F, consisting of Keratocytes and/or stem cells and any combination thereof as disclosed and defined in the present invention.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Some embodiments of the invention disclose the corneal graft as defined above, wherein collagen of Group E is used to make hydrogels of Group D.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Some embodiments of the invention disclose an Onlay.

Additional 1 to 10% v/v HEA solution is mixed with the collagen, and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC) is admixed to form 0.5% (w/v) solution. The yield is thoroughly mixed and centrifuged, and poured into poly propylene (PP) contact lens molds. The molds are inserted into nitrogen chambers at 10 degrees C. for 12 to 24 hours. After crosslinking, lenticules are washed in saline for 24 to 72 hours. Washed hydrogel is then placed in an Excimer Laser system and ablated to form a lenticule with optical power according to an OCT scan of the patient's eyes. The resulting Inlay lenticule is further scanned by an OCT system to assure its optical properties, and possibly, lenticules are marked using Gentian Violet surgical marker by an arrow shaped and an &#x201c;S&#x201d; shaped marks, for easier grafting orientation.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> which shows OCT scans of an intrastromal lenticule graft before and after laser processing, in accordance with a few embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Several publications, patents, and patent applications have been cited hereinabove.
