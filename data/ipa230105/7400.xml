The first magnetic assembly and the second magnetic assembly are respectively disposed on opposite side walls of the first housing <b>1</b>. A magnetization direction of the first magnet <b>21</b> and a magnetization direction of the second magnet <b>22</b> are the same and along respective arrangement directions thereof, a magnetization direction of the third magnet <b>23</b> and a magnetization direction of the fourth magnet <b>24</b> are the same and along respective arrangement directions thereof. The magnetization direction of the first magnet <b>21</b> is opposite to the magnetization direction of the third magnet <b>23</b>, and the first magnet <b>21</b>, the second magnet <b>22</b>, the third magnet <b>23</b> and the fourth magnet <b>24</b> constitute a closed magnetic circuit. A first channel is formed between the first magnetic assembly and the second magnetic assembly; and the coil assembly <b>3</b> is connected with the second housing <b>4</b> and positioned in the first channel along a longitudinal direction thereof, and the second housing <b>4</b> is movably connected to the magnetic assembly <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The magnetization directions of the first magnet <b>21</b> and the second magnet <b>22</b> are the same and along the arrangement direction thereof. The magnetic lines of the first magnet <b>21</b> and the second magnet <b>22</b> pass through the coil assembly <b>3</b> in the first channel, and thus an interaction force may be generated between the magnetic assembly <b>2</b> and the coil assembly <b>3</b>. Similarly, the magnetization directions of the third magnet <b>23</b> and the fourth magnet <b>24</b> are the same and along the arrangement direction thereof, and the magnetization direction of the first magnet <b>21</b> is opposite to the magnetization direction of the third magnet <b>23</b>. As such, the first magnet <b>21</b>, the second magnet <b>22</b>, the third magnet <b>23</b> and the fourth magnet <b>24</b> constitute a closed magnetic circuit, so as to drive the electronic product connected to the vibration sound device <b>100</b> to sound.
