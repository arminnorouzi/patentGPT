In particular, the present invention relates to chest pads and chest protectors for play involving various projectiles including baseball, lacrosse, and softball.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Baseball and softball catchers are positioned behind home plate and perform many important functions during a game, from calling plays and protecting the plate to catching the ball thrown by the pitcher. Due to impacts from pitches, sometimes in excess of 90 mph, and home plate crashes with other players, the bodies of baseball players are regularly exposed to physical trauma. Similarly, lacrosse goalies are vulnerable to being struck with a high speed ball as the ball is shot into the goal. As a result, chest protectors and other protective equipment, such as shoulder pads, are primarily associated with baseball and softball catchers and lacrosse goalies. However, field players in baseball, softball, and lacrosse as well as batters and base runners are also at risk for getting injured from being struck with a projectile during play.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A particular concern in sports involving high speed projectiles is a phenomenon called commotio cordis. The phenomenon occurs when a blunt blow to the chest wall directly over the heart happens during a precise moment in the heart's cycle, disrupting its normal rhythm and causing cardiac arrest. The only effective response to commotio cordis is the immediate application of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and deployment of a defibrillator (AED) to administer a controlled electric shock in order to allow restoration of the normal rhythm.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition to defibrillation and CPR, protective equipment may help to reduce the risk of commotio cordis. However, a 2006 study revealed that the seven baseball chest protectors and five lacrosse chest protectors tested on juvenile swines did not significantly decrease the occurrence of ventricular fibrillation (VF) when compared with controls and thus, these commercially available chest protectors were deemed ineffective in protecting against VF triggered by chest blows. More recently, with the exact cause of commotio cordis now known, testing on a mechanical surrogate has provided further guidance as to what thresholds must be met by protective equipment to prevent commotio cordis. In fact, the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE) has arrived at a final standard test method and performance specification for use in evaluating the performance characteristics of chest protectors for commotio cordis (NOCSAE 200-17a m18). More recent research by Dr. Mark Link demonstrated that the majority of commercially available chest protectors, when tested on a mechanical surrogate, failed to decrease the incidence rate of commotio cordis. In other words, tests on the majority of commercially available chest guards found that there was not a significant difference in preventing commotio cordis between wearing the protection and not.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for improved protective equipment to reduce the occurrence of commotio cordis.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention is directed to a chest pad that significantly reduces the occurrence of commotio cordis among athletes.
