to a liquid crystal display device capable of avoiding black unevenness generated in a display area.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">(2) Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A liquid crystal display device is formed by a TFT substrate with pixels including pixel electrodes and thin film transistors (TFT) formed in a matrix shape, an opposite substrate facing the TFT substrate, and a liquid crystal interposed between the TFT substrate and the opposite substrate. Then, an image is formed by controlling the transmittance of light through liquid crystal molecules in every pixel.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a liquid crystal display device, there sometimes occurs black unevenness especially in the periphery of a display area. This may be affected by the water entering into the liquid crystal. In order to avoid the water from entering inside, various structures have been developed. On the other hand, there is another way of, even if water enters into the liquid crystal display device, adsorbing the water entered inside in order to suppress the affect on the liquid crystal.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Japanese Patent Publication Laid-Open No. 2008-191265 discloses a structure in which an adsorbent layer for adsorbing the water is arranged in a seal portion for sealing the TFT substrate and the opposite substrate.

In other words, something other than the essential material for the operation of the liquid crystal display device is used as another component. This conventional method has the following problems:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">(1) The other component is arranged in the different process; therefore, the manufacturing cost is increased according to an increase in the component cost and the process. (2) The material other than the essential material for the operation of the liquid crystal display device is used; therefore, it is necessary to check whether the display performance is affected by the material when the liquid crystal display device is operated for a long time.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the invention is to solve the above problems and to avoid black unevenness from occurring in a liquid crystal display device by effectively adsorbing water entered into a liquid crystal display panel, without increasing the manufacturing cost and without deteriorating reliability.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The invention is to solve the above problems and the concrete means are as follows.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">(1) A liquid crystal display device including a display area and a terminal portion, in which a TFT substrate with an organic passivation film formed there and an opposite substrate are adhered to each other by a seal portion and a liquid crystal is enclosed there, wherein in the seal portion of the TFT substrate, a groove-shaped through-hole is formed in the organic passivation film to surround the display area, a water absorption layer formed of the same material in the same process as that of the organic passivation film is formed within the groove-shaped through-hole, and the water absorption layer is not covered with the inorganic insulating film.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">(2) The device according to the above (1), wherein the water absorption layer is continuously formed along the whole periphery to surround the display area.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">(3) The device according to the above (1), wherein the water absorption layer is formed discontinuously to surround the display area.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">(4) The device according to the above (1), wherein the water absorption layer is formed only in the corner portions of the display area.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a top plan view of a liquid crystal display device according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along the line A-A of FIG. <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an enlarged top plan view corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional view of a seal portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional view of another example of the seal portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic plan view illustrating the invention.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic plan view illustrating another example of the invention.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a schematic plan view illustrating further another example of the invention.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating the structure of the seal portion of the liquid crystal display device used together with the invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Before describing the embodiment of the invention, a structure for avoiding water from entering into a liquid crystal layer, which is used together with the invention, will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view in the vicinity of a seal portion of a liquid crystal display device. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, a TFT substrate <b>100</b> and an opposite substrate <b>200</b> are adhered to each other by a sealing material <b>20</b>. An organic passivation film <b>4</b> serving also as a flattening film is formed on the TFT substrate <b>100</b>. This organic passivation film <b>104</b> is formed of acrylate resin; therefore, the above film absorbs water and transmits the water easily. Further, the organic passivation film <b>104</b> also serves as the flattening film and formed thick with 1 to 4 &#x3bc;m, generally with 2 to 3 &#x3bc;m; therefore, the above film easily transmits the water.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The organic passivation film is provided with a groove-shaped through-hole along the end portion of the TFT substrate <b>100</b> in a way of surrounding a display area. The water absorbed by the organic passivation film <b>104</b>, coming from the end portion of the substrate inwardly, is shut out by the groove-shaped through-hole <b>1041</b> and does not arrive at a liquid crystal layer <b>300</b>. In the groove-shaped through-hole <b>1041</b>, the organic passivation film <b>104</b> is covered with the insulating film <b>105</b> formed of SiN; therefore, it takes a long time for the entered water to pass the groove-shaped through-hole <b>1041</b>, hence to prolong a lifetime of the liquid crystal display device as much.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the structure as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, however, once the water passes the insulating film <b>105</b>, the water easily arrives at the liquid crystal layer <b>300</b>. According to the structure as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, there is a limit to a long life of the liquid crystal display device.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the opposite substrate <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, a black matrix <b>201</b> is formed extensively in the end portion of the substrate. The black matrix <b>201</b> is formed of an organic material in many cases. When the black matrix is formed of the organic material, water easily enters from the end portion. In order to shut down the water entered through the black matrix <b>201</b>, a black matrix groove <b>2011</b> is formed. The black matrix is not so thick as the organic passivation film <b>104</b> in the TFT substrate <b>100</b> and therefore, the entered amount of the water is smaller than that on the side of the TFT substrate. The contents of the invention will be described in detail using the following embodiments.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a top plan view of a liquid crystal display device to which the invention is applied. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the TFT substrate <b>100</b> and the opposite substrate <b>200</b> are adhered to each other by the sealing material <b>20</b>, with the liquid crystal interposed between the TFT substrate <b>100</b> and the opposite substrate <b>200</b>. The TFT substrate <b>100</b> is formed larger than the opposite substrate <b>200</b>, and a portion of only one sheet of the TFT substrate <b>100</b> is a terminal portion <b>150</b>. In the terminal portion <b>150</b>, an IC driver <b>160</b> for driving a liquid crystal display panel and terminals for connecting a flexible wiring substrate for supplying power, video signals, and scanning signals to the liquid crystal display panel are formed.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in a display area <b>500</b>, scanning lines <b>30</b> respectively extend in a horizontal direction and are aligned in a vertical direction. Further, video signal lines <b>40</b> respectively extend in the vertical direction and are aligned in the horizontal direction. An area surrounded by the scanning line <b>30</b> and the video signal line <b>40</b> is a pixel <b>35</b>. In a narrow frame, a distance w between the end portion of the display area <b>500</b> and the end portion of the liquid crystal display device is small with about 1 mm. In this case, the width of the sealing material becomes smaller and if so, the outside water gets easily reach the liquid crystal layer in the display area. This easily causes a so-called black unevenness easily, affected by the water.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a detailed cross-sectional view of a seal portion corresponding to the cross section taken along the line A-A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a first insulating film <b>101</b> is formed on the TFT substrate <b>100</b> formed of glass. The first insulating film <b>101</b> can be occasionally an undercoat film formed to prevent the impurities generated from the glass from contaminating the TFT semiconductor layer. A second insulating film <b>102</b> is formed on the first insulating film <b>101</b>. The second insulating film <b>102</b> can be occasionally a gate insulating film in the TFT. A scanning-line lead line <b>103</b> is formed on the second insulating film <b>102</b>. The scanning-line lead line <b>103</b> shown in a rectangular shape in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross section of the scanning-line lead line <b>103</b>, which is connected to the scanning line <b>30</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">An organic passivation film <b>104</b> is formed to cover the scanning-line lead lines <b>103</b>. The organic passivation film <b>104</b> is formed thick with 2 to 3 &#x3bc;m, also serving as a flattening film. The organic passivation film <b>104</b> is formed of photosensitive resin, which does not need photoresist for patterning.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the display area, it is necessary to connect a pixel electrode or a common electrode formed on the organic passivation film <b>104</b> to a source electrode of the TFT, which connection is performed through the through-hole formed on the organic passivation film <b>104</b>. The organic passivation film <b>104</b> is formed of resin such as acrylic resin. This film easily absorbs water and when the pixel electrode or the common electrode is formed directly on the organic passivation film <b>104</b>, the pixel electrode or the common electrode is exfoliated especially in the through-hole portion, due to the water absorbed by the organic passivation film <b>104</b>. In order to avoid this phenomenon, the conventional art has been designed in that the diameter of the through-hole is enlarged so that the inorganic insulating film <b>105</b> may cover the organic passivation film assuredly, also in the through-hole. In other words, in the conventional art, it has been essential that the organic passivation film <b>104</b> is covered with the inorganic insulating film <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an interlayer insulting film <b>105</b> made of SiN is formed on the organic passivation film <b>104</b>. This interlayer insulting film <b>105</b> is an insulating film between a lower layer electrode formed flat and an upper layer electrode having a slit in the display area of the liquid crystal display device of the IPS method. In some cases, the lower electrode may be the common electrode and the upper layer electrode may be the pixel electrode and in other cases, it may be reversed; the lower layer electrode and the upper layer electrode are both formed of transparent oxide conductive film represented by Indium Tin Oxide (ITO).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Since the organic passivation film <b>104</b> easily transmits the water, as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the groove-shaped through-hole <b>1041</b> is formed in the organic passivation film <b>104</b> in order to shut out the water coming from the end portion through the organic passivation film <b>104</b>. The groove-shaped through-hole <b>1041</b> is formed around the whole periphery of the TFT substrate <b>100</b> to surround the display area within the seal portion.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The characteristic of the invention is that a water absorption layer <b>10</b> formed by the organic passivation film is formed in a shape of wall within the groove-shaped through-hole <b>1041</b>, not covered with the inorganic insulating material. This water absorption layer <b>10</b> is to absorb the water when water transmitted from the end portion of the TFT substrate <b>100</b> through the organic passivation film <b>104</b> further intends to pass the groove <b>1041</b> of the organic passivation film <b>104</b>. According to this, a time from the intrusion of the water into the liquid crystal display panel to the arrival at the liquid crystal layer <b>300</b> can be prolonged. As the result, a lifetime of the liquid crystal display device can be prolonged.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an alignment film <b>106</b> is formed on the interlayer insulting film <b>105</b>. The alignment film <b>106</b> is formed by applying an alignment film material that is originally liquid according to the flexography or inkjet, and three concave portions are formed on the organic passivation film <b>104</b> as a stopper so that the alignment film material does not arrive at the outer end portion of the seal portion. Further, the groove-shaped through-hole <b>1041</b> formed further outside of the concave portions also serves as the stopper against the alignment film material.

The black matrix <b>201</b> is formed of resin and a black matrix groove <b>2011</b> is formed in order to shut down the water transmitted through the resin. A color filter <b>202</b> is formed on the black matrix <b>201</b> in a stripe shape in a direction vertical to the paper surface.
