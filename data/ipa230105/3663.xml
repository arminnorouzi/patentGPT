id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a technique for remotely measuring r a displacement on a surface of an object performing a motion such as movement or rotation and determining an abnormality of the object.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">If a defect such as surface cracking or peeling or an internal cavity occurs in an object (hereinafter also referred to as a moving object) that performs a motion such as movement or rotation, such as a propeller of wind power generation, a blade of a turbine, or a wheel of a traveling vehicle, soundness of a structure including the moving object may be adversely affected. Therefore, it is necessary to accurately detect these defects as abnormalities as soon as possible.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As a method of inspecting the moving object, there is a method of detecting an abnormality of the moving object by stopping the motion of the moving object and performing a visual inspection or a noise inspection by an inspector. This method requires significant human costs and has a problem that the structure including the moving object cannot be used during the inspection.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, a method of determining a state of the moving object without stopping the motion of the moving object on the basis of an image of the moving object has been developed. For example, in the techniques disclosed in NPLs 1 and 2, a moving image of a moving object is captured by a stereo camera, motions of a plurality of points in the moving object are obtained from time-series frame images constituting the moving image, and an abnormality of the moving object is detected.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, in the techniques in PTLs 1 and 2, a displacement amount (also referred to as in-plane displacement) in a direction along a surface of a moving object and a displacement amount (also referred to as out-of-plane displacement) in a direction along an optical axis direction of a camera are detected from a moving image by a single camera instead of a stereo camera. Moreover, in the techniques in PTLs 1 and 2, defects (abnormalities) of the moving object such as cracking, peeling, and an internal cavity are detected on the basis of the detected out-of-plane displacement and in-plane displacement.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">PTL 3 discloses a technique of irradiating a three-dimensional structure with laser light and acquiring shape data of a three-dimensional structure using reflected light of laser light from the three-dimensional structure.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0007">[PTL 1] WO 2016/152075 A1</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0008">[PTL 2] WO 2016/152076 A1</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0009">[PTL 3] JP 2007-121126 A</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Non Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0010">[NPL 1] Hyoseong Lee et al., &#x201c;Measurement of 3-D vibration by dynamic photogrammetry using least-square image matching for sub-pixel targeting&#x201d;, IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), 2015</li>    <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0011">[NPL 2] Jan Winstroth and Joerg R.

On the other hand, the techniques described in PTLs 1 and 2 use only one camera, and can suppress an increase in size as compared with the stereo camera, so that the problem of an increase in size of the device caused by the stereo camera is prevented.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0013">However, in the techniques described in PTLs 1 and 2, when the out-of-plane displacement and the in-plane displacement in the moving object during the motion are measured, a value obtained by adding a displacement due to the motion of the moving object to the out-of-plane displacement and the in-plane displacement is detected as a measured value. As a result, characteristics appearing in the out-of-plane displacement and the in-plane displacement due to the abnormality of the moving object become difficult to be captured from the measured value, and this causes a problem that the detection accuracy of the abnormality of the moving object is lowered.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0014">The present invention has been made in view of the above problems, and a main object thereof is to enable accurate detection of an abnormality of a moving object in a non-contact manner while suppressing an increase in size of a device.</p><heading

An abnormality determination device <b>100</b> according to the first example embodiment is connected to a capture device <b>1</b> and has a function to receive an image captured by the capture device <b>1</b> from the capture device <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0070">The capture device <b>1</b> has a function to capture a moving image, and generates time-series frame images (hereinafter, referred to as time-series images) by capturing a moving image of a surface of an object to be measured <b>10</b> as a target to be captured in the first example embodiment. That is, the time-series images include a plurality of frame images. A frame rate of the time-series images is, for example, 400 frames per second (fps). Here, the object to be measured <b>10</b> is a moving object that performs a motion such as movement or rotation, and the frame rate of the time-series images is appropriately set in consideration of a natural frequency of the object to be measured <b>10</b> and is not limited to 400 fps.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0071">The abnormality determination device <b>100</b> has a function to calculate displacement on a captured surface of the object to be measured <b>10</b>, using a difference of the surface of the object to be measured <b>10</b> between the frame images in the time-series images generated by the capture device <b>1</b>. The abnormality determination device <b>100</b> is, for example, an information device (signal processing device) such as a personal computer (PC) or a server.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0072">In the first example embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the abnormality determination device <b>100</b> includes, as functional units, a coordinate system fixing unit <b>2</b>, a displacement calculation unit <b>3</b>, a displacement difference calculation unit <b>4</b>, a depth movement amount calculation unit <b>5</b>, a displacement separation unit <b>6</b>, and a determination unit <b>7</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, the determination unit <b>7</b> includes a three-dimensional spatial distribution information analysis unit <b>8</b> and a temporal change information analysis unit <b>9</b>. Each functional unit of the abnormality determination device <b>100</b> is implemented by a central processing unit (CPU), which is a calculation resource included in the information device, executing a computer program (hereinafter also referred to as a program) stored in a memory or a hard disk drive (HDD), which is a storage resource.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0073">The coordinate system fixing unit <b>2</b> in the abnormality determination device <b>100</b> has a function to receive the time-series images from the capture device <b>1</b> and generate coordinate-fixed time-series images using the plurality of frame images (captured images) of the received time-series images. The coordinate-fixed time-series images are time-series images as follows. Here, it is assumed that a reference point set in the frame image defined as a reference among the plurality of frame images of the time-series images is displaced in accordance with the displacement due to the motion of the object to be measured <b>10</b> in the plurality of time-series frame images. The time-series frame images in which directions of the frame images are rotated or displaced so that positions of the reference points in the time-series frame images coincide with one another are referred to as coordinate-fixed time-series images.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, and <b>2</b>C</figref> are diagrams for describing the function of the coordinate system fixing unit <b>2</b> using a specific example. In this specific example, the object to be measured <b>10</b> is one propeller-like blade (object to be measured) <b>21</b> that rotates about a rotation shaft <b>22</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. In addition, it is assumed that a selection region <b>23</b> is set in the first frame image illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> defined as a reference in the time-series images. The selection region <b>23</b> is a region including an image of the object to be measured <b>21</b>. In this example, the selection region <b>23</b> has a rectangular shape, and one corner P<b>1</b> of the rectangular shape is set as the reference point. Moreover, coordinates representing a position on the frame image are represented using a two-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system including an X axis and a Y axis orthogonal to each other, and the coordinates of the reference point P<b>1</b> in the first frame image are represented as (X1, Y1).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is obtained by rotating the selection region <b>23</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> by an angle &#x3b8; about the reference point P<b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> illustrates the second frame image captured at a later time than the first frame image in the time-series images including the first frame image.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0076">The coordinate system fixing unit <b>2</b> compares each image of the selection region <b>23</b> rotated by the angle &#x3b8; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> from 0&#xb0; to 360&#xb0; with 1&#xb0; increments with, for example, the second frame image in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, and calculates a correlation value between the compared images (similarity of the images) by an image correlation method. Further, the coordinate system fixing unit <b>2</b> acquires the value of the angle &#x3b8; (hereinafter also referred to as a similarity large angle &#x3b8;m) at which the correlation value is maximized by the calculation processing of the correlation value. In addition, the coordinate system fixing unit <b>2</b> acquires the coordinates of the position of the reference point P<b>1</b> in the case where the image of the selection region <b>23</b> is superimposed on the second frame image so that the correlation value is maximized. That is, the selection region <b>23</b> superimposed on the second frame image so as to maximize the correlation value is represented as a region <b>24</b> by the dotted line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, and the coordinates of the position P<b>2</b> corresponding to the reference point P<b>1</b> of the selection region <b>23</b> are represented as (X2, Y2).</p><p id="p-0075" num="0077">Note that, for example, affine transformation is used for image rotation, and the increment of the rotation angle may be appropriately set according to required accuracy or calculation cost (processing amount), and is not limited to the increment of 1&#xb0;. Further, as a method of calculating the similarity between images, a method other than the image correlation method may be used. Moreover, image interpolation processing may be performed in the image rotation. Furthermore, in the processing of calculating the similarity between images and the processing of image rotation, the coordinate system fixing unit <b>2</b> may have a function to select a processing method according to the calculation cost calculated in consideration of a resolution of the image or the like.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> are diagrams for describing coordinate-fixed time-series images.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is an image corresponding to the selection region <b>23</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is an image obtained by rotating the region <b>24</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> by the similarity large angle &#x3b8;m in a direction to match the direction of the selection region <b>23</b> (in other words, a reverse direction to the direction in which the image of the selection region <b>23</b> is displaced from the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> to the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>). The solid line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> indicates an image (blade image) of the object to be measured <b>21</b> displayed in the region <b>24</b> in the second frame image. The alternate long and short dash line indicates an image of the object to be measured <b>21</b> displayed in the selection region <b>23</b> in the first frame image (an image of the blade (an image corresponding to the image of the object to be measured <b>21</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>)). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the images of the regions <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> are superimposed such that the position of the reference point P<b>1</b> set in the selection region <b>23</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> coincides with the position of the point P<b>2</b> corresponding to the reference point P<b>1</b> in the region <b>24</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0080">In each frame image in the time-series images or in a plurality of frame images selected from the time-series images, the processing of displacing (rotating) the frame images and the processing of superimposing the frame images are executed in a similar manner to described above to generate a coordinate-fixed time-series image.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0081">As described above, the state as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> in which the frame images are superimposed such that the reference point P<b>1</b> set in the reference frame image coincides with the point corresponding to the reference point P<b>1</b> in another frame image is referred to as a good coordinate-fixed state. On the other hand, a state in which the frame images are superimposed such that the reference point P<b>1</b> set in the reference frame image shifts from the point corresponding to the reference point P<b>1</b> in another frame image is referred to as a non-good (defective) coordinate-fixed state. An example of a defective coordinate-fixed state is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0082">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, there is a case where the images are displayed in a shifted manner although the images of the same object to be measured <b>21</b> are superimposed and displayed in the good coordinate-fixed state. This image shift is caused by deformation of the object to be measured <b>21</b> itself. Further, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the image shift generated in the case where the images of the same object to be measured <b>21</b> are superimposed and displayed in the defective coordinate-fixed state is caused by not only the deformation of the object to be measured <b>21</b> itself but also the defective coordinate-fixed state (shift of the reference point).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0083">The displacement calculation unit <b>3</b> has a function to calculate a two-dimensional spatial distribution of displacements of the surface of the object to be measured from the coordinate-fixed time-series images. In the first example embodiment, the displacement calculation unit <b>3</b> has a function to calculate a displacement amount of the image in the coordinate-fixed time-series image generated by the coordinate system fixing unit <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0084">The displacement amount of the image in the coordinate-fixed time-series image will be described with a specific example. The image of the object to be measured <b>21</b> illustrated in the coordinate-fixed time-series image in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> has a quadrangular shape, and here, the four corners are represented as A, B, C, and D, respectively. When the images of the plurality of objects to be measured illustrated in the coordinate-fixed time-series images are arranged in time series, the image of the object to be measured repeats enlargement and reduction according to the displacement (motion or rotation) of the object to be measured. As a result, when the corners A, B, C, and D of the image of the object to be measured as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> are traced in time series in the coordinate-fixed time-series images, the corners A to D are displaced.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> illustrates, in time series, an example of displacement amounts (displacement in the Y direction) of the corners A to D with reference to the positions of the corners A to D in the image of the object to be measured <b>21</b> defined as a reference in the coordinate-fixed time-series images. In the case where the coordinate-fixed time-series images are in a good coordinate-fixed state, the displacements of the corners A to D show the temporal changes as illustrated by the solid lines A<b>1</b> to D<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>. In the case where the coordinate-fixed time-series images are in a defective coordinate-fixed state, the displacements of the corners A to D show the temporal changes as illustrated by the dotted lines A<b>2</b> to D<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>. The displacements of the corners A to D illustrated by the dotted lines A<b>2</b> to D<b>2</b> are displacements obtained by adding an error component caused by the defective coordinate-fixed state to the displacements of the corners A to D illustrated by the solid lines A<b>1</b> to D<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0086">The displacement calculation unit <b>3</b> calculates the displacement amount of the image in the coordinate-fixed time-series image generated by the coordinate system fixing unit <b>2</b> by, for example, comparing the reference image of the object to be measured <b>21</b> with another image of the object to be measured <b>21</b> captured at a different capture time. The displacement calculation unit <b>3</b> may calculate the displacement of not the corner but the surface (blade surface) of the object to be measured <b>21</b> by calculating correlation between the frame images in the time-series images by the image correlation method. Further, in the case of calculating correlation between the frame images as the displacement amount using the image correlation method, the displacement calculation unit <b>3</b> can calculate the displacement amount at 1/100 level of a pixel pitch of an optical element in the capture device <b>1</b> by further using a quadratic curve interpolation method. Moreover, the displacement calculation unit <b>3</b> may generate a displacement distribution diagram in the two-dimensional space on the basis of the calculated displacement amount. Moreover, in a case where a normal direction of the surface of the object to be measured is inclined with respect to an optical axis of a lens of the capture device <b>1</b>, the displacement calculation unit <b>3</b> may calculate the displacement amount in which the inclination of the normal direction of the surface of the object to be measured with respect to the optical axis of the lens of the capture device <b>1</b> is corrected by executing perspective projection conversion processing.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0087">The displacement difference calculation unit <b>4</b> has a function to remove the error component caused by the defective coordinate-fixed state from the displacement amount calculated by the displacement calculation unit <b>3</b>. As a specific example, the displacement difference calculation unit <b>4</b> subtracts the displacement amount of the corner D from the displacement amounts of the corners A to C of the object to be measured <b>21</b> calculated by the displacement calculation unit <b>3</b>. Here, it is assumed that the deformation of the object to be measured itself during the motion of the object to be measured is sufficiently smaller than the magnitude of the error component caused by the defective coordinate-fixed state, and the object to be measured can be regarded as a rigid body. The error components caused by the defective coordinate-fixed state included in the displacement amounts of the corners A to D are similar. As a result, by subtracting the displacement amount of the corner D from the displacement amounts of the corners A to C, the displacement amounts of the corners A to C in which the error component caused by the defective coordinate-fixed state has been removed, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, are calculated. That is, the displacement difference calculation unit <b>4</b> calculates the two-dimensional displacement difference distribution representing differences between the displacements of the surface of the object to be measured in the two-dimensional spatial distribution calculated by the displacement calculation unit <b>3</b> and the displacement selected as a reference from the displacements of the surface of the object to be measured in the two-dimensional spatial distribution.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0088">The displacement amount in which the error component caused by the defective coordinate-fixed state has been removed is obtained by the displacement difference calculation unit <b>4</b>, so that evaluation performance of a vibration state of the object to be measured <b>21</b> can be improved as follows. That is, since the object to be measured <b>21</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a propeller-like blade and has a cantilever shape, the object to be measured naturally vibrates at a frequency corresponding to its size and material. Amplitude of a higher order natural vibration mode is smaller than the vibration of a primary natural vibration mode (fundamental mode). Therefore, in the case where the displacement amount calculated by the displacement calculation unit <b>3</b> includes the error component caused by the defective coordinate-fixed state, the frequency characteristic of the vibration of the object to be measured <b>21</b> obtained using the displacement amount calculated by the displacement calculation unit <b>3</b> is illustrated as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>. That is, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> is a graph illustrating the frequency characteristic of vibration at the corner A of the object to be measured <b>21</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the frequency characteristic being obtained on the basis of the displacement amount calculated by the displacement calculation unit <b>3</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, the vibration at the natural frequency of the primary natural vibration mode of the object to be measured <b>21</b> appears, but the vibration of the higher order natural vibration mode is buried in a noise component due to the error component caused by the defective coordinate-fixed state and does not appear.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0089">In contrast, by using the displacement amount in which the error component caused by the defective coordinate-fixed state has been removed by displacement difference calculation unit <b>4</b>, the frequency characteristic of the vibration regarding the corner A of the object to be measured <b>21</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> can be obtained.

The in-plane displacement occurs in the surface of the object to be measured <b>21</b> by the opening and closing of the opening due to the crack.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>C</figref> is a graph illustrating the temporal change in the in-plane displacement at points Ja and Jb, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>D</figref> is a graph illustrating an in-plane displacement distribution on a straight line passing through the points Ja and Jb. In a case where there is no crack in the surface of the object to be measured <b>21</b>, the spatial in-plane displacement distribution is continuous as illustrated by the solid line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>D</figref>. On the other hand, in the case where there is a crack, the spatial in-plane displacement distribution exhibits a rapid intermittent change between the points Ja and Jb, as illustrated by the dotted line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>D</figref>.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0111">Therefore, the abnormality of the object to be measured <b>21</b> caused by a crack or the like in the surface of the object to be measured <b>21</b> can be detected on the basis of such a temporal change in the in-plane displacement or a spatial in-plane displacement distribution.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0112">In consideration of the above, the three-dimensional spatial distribution information analysis unit <b>8</b> of the determination unit <b>7</b> analyzes the three-dimensional displacement distribution of the object to be measured at a plurality of time points of attention. Further, the temporal change information analysis unit <b>9</b> analyzes temporal changes in three-dimensional displacements in a plurality of portions on the surface of the object to be measured. The determination unit <b>7</b> determines the abnormality of the object to be measured <b>21</b> on the basis of information obtained by the three-dimensional spatial distribution information analysis unit <b>8</b> and the temporal change information analysis unit <b>9</b>. This determination result is output to, for example, a notification device. The notification device visually notifies the determination result by, for example, screen display or audibly notifies the determination result by a speaker or the like. Moreover, the information output by the notification device may be information in a form read by a machine in addition to the information in a form visually and aurally recognizable by a person. In the above example, the determination unit <b>7</b> determines the abnormality of the object to be measured <b>21</b> using both the depth movement amount and the in-plane displacement. In contrast, the determination unit <b>7</b> may determine the abnormality of the object to be measured <b>21</b> using one of the depth movement amount or the in-plane displacement.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0113">Next, an example of an operation flow of the abnormality determination device <b>100</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating an example of the abnormality determination processing executed by the abnormality determination device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0114">First, the abnormality determination device <b>100</b> acquires the time-series images in which the surface of the object to be measured <b>10</b> (<b>21</b>) is captured from the capture device <b>1</b> (S<b>1</b>). Thereafter, the coordinate system fixing unit <b>2</b> calculates the displacement amount in the surface of the object to be measured <b>10</b> using a set of mth (m&#x3e;1) and (m+1)th frame images included in the time-series images. Further, the coordinate system fixing unit <b>2</b> detects a rotation angle and translational displacement between the mth and (m+1)th frame images by rotation template matching, using the calculated displacement amount (S<b>2</b>). Moreover, the coordinate system fixing unit <b>2</b> generates the coordinate-fixed time-series image by reversely rotating the (m+1)th frame image by the detected rotation angle or reversely displacing the (m+1)th frame image by the translational displacement (S<b>3</b>). Thereafter, the displacement calculation unit <b>3</b> calculates the displacement amount of the surface of the object to be measured in the coordinate-fixed time-series image (S<b>4</b>).</p><p id="p-0115" num="0115">Then, the displacement difference calculation unit <b>4</b> calculates a displacement difference (that is, two-dimensional displacement difference distribution) by subtracting the displacement amount selected as a reference in the coordinate-fixed time-series image from the displacement amount calculated in the same coordinate-fixed time-series image (S<b>5</b>).</p><p id="p-0116" num="0116">Thereafter, the depth movement amount calculation unit <b>5</b> calculates the depth movement amount (out-of-plane displacement) from the displacement difference obtained by the displacement difference calculation unit <b>4</b> (S<b>6</b>). Further, the displacement separation unit <b>6</b> calculates the in-plane displacement by subtracting the depth movement amount obtained by the depth movement amount calculation unit <b>5</b> from the displacement difference obtained by the displacement difference calculation unit <b>4</b> (S<b>7</b>).</p><p id="p-0117" num="0117">After that, the coordinate system fixing unit <b>2</b> determines whether the depth movement amount and the in-plane displacement have been calculated for predetermined n (&#x3e;1) frame images included in the time-series images (S<b>8</b>). In a case where the processing of calculating the depth movement amount and the in-plane displacement has not been completed for the n frame images (No in S<b>8</b>), the processing returns to step S<b>1</b>, and the coordinate system fixing unit <b>2</b> generates the coordinate-fixed time-series image by using the next set of frame images included in the time-series images, that is, the (m+1)th and (m+2)th frame images.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0118">On the other hand, in step S<b>8</b>, in a case where the coordinate system fixing unit <b>2</b> determines that the processing of calculating the depth movement amount and the in-plane displacement has been completed for the n frame images (Yes in S<b>8</b>), the determination unit <b>7</b> executes the determination processing. That is, the determination unit <b>7</b> analyzes the calculated depth movement amount and in-plane displacement (S<b>9</b>), and determines the abnormality of the object to be measured <b>10</b> using the analysis result (S<b>10</b>). After the abnormality determination, the abnormality determination device <b>100</b> may output the determination result to the notification device. By the notification of the notification device, the user can determine whether it is necessary to repair or precisely examine the object to be measured <b>10</b>, for example.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0119">In this manner, the abnormality determination device <b>100</b> executes the abnormality determination processing.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0120">According to the configuration of the first example embodiment, it is possible to accurately determine the abnormality of the moving object using the captured image of the single capture device without using a stereo camera, that is, while suppressing the increase in size and cost of the device.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Second Example Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0121" num="0121">Hereinafter, a second example embodiment according to the present invention will be described.
