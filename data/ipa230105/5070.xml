More specifically, the present invention relates to a system and method of combining omics-based health management resources and tools for the prevention, management, recovery and protection components within a critical illness or life insurance or assurance product. Accordingly, the present specification makes specific reference thereto. However, it is to be appreciated that aspects of the present invention are also equally amenable to other like applications, devices and methods of manufacture.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Life insurance or life assurance are contract based financial products between an insurance policy holder and an insurer. A traditional life insurance or critical illness policy typically provides cash at either death or in the event of the onset of a critical illness. The insurer guarantees a sum of money upon the death of the insured person that is payable to a designated beneficiary. Events such as terminal critical illnesses can also initiate payment depending on the specifics of the policy. The policy holder typically pays the insurer a lump sum or regularly occurring premium. The insurance benefits often include other expenses, such as medical and funeral expenses.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Life insurance or life assurance products are similar to other types of asset management products or systems. Asset management is a systematic approach to the governance and realization of value from the things over an entire life cycle that a group or entity is responsible for protecting. It may apply both to tangible assets and to intangible assets. Asset management is a systematic process of developing, operating, maintaining, upgrading, and disposing of assets in the most cost-effective manner.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Life-based insurance products tend to fall into two major categories: protection policies and investment policies. A protection policy is designed to provide a benefit, typically a lump-sum payment, in the event of a specified occurrence such as death. This is a type of term insurance. Investment policies are designed to facilitate the growth of collected capital by regular or single premiums. Common forms of investment policies include whole life, universal life, and variable life policies.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Insurance based products are typically limited to cash payouts with nothing more. There may be incentives built-in to the product to decrease premiums, but there are no support programs associated with the insurance products. Therefore, there is a need for a life insurance or assurance product that provides for prevention, management, recovery, and the financial impact of a catastrophic life event in the event of a significant illness, such as cancer.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In this manner, the improved system and method of the present invention accomplishes all of the forgoing objectives, thereby providing an easy solution of administering a life insurance or assurance product. A primary feature of the present invention a type of life insurance or assurance where an insurance company provides easier access to expensive and cutting edge technology which can help the policyholders live a longer and healthier life. Additionally, the method and system of the present invention democratize the cost of expensive technologies and make them affordable to the average person and creates shared-value, precision health management solutions.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The improved systems and methods create companion programs for the life, critical illness, and annuity insurance industry. The systems and methods are configured to create stand-alone &#x201c;disease-specific&#x201d; insurance policies or it can be embedded into existing insurance structures to help consumers proactively manage the risk of disease. The systems and methods are configured to help consumers navigate the clinical and financial challenges of managing and recover from diseases.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the disclosed innovation.

One of the primary purposes of omics is to study genomics. Genomics is the study of the whole genome, the complete set of DNA, of a person. The structural and functional characterization of the genome is performed using a combination of recombinant DNA, DNA sequencing and mapping methods, and bioinformatics. Functional genomics focuses on looking at the involvement of genes in shaping different biological activities. The main aim is to assess differential expressions of genes in a specific condition, such as during the development and progression of diseases, such as cancers.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Omics technologies have made it possible to study the genetic makeup of an individual leading to personalized medicines. Omics-based testing is useful for understanding the complex interactions between multiple genetic and environmental factors that occur during the pathogenesis of severe diseases, including cancers and cardiovascular diseases. Such information is particularly required to develop diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, as well as to study the clinical efficacy of specific drugs. The system <b>100</b> may be further configured to gamify &#x201c;omics literacy&#x201d; to encourage policyholders to become more aware about how their health is impacted and managed by omics technologies</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Pharmacogenomics is a field of precision medicine designed to tailor specific medical treatment to each individual person or to a group of people. Pharmacogenomics tests and evaluates how a person's DNA affects the way that individual responds to drugs. #Drugs interact with each unique body in numerous ways, depending both on how the drug is taken and where in the body the drug acts as the body needs to break a drug down and get it to the intended area.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Examples of these interactions typically include drug receptors, drug uptake, drug breakdown, and targeted drug development. Some drugs need to attach to proteins on the surface of cells called receptors to work properly. Individual DNA determines how many and what type of receptors a person has, which can affect individual responses to the drug. This has an impact on dosage.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Some drugs need to be actively taken into the tissues and cells in which they act. Individual DNA can affect uptake of certain drugs. Decreased uptake can mean that the drug does not work as well and can cause it to problematically build up in other parts of the body. Individual DNA can also affect how quickly some drugs are removed from the cells in which they act. If drugs are removed from the cell too quickly, the drugs might not have time to fully act or to act effectively.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Individual DNA can affect how quickly a body breaks down a drug. If an individual metabolizes the drug down more quickly than a typical average person, that individual metabolizes the drug faster and may require a larger dosage of the drug or a completely different drug. Conversely, if an individual breaks the drug down more slowly, they may require a lesser dosage.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Pharmacogenomic approaches to drug development are designed to target the underlying problem rather than just treating symptoms. Some diseases are caused by specific changes or mutations in a gene. The same gene can have different types of mutations, which have different effects. Some mutations may result in a protein that does not work correctly, while others may mean that the protein is not made at all. Drugs can be created and tailored based on how the mutation affects the protein, and these drugs will only work for a specific type of mutation.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The genetic testing for cancer risk that is typically ordered by a doctor involves testing for inherited genetic variants that are associated with a high to moderate increased risk of cancer and are responsible for inherited cancer susceptibility syndromes. By contrast, direct to customer (DTC) genetic testing for cancer risk often involves the analysis of common inherited genetic variants that, individually, are generally associated with only a minor increase in risk. Even when added together, all the known common variants associated with a particular cancer type account for only a small portion of a person's risk of that cancer.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Genetic tests based on these common variants have not yet been found to help patients and their care providers make health care decisions and, therefore, they are not a part of recommended clinical practice. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is a comprehensive technique for analyzing entire genomes. Genomic information has been instrumental in identifying inherited disorders, characterizing the mutations that drive cancer progression, and tracking disease outbreaks.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the system <b>100</b> comprises a server <b>110</b>.
