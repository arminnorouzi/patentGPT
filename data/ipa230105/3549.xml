For example, the transmitted magnetic field may induce electric currents within the element(s) thereof that in turn may generate at least one induced magnetic field within the measurement volume.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such effects on the transmitted magnetic field need to be accounted for when, for example, using magnetic trackers to track a position and orientation of objects within the measurement volume. In order to account for the effects of such element(s) on the transmitted magnetic field, location sensors are typically attached to the element(s) and/or users are requested to define the spatial arrangement, the position and orientation and/or the state of such elements. However, such approaches require additional processing and/or may be inaccurate. Some other procedures of determining a configuration of the measurement volume may utilize optical and/or intertidal sensors. However, optical sensors require constant line of sight to the elements of the measurement volume while inertial sensors may have significant drifting over time.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some aspects of the present invention may provide a system for determining a configuration of a measurement volume, the system may include: at least one transmitter adapted to be positioned within the measurement volume at corresponding at least one transmitter position and adapted to generate a transmitted magnetic field within the measurement volume;

Some other aspects of the present invention may further provide systems and methods for determining a relative position and orientation of two elements.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0130">The determination of the configuration of the measurement volume by the disclosed systems and methods may be based on a magnetic field measured within the measurement volume by one or more receivers located therein and based on reference configuration datasets, while eliminating a need in connecting/attaching sensors to elements or objects within the measurement volume (e.g., as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>H</figref>).</p><p id="p-0133" num="0131">The disclosed systems and methods are not limited to specific locations of transmitters and receivers within the measurement volume. This in contrast to, for example, other available systems that typically utilize optical means (and thus require direct line of sight to the elements/objects in the measurement volume) or inertial means (and thus suffer from drifting) for determining the configuration of the measurement volume.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0132">As the disclosed systems and methods do not require direct contact or line of sight to the elements or objects within the measurement volume, the systems and methods may be capable of determining configurations that cannot be observable by an external user. For example, disconnection within an electrical circuit in one of the elements of the measurement volume may, for example, affect the magnetic field within the measurement volume and thus may be detected by the system.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0133">Furthermore, such configurations that cannot be observable by an external user may be detectable even if there are no specific reference configuration datasets for the configurations thereof. For example, the system may detect that there is no reference configuration dataset for a particular configuration of the measurement volume and generate a respective notification. Such notification may be indicative of, for example, a failure in one or more elements of the measurement volume. In this manner, the disclosed systems and methods may be capable of improving safety and enhancing monitoring of the measurement volume and the elements thereof.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0134">Aspects of the present invention are described above with reference to flowchart illustrations and/or portion diagrams of methods, apparatus (systems) and computer program products according to embodiments of the invention. It will be understood that each portion of the flowchart illustrations and/or portion diagrams, and combinations of portions in the flowchart illustrations and/or portion diagrams, can be implemented by computer program instructions. These computer program instructions can be provided to a processor of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus, create means for implementing the functions/acts specified in the flowchart and/or portion diagram or portions thereof.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0135">These computer program instructions can also be stored in a computer readable medium that can direct a computer, other programmable data processing apparatus, or other devices to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer readable medium produce an article of manufacture including instructions which implement the function/act specified in the flowchart and/or portion diagram portion or portions thereof. The computer program instructions can also be loaded onto a computer, other programmable data processing apparatus, or other devices to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer, other programmable apparatus or other devices to produce a computer implemented process such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide processes for implementing the functions/acts specified in the flowchart and/or portion diagram portion or portions thereof.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0136">The aforementioned flowchart and diagrams illustrate the architecture, functionality, and operation of possible implementations of systems, methods and computer program products according to various embodiments of the present invention. In this regard, each portion in the flowchart or portion diagrams can represent a module, segment, or portion of code, which includes one or more executable instructions for implementing the specified logical function(s). It should also be noted that, in some alternative implementations, the functions noted in the portion can occur out of the order noted in the figures. For example, two portions shown in succession can, in fact, be executed substantially concurrently, or the portions can sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality involved. It will also be noted that each portion of the portion diagrams and/or flowchart illustration, and combinations of portions in the portion diagrams and/or flowchart illustration, can be implemented by special purpose hardware-based systems that perform the specified functions or acts, or combinations of special purpose hardware and computer instructions.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0137">In the above description, an embodiment is an example or implementation of the invention.
