non-transitory computer readable media configured for enabling content sharing between users of wearable extended reality appliances are provided. In one implementation, the computer readable medium may be configured to contain instructions to cause at least one processor to establish a link between a first wearable extended reality appliance and a second wearable extended reality appliance. The first wearable extended reality appliance may display first virtual content. The second wearable extended reality appliance may obtain a command to display first virtual content via the second wearable extended reality appliance, and in response, this content may be transmitted and displayed via the second extended reality appliance. Additionally, the first wearable extended reality appliance may receive second virtual content from the second wearable extended reality appliance, and display said second virtual content via the first wearable extended reality appliance.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="145.63mm" wi="136.57mm"

Background Information</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For many years, PC users were faced with a productivity dilemma: either to limit their mobility (when selecting a desktop computer) or to limit their screen size (when selecting a laptop computer). One partial solution to this dilemma is using a docking station. A docking station is an interface device for connecting a laptop computer with other devices. By plugging the laptop computer into the docking station, laptop users can enjoy the increased visibility provided by a larger monitor. But because the large monitor is stationary, the mobility of the user&#x2014;while improved&#x2014;is still limited. For example, even laptop users with docking stations do not have the freedom of using two 32&#x2033; screens anywhere they want.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some of the disclosed embodiments are directed to providing a new approach for solving the productivity dilemma, one that uses extended reality (XR) to provide a mobile environment that enables users to experience the comfort of a stationary workspace anywhere they want by providing virtual desktop-like screens.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments consistent with the present disclosure provide systems, methods, and devices for providing and supporting productivity applications using an extended reality environment.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Some disclosed embodiments may include systems, methods and non-transitory computer readable media for enabling content sharing between users of wearable extended reality appliances.

In some examples, analyzing the image data may include calculating at least one convolution of at least a portion of the image data, and using the calculated at least one convolution to calculate at least one resulting value and/or to make determinations, identifications, recognitions, classifications, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0217">Consistent with other aspects of the disclosure, a processing device of system <b>200</b> may analyze image data in order to implement any of the methods disclosed herein. In some embodiments, analyzing the image may comprise analyzing the image data and/or the preprocessed image data using one or more rules, functions, procedures, artificial neural networks, object detection algorithms, face detection algorithms, visual event detection algorithms, action detection algorithms, motion detection algorithms, background subtraction algorithms, inference models, and so forth. Some non-limiting examples of such inference models may include: an inference model preprogrammed manually; a classification model; a regression model; a result of training algorithms, such as machine learning algorithms and/or deep learning algorithms, on training examples, where the training examples may include examples of data instances, and in some cases, a data instance may be labeled with a corresponding desired label and/or result, and more. In some embodiments, analyzing image data (for example by the methods, steps and modules described herein) may comprise analyzing pixels, voxels, point cloud, range data, etc. included in the image data.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0218">A convolution may include a convolution of any dimension. A one-dimensional convolution is a function that transforms an original sequence of numbers to a transformed sequence of numbers. The one-dimensional convolution may be defined by a sequence of scalars. Each particular value in the transformed sequence of numbers may be determined by calculating a linear combination of values in a subsequence of the original sequence of numbers corresponding to the particular value. A result value of a calculated convolution may include any value in the transformed sequence of numbers. Likewise, an n-dimensional convolution is a function that transforms an original n-dimensional array to a transformed array. The n-dimensional convolution may be defined by an n-dimensional array of scalars (known as the kernel of the n-dimensional convolution). Each particular value in the transformed array may be determined by calculating a linear combination of values in an n-dimensional region of the original array corresponding to the particular value. A result value of a calculated convolution may include any value in the transformed array. In some examples, an image may comprise one or more components (such as color components, depth component, etc.), and each component may include a two-dimensional array of pixel values. In one example, calculating a convolution of an image may include calculating a two-dimensional convolution on one or more components of the image. In another example, calculating a convolution of an image may include stacking arrays from different components to create a three-dimensional array, and calculating a three-dimensional convolution on the resulting three-dimensional array. In some examples, a video may comprise one or more components (such as color components, depth component, etc.), and each component may include a three-dimensional array of pixel values (with two spatial axes and one temporal axis). In one example, calculating a convolution of a video may include calculating a three-dimensional convolution on one or more components of the video. In another example, calculating a convolution of a video may include stacking arrays from different components to create a four-dimensional array, and calculating a four-dimensional convolution on the resulting four-dimensional array.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0219">Some disclosed embodiments may include systems, methods, and non-transitory computer readable media configured for enabling content sharing between users of wearable extended reality appliances. Content sharing may involve the presentation by one entity to another of text, images, programs, or any other information. The content may be shared between users of wearable extended reality appliances, so that one entity wearing an appliance may view or otherwise have access to content available via the wearable extended reality appliance of another. Content sharing may be enabled in many different ways. In some embodiments, enabling may occur through a link between two extended reality appliances. In one example, the link may include a direct and/or in-direct communication link between the two extended reality appliances. In another example, a system (such as a centralized system) may be in communication with each one of the two extended reality appliances, for example to provide each one of the two extended reality appliances content for presentation, to receive location and/or orientation information associated with the extended reality appliances, and/or any other information pertaining to presenting content. The link may include a linkage in a data-structure or a database of the system or maintained by the system. In one non-limiting example, a detected proximity of two entities may trigger an automatic or selectable sharing of content. In other embodiments, one entity may select content for sharing either with a group or an individual or may tie content to a physical or virtual location enabling anyone accessing that location to view the content. In some embodiments, content sharing may be enabled through permissions, where viewing of shared content is only enabled for entities with appropriate authority. In yet other embodiments, rules may define with whom content may be shared. In further exemplary embodiments, sharing may be enabled via a request sent from one appliance to another. Content sharing may be initiated in some embodiments as the result of signals from one or more sensors. For example, one or more image sensors might detect a gesture indicative of an intent to share content. Or a proximity sensor may trigger an ability to share when two wearable extended reality appliances are in proximity to each other. There are many different ways in which content sharing may be enabled consistent with this disclosure, and this disclosure is not limited to any particular one.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0220">Some disclosed embodiments may include computer readable media containing instructions that when executed by at least one processor cause the at least one processor to establish a link between a first wearable extended reality appliance and a second wearable extended reality appliance. In some embodiments, establishing a link may refer to any means of communicating between the first wearable extended reality appliance and the second extended wearable reality appliance. In some embodiments, there may be a formal protocol that governs how the first wearable extended reality appliance and the second wearable extended reality appliance transmit and receive data. Such protocols may include but are not limited to Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocols (TCP/IP), Bluetooth, Infrared, Near Field Communication, Ultra-Wide Band, WiFi, Zig-Bee, short-range communication protocol, and/or long-range communication protocol. Such means of communication between the first wearable extended reality appliance and the second wearable extended reality appliance may include, but are not limited to, Local Area Network (LAN), Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), Virtual Private Network (VPN), an indirect communication link, and/or by a directed communication link. The processor may cause the first wearable extended reality appliance to initiate communication with a second wearable extended reality appliance via one or more of the above-identified protocols. In some examples, establishing a link may refer to linkage in a data-structure and/or a database, for example in system coordinating an extended reality environment, in a system that communicates with both the first and the second wearable extended reality appliances, and/or in a system that provides content for presentation for both the first and the second wearable extended reality appliance.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0221">Some disclosed embodiments may involve establishing the link (for example, the communication link, the link in the data-structure and/or a database) and enabling information exchange when the first wearable extended reality appliance is detected in proximity to the second wearable extended reality appliance. Such instructions may be configured based on a threshold distance, and this threshold distance may vary between users of the extended reality appliance. For example, the first wearable extended reality appliance user may prefer to initiate a link with the second wearable extended reality appliance at a shorter threshold distance, for instance one or two meters, when a particular type of user is around, such as a family member. By contrast, the same first wearable extended reality appliance user may prefer to initiate a link with the second wearable extended reality appliance at a longer threshold distance in order to facilitate communication with a colleague or team member. The user may be free to update threshold distance settings depending on the user's preference.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0222">In some examples, the communication link between the wearable extended reality appliances may be through intermediate devices. Intermediate devices may include any networking device positioned between a Remote Access Server (RAS) and a RAS client. Intermediate devices may aid in providing connectivity between two separate wearable extended reality appliances. An intermediate device may provide an extra layer of security before a communication link between two wearable extended reality appliances is established. For example, when security protocols are not satisfied, the intermediate device may prevent establishment of a connection between the two extended reality appliances.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0223">Some disclosed embodiments may involve presenting through the first wearable extended reality appliance first virtual content. The virtual content may take on a variety of different forms and may include documents, photos, videos, virtual characters, and any other sharable media that can be transmitted wirelessly. In some examples, the virtual content may be presented as part of an extended reality environment. In other examples, virtual content may be displayed on a physical screen, such as a TV, tablet, laptop, or smartphone, or it may be displayed on a virtual screen, such as through one or more extended reality appliances.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0224">Some disclosed embodiments may include obtaining a first command to display the first virtual content via the second wearable extended reality appliance. A first command may refer to a signal received from the at least one processor to display virtual content via the second wearable extended reality appliance. In another example, the first command may refer to a command obtained from a user, and/or in response to an action of the user. The non-transitory computer readable medium may be configured to share content and may contain instructions for the at least one processor to send a signal to the first wearable extended reality appliance to display virtual content.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0225">In some disclosed embodiments, obtaining the first command to present virtual content may include a sharing intent in data captured by the first wearable extended reality appliance. A sharing intent may refer to a user's desire to present virtual content to another user or to exchange virtual content with another user. In one example, a machine learning model may be trained using training examples to identify sharing intent by analyzing captured data. An example of such a training example may include sample captured data, together with a label indicating whether the sample capture data corresponds to a sharing intent and/or a parameter of the sharing intent (for example, an intent to share a particular content, an intent to share content presented in a particular area, an intent to share content with a particular entity, and/or an intent to share content in a particular way). The trained machine learning model may be used to analyze the data captured by the first wearable extended reality appliance and identify the sharing intent and/or parameters of the sharing intent. For example, a user's sharing intent may be identified in captured image data. Some non-limiting examples of such captured image data may include image data (such as one or more images and/or one or more videos) captured using an image sensor included in the first wearable extended reality appliance, included in the second wearable extended reality appliance, included in a device in an environment of the first and the second wearable extended reality appliances (the device may differ from the first and the second wearable extended reality appliances, such as another wearable extended reality appliance, a stationary camera mounted in a room, and/or any other device that may capture image or video data). A user's sharing intent may be identified by analyzing the image data to detect movement or a change of position or orientation of an object in the captured image data. For example, a user's sharing intent may be identified by detecting a movement of the user's hand (e.g., user is waving their hand), by using a visual gesture recognition algorithm to analyze the image data. In another example, a user's sharing intent may be identified by detecting that a user has moved a piece of hardware in the one or more captured images, for example using a visual object tracking algorithm. Additionally, such a sharing intent may be captured if a user moves a finger, nods their head, touches their extended reality appliance, or otherwise gestures to another user that he or she wishes to share content. In some examples, a machine learning model may be trained using training examples to identify sharing intent by analyzing images and/or videos. An example of such training example may include a sample image and/or a sample video, together with a label indicating whether the sample image and/or sample video corresponds to a sharing intent and/or a parameter of the sharing intent (for example, an intent to share a particular content, an intent to share content presented in a particular area, an intent to share content with a particular entity, an intent to share content in a particular way, and/or intent to share content at a particular time). The trained machine learning model may be used to analyze the captured image data and identify the sharing intent and/or parameters of the sharing intent. In some examples, a convolution of at least part of the image data may be calculated to obtain a result value of the calculated convolution. In one example, in response to a first result value of the calculated convolution, a sharing intent of the first virtual content may be identified, and in response to a second result value of the calculated convolution, no sharing intent of the first virtual content may be identified. In another example, in response to a first result value of the calculated convolution, a sharing intent of one virtual content may be identified, and in response to a second result value of the calculated convolution, a sharing intent of another virtual content may be identified.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0226">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a sharing intent of first extended reality appliance user <b>610</b> via a sharing movement <b>612</b>. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, hand waving by first user <b>610</b> reflects an intent to share virtual content <b>614</b> with second extended reality appliance user <b>616</b>.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0227">Hardware that may be used to capture a user's sharing intent may include a pointer, keyboard, mouse, joystick, or any other object designed to facilitate sharing data. Such a sharing intent may be captured when a user moves the hardware, such as a mouse or a joystick, towards another user. In some embodiments, a user's sharing intent may also be determined when the user waves a wand, presses a button on a keyboard, or otherwise gestures with respect to another user. In some embodiments, identification of sharing intent based on captured data from hardware may be configured based on a user's preference, and may not be limited to moving the hardware towards a second user.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0228">A user's preference refers to how a particular wearable extended reality appliance user chooses to configure their appliance to share virtual content. For example, one user may prefer to share virtual content via a hand movement, whereas another user may prefer to share content via a pointer or joystick. Alternatively, users may be permitted to define gesture preferences for sharing content.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0229">In some embodiments, the sharing intent may also be identified in captured voice data. For example, the captured voice data may include audio data captured using an audio sensor included in the first wearable extended reality appliance, using an audio sensor included in the second wearable extended reality appliance, and/or using an audio sensor included in another device. In one example, a user may verbally initiate sharing through a voice command. The command may include, but is not limited to, for example, &#x201c;share content,&#x201d; &#x201c;transmit content,&#x201d; &#x201c;display content,&#x201d; &#x201c;present content,&#x201d; or any other word combination that may be construed as a request to share content with another user. Additionally, the verbal command may name a second user specifically, and may take the form of, for example, &#x201c;share content with User X.&#x201d; Verbal commands may also be configured based on a user's preference. In one example, the captured voice data may be analyzing using a speech recognition algorithm to identify voice commands corresponding to the sharing intent and/or parameters of the sharing intent.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0230">Each unique wearable extended reality appliance user's preferences, as described above, may be stored in the non-transitory computer readable medium enabled for control of content sharing.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0231">In some embodiments, the sharing intent may be identified in captured positioning data. Such positioning data may be captured based on the first wearable extended reality appliance user's position and/or orientation, based on position and/or orientation of the first wearable extended reality appliance, and/or based on position and/or orientation of a device associated the first wearable extended reality appliance (for example, of another device used by a user of the first wearable extended reality appliance, such as a keyboard, a glove, and/or a pointing device). For example, a sharing intent may be identified when a user positions their body and wearable extended reality appliance closer to another user's. By way of another example, the sharing intent may be identified when a user stands from a sitting position, leans over to another user, or otherwise positions their body or extended reality appliance in such a way as to indicate a sharing intent. Sharing intent based on positioning data may also be configured based on a user's preference. In one example, the position and/or orientation may be determined by analyzing data captured using a sensor included the first wearable extended reality appliance and/or in a different device, such as a positioning sensor (such as an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and/or a GPS sensor), and/or an image sensor (for example by analyzing the image data captured using the image sensor using ego-motion algorithms, and/or using visual object tracking algorithms).</p><p id="p-0233" num="0232">In some embodiments, obtaining the first command may include identifying a sharing intent associated with an action performed in an extended reality environment (such as a virtual reality environment, an augmented reality environment, and/or a mixed reality environment). As described in the below paragraphs, an action performed in an extended reality environment may include sharing content via a sharing bubble or a sharing ring, or by automatically sharing content with another wearable extended reality appliance user upon establishing a link between the two or more wearable extended reality appliances.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0233">In some embodiments, identifying the sharing intent may include determining that a first user of the first wearable extended reality appliance changed an orientation of a virtual screen presenting the first virtual content towards a second user of the second wearable extended reality appliance. In one example, determining that a first user of the first wearable extended reality appliance changed an orientation of the virtual screen towards a second user may include determining that the virtual screen is oriented towards the second user, and determining that the virtual screen became oriented towards the second user as a result of an action of the first user (and not, for example, as a result of a movement of the second user). In one example, determining whether the virtual screen became oriented towards the second user as a result of an action of the first user may be based on an analysis of movements of the second user and/or movements of the virtual screen and/or inputs leading to the movements of the virtual screen. For example, at least one of a system coordinating an extended reality environment, a system that communicates with both the first and the second wearable extended reality appliances, a system that provides content for presentation for both the first and the second wearable extended reality appliance, or the first wearable extended reality appliance may determine that an orientation of the virtual screen changed towards the second user. Based on the first wearable extended reality appliance user's preference, this may manifest a sharing intent with the second user. In some examples, a first angle may be an angle between a surface corresponding to the virtual screen and a direction associated with a user of the first wearable extended reality appliance, a second angle may be an angle between a surface corresponding to the virtual screen and a direction associated with a user of the second wearable extended reality appliance, and the determination that the orientation of the virtual screen presenting the first virtual content changed towards the second user of the second wearable extended reality may be based on the first angle and the second angle. Some non-limiting examples of such direction associated with a user may include a direction of a head of the user, a direction of a body of the user, a direction of a gaze and/or an eye of the user, a fixation line direction of the user, a line of sight direction of the user, a visual axis direction of the user, a pupillary axis direction of the user, an optical axis direction of the user, and/or a direction associated with an orientation of the wearable extended reality appliance of the user. In one example, a function of the first angle and the second angle may be calculated and compared with a threshold to determine whether the orientation of the virtual screen presenting the first virtual content changed towards the second user. In another example, a machine learning model may be trained using training examples to determine whether orientations of virtual screens are changed towards users based on angles and/or distances. An example of such training example may include sample angles of a sample virtual screen with respect to sample users and/or sample distances of the sample virtual screen from the sample users, together with a label indicating whether the sample virtual screen is oriented towards each one of the samples users. The trained machine learning model may be used to analyze the first angle, the second angle, and possibly the distances of the users from the virtual screen, to determine that the virtual screen is oriented towards the second user.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0234">Furthermore, the user of the second wearable extended reality appliance may be located within proximity, whether a physical threshold distance or virtual proximity, of the virtual screen. In one example, the sharing intent may be determined if a user of the first wearable extended reality appliance leans or nods towards the user of the second wearable extended reality appliance, such that the change in orientation may be captured. The user of the second wearable extended reality appliance may also be a representation of the user, such as an avatar. Thus, a first user may share content based on a change in orientation even if the second user was not physically located next to the first user.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0235">In some embodiments, identifying the sharing intent may include determining that a first user of the first wearable extended reality appliance moved the first virtual content towards a virtual sharing space surrounding a second user of the second wearable extended reality appliance. In one example, the virtual sharing space surrounding a second user may be referred to as a sharing bubble. For example, the at least one processor may be configured to detect an action that may take the form of a gesture, a dragging of the first virtual content, or other physical movements made by the first user. The at least one processor may be configured to determine movement of a first virtual content towards a virtual sharing space based on the detected gesture, dragging, or other physical movement. This sharing action may also be based on people's natural movement to lean towards other people with whom they wish to share content. Such movements may be detected by one or more sensors within at least one extended reality appliance, or via a sensor associated with another device.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0236">The virtual sharing space in the above embodiment, known as a sharing bubble, may be determined automatically in a myriad of different ways. For example, the virtual sharing space may be determined based on a position and/or a movement of the second user and/or the second wearable extended reality appliance. For example, the virtual sharing space may include a space within a selected distance from the second user and/or the second wearable extended reality appliance. In this embodiment, when a first user is within a certain distance of a second user, virtual content may be automatically shared with the second user. In another example, the sharing bubble may be elongated in the direction of the movement. In yet another example, the sharing bubble may be larger in horizontal directions than in vertical directions.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0237">The sharing bubble may be a space around a user. This space may be defined in a variety of different ways. In some embodiments, the size and/or orientation of a bubble surrounding one or more users may be determined by the number of users, the positions of the user, the positions of other people not belonging to the bubble, the orientations of the users, the orientations of other people not belonging to the bubble, the identities of the users, the identities of the users not belonging to the bubble, the positions of inanimate objects in the vicinity of the users, the types of the inanimate objects in the vicinity of the users, the status of the inanimate objects in the vicinity of the users, motion patterns of the users, motion patterns of other people not belonging to the bubble, preferences of the users, past behavior of the users, gestures of the users, and/or other factors regarding proximity of users to one another. In one example, a topological function of one of more of these parameters may define the space of the sharing bubble.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0238">When the virtual sharing bubbles of two or more users collide, the two or more users may be automatically offered an opportunity to create a new shared bubble in which virtual content items may be shared among the extended realities of the two or more users. The at least one processor may be configured to determine that there is an overlap between virtual sharing bubbles, and in response the at least one processor may suggest to the users of the overlapping bubbles that virtual content may be shared between those users. A user's wearable extended reality appliance may also be configured to share content automatically upon overlapping with another user's bubble.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0239">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> illustrates a pair of users <b>714</b> and <b>716</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, first wearable extended reality appliance user <b>714</b> may have an associated virtual sharing bubble <b>710</b> and second wearable extended reality appliance user <b>716</b> may have an associated virtual sharing bubble <b>718</b>. Virtual sharing bubble <b>710</b> of first wearable extended reality appliance user <b>714</b> may come into contact with and overlap with virtual sharing bubble <b>718</b> of second wearable extended reality appliance user <b>716</b> when, for example, first wearable extended reality appliance user <b>714</b> moves towards a second user <b>716</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> illustrates a condition in which virtual sharing bubble <b>710</b> overlaps with virtual sharing bubble <b>718</b> via overlapping region <b>720</b>. Virtual content <b>712</b> may be automatically shared with second wearable extended reality appliance user <b>716</b> when the sharing bubbles <b>710</b> and <b>718</b> overlap in, for example, overlapping region <b>720</b>, and/or when the volume of overlapping region <b>720</b> is above a selected volume threshold. In one example, the volume threshold may be selected by configuration, by a user, as a function of a volume of virtual sharing bubble <b>710</b> and/or of a volume of virtual sharing bubble <b>718</b>, of the users <b>714</b>, <b>716</b>, and/or of the virtual content <b>712</b>.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0240">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref> illustrate a combined virtual sharing bubble <b>810</b> after the sharing bubbles from first extended reality appliance user <b>812</b> and second extended reality appliance user <b>816</b> overlap, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>. While virtual content <b>814</b> may be automatically shared when these virtual sharing bubbles overlap, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>, virtual content <b>814</b> may also be shared automatically when a first user <b>812</b> leans towards a second user <b>816</b> (for example, when first user <b>812</b> leans towards second user <b>816</b> when the virtual sharing bubbles overlap). The combined sharing bubble <b>810</b> may reduce in size the closer users get to one another.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0241">The virtual sharing space may also be determined based on a usage mode of the second wearable extended reality appliance, the user, the second wearable extended reality appliance, and/or objects surrounding the second wearable extended reality appliance. For example, a user may configure the extended reality appliance to automatically share content when that user enters a room, passes a second user's desk, or walks within proximity of any other object in a room. Additionally, a usage mode may be configured to automatically share content with some users, and to not share the content with others.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0242">A usage mode may refer to the different settings a user configures their extended reality system (for example, their wearable extended reality appliance) based on the different tasks they wish to accomplish. For example, one usage mode may apply only to activities performed in the workplace. In this example, certain types of content, including documents and emails, may be shared at a certain distance between two wearable extended reality appliance users. In another example, a usage mode may apply only to activities performed at home. A user may wish to share a video, for example, but not any documents or emails.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0243">In some embodiments, identifying the sharing intent may also include determining that a first user of the first wearable extended reality appliance moved the first virtual content towards a defined, sharing space. For example, additionally or alternatively to automatically sharing content when two extended reality appliance users move towards each other, a user may create a sharing space based on predefined parameters, such as length, width, height, and/or location in a room. Instead of sharing content when two users' virtual sharing bubbles overlap, the sharing intent may be determined when users move content towards and/or into such a predefined space. In contrast with the sharing bubble that encompasses each user and has been described above, this sharing intent may be referred to as a sharing ring, as its characteristics are predefined by an extended reality appliance user. Sharing rings may be configured based on a user's preferences. In particular, the location and/or size of a sharing ring may be configured by each user of a wearable extended reality appliance.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0244">Some non-limiting examples of such a virtual sharing space may include a ring, a rectangle, a cube, a sphere, a convex shape, a non-convex shape, a smooth shape, an irregular shape, or any other well-defined shape. In some examples, the virtual sharing space may be anchored to a physical location, may be anchored to a physical object, may be created by a user, or may be created based on any other predefined characteristic. A virtual sharing space (such as a sharing ring) may have any two-dimensional or three-dimensional shape, and are not limited to rings. In one example, a virtual sharing space (such as a sharing ring) may be anchored to an object and configured to move with the object. For example, a virtual sharing space may be anchored to a keyboard, an input device, an output device, a chair or a desk associated with a particular user, and moving virtual content into that virtual sharing space may cause the virtual content to be shared with the particular user. In an example of a desk, the virtual sharing space may correspond to at least part of an area of a top surface of the desk. In an example of a chair, the virtual sharing space may correspond to a three-dimensional shape encompassing at least part of the chair. In an example of a keyboard, the keyboard may be placed on a desk, and the virtual sharing space may correspond to at least part of an area of a top surface of the desk, for example a part of the area of the top surface of the desk in a vicinity of the keyboard. Sharing content may also be based on a predefined privacy setting, which may be configured by an extended reality appliance user. In some examples, content may be shared between two users, may be shared with the public, may be shared among a plurality of users, or may include any other combination of public and private sharing. The type and level of sharing and/or the identity of the users that may access the virtual content may be determined based on the virtual sharing space, the content, the user, or any other factors based on the where the user is located. In the sharing space, movement of the virtual content may be a result of an action of a user of the first wearable extended reality appliance. Such an action may take the form of, for example, a gesture, a dragging of the first virtual content, or any other physical movement or movement involving the first virtual content.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0245">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates a sharing ring <b>914</b>, which may be a predefined virtual sharing space created by a first wearable extended reality appliance user <b>910</b>, a virtual sharing space created by a user of another wearable extended reality appliance (such as one of users <b>918</b> or a user of a different wearable extended reality appliance), a virtual sharing space created by a user not using a wearable extended reality appliance, and/or an automatically generated virtual sharing space. First user <b>910</b> may place virtual content <b>912</b> in a predefined area <b>914</b> such that virtual content <b>912</b>, previously only visible to the first wearable extended reality appliance user <b>910</b>, becomes shared content <b>916</b> that may be visible to other extended reality appliance users <b>918</b>.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0246">In some examples, virtual content items may be shared based on people's natural movement and/or based on a user moving a virtual display screen and placing it in a location which is visible to other users or participants. For example, it may be recognized that there is a hand movement or a gesture, and in response a virtual content item (such as a virtual display screen) may be shared with the relevant users. In some embodiments, all participants may see the virtual display screen docked in the same location. In some embodiments, a virtual content item may be simultaneously viewed in a public region by a plurality of participants and in private mode as an additional/duplicate virtual display screen of a particular user, docked to where the users choose. For example, a user may prefer to see a virtual content item from a closer distance, especially if it includes text, may prefer to add private overlay to the virtual content item, or any other configurations. In one example, virtual content items with lower levels of privacy may be shared without need of user approval. In one example, public content items may be viewed in shared and private modes, and shared content may be viewed in private mode.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0247">In some embodiments, for example, the sharing of virtual content may be triggered when a first user and a second user's sharing bubble overlap, or when a user shares content in a predefined area, i.e., a sharing ring, or by any other mean discussed herein. However, before virtual content between a first wearable extended reality appliance and a second wearable extended reality appliance may be shared, a non-transitory computer readable medium may establish a link between the two appliances. In some embodiments, virtual content may be automatically shared via a virtual sharing space when the link between the first wearable extended reality appliance and the second extended reality appliance is established. A processor may automatically generate the sharing of virtual content when the first and second wearable extended reality appliances are linked so as to communicate with each other. The shared virtual content may be selected based on the preference of the users of the first and/or second extended reality appliances. Whether a sharing is created immediately after establishing a link may be based on a user's preference, and the extended reality appliance may be configured for different uses.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0248">For example, one user may configure their wearable extended reality appliance or system to automatically share content in the workplace. In this example, the appliance may be configured to share content at a longer distance, such as when a coworker is in view, and the content may be limited to documents and emails. In another example, a user may configure their wearable extended reality appliance or system to automatically share content at home. In this example, the appliance may be configured to only automatically share content at a shorter distance, such as when a family member is directly next to the user. Such virtual content may be limited to videos and music and may not include documents or emails.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0249">In some embodiments, a visualization of the virtual sharing space may be presented by each of the first wearable extended reality appliance and the second wearable extended reality appliance. For example, on a typical computer screen, one can share a document by dragging and dropping files between different folders, such as a Dropbox folder. In contrast, in some embodiments of the disclosure, sharing virtual objects does not have to be limited to folders. Rather, virtual objects may be shared via a virtual box, a virtual window, or otherwise marked area. A virtual box may refer to a space on a virtual display presented by the first or second wearable extended reality appliance where multiple users may share virtual content. This sharing act may also take place in the three-dimensional space virtual space, and the act of sharing virtual objects between such a folder, a virtual box, or a window may be visible to users of both the first and second wearable extended reality appliances. In some examples, the visualization of the virtual sharing space may include a visual indication of a border of the virtual sharing space, a visual indication of a volume of the virtual sharing space, and/or a visual indication of a center of the virtual sharing space. Some non-limiting examples of such visual indicators may include virtual colorization of a surface or a volume, virtually highlighting a surface or a volume, and/or one or more virtual visual symbols at selected locations. When a user virtually moves virtual content towards and/or into the visualized virtual sharing space, a sharing of the moved virtual content may be triggered. For example, the user may move the virtual content using gestures, using a computer pointing device, using textual inputs, and/or using voice commands.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0250">In some embodiments, a location of the virtual sharing space may be determined based on a location of a physical object in an environment of the first wearable extended reality appliance. For example, certain physical objects such as whiteboards or other display surfaces may be linked to a virtual sharing space such that anyone with permissions and in the vicinity of that object may have access to shared content. In some embodiments, an extended reality appliance user may select an object for defining a virtual sharing space. For example, a piece of artwork on a wall or a physical object on a table may be selected as a basis for a virtual sharing space, and upon detection of the selected object, a virtual display screen may appear in a region adjacent the selected object.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0251">By way of example. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> illustrates a sharing bubble, wherein the second wearable extended reality appliance <b>1012</b> receives first virtual content <b>1014</b> from the second wearable extended reality appliance <b>1010</b> via sharing region <b>1016</b>. Such virtual content may also be shared via a sharing ring as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0252">In another example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref> illustrates presenting received virtual content. Here, the second wearable extended reality appliance <b>1012</b> presents first virtual content <b>1014</b> received from the first wearable extended reality appliance <b>1010</b>. The virtual content may be presented via the wearable extended reality appliance on a screen such as a tablet or TV, via the appliance itself, or any other physical object, as represented by the square in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0253">Some embodiments may provide an indicator via the first wearable extended reality appliance upon the first virtual content being presented via the second wearable extended reality appliance. An indicator may refer to any sort of mark, annotation, or signal that informs a user that his or her content is being displayed on another's extended reality appliance. Additionally, the indicator may be demonstrative of whether the content is privately shared, publicly shared, shared with a particular individual (and/or the identity of the particular individual), shared with a particular group (and/or the identity of the particular group), and other public or private sharing options. As another example, the indicator may inform whether a user of the second wearable extended reality appliance has included annotations or other comments on the first virtual content, or has edited or transformed the first virtual content. In one example, the indicator provided via the first wearable extended reality appliance may be an audible indicator. In another example, the indicator provided via the first wearable extended reality appliance may be a visual indicator. For example, the visual indicator may be present on or in conjunction with the first virtual content. In another example, the visual indicator may include a visual modification to a presentation of the first virtual content.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0254">There are many ways in which virtual content may be shared between wearable extended reality appliance users. Content may be shared via a sharing bubble or a sharing ring. A first wearable extended reality appliance user may share content, via a sharing bubble or sharing ring, with a second wearable extended reality appliance user. In the above embodiments, the second wearable extended reality appliance user may display content received from the first user. This content may be displayed in a myriad of ways, whether it be through the second user's extended reality appliance, via a screen such as a tablet or TV, a flat surface such as a wall, window, or chalkboard, and/or any other physical object that a user may designate to present virtual content. For example, the second wearable extended reality appliance, after receiving virtual content from the first user, may display the content via the second appliance, and/or via a TV or whiteboard.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0255">In some embodiments, the first virtual content may be associated with at least one private virtual object and at least one public virtual object, and causing the virtual content to be transmitted for display by the second wearable extended reality appliance may include transmitting the at least one public virtual object and avoiding transmission of the at least one private virtual object. As described herein, a virtual object may refer to a virtual display screen, to virtual content items, to virtual two-dimensional objects, to virtual three-dimensional objects, documents, media items, photos, videos, virtual characters, user-generated content, and/or components of the listed objects (e.g., a volume or brightness adjustment bar). Furthermore, a public virtual object may include virtual object that may be shared for viewing by other wearable extended reality appliance users and that may not be subject to any restrictions on sharing with other users. By contrast, a private virtual object may include virtual content that a wearable extended reality appliance user does not wish and/or is not allowed to share with any other user or with any other user that is not part of a predefined group. In some examples, a user may configure which virtual objects are public and which virtual objects are private, or may configure different privacy levels to different virtual objects. In other example, it may be determined automatically whether a virtual object is private or public, for example based on an analysis of visual and/or non-visual characteristics of the virtual object.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0256">In the above embodiments, a user may specify that some or all portions of a virtual content may not be shared with another user. For example, if when the virtual content is visualized as a screen, the screen may have both a public and a private window. The public and private window each may contain virtual object. Thus, in some disclosed embodiments, virtual content may be displayed with only the public virtual object being visible to the second wearable extended reality appliance user, with the private virtual content remaining hidden. Virtual content, meant to be shared between wearable extended reality appliance users, may consist of various virtual objects, some private and some public.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0257">By way of example, virtual content may include a table or graph illustrating financial information associated with a user and the user may not wish to share the financial information with other users. The user may designate the financial information in the virtual content as a private virtual object thus preventing other users from being able to see that virtual content. In another example, virtual content may include a document with confidential exhibits. The user may designate the exhibits as a private virtual object, thus preventing other users from being able to see that virtual object.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0258">In some embodiments, virtual content items may be shared between same levels of privacy without need for user's approval. Levels of privacy may refer to which virtual content items may be or is shared with which specific wearable extended reality appliance users. Levels of privacy may be established by dividing the virtual content itself of other users one or more groups with each group being allowed to visualize some or all of the virtual content. The number of levels of privacy may be configured based on the user's preferences. For example, some of the virtual content may be designated as content that may be shared with all other users. This may qualify as a low level of privacy. In another example, a portion of the virtual content may be designated as content that may be shared with users who may be related to a user sharing the virtual content. The relationship may be based on family relationships or professional relationships. For example, a user may designate a portion of or all of a virtual content as content that may be shared only with immediate family members (e.g., spouse, children, or parents) or with users in a particular professional group (e.g., an office team or department). This may qualify as a medium level of privacy. As another example, a user may designate some or all of a virtual content as content that may be viewed only by the user and by no one else. This may qualify as a high level of privacy. Although only three levels of privacy (e.g., low, medium, high) have been discussed in this specification, the present disclosure is not so limiting, and it is contemplated that any number of levels of privacy may be established consistent with embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0259">In some embodiments, virtual content items may require user's approval before being shared at a lower level of privacy than the current level of privacy of the visual content item. In some examples, the decision of whether a virtual display screen needs to be shared may be based on the virtual size of the virtual display screen, the orientation of the virtual display screen, the location of the virtual display screen, and factors related to the virtual screen configuration.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0260">In some embodiments, different sharing levels may be applied. Some non-limiting examples of such sharing levels may include private (available only to the user), Shared (available to people the user chooses to share with), public (available to anyone in a particular physical space), or any other combination of public, private, or shared. In one example, a particular physical space may have owners, and only an owner of the particular physical space may share public content in that particular physical space content. For example, a company may share public content within their office, or users may share public content within their house.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0261">In some examples, private content items, including, but not limited to, virtual display screens and widgets, may be shared with other users in a way that do not enable identification of some type of items. For example, items such as text, images, fine details, or any other media that a user may not want to share may not be identified or visible to the other users. By way of example, some or all of the virtual content may appear blurred to some users but may be clearly visible to other users based on how the first wearable extended reality appliance user configures their appliance or level of privacy. Other methods of obscuring the virtual content may be employed. In one example, when a first user comes close to a second user, the first user may see private content of the second user as if being viewed through a milky glass, but without seeing content details. Thus, the second user's contents may be protected from a first user who may not have authority to view private documents.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0262">In some embodiments, it may be communicated to the user that a particular content is going to be shared with others, and the user may be provided time to cancel sharing before the particular content is shared. Additionally, a user may obtain information related to the user's objects being shared with other users, information related to objects of others that are shared with the user, information related to these other users, and/or information related to a level of sharing of different users.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0263">In some embodiments, a user may select a virtual content item, such as a virtual display screen, a document, or other media, to be shared and send it to a physical screen, using a gesture. Such physical screens may include, for example, but are not limited to, TV, tablet, laptop, smartphone, smartboard, board, physical screen designated for content sharing, or any other physical screen. Gestures used by a user to share virtual content may include, for example, a drag, a pinch, a swipe, or any other hand movement. As a result, the virtual content item may be shared, may be presented over the physical screen, or manipulated in any other way as desired by the user. In some examples, the physical screen may serve and/or induce a virtual sharing space, for example with screen borders as area of sharing, and the virtual content item may be presented as a virtual layer and viewed by extended reality appliances.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0264">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B</figref> illustrate sharing public virtual content <b>1110</b>. This content may be shared to a physical screen <b>1114</b>, here, a TV, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>, for example by using a gesture <b>1112</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>. Such a gesture may be a hand wave, finger point, or any bodily movement. In this embodiment, the virtual content shared to a physical screen may be a public virtual content&#x2014;everyone may see the content, including those who are not wearing extended reality appliances.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0265">In some examples, a user may move her/his own virtual content item, such as a virtual display screen or document, to any of her/his personal physical screens. Such personal screens may include personal physical display screen, a smartphone screen, or tablet screen. The user may move his/her own content item by using a gesture. In response, the virtual content item may move to the physical display screen (i.e., may be presented using the physical display screen) or may be presented virtually over the physical display screen, for example without additional approvals, and with the virtual content item staying in same level of privacy.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0266">When sharing some content, however, additional approval may be required. For example, a user may desire to share private virtual content that has a higher level of privacy, i.e., is confidential, with another user. Such virtual content may be password protected, be accessible to only certain users, or otherwise be made private. In this scenario, the sharing user may be prompted to enter a password, contact a system administrator, or otherwise request permission to share the virtual content.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0267">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B</figref> illustrate sharing private virtual content <b>1210</b>. Here, an extended reality appliance user may share their own virtual content <b>1210</b> with their own physical screen <b>1212</b> by using a gesture <b>1214</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref>. This content stays in the same level of privacy, i.e., no additional approvals are needed to share the private virtual content. In some examples, a user may initiate sharing of a virtual content with a physical screen. An identification of one or more users exposed to the physical screen may be made (for example, based on location information associated with the users, and/or based on an analysis of an image of a room that includes the physical screen). Based on the identified one or more users, it may be determined whether the virtual content may be shared with the physical screen without additional approval, whether the virtual content may be shared with the physical screen upon additional approval, and/or whether the virtual content may not be shared with the physical screen. In one example, after the virtual content is shared with the physical screen, a (potential or actual) exposer of the physical screen to an additional user may be identified (for example, based on location information associated with the additional user, and/or based on an analysis of an image of a room that includes the physical screen), and in response to the identified exposer of the physical screen to the additional user, the sharing of the virtual content with the physical screen may be stopped, or a prompt may be provided to the user sharing the virtual content. Such prompt may include an indicator of the exposer and/or of the additional user, and/or may be configured to enable the user sharing the virtual content to continue or stop the sharing of the virtual content.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0268">In some embodiments, the privacy settings described above may be configured as part of a user's default settings. In some embodiments, causing the first virtual content to be displayed by the second wearable extended reality appliance may include modifying the first virtual content according to default settings associated with the second wearable extended reality appliance. The default settings may be configured according to the second wearable extended reality appliance user's preference and/or hardware available in the second wearable extended reality appliance and/or environmental conditions associated with the second wearable extended reality appliance. For example, the second wearable extended reality appliance may operate in lower or higher resolution than the first wearable extended reality appliance, and the rendering resolution of the first virtual content may be modified accordingly. In another example, the second wearable extended reality appliance may operate at different ambient light conditions than the first wearable extended reality appliance, and intensity and/or opacity of the rendering of the first virtual content may be modified to compensate for the different ambient light conditions. In yet another example, the second wearable extended reality appliance may enable a different angular field-of-view than the first wearable extended reality appliance, and a size of the first virtual content may be modified to adjust to the different angular field-of-view. In some examples, default settings may refer to how a wearable extended reality appliance is configured for use or how the wearable extended reality appliance is used. In some embodiments, default settings may be configured to hide personal information such as passwords or credit card numbers, or the default settings may involve a user's preferred display parameters, i.e., where content is displayed or how large the content appears. Default settings may be customizable by a user of the wearable extended reality appliance and may include, for example, privacy settings, proximity settings, gesture settings, or any other settings that may determine how the wearable extended reality appliance presents and/or shares virtual content.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0269">In the above embodiments, privacy settings may determine an initial level of privacy associated with any virtual content that may be shared with another user. For example, a default privacy setting may allow virtual content to be shared with all users. As another example, a default privacy setting may prohibit virtual content from being shared with any other user. As another example, a default privacy setting may allow virtual content to be shared with a predefined group of users (e.g., immediate family members of a user, or colleagues in a particular team or department associated with the user).</p><p id="p-0271" num="0270">In the above embodiments, sharing settings may determine how far one user needs to be from another before a sharing bubble is created, how large a predefined sharing ring is and where it is presented, or a default physical object via which virtual content is to be presented. In the above embodiments, gesture settings may determine what default user movement manifests a sharing intent. For example, a wearable extended reality appliance user may configure the gesture settings to automatically share content when the user waves their hand, but not share content when the user nods their head. Such privacy sharing and gesture settings may be adjusted at any time depending on the preference of the user and what the desired use of the wearable extended reality appliance is.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0271">Some disclosed embodiments may involve receiving from the second wearable extended reality appliance second virtual content for display via the first wearable extended reality appliance. Receiving may involve any form of transmission of content. For example, the content may be received through a network-based communication of content, or through a direct communication of content, such as through a Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, NFC, or other direct communication protocol between multiple extended reality appliances or modems associated therewith. In some embodiments, a processor may instruct the first wearable extended reality appliance to receive virtual content from the second wearable extended reality appliance, and to display that virtual content. In some other examples, a processor may receive the virtual content from the second wearable extended reality appliance, and may provide the virtual content to the first wearable extended reality appliance, for example for display of the virtual content. There are many ways in which the first wearable extended reality appliance may receive virtual content from the second wearable extended reality appliance as discussed elsewhere in this specification. For example, the second wearable extended reality appliance may share virtual content with the first wearable extended reality appliance via a sharing bubble or a sharing ring. As another example, the second wearable extended reality appliance may share virtual content with the first wearable extended reality appliance as soon as a link between the two appliances is established.</p><p id="p-0273" num="0272">Some disclosed embodiments may include displaying multiple versions of virtual content. In some embodiments, the first virtual content may include a two-dimensional virtual object, and the second virtual content may include an alternate version of the two-dimensional object. An alternate version of a two-dimensional object may include, for example, a scaled down version of the two-dimensional object, a magnified version of the two-dimensional object, a two-dimensional object having a different location or orientation, a two-dimensional object having a different color, texture, or shading, or a two-dimensional object with some or all of its characteristics or functions having been altered in some manner. An alternate version of a two-dimensional object may be generated based on a viewing user's preference.</p><p id="p-0274" num="0273">For example, a two-dimensional object may be a virtual document and the alternate version of the two-dimensional virtual object may be an annotated or highlighted version of the virtual document. As another example, a two-dimensional object may be a presentation, and an alternate version of the two-dimensional object may have modified colors, graphics, and/or shapes in the presentation. By way of another example, multiple versions of virtual content may be comprised of both public and private virtual objects. For example, a first user of a first wearable extended reality appliance may send a document to a second user, who may share the document with a larger group. However, some of the comments and annotations on the virtual object may remain hidden based on the first or second user's privacy and/or document sharing settings.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0274">In some embodiments, the first virtual content may include a three-dimensional virtual object, and the second virtual content may include a two-dimensional virtual object associated with the three-dimensional object. When one wearable extended reality appliance user shares content with another user, such content may include multiple virtual objects. As described in the above embodiments, these virtual objects may include both two-dimensional objects and three-dimensional objects and may be subject to various privacy settings. A three-dimensional virtual object may be a design model or project mock-up and the two-dimensional virtual object associated with the three-dimensional object may be a list of comments on the model. As with the two-dimensional models, subsequent versions of a three-dimensional virtual object may be configured to have different privacy settings.</p><p id="p-0276" num="0275">For example, a project mock-up, such as a bridge, building, or other scale or architectural model, may be shared as a three-dimensional virtual object with another user. Associated with the project-mock up may be a list of comments, i.e., a two-dimensional virtual object, regarding the size, length, width, a myriad of any other parameters relevant to the project mock-up. In addition to the two-dimensional objects associated with the three-dimensional objects, a user may include three-dimensional virtual objects in the modified version as well. In the project mock-up example for instance, a wearable extended reality appliance user may share a first version of the mock-up and may also share a modified version of the model that may have more components, may be a different size, or have different texture than the first one.</p><p id="p-0277" num="0276">In response to receiving the virtual content from the second wearable extended reality appliance, some disclosed embodiments may include presenting via the first extended reality appliance the second virtual content received from the second wearable extended reality appliance. There are many ways in which virtual content may be shared between wearable extended reality appliance users. Content may be shared via a sharing bubble or a sharing ring. A second wearable extended reality appliance user may share content, via a sharing bubble or sharing ring, with a first wearable extended reality appliance user. In the above embodiments, the first wearable extended reality appliance user may present content received from the second user. This content may be presented in a myriad of ways, for example, through the second user's extended reality appliance, via a screen such as a tablet or TV, or via a physical object such as a whiteboard or chalkboard. In one embodiment, the first user, after receiving virtual content from the second user, may present the content via the first appliance, or via a TV or whiteboard. The first wearable extended reality appliance user may also present content received from a second user to other users who are nearby the first user.</p><p id="p-0278" num="0277">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A and <b>13</b>B</figref> illustrate a sharing bubble, wherein the first wearable extended reality appliance <b>1310</b> receives second virtual content <b>1314</b> from the second wearable extended reality appliance <b>1312</b> via sharing region <b>1316</b>. Such virtual content may also be shared via a sharing ring. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>B</figref> illustrates an example of presenting received content <b>1314</b>. Here, first wearable extended reality appliance <b>1310</b> may present second virtual content <b>1314</b> received from the second wearable extended reality appliance <b>1312</b>. The virtual content may be presented via the wearable extended reality appliance, a screen such as a tablet or TV, or any other physical object.</p><p id="p-0279" num="0278">In another example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> shows a flowchart illustrating an exemplary method <b>1410</b> of coordinating between the first and second wearable extended reality appliances to display various virtual content. Method <b>1410</b> may contain step <b>1412</b>, wherein the at least one processor may establish a link between the first and second wearable extended reality appliances, for example for communication between the two appliances or for control of the two appliances. Method <b>1410</b> may also contain step <b>1414</b>, wherein first virtual content may be presented on the first wearable extended reality appliance before, after, or simultaneously with establishing a link with a second wearable extended reality appliance. Method <b>1410</b> may also contain step <b>1416</b>, involving obtaining a command to display the first virtual content via the second wearable extended reality appliance. Method <b>1410</b> may also contain step <b>1418</b>, wherein the first virtual content in some embodiments may be caused to be transmitted for display to the second wearable extended reality appliance. Method <b>1410</b> may also contain step <b>1420</b>, wherein a second virtual content may be received from the second wearable extended reality appliance. Method <b>1410</b> may contain step <b>1422</b>, wherein the first wearable extended reality appliance may display the second virtual content.</p><p id="p-0280" num="0279">Some disclosed embodiments may involve operations for providing situational awareness to users of wearable extended reality appliances. Situational awareness may include one or more of a perception of elements in an environment, a comprehension of a current situation, a projection of future status, or any ability to identify, process, or understand elements of information regarding what is occurring in an environment. For example, situational awareness may include an understanding of one or more of a location, area, point, geography, region, scene, setting, site, surroundings, topography, section, angle, inclination, dimension, amount, breadth, capacity, content, diameter, height, intensity, length, magnitude, proportion, range, volume, width, amplitude, age, date, presence, time, moment, occasion, or any other condition associated with any portion of an environment. In some examples, situational awareness may include an understanding of a state of another person in an environment of a user. For example, the situational awareness may include an understanding of whether the other person is engaged with virtual content (such as virtual displays, virtual avatars, etc.) or not.</p><p id="p-0281" num="0280">Some embodiments may cause virtual content to be displayed through a first wearable extended reality appliance. The term virtual content may include any type of data representation that may be displayed to the user, such as through an extended reality appliance or other presentation device. The virtual content may include a virtual object, inanimate virtual content, animate virtual content configured to change over time or in response to triggers, virtual two-dimensional content, virtual three-dimensional content, a virtual overlay over a portion of a physical environment or over a physical object, a virtual addition to a physical environment or to a physical object, a virtual promotion content, a virtual representation of a physical object, a virtual representation of a physical environment, a virtual document, a virtual character or persona, a virtual computer screen, a virtual widget, or any other format for displaying information virtually. Consistent with the present disclosure, the virtual content may include any visual presentation rendered by a computer or a processing device. In one embodiment, the virtual content may include a virtual object that is a visual presentation rendered by a computer in a confined region and configured to represent an object of a particular type (such as an inanimate virtual object, an animate virtual object, virtual furniture, a virtual decorative object, virtual widget, or other virtual representation). The rendered visual presentation may change to reflect changes to a status object or changes in the viewing angle of the object, for example, in a way that mimics changes in the appearance of physical objects.</p><p id="p-0282" num="0281">Some embodiments may involve detecting a second wearable extended reality appliance in proximity to the first wearable extended reality appliance. Proximity may refer to a closeness, adjacency, concurrence, contiguity, propinquity, close vicinity, or any other state or condition of being near. Proximity may be measured by any of a capacitive effect, inductive effect, magnetic effect, or optical effect. Proximity may also be detected using one or more of, for example, radar, sonar, ultrasonic, fiber optic, or Hall Effect technology, reflection of ionizing radiation, or any other technology that can detect the presence of nearby objects. Proximity may include distance, direction, or a combination of distance and direction. In other examples, locations of the first and second wearable extended reality appliance may be based on positioning data corresponding to the two. In one example, the locations may be determined using indoor or outdoor positioning sensors included in each one of the two wearable extended reality appliances, from localization of the two wearable extended reality appliances in an image (for example, an image captured using an image sensor in the environment of the two wearable extended reality appliances and analyzed using an object detection algorithm to localize the wearable extended reality appliances), and so forth. In other examples, an image captured using an image sensor included in the first wearable extended reality appliance may be analyzed using an object detection algorithm to detect the second wearable extended reality appliance, and a distance between the two wearable extended reality appliances may be determined, for example based on a size of the second wearable extended reality appliance in the captured image, thereby determining whether the second wearable extended reality appliance is in proximity to the first wearable extended reality appliance. In other examples, an image captured using an image sensor included in the second wearable extended reality appliance may be analyzed using an object detection algorithm to detect the first wearable extended reality appliance, and the second wearable extended reality appliance may be considered in proximity to the first wearable extended reality appliance when the first wearable extended reality appliance is detected in the captured image (and therefore is in a line of sight of the second wearable extended reality appliance).</p><p id="p-0283" num="0282">In some embodiments, detecting a second wearable extended reality appliance in proximity to the first wearable extended reality appliance may be continuous. In some embodiments, detecting a second wearable extended reality appliance in proximity to the first wearable extended reality appliance may occur at regular or irregular time intervals. In some embodiments, detecting a second wearable extended reality appliance in proximity to the first wearable extended reality appliance may be triggered by an input. The input may be received from a user, a system, or any other source of information that may trigger a detection of proximity.</p><p id="p-0284" num="0283">In certain embodiments, detecting a second wearable extended reality appliance in proximity to the first wearable extended reality appliance may include detecting that the second wearable extended reality appliance is within a certain distance, width, height, radius, or other measure of separation from the first wearable extended reality appliance. For example, detecting a second wearable extended reality appliance in proximity to the first wearable extended reality appliance may include detecting that the second wearable extended reality appliance is within one foot, two feet, five feet of, or any distance from the first extended reality appliance. The measure of separation used to detect the proximity may be inputted by a user, a system, or may be determined from any other source of information. For example, a user may input a value of five feet to trigger a detection of proximity. In another embodiment, a system may include default settings to trigger a detection of proximity when a distance of five feet is detected between the first wearable extended reality appliance and the second wearable extended reality appliance. In one example, the measure of separation used to detect the proximity may be different for different directions (for example, one measure of separation for horizontal distances, and a smaller measure of separation for vertical distances, or in another example, one measure of separation for an upward distance, and a smaller measure of separation for a downward distance). In some examples, the second wearable extended reality appliance may be considered in proximity to the first wearable extended reality appliance when the two wearable extended reality appliance are in a same defined space (such as a same room, a same apartment, a same office, a same building, and so forth). In some examples, the second wearable extended reality appliance may be considered in proximity to the first wearable extended reality appliance when the first wearable extended reality appliance is in a line of sight of the second wearable extended reality appliance.</p><p id="p-0285" num="0284">In some embodiments, a detection of proximity may be based on any reference point of each of the first wearable extended reality appliance and the second wearable extended reality appliance. For example, proximity may be detected based on a distance from any physical position of a wearable extended reality appliance. Alternatively, proximity may be detected based on a distance from a virtual position of a virtual object presented through a wearable extended reality appliance. In another example, proximity may be detected based on a distance from a reference point within a certain range of a wearable extended reality appliance.</p><p id="p-0286" num="0285">Some embodiments may involve establishing a link between the first wearable extended reality appliance and the second wearable extended reality appliance. A link may include one or more of a physical or non-physical attachment, or any other mode of connection. In some embodiments, a link may be established using physical attachment including, for example, a wire, cable, or any other type of attachment means that requires a tangible connection between the first wearable extended reality appliance and the second wearable extended reality appliance. In some embodiments, a link may be established using non-physical means, and may include wireless communication such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, Wi-Fi, or any other technology that implements the transfer of information between two or more points without the use of an electric conductor as a medium by which to perform the transfer.</p><p id="p-0287" num="0286">Furthermore, the link may be a direct or indirect link between the first wearable extended reality appliance and the second extended reality appliance. A direct link between the first wearable extended reality appliance and the second wearable extended reality appliance may be an unobstructed connection between the first wearable extended reality appliance and the second wearable extended reality appliance. Alternatively, an indirect link between the first wearable extended reality appliance and the second wearable extended reality appliance may be an obstructed connection between the first wearable extended reality appliance and the second wearable extended reality appliance. This type of link may include a connection that connects systems that are connected to one or both of the first wearable extended reality appliance and the second wearable extended reality appliance. Such systems may include, for example, a laptop, smartphone, or any other type of non-wearable device that may be connected to a wearable extended reality appliance. In one example, the link between the first wearable extended reality appliance and the second wearable extended reality appliance may include a direct and/or in-direct communication link between the two extended reality appliances. In another example, a system (such as a centralized system) may be in communication with each one of the first and the second wearable extended reality appliances, for example to provide each one of the two wearable extended reality appliances content for presentation, to receive location and/or orientation information associated with the wearable extended reality appliances, and so forth. The link between the first wearable extended reality appliance and the second wearable extended reality appliance may include a linkage in a data-structure or a database of the system or maintained by the system. In some examples, establishing a link between the first wearable extended reality appliance and the second wearable extended reality appliance may refer to linkage in a data-structure and/or a database, for example in system coordinating an extended reality environment, in a system that communicates with both the first and the second wearable extended reality appliances, in a system that provides content for presentation for both the first and the second wearable extended reality appliance, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0288" num="0287">Some embodiments may involve transmitting data representing at least a portion of the virtual content in an obscured form to the second wearable extended reality appliance, wherein the obscured form provides an indication of a position of the at least a portion of the virtual content in a three-dimensional space without revealing substance of the virtual content in obscured form. In one example, the data may be transmitted from the first wearable extended reality appliance to the second, for example through a direct or an indirect communication link. In this example, the first wearable extended reality appliance may process at least part of the virtual content to generate the obscured form, for example as described below. In another example, the data may be transmitted from a computerized system (for example, a system coordinating an extended reality environment, a system that communicates with both the first and the second wearable extended reality appliances, a system that provides content for presentation for both the first and the second wearable extended reality appliance, and so forth) to the second wearable extended reality appliance. In this example, the computerized system may process at least part of the virtual content to generate the obscured form, for example as described below. An obscured form may include a presentation of any portion of the virtual content in a manner that obfuscates that portion of the virtual content. In certain embodiments, an obscured form that provides an indication of a position of the at least a portion of the virtual content in a three-dimensional space without revealing substance of the virtual content may include a presentation of the at least a portion of the virtual content through masking, redaction, omission, pixilation, blurring, or any other means that at least partially conceals any portion of the virtual content. In some examples, an obscured form may provide a visual indication of a position of the at least a portion of the virtual content in a three-dimensional space and/or a visual indication of a type of the at least a portion of the virtual content without revealing at least one detail of the at least a portion of the virtual content. For example, the obscured form may provide a visual indication that the at least a portion of the virtual content includes a textual content, without revealing the exact words and/or the exact letters of the textual content. In another example, the obscured form may provide a visual indication that the at least a portion of the virtual content includes a graphical content, without revealing the exact images and/or the exact graphics of the graphical content.</p><p id="p-0289" num="0288">The functioning of the at least one processor as prescribed by the instructions is exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> and <b>16</b></figref>.

Here, because the second wearable extended reality appliance <b>1617</b> is in proximity to the first wearable extended reality appliance <b>1615</b>, a portion <b>1626</b> of the first virtual content <b>1622</b> may be transmitted to the second wearable extended reality appliance <b>1617</b>. Moreover, the portion <b>1626</b> of the first virtual content <b>1622</b> may be shown in an obscured form to the second wearable extended reality appliance <b>1617</b> by being blurred, so that the blurred image provides an indication of a position of portion <b>1626</b> of the first virtual content <b>1622</b> in a three-dimensional space without revealing a substance of the virtual content <b>1622</b>.</p><p id="p-0291" num="0290">In some embodiments, the virtual content displayed through the first wearable extended reality appliance may include content of differing types, and the operations further include presenting via the second wearable extended reality appliance, a type associated with the obscured information, without revealing substance of the content. Content of differing types may include content that varies with regard to format, presentation, shape, size, color, or any other aspect. In some embodiments, differing types of content may include, for example, word processing content, gaming content, spreadsheet content, database content, graphics content, or web browser content. As one example of a presentation consistent with such embodiments, the virtual content displayed through the first wearable extended reality appliance may include content of a web browser type. Accordingly, when data representing at least a portion of the virtual content is transmitted in an obscured form to the second wearable extended reality device, a web browser type that is associated with the obscured form is presented via the second display.</p><p id="p-0292" num="0291">In some embodiments, the virtual content displayed through the first wearable extended reality appliance may include a plurality of virtual screens, and the virtual content presented in obscured form via the second wearable extended reality appliance may further provide an indication of sizes and orientations of the plurality of virtual screens without revealing substance of content associated with the plurality of virtual screens. A virtual screen (also referred to as virtual display herein) may include any bounded shape or presentation area including virtual content, such as a rectangular window containing a plurality of virtual objects. A plurality of virtual screens may include two or more bounded shapes or presentation areas, with each including virtual content. The plurality of virtual screens may have different sizes, orientations, display settings, and other visual features. One or more of these visual features may be obfuscated when the plurality of virtual screens is presented to the second wearable extended reality appliance. For example, the virtual content displayed through the first wearable extended reality appliance may include one virtual screen that is square in shape and another virtual screen that is rectangular in shape. In such an embodiment, when the obscured form is presented via the second wearable extended reality appliance, the square shape and the rectangular shape of the corresponding virtual screens may be displayed to the user of the second wearable extended reality appliance, but the content of the square and rectangular shapes may be obscured. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is an example illustration of a virtual display provided in an obscured form, consistent with some embodiments of the present disclosure. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, the virtual content displayed through the first wearable extended reality appliance <b>1710</b> may include one virtual screen <b>1712</b> comprising two smaller windows <b>1714</b> and <b>1716</b> and another virtual screen <b>1718</b> comprising one large window <b>1720</b>. When the virtual content is displayed through the second wearable extended reality appliance <b>1722</b>, only the size of the two smaller windows <b>1714</b> and <b>1716</b> in the first virtual screen <b>1712</b> and the larger window <b>1720</b> in the second virtual screen <b>1718</b> may be displayed to the user of the second wearable extended reality appliance. In this exemplary embodiment, the indication of the size without revealing substance of content associated with the plurality of virtual screens may be achieved through blurring, but blacking out, pixilation, or any other method of concealing the content is contemplated for use with other embodiments.</p><p id="p-0293" num="0292">In some embodiments, the virtual content displayed through the first wearable extended reality appliance may include a user interface presenting a conversation with one or more participants, and the obscured form may further include a representation of the conversation without revealing identities of the one or more participants. The user interface may include a graphical or textual display of communication exchanged by two or more users. The display may be generated by one or more applications that allow users to exchange textual or graphic communications. Such applications may include iMessage, Google Chat, SMS, Facebook Chat, Messenger, Slack, Teams, WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, Zoom, or any other application used for composing and sending electronic messages, typically consisting of alphabetic and numeric characters, between two or more users of mobile devices, desktops, laptops, or another type of compatible computer. The user interface may be presented to another user if a second wearable extended reality appliance is in proximity to a first wearable extended reality appliance. For example, the user interface may include a chatting window comprising a plurality of participants. In such an embodiment, the obscured form may present an indication of a chatting window, such as through chatting bubbles, but conceal the names of the participants. Other indications of a participant's identity may also be concealed, such as a photograph, picture, avatar, association, organization, location, position, role in an organization, or any other information that may be tied to an individual's identity. An individual's identity may include their name, phone number, email, user ID, address, location, face, picture, video, or any other identifying information.</p><p id="p-0294" num="0293">In some embodiments, the virtual content displayed through the first wearable extended reality appliance may include a virtual three-dimensional object, and the obscured form may further provide an indication of a shape of the virtual three-dimensional object without revealing other details of the three-dimensional object. A virtual three-dimensional object may include a virtual three-dimensional representation of a physical person, or an animate or inanimate object. A shape of a three-dimensional object may include the architecture, body, configuration, contour, format, frame, outline, silhouette, dimensions, color, texture, identifying features such as projections and recesses, or any other characteristic of the object that describes its form. For example, the virtual content displayed through the first wearable extended reality appliance may include a three-dimensional rendering of a person. In such an embodiment, the obscured form may provide a silhouette of the person without revealing other details of the person, such as their face, what they are wearing, and any other attributes of the person that extend beyond merely their shape.</p><p id="p-0295" num="0294">In some embodiments, the operations may further include receiving a request from the second wearable extended reality appliance to share the virtual content, and upon receiving confirmation from the first wearable extended reality appliance, transmitting second data representing the at least a portion of the virtual content in an unobscured form to the second wearable extended reality appliance. A request from the second wearable extended reality appliance may be generated either automatically or through user input. An automatic request from the second wearable extended reality appliance may include a request that is triggered to be sent based on a distance between the first wearable extended reality appliance and the second wearable extended reality appliance, a location of the first wearable extended reality appliance or the second wearable extended reality appliance, an identity of a user of the first wearable extended reality appliance or the second wearable extended reality appliance, a specified time, or any other parameter that may be used to trigger a request from the second wearable extended reality appliance. A request from the second wearable extended reality appliance may also be sent through a user input. A user input request may be generated when a user of the second wearable extended reality appliance interacts with the second wearable extended reality device or any other device connected to the second wearable extended reality device. In some examples, a user input request may be generated when a user of the second wearable extended reality appliance interacts with any portion of the virtual display of the second wearable extended reality appliance. Such an interaction may be achieved through a trigger, a touch-screen interface, a mouse, or any other type of interactive element. In some embodiments, the automatic request from the second wearable extended reality appliance may be generated through a combination of an automatic input and a user-generated input. For example, a request from the second wearable extended reality appliance to share the virtual content may be generated when the first wearable extended reality appliance is within five feet of the second wearable extended reality appliance and a user of the second wearable extended reality appliance presses a button to generate the request. Confirmation from the first wearable extended reality appliance may be generated through an input from a user of the first wearable extended reality appliance. The user may generate the input through interaction with an object connected to the first wearable extended reality appliance, such as a trigger, a touch-screen interface, a mouse, or any other type of interactive element. In another example, the first wearable extended reality appliance or a processing unit associated with the first wearable extended reality appliance may access a data-structure including access permissions to determine whether a confirmation should be provided, and may automatically provide the confirmation in response to a determination that a confirmation should be provided.</p><p id="p-0296" num="0295">In some embodiments, the operations may further include providing to the first wearable extended reality appliance an indication that the at least a portion of the virtual content is displayed in an obscured form via the second wearable extended reality appliance. This indication may be presented to a user of the first wearable extended reality appliance through an output that is either audio, visual, or haptic in nature. Further, any combination of an audible, visual, or haptic output may also be used to present the indication to the first wearable extended reality appliance. The indication presented to the user may include an indication of at least one of the second wearable extended reality appliance, a user of the second wearable extended reality appliance, the portion of the virtual content, the obscuring technique, the obscured form, or a time period of the presentation of the obscured form. An audio indication that the at least a portion of the virtual content is displayed in an obscured form via the second extended reality appliance may include a beep, tone, alarm, voice indication, or any other type of sound. A visual indication that the at least a portion of the virtual content is displayed in an obscured form via the second extended reality appliance may include a picture, image, cartoon, description, sentence, drawing, figure, icon, photograph, or any other viewable output. A haptic indication that the at least a portion of the virtual content is displayed in an obscured form via the second extended reality appliance may include a buzz, vibration, or any other sign to a user of the first extended reality appliance that relates to the sense of touch. In other examples, the indication that the at least a portion of the virtual content is displayed in the obscured form via the second wearable extended reality may be provided to the first wearable extended reality appliance in a digital signal, for example in a digital signal transmitted to the first wearable extended reality appliance. The digital signal may include an indication of at least one of the second wearable extended reality appliance, a user of the second wearable extended reality appliance, the portion of the virtual content, the obscuring technique, the obscured form, or a time period of the presentation of the obscured form.</p><p id="p-0297" num="0296">Some embodiments, may involve determining an intent of a first user of the first wearable extended reality appliance to share the at least a portion of the virtual content with a second user of the second wearable extended reality appliance, and transmitting second data representing the at least a portion of the virtual content in an unobscured form to the second wearable extended reality appliance. An intent of a first user of the first wearable extended reality appliance to share the at least a portion of the virtual content with a second user of the second wearable extended reality appliance may be determined based on any input by the first user. Such an input may include interaction with objects such as a trigger, a touch-screen interface, a mouse, or any other type of interactive element. For example, when a first user of the first wearable extended reality appliance presses a button on the first wearable extended reality appliance, an intent of the first user of the first wearable extended reality appliance to share the at least a portion of the virtual content with a second user of the second wearable extended reality appliance is determined. In another example, such input may include a gesture of the first user. An unobscured form of the at least a portion of the virtual content may include a presentation of the at least a portion in a manner that is not concealed. For example, an obscured form of the at least one portion may include an image with a blur filter applied such that the shape of the image is readily identifiable, while its substance is not. In such an embodiment, an unobscured form of the image may include an image with the blur filter removed, such that the substance of the image also becomes identifiable.</p><p id="p-0298" num="0297">In some embodiments, the intent to share the at least a portion of the virtual content with the second user of the second wearable extended reality appliance is determined from image data captured by the first wearable extended reality appliance. Image data may include pixel data, time, date, location, identity of a subject, role of a subject, or any other information that may be associated with a given image. For example, the first wearable extended reality appliance may capture image data indicative of a person A. The at least one processor may be configured to determine an intent to share the at least a portion of the virtual content with the second user of the second wearable extended reality appliance based on the information included in the image data. For example, the at least one processor may determine the intent to share the at least a portion of the virtual content with the second user of the second wearable extended reality appliance when the image data indicates person A, or based on a time, date, or location associated with the image. In other examples, the image data may be analyzed using a gesture recognition algorithm to identify a gesture indicative of the intent of the first user to share the at least a portion of the virtual content with the second user.</p><p id="p-0299" num="0298">In some embodiments, the intent to share the at least a portion of the virtual content with the second user of the second wearable extended reality appliance may be determined from not receiving an indication from the user of the first wearable extended reality appliance to keep the at least a portion of the virtual content in an obscured form. In some embodiments, the at least one processor may not receive any input from a user of the first wearable extended reality appliance regarding obscuring a portion of the virtual content. The at least one processor may be configured to determine the intent to share based on a lack of input from the user. In some embodiments, the at least one processor may not receive any input from a user of the first wearable extended reality appliance regarding obscuring a portion of the virtual content within a given period of time. The at least one processor may be configured to determine the intent to share based on a lack of input from the user during a given period of time. For example, the given period of time set by the first wearable extended reality system may be five minutes from any triggering event. The at least one processor my determine the intent to share the at least a portion of the virtual content with the second user of the second wearable extended reality appliance when it does not receive an indication from the user of the first wearable extended reality appliance to keep the at least a portion of the virtual content in an obscured form within five minutes. A triggering event may be one or more of a user input or a determination made by the first wearable extended reality appliance.</p><p id="p-0300" num="0299">In some embodiments, the virtual content displayed through the first wearable extended reality appliance may include a first portion classified as private and a second portion classified as public, and the operations may further exclude the first portion from transmission to the second wearable extended reality appliance and transmit the second portion in an obscured form to the second wearable extended reality appliance. The classification of private or public content may be based on user input or other criteria, such as the content itself. For example, content may be marked by a user as confidential or private, or content may be automatically designated as private if it includes any identifying information. Information classified as private may include a name, identity, email address, location, or any other information intended for or restricted to the use of a particular person, group, or class. Information classified as public may include a message, picture, news article, or any other information intended to be exposed to general view. For example, the virtual content displayed through the first wearable extended reality appliance may include a chat window consisting of a first portion comprising an identity of a participant, which may be classified as private. A second portion of the chat window may include a chat bubble, which may be classified as public. The at least one processor may be configured to prohibit transmission of the first portion comprising the identity of the participant to the second wearable extended reality appliance. The processor may, however, transmit the second portion of the chat window comprising the chat bubble in an obscured form to the second wearable extended reality appliance. As another example, the virtual content displayed through the first wearable extended reality appliance may include a shopping application window consisting of a first portion comprising the user's credit card details, which may be classified as private. A second portion of the shopping application window may include a list of items available for purchase, which may be classified as public. The at least one processor may be configured to prohibit transmission of the first portion comprising the user's credit card details to the second wearable extended reality appliance. The processor may, however, transmit the second portion comprising the list of items available for purchase in an obscured form to the second wearable extended reality appliance.</p><p id="p-0301" num="0300">In some embodiments, the virtual content displayed through the first wearable extended reality appliance may include a first portion classified as private and a second portion classified as public, and the operations may further include transmitting the first portion in an obscured form and transmitting the second portion in a non-obscured form. As discussed above, some portions of a virtual content may be designated as being confidential or private while other portions may be designated as being public. Information classified as public may include a message, picture, news article, or any other information intended to be exposed to general view. The portions classified as private may be transmitted in an obscured form, while the portions classified as public may be transmitted in an unobscured form. For example, the virtual content displayed through the first wearable extended reality appliance may include a chat window consisting of a first portion comprising an identity of a participant classified as private and a second portion comprising a chat bubble classified as public. In such an embodiment, the first portion comprising the identity of the participant is transmitted to the second wearable extended reality appliance in an obscured form, while the second portion comprising the chat bubble is transmitted in a non-obscured form to the second wearable extended reality appliance. In such an embodiment, the first portion comprising the identity of the participant may be presented as a blurred image, while the second portion comprising the chat bubble may be presented without any blur. As another example, the virtual content displayed through the first wearable extended reality appliance may include a shopping application window consisting of a first portion comprising the user's credit card details, which may be classified as private. A second portion of the shopping application window may include a list of items available for purchase, which may be classified as public. In such an embodiment, the first portion comprising the user's credit card details is transmitted to the second wearable extended reality appliance in an obscured form, while the second portion comprising the list of items available for purchase is transmitted in a non-obscured form to the second wearable extended reality appliance. In such an embodiment, the first portion comprising the user's credit card details may be presented as a blurred image, while the second portion comprising the list of items available for purchase may be presented without any blur.</p><p id="p-0302" num="0301">In some embodiments, the operations may further include receiving indication via the first wearable extended reality appliance that the first portion is classified as private. An indication that the first portion is classified as private may be received via the first wearable extended reality appliance through a user interaction with any portion of the first wearable extended reality appliance or with any device connected to the first wearable extended reality appliance, such as a trigger, a touch-screen interface, a mouse, or any other type of interactive element. Thus, for example, a user may provide one or more inputs indicating a portion of virtual content and identifying that portion as being private, using the first wearable extended reality appliance or any device connected to the first wearable extended reality appliance. For example, a user may select portions of a document by highlighting them with a cursor to mark those portions as private. As another example, a user may select portions of an image by highlighting them with a cursor to mark those portions as private.</p><p id="p-0303" num="0302">In some embodiments, the operations may further include automatically determining that the first portion is classified as private. An automatic determination that the first portion is classified as private may be based on a determination by the first wearable extended reality appliance that is independent of any user input, or may be determined by another computing device. In such embodiments, the automatic determination may be based on one or more characteristics of the virtual content, including, for example, an identity of the user, a role of the user, a location of the first wearable extended reality appliance, a present time or date, or any other information associated with a virtual content. In some embodiments, the at least one processor may employ one or more rules that determines whether some or all portions of virtual content should be designated as private based on the one or more characteristics of the virtual content independent of an active user input. In such embodiments, the rules may be stored in a database or may be created by a user. Alternatively, or in addition, a machine learning model (such as a classification model, a visual classification model, etc.) may be trained using training examples to determine whether contents are public or private. An example of such training example may include a sample content, together with a label indicating whether the sample content is public or private. The trained machine learning model may be used to determine which portions are confidential and which portions are public. In another example, the first wearable extended reality appliance may be configured to determine the location of the appliance. In such an embodiment, the at least one processor may be configured to classify the first portion of a virtual content as private whenever the first wearable extended reality appliance is in a given location or within a predetermined distance of the given location.</p><p id="p-0304" num="0303">Some embodiments, the operations may further include identifying at least a first individual with permission to view the first portion and at least a second individual without permission to view the first portion, and the operations may additionally include enabling display of the first portion to the at least a first individual while preventing display of the first portion to the at least a second individual. A first individual with permission to view the first portion may be identified either based on user input or automatically. In some embodiments, a user of the first wearable extended reality appliance may interact with the first wearable extended reality appliance or any connected devices in order to identify that an individual has permission to view the first portion. The user may interact with the first wearable extended reality appliance or any connected devices using a trigger, a touch-screen interface, a mouse, or any other type of interactive element in order to identify an individual as having permission to view the first portion. In some embodiments, the first wearable extended reality appliance or a different computing device may automatically identify that an individual has permission to view the first portion, based on one or more of the identity of the individual, the role of the individual, the location of the first wearable extended reality appliance, the location of the second wearable extended reality appliance, the present time or date, or any other information that may be used to classify a permission status of an individual independent of an active user input. In some embodiments, the at least one processor may employ one or more rules to identify that an individual has permission to view the first portion based on the information that may be used to classify a permission status independent of an active user input. In such embodiments, the rules may be stored in a database or could be created by a user. Alternatively, or in addition, a machine learning model (such as a classification model, a visual classification model, etc.) could be trained using training examples to determine whether particular individuals have permissions to view different contents. An example of such training example may include a sample content and data associated with a sample individual, together with a label indicating whether or not the sample individual has permission to view the sample content. The trained machine learning model may be used to determine which individuals have permission to view the first portion. A second individual without permission to view the first portion may similarly be identified either based on user input or automatically. In some embodiments, a user of the first wearable extended reality appliance may interact with the first wearable extended reality appliance or any connected devices in order to identify that an individual does not have permission to view the first portion. The user may interact with the first wearable extended reality appliance or any connected devices using a trigger, a touch-screen interface, a mouse, or any other type of interactive element in order to identify an individual as not having permission to view the first portion. In some embodiments, the first wearable extended reality appliance or a different computing device may automatically identify that an individual does not have permission to view the first portion, based on one or more of the identity of the individual, the role of the individual, the location of the first wearable extended reality appliance, the location of the second wearable extended reality appliance, the present time or date, or any other information that can be used to classify a permission status of an individual independent of an active user input. Additionally, enabling display may include enabling a fully obscured display, a fully unobscured display, a partially obscured display, or a partially unobscured display. For example, a first individual may be identified to have permission to view the first portion of a document, while a second individual may be identified to not have permission to view the first portion. Some disclosed embodiments may allow the first individual to see the portion of the document clearly, while blacking out, blurring, or in some other way while preventing display of the portion of the document to the second individual.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0304">Some embodiments may involve detecting that a third wearable extended reality appliance is in proximity to the first wearable extended reality appliance; establishing an additional link between the first wearable extended reality appliance and the third wearable extended reality appliance; and transmitting data representing a specific portion of the virtual content in an unobscured form to the third wearable extended reality appliance, while the specific portion of the virtual content is displayed in an obscured form to the second wearable extended reality appliance. Detecting a proximity between the first wearable extended reality appliance and the third wearable extended reality appliance may be achieved via systems, devices, and methods similar to those discussed above for detecting the proximity between the first wearable extended reality appliance and the second wearable extended reality appliance. Establishing an additional link between the first wearable extended reality appliance and the third wearable extended reality appliance may be achieved via systems, devices, and methods similar to those discussed above for establishing a link between the first wearable extended reality appliance and the second extended reality appliance. For example, a link may be established between the first wearable extended reality appliance and the third wearable extended reality appliance through Bluetooth, and a link may be established between the first wearable extended reality appliance and the second wearable extended reality appliance also through Bluetooth. In another example, the link between the first wearable extended reality appliance and the second wearable extended reality appliance may include a linkage in a data-structure or a database, for example in a system coordinating an extended reality environment, in a system that communicates with both the first and the second wearable extended reality appliances, in a system that provides content for presentation for both the first and the second wearable extended reality appliance, and so forth. By way of another example, a link may be established between the first wearable extended reality appliance and the third wearable extended reality appliance in a different way than a link established between the first wearable extended reality appliance and the second wearable extended reality appliance. For example, a link may be established between the first wearable extended reality appliance and the third wearable extended reality appliance through Bluetooth, while a link may be established between the first wearable extended reality appliance and the second wearable extended reality appliance through Wi-Fi or in a data-structure.</p><p id="p-0306" num="0305">In some embodiments, the operations may further include accessing second user permission data associated with a second user of the second wearable extended reality appliance and third user permission data associated with the third wearable extended reality appliance; and based on the second user permission data and the third user permission data, selectively sharing content with the second wearable extended reality appliance and with the third wearable extended reality appliance, wherein the content shared with the second wearable extended reality appliance differs from content shared with the third wearable extended reality appliance. The second user permission data associated with the second user of the second wearable extended reality appliance may be generated either through user input or automatically, similar to the systems, devices, and methods discussed above. The user input may be generated by either a user of the first wearable extended reality appliance, a user of the second wearable extended reality appliance, or any other user. In one embodiment, a user of the first wearable extended reality appliance, a user of the second wearable extended reality appliance, or any other user may interact with the first wearable extended reality appliance, the second wearable extended reality appliance, or any connected devices in order to generate the second user permission data associated with the second user of the second wearable extended reality appliance.

In some embodiments, the first wearable extended reality appliance, the second wearable extended reality appliance, or any connected devices may automatically generate the second user permission data associated with the second user of the second wearable extended reality appliance, based on one or more of the identity of the second user, the role of the second user, the location of the first wearable extended reality appliance, the location of the second wearable extended reality appliance, the present time or date, or any other information that can be used to establish rules for data privacy independent of an active user input.</p><p id="p-0307" num="0306">Similarly, the third user permission data associated with the third user of the second wearable extended reality appliance may be generated either through user input or automatically. The user input may be generated by either a user of the first wearable extended reality appliance, a user of the third wearable extended reality appliance, or any other user. In one embodiment, a user of the first wearable extended reality appliance, a user of the third wearable extended reality appliance, or any other user may interact with the first wearable extended reality appliance, the third wearable extended reality appliance, or any connected devices in order to generate the third user permission data associated with the third user of the third wearable extended reality appliance. Such a user may interact with the first wearable extended reality appliance, the third wearable extended reality appliance, or any connected devices using a trigger, a touch-screen interface, a mouse, or any other type of interactive element in order to generate the third user permission data associated with the third user of the third wearable extended reality appliance. In another embodiment, the first wearable extended reality appliance, the third wearable extended reality appliance, or any connected devices may automatically generate the third user permission data associated with the third user of the third wearable extended reality appliance, based on one or more of the identity of the third user, the role of the third user, the location of the first wearable extended reality appliance, the location of the third wearable extended reality appliance, the present time or date, or any other information that can be used to establish rules for data privacy independent of an active user input.</p><p id="p-0308" num="0307">Furthermore, selectively sharing content may include sharing content in any way that differentiates the information being presented to the second user of the second wearable extended reality appliance from the information being presented to the third user of the third wearable extended reality appliance. For example, the content shared with the second user of the second wearable extended reality appliance may comprise fully obscured content, while the content shared with the third user of the third wearable extended reality appliance may comprise only partially obscured content. In one example, the content shared with the second user of the second wearable extended reality appliance may comprise a blacked-out image, while the content shared with the third user of the third wearable extended reality appliance may comprise only a blurred-out image. In another example, the content shared with the second user of the second wearable extended reality appliance may comprise a completely redacted document, while the content shared with the third user of the third wearable extended reality appliance may comprise only a partially redacted document.</p><p id="p-0309" num="0308">In some embodiments, the second user permission data and the third user permission data may be obtained during the establishment of the link and the additional link respectively. In such embodiments, the second user permission data and the third user permission data may be obtained following a request to a user for the permission data or automatically.</p><p id="p-0310" num="0309">In some embodiments, the data representing at least a portion of the virtual content in an obscured form may be generated by processing at least part of the virtual content. For example, the first wearable extended reality appliance may process the at least part of the virtual content to generate the data representing the at least a portion of the virtual content in the obscured form. In another example, a computerized system (for example, a system coordinating an extended reality environment, a system that communicates with both the first and the second wearable extended reality appliances, a system that provides content for presentation for both the first and the second wearable extended reality appliance, and so forth) may process the at least part of the virtual content to generate the data representing the at least a portion of the virtual content in the obscured form. In some examples, the processing of the at least part of the virtual content to generate the data may include applying the at least part of the virtual content to a transformation function, such as blurring, modification, visual filter, and so forth. In one example, a machine learning model (such as a generative model, a generative adversarial network, a transformer based generative model, etc.) may be trained using training examples to generated obscure forms of virtual contents. An example of such training example may include a sample virtual content and sample obscuring parameters, together with a desired obscured form of the sample virtual content corresponding to the sample obscuring parameters. Some non-limiting examples of such obscuring parameters may include an obscuring level (such as &#x2018;High&#x2019;, &#x2018;Low&#x2019;, etc.), an obscuring method (such as reduction, blurring, etc.), and so forth. The trained machine learning model may analyze the at least part of the virtual content to generate the data representing the at least a portion of the virtual content in the obscured form. In one example, a manual configuration may be used to select obscuring parameters for the usage of the trained machine learning model. In some examples, the obscure form of the at least a portion of the virtual content may be selected based on characteristics of the second wearable extended reality appliance (such as hardware characteristics, display resolution, operating system, and so forth) and/or based on a condition of the second wearable extended reality appliance (such as ambient illumination conditions in an environment of the second wearable extended reality appliance, usage mode of the second wearable extended reality appliance, and so forth). For example, the characteristics and/or condition of the second wearable extended reality appliance may be used to select obscuring parameters for the usage of the trained machine learning model. In some examples, in response to first ambient illumination conditions in the environment of the second wearable extended reality appliance, a first obscure form of the at least a portion of the virtual content may be selected, and in response to second illumination conditions in the environment of the second wearable extended reality appliance, a second obscure form of the at least a portion of the virtual content may be selected, the second obscure form may differ from the first obscure form. In one example, the first ambient illumination conditions may correspond to brighter illumination than the second ambient illumination conditions, and the first obscure form may be more opaque and/or sharper than the second obscure form. In some examples, in response to a first usage mode of the second wearable extended reality appliance, a first obscure form of the at least a portion of the virtual content may be selected, and in response to a second usage mode of the second wearable extended reality appliance, a second obscure form of the at least a portion of the virtual content may be selected, the second obscure form may differ from the first obscure form. For example, the first usage mode may include an active engagement of the user of the second wearable extended reality appliance with virtual objects, the second usage mode may include a passive viewing of virtual objects by the user of the second wearable extended reality appliance, and the first obscure form may be smaller than the second obscure form. In another example, the first usage mode may include usage while being mobile (for example, walking, running, etc.), the second usage mode may include usage while being stationary (for example, sitting, standing, etc.), and the first obscure form may be less opaque than the second obscure form.</p><p id="p-0311" num="0310">In some embodiments, a method for providing situational awareness to users of wearable extended reality appliances may be disclosed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> is a flowchart of an exemplary method <b>1805</b> of providing situational awareness to users of wearable extended reality appliances, consistent connection with some embodiments of the present disclosure.

For example, a non-transitory computer-readable medium is described below, with the understanding that aspects of the non-transitory computer-readable medium may apply equally to methods, systems, and apparatuses. For example, one or more processes embodied in the non-transitory computer-readable medium may be performed as a method, in a system, or in an apparatus. Some aspects of such processes may occur electronically over a network that may be wired, wireless, or both. Other aspects of such processes may occur using non-electronic means. In a broadest sense, the processes are not limited to particular physical and/or electronic instrumentalities, but rather may be accomplished using many differing instrumentalities.

A non-transitory computer-readable medium may include any type of physical memory on which information or data readable by at least one processor may be stored. A non-transitory computer-readable medium may include, for example, random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), volatile memory, non-volatile memory, hard drives, compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM), digital versatile discs (DVDs), flash drives, disks, any optical data storage medium, any physical medium with patterns of holes, programmable read-only memory (PROM), erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM), FLASH-EPROM or any other flash memory, non-volatile random-access memory (NVRAM), caches, registers, any other memory chip or cartridge, or networked versions of the same. A non-transitory computer-readable medium may refer to multiple structures, such as a plurality of non-transitory computer-readable media, located at a local location or at a remote location. Additionally, one or more non-transitory computer-readable media may be utilized in implementing a computer-implemented method. Accordingly, a non-transitory computer-readable medium may include tangible items and may exclude carrier waves or transient signals.</p><p id="p-0315" num="0314">The instructions contained in the non-transitory computer-readable medium may include, for example, software instructions, computer programs, computer code, executable instructions, source code, machine instructions, machine language programs, or any other type of directions for a computing device. The instructions contained in the non-transitory computer-readable medium may be based on one or more of various types of desired programming languages, and may include (e.g., embody) various processes for tying a virtual whiteboard to a physical space as described herein.</p><p id="p-0316" num="0315">At least one processor may execute the instructions contained in the non-transitory computer-readable medium to cause various processes to be performed for tying a virtual whiteboard to a physical space as described herein. The processor may include, for example, integrated circuits, microchips, microcontrollers, microprocessors, central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), digital signal processors (DSPs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), or other units suitable for executing instructions or performing logic operations. The processor may include a single-core or multiple-core processor. In some examples, the processor may be a single-core processor configured with virtualization technologies. The processor may, for example, implement virtualization technologies or other functionalities to provide the ability to execute, control, run, manipulate, or store multiple software processes, applications, or programs. In another example, the processor may include a multiple-core processor (e.g., dual-core, quad-core, or with any desired number of cores) configured to provide parallel processing functionalities to allow a device associated with the processor to execute multiple processes simultaneously. Other types of processor arrangements may be implemented to provide the capabilities described herein.</p><p id="p-0317" num="0316">Some disclosed embodiments may relate to tying a virtual whiteboard to a physical space. A virtual whiteboard may refer to a virtual location where content may be displayed. For example, a virtual surface may be an area in a display space configured for the presentation of digital content. The digital content may include images, widgets, text, links, markings, scribbles or any other preexisting information or information generated on the fly, such as handwritten or typed text or images. The virtual content being displayed by an extended reality appliance to a user. Although referred to in a colloquial sense as a &#x201c;white&#x201d; board, the surface need not be of any particular color. That is, the display area may be white, black, blue, green, or yellow, or may have any other desired color. The surface may be displayed as glossy, smooth, or coarse, or may have any other desired texture. Any shape may be employed as a whiteboard. For example, in some embodiments, the whiteboard may have a traditional rectangular shape of a chalkboard or a flip chart, and in other embodiments, the whiteboard may be presented in the shape of a circle, square, triangle, hexagon, parallelogram, trapezoid, freeform shape, or any other desired contour. Similarly, use of the term &#x201c;board&#x201d; is not meant to imply that the display need be flat. In some embodiments, the virtual whiteboard may be present with varying contours. For example, a whiteboard may be presented as a rotatable cube or other three-dimensional shape (or combinations of shapes.) In some embodiments, initial characteristics (e.g., shape, size, color) of a whiteboard may change over time. For example, as a user interacts with differing portions of the whiteboard, the whiteboard's characteristics may change (e.g., a full board may expand; interacting with certain regions of the board may cause changes in display characteristics). A whiteboard surface is not limited to any particular size. It might be of any size, depending on the particular use case (e.g., if rectangular, 0.5 square meters, 0.75 square meters, 1 square meter, 2 square meters, or any other desired amount of area). In some examples, the surface of the virtual whiteboard may be bounded by an enclosure (e.g., frames) along the borders of the shape of the surface, the enclosure being displayed as virtual content together with the displayed surface. The virtual whiteboard may be displayed as being affixed onto a physical wall or a virtual wall being displayed as virtual content, may be displayed as being supported by an assembly standing on the floor, may be displayed as being placed (e.g., floating) in a space without being connected to other objects (either physical or virtual) in the space, or may be displayed in any other desired manner.</p><p id="p-0318" num="0317">The virtual whiteboard may be configured for making markings. For example, virtual content may be added onto, or removed from, a surface of the virtual whiteboard. Such virtual content may include texts, drawings, colors, shapes, icons, logos, pictures, graphics, annotations, videos, animations, documents, files, links, programs, scripts, or any other desired representation of data. Such virtual content may be displayed to be on the surface of the virtual whiteboard, and to be facing a direction same as or substantially similar to a direction that the virtual whiteboard may be facing. The virtual content on the virtual whiteboard may be within the borders of the virtual whiteboard. The virtual content on the virtual whiteboard may be modified in any desired manner. Using the virtual whiteboard (e.g., adding, removing, or modifying virtual content) may be carried out via user commands. As further described herein, the virtual whiteboard may be used in various manners and to implement various functions.</p><p id="p-0319" num="0318">In some examples, the virtual whiteboard may resemble a physical whiteboard. Just as physical whiteboards may be located in physical spaces, virtual whiteboards may be tied to physical spaces. For example, a virtual whiteboard may be tied to a physical space such as a conference room, a classroom, a discussion room, a work room, an office, a living room, a bedroom, a kitchen, a hall, a concourse, an indoor space, a playground, an outdoor space, or any other desired environment. Tying the virtual whiteboard to a physical space may, for example, enable a user of an extended reality appliance in the physical space to post content on the virtual whiteboard, for later viewing by another user even when the posting user is no longer physically located in the physical space of the virtual whiteboard. In some examples, a virtual whiteboard tied to a physical space may be configured to have a particular orientation and a particular position relative to the settings of the physical space. This may enable the virtual whiteboard, when displayed in the physical space, to have a consistent (e.g., fixed) orientation and position relative to the settings of the physical space. For example, a virtual whiteboard tied to a particular conference room in a building may, when invoked, be displayed consistently as being placed on a particular part of a specific wall of the conference room. In some examples, a virtual whiteboard may be a surface that enables different users in a vicinity of the virtual whiteboard to add virtual content for presentation on the virtual whiteboard by interacting with the virtual whiteboard, and/or erase visual content presented on the virtual whiteboard (for example, by interacting with the virtual whiteboard) and/or view visual content presented on the whiteboard. Some non-limiting examples of such virtual content are described above. Some non-limiting examples of such interactions are describes below. In some examples, a virtual whiteboard may be a virtual object mimicking and/or extending the functionality of a physical whiteboard.</p><p id="p-0320" num="0319">Some disclosed embodiments may involve receiving via a wireless network, an indication of a location of a first wearable extended reality appliance (WER-Appliance). A wireless network may include, for example, a Wi-Fi network, a WiMAX network, a cellular network (e.g., 2G, 3G, 4G, or 5G), a mobile network, a satellite communication network, a terrestrial microwave network, a wireless personal area network, a wireless local area network, a wireless ad hoc network, a wireless metropolitan area network, a wireless wide area network, a wireless global area network, a space network, or any other type of computer network that may use wireless data connections between network nodes.</p><p id="p-0321" num="0320">The location of the first wearable extended reality appliance may be determined, and the information may be sent to at least one processor via the non-transitory computer-readable medium (e.g., a processor of the server <b>210</b>). The determination of the location of the first wearable extended reality appliance may be based on one or more positioning systems included in the first wearable extended reality appliance, such as Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors, indoor positioning systems, Wi-Fi-based positioning systems, presence reporting systems for tagged objects, radio-frequency identification (RFID) systems, positioning systems based on received signal strength indications of wireless networks, or other types of desired mechanisms configured to identify device locations. The location of the first wearable extended reality appliance may be determined periodically, such as continuously, every 0.1 seconds, every 0.5 seconds, every 1 second, every 2 seconds, every 3 seconds, or at any other desired interval. In other examples, the location of the first wearable extended reality appliance may be determined when needed, at random points in time, and so forth. Such location information as monitored and updated may be sent to, and received by, the at least one processor of the non-transitory computer-readable medium.

The repository of virtual whiteboards and locations thereof may refer to a data storage containing, for example, a table of virtual whiteboards (e.g., data for presentation on virtual whiteboards) and corresponding locations of the virtual whiteboards. For example, each virtual whiteboard of the virtual whiteboards indicated in the table may have a corresponding location stored in the table. The repository may be implemented based on or in a similar manner as data structure <b>212</b>. In some examples, the repository of virtual whiteboards and locations may be any data-structure searchable by location and enabling retrieval of whiteboards by physical location. In some examples, the location of the first wearable extended reality appliance may be a particular room (such as a particular meeting room, a particular office room, etc.), the lookup in the repository may be based on the particular room to identify one or more virtual whiteboards positioned in the particular room, and it may be determined that the location of the first wearable extended reality appliance corresponds to the one or more virtual whiteboards positioned in the particular room. In one example, the particular room may be a particular physical room, and the first wearable extended reality appliance may be located in the particular physical room. In some examples, the location of the first wearable extended reality appliance may be and/or indicate a particular wall (or a particular surface of a different type) visible to a user of the first wearable extended reality appliance, the lookup in the repository may be based on the location of the first wearable extended reality appliance and/or the particular wall to identify one or more virtual whiteboards placed on the particular wall, and it may be determined that the location of the first wearable extended reality appliance corresponds to the one or more virtual whiteboards placed on the particular wall. In one example, the particular wall may be identified by the position and direction of the first wearable extended reality appliance. In another example, the particular wall may be identified by analyzing image data captured by an image sensor included in the first wearable extended reality appliance to detect the particular wall in the image data. In some examples, the lookup in the repository may identify one or more virtual whiteboards positioned in a distance smaller than a selected threshold from the location of the first wearable extended reality appliance, and it may be determined that the location of the first wearable extended reality appliance corresponds to the identified one or more virtual whiteboards. In some non-limiting examples, the threshold may be selected based on a user of the first wearable extended reality appliance, based on the location of the first wearable extended reality appliance, based on a direction of the first wearable extended reality appliance, based on the whiteboard, based on a dimension of the whiteboard, based on a type of the whiteboard, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0324" num="0323">In some examples, when a particular virtual whiteboard is initially generated for a physical space, a registration process may be triggered, where identification of the virtual whiteboard and the location of the virtual whiteboard may be determined and sent to the repository. The generated virtual whiteboard may be tied to the physical space. The location of the virtual whiteboard may include, for example, a set of GPS coordinates, a building identifier, a room identifier, a space identifier, an office identifier, or any other type of positioning data. The information pair of the virtual whiteboard identification and the virtual whiteboard location may be received by the repository, and may be stored by the repository (e.g., in a data table). In some examples, an orientation of a particular virtual whiteboard and a position of the virtual whiteboard relative to the settings of a physical space may be recorded in the repository. By doing so, when the virtual whiteboard is displayed in the physical space, the virtual whiteboard may be configured, using the orientation and position information recorded in the repository, to have a consistent (e.g., fixed) orientation and position relative to the settings of the physical space. For example, using the orientation and position information recorded in the repository, when the virtual whiteboard is displayed in the physical space, the virtual whiteboard may be displayed consistently as being placed on a particular part of a wall of the physical space (e.g., a conference room).</p><p id="p-0325" num="0324">Information stored in the repository may be queried or retrieved, for example, for determining whether an extended reality appliance is present in a location of any of the virtual whiteboards identified in the repository. To perform the lookup in the repository, at least one processor may use the location of the first wearable extended reality appliance as a key to search in the repository. The at least one processor may determine whether a location indication matching the location of first wearable extended reality appliance is found in the repository. If a matching location indication is found in the repository, the at least one processor may identify a virtual whiteboard corresponding to the matching location. Based on a lookup as described above, the at least one processor may determine that the location of the first wearable extended reality appliance corresponds to a location of a particular virtual whiteboard. If a location indication matching the location of the first wearable extended reality appliance is not found in the repository, the at least one processor may determine that the location of the first wearable extended reality appliance does not correspond to a location of any virtual whiteboard. A lookup in the repository may be triggered when location information of an extended reality appliance (e.g., as periodically monitored) is received by the at least one processor, and the lookup may be performed based on the received location information.</p><p id="p-0326" num="0325">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, in step <b>1912</b>, instructions contained in a non-transitory computer-readable medium when executed by a processor may cause the processor to perform a lookup in a repository of virtual whiteboards and locations thereof to determine that the location of the first wearable extended reality appliance corresponds to a location of a particular virtual whiteboard.</p><p id="p-0327" num="0326">Some disclosed embodiments may involve transmitting to the first wearable extended reality appliance, data corresponding to content of the particular virtual whiteboard to thereby enable a first user of the first wearable extended reality appliance to virtually view the content of the particular virtual whiteboard and to add virtual content to the particular virtual whiteboard.

Each of the differing users may post his or her document(s) onto the virtual whiteboard, to share the document(s) with other users.</p><p id="p-0328" num="0327">The content of the particular virtual whiteboard may be stored in the repository that may also store identifications and locations for virtual whiteboards, or in a different repository. The at least one processor may retrieve the content of the particular virtual whiteboard from the repository, and may transmit the retrieved content to the first wearable extended reality appliance. In some examples, the at least one processor may retrieve the configuration of the virtual whiteboard (e.g., the size, shape, texture, or frame of the virtual whiteboard), which may be stored in the repository. The at least one processor may transmit the configuration of the virtual whiteboard to the first wearable extended reality appliance.</p><p id="p-0329" num="0328">The first wearable extended reality appliance may receive the transmitted content of the particular virtual whiteboard. In some examples, the first wearable extended reality appliance may receive the transmitted configuration of the particular virtual whiteboard. The first wearable extended reality appliance may, based on the received data, render the virtual whiteboard and the content of the virtual whiteboard, as a virtual representation to a first user of the first wearable extended reality appliance. The first user may include a person using the first wearable extended reality appliance, such as a student, a teacher, a presenter, a participant, a worker, an individual, or any other member of the population. Using the first wearable extended reality appliance, the first user may virtually view the rendered virtual whiteboard and the rendered content of the virtual whiteboard.</p><p id="p-0330" num="0329">The first user may add virtual content to the particular virtual whiteboard. The added virtual content may include, for example, text, drawings, colors, shapes, icons, logos, pictures, graphics, annotations, videos, animations, documents, files, links, programs, scripts, scribbles, handwritten texts, or any other desired representation of data. In some examples, the added content may include animated content, such as videos, sequentially displayed images, moving pictures, motion pictures, or any other type of content with moving elements. In some examples, the added content may include a drawing made by the first user through interaction with the particular virtual whiteboard. For example, a physical drawing tool or a digital representation of a drawing tool may be provided to the first user. The drawing tool when activated may follow a travel path of an input device associated with the first wearable extended reality appliance. Using the drawing tool, the travel path of the input device may be projected onto the virtual whiteboard, thereby allowing the first user to draw on the virtual whiteboard. Additionally or alternatively, when the drawing tool is intersecting with and/or is touching and/or in proximity of a region of the particular virtual whiteboard, a marking may be added to the region of the particular virtual whiteboard. The characteristics of the marking added (such as color, size, texture, etc.) may be selected based on the drawing tool, based on a parameter of the intersection, based on a parameter of the touch, based on the proximity, based on an analysis of the movement of the drawing tool, based on the virtual whiteboard, and so forth. In another example, a part of a body of the first user (such as a digit, a hand, etc.) may be used by the first user to add content through interaction with the particular virtual whiteboard. For example, when the part of the body is intersecting with and/or is touching and/or in proximity of a region of the particular virtual whiteboard, a marking may be added to the region of the particular virtual whiteboard. The characteristics of the marking added (such as color, size, texture, etc.) may be selected based on the gesture, based on a parameter of the intersection, based on a parameter of the touch, based on the proximity, based on the virtual whiteboard, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0331" num="0330">To add virtual content to the virtual whiteboard, the first user may input user commands to the first wearable extended reality appliance using an input device associated with the first wearable extended reality appliance. The virtual whiteboard may have one or more functions that may allow the first user to add virtual content to the virtual whiteboard. For example, a function to add text may allow the first user to type text onto the virtual whiteboard. As another example, a function to add drawings may allow the first user to draw on the virtual whiteboard. By way of another example, a function to add files may allow the first user to upload a file onto the virtual whiteboard. As another example, a function to add pictures may allow the first user to upload a picture onto the virtual whiteboard. Other functions to add virtual content to the virtual whiteboard may be provided as desired. The first user may use an input device of the first wearable extended reality appliance to invoke one or more of the functions, and to add virtual content to the virtual whiteboard. In addition, the virtual whiteboard may have functions to modify or remove virtual content of the virtual whiteboard.

For example, receiving may include obtaining by at least one processor, signals reflecting virtual content. Based on the adding of the virtual content to the particular virtual whiteboard by the first user, the first wearable extended reality appliance may send signals reflecting the added virtual content to the at least one processor. The at least one processor may receive, during a first time period, the virtual content added by the first user. The virtual content added by the first user may be received from the first wearable extended reality appliance, from a device associated with the first wearable extended reality appliance, from a fixed camera placed in a vicinity of the particular virtual whiteboard, or from any other suitable entities having information associated with the added virtual content. In some examples, the first time period may be a time period before the first wearable extended reality appliance leaves the location of the particular virtual whiteboard. For example, the first time period may include the time of the addition of the virtual content to the particular virtual by the first user. In some examples, the first time period may be a time period after the first wearable extended reality appliance is no longer in the location of the particular virtual whiteboard. In some examples, the first time period may be a time period during which the first wearable extended reality appliance leaves the location of the particular virtual whiteboard. For example, the first time period may be a time period after the time of the addition of the virtual content to the particular virtual by the first user. For example, the virtual content added to the particular virtual whiteboard by the first user may be received from an external device that stored the virtual content from the time of the addition. The external device may provide the virtual content (for example, by transmitting it) once the first wearable extended reality appliance leaves the location of the particular virtual whiteboard and/or after the first wearable extended reality appliance is no longer in the location of the particular virtual whiteboard (for example, to overcome communication problems at the location of the particular virtual whiteboard, to minimize communication costs, and so forth).

Based on receiving the virtual content added by the first user from the first wearable extended reality appliance, the at least one processor may store the added content in the repository of virtual whiteboards and locations thereof. The added content may be stored in the repository in association with the particular virtual whiteboard to which the added content is added.</p><p id="p-0336" num="0335">Consistent with disclosed embodiments, instructions contained in a non-transitory computer-readable medium may include receiving via the wireless network at a second time period after the first wearable extended reality appliance is no longer in the location of the particular virtual whiteboard, an indication that a second wearable extended reality appliance is in the location of the particular virtual whiteboard. After the first user has added the virtual content to the particular virtual whiteboard using the first wearable extended reality appliance, the first wearable extended reality appliance may leave the location of the particular virtual whiteboard. For example, the first user may leave the location of the particular virtual whiteboard, and may take the first wearable extended reality appliance with him or her. At a second time period after the first wearable extended reality appliance is no longer in the location of the particular virtual whiteboard, a second wearable extended reality appliance (which may differ from or be the same as the first wearable extended reality appliance) may arrive at the location of the particular virtual whiteboard. For example, a second user in possession of the second wearable extended reality appliance, may arrive at a vicinity of the virtual whiteboard. By way of another example, a second user may enter a conference room, a classroom, a discussion room, a work room, an office, a meeting room, a living room, a bedroom, a kitchen, a hall, a concourse, an indoor space, a playground, an outdoor space, or any other desired environment associated with the location of the particular virtual whiteboard, and may take the second wearable extended reality appliance with him or her.</p><p id="p-0337" num="0336">In a similar manner as the first wearable extended reality appliance, the second wearable extended reality appliance (or another process or computerized system) may periodically monitor the location of the second wearable extended reality appliance. In other examples, the location of the second wearable extended reality appliance may be determined when needed, at random points in time, and so forth. For example, the second wearable extended reality appliance may use positioning systems to determine its location. The second wearable extended reality appliance may send the location information (e.g., as periodically monitored) via the wireless network to at least one processor (e.g., a processor of the server <b>210</b>). The at least one processor may receive the location information sent by the second wearable extended reality appliance. The received location information may indicate, to the at least one processor, whether the second wearable extended reality appliance is in the location of the particular virtual whiteboard (or in a location that corresponds to the location of the particular virtual whiteboard). For example, the at least one processor may compare the received location information of the second wearable extended reality appliance with locations of virtual whiteboards included in the repository. If the location information of the second wearable extended reality appliance matches the location of the particular virtual whiteboard, the at least one processor may determine that the second wearable extended reality appliance is in the location of the particular virtual whiteboard. In another example, it may be determined that the second wearable extended reality appliance is in a location that corresponds to the location of the particular virtual whiteboard in a similar manner to the determination that the location of the first wearable extended reality appliance corresponds to the location of the particular virtual whiteboard.</p><p id="p-0338" num="0337">In some examples, the second time period and the first time period may have no overlap. For example, the first time period may end before the second time period starts. In some examples, the first time period may start after the second time period ends. In some examples, the second time period and the first time period may have overlap, but may differ from one another (e.g., may be of unequal durations).

Based on receiving the indication that the second wearable extended reality appliance is in the location of the particular virtual whiteboard, at least one processor may transmit, to the second wearable extended reality appliance, data corresponding to the content of the particular virtual whiteboard (e.g., the content transmitted previously to the first wearable extended reality appliance) and corresponding to the virtual content added by the first user to the particular virtual whiteboard. Such data may be stored in memory with a marker associating the content with the virtual whiteboard. Therefore, although the first wearable extended reality device is not present, the data may be retrieved from memory and sent to the second wearable extended reality device.

That is, the at least one processor may store the added content in memory for later retrieval. The indication that the first user contributed the added content may include, for example, initials of the first user, a code associated with the first user, a username of the first user, user identification of the first user (e.g., a user identification number), a location of the first user when the first user adds the virtual content to the particular virtual whiteboard, a time when the first user adds the virtual content to the particular virtual whiteboard, a place of the first user when the first user adds the virtual content to the particular virtual whiteboard, or any other desired information associated with the first user adding the virtual content to the particular virtual whiteboard. The indication associated with the added content may be stored in connection with the added content (e.g., in the repository). The at least one processor may be configured to transmit an indication associated with the added content to the second wearable extended reality appliance. In one example, the second wearable extended reality appliance may be configured to provide a visual indication that the first user contributed the added content (for example, to a user of the second wearable extended reality appliance), for example based on the indication that the first user contributed the added content in the data transmitted to the second wearable extended reality appliance.</p><p id="p-0342" num="0341">In some examples, the data transmitted to the second wearable extended reality appliance may include an indication of when the added content was added to the particular virtual whiteboard.

For example, the added content may be permitted for posting on the particular virtual whiteboard based on images analysis of the added content to determine that there is no nudity in the added content. Additionally or alternatively, image analysis of the added content may be used to determine various characteristics of the added content, such as unclear or blurred images, images with insufficient lighting, images of restricted objects (e.g., restricted government facility), images of a confidential document or prototype, or other image features of interest. One or more criteria to permit content posting on the particular virtual whiteboard may be configured, for example, based on policies (e.g., policies of an organization or group).

Based on image analysis of the added content, when determined characteristics of the added content do not satisfy the one or more criteria, the added content might not be permitted for posting on the particular virtual whiteboard. In some examples, the type of content may be determined by analyzing the added content, for example using a visual classification algorithm classifying each content to one of a plurality of classes, where each class correspond to a content type.

The rules associating the users with the permissions to view content from the particular virtual whiteboard may include indication of whether each of the users is permitted to view content from the particular virtual whiteboard. For example, the repository of virtual whiteboards may store, for each virtual whiteboard, a user permission table for viewing content. The user permission table may list one or more users of the virtual whiteboard, and whether the one or more users have permission to view content from the virtual whiteboard. At least one processor may access the permission information for viewing content for the particular virtual whiteboard. Based on the accessed permission information, the at least one processor may determine whether a second user is permitted to view content (e.g., the content added by the first user to the particular virtual whiteboard) on the particular virtual whiteboard. In some examples, the determination that the second user is permitted to view the added content from the particular virtual whiteboard may be based on the location of the particular virtual whiteboard. In one example, the rules associating users with permissions to view content from the particular virtual whiteboard may include rules associating the users with permissions based on locations of the particular virtual whiteboard. For example, the second user may be permitted to view content from all virtual whiteboard in a first region (such as a particular building, a particular floor, a particular room, etc.). In another example, the second user may have no permission to view content from all virtual whiteboard in a second region (such as a particular building, a particular floor, a particular room, etc.). In some examples, the determination that the second user is permitted to view the added content from the particular virtual whiteboard may be based on the first user. In one example, the rules associating users with permissions to view content from the particular virtual whiteboard may include rules associating the users with permissions based on identities of content creators associated with the content to be viewed. For example, the second user may be permitted to view content added to the particular virtual whiteboard by individuals of a first group of individuals. In another example, the second user may have no permission to view content added to the particular virtual whiteboard by individuals of a second group of individuals. The determination that the second user is permitted to view the added content from the particular virtual whiteboard may be based on whether the first user is included in the first group and/or based on whether the first user is included in the second group.</p><p id="p-0359" num="0358"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating an exemplary process <b>2500</b> for viewing content from a virtual whiteboard consistent with some embodiments of the present disclosure.

Permissions to view content on a virtual whiteboard may be different for different ages of users. For example, a content item of a virtual whiteboard may be permitted to be viewed by users who are 18 years of age or older, and may not be permitted to be viewed by users who are under 18 years of age. The at least one processor may determine, based on the age of the second user, whether the second user is permitted to view content (e.g., the content added by the first user to the particular virtual whiteboard) on the particular virtual whiteboard. The age restriction for viewing a content item may be specified by the user who adds the content item to a virtual whiteboard, may be specified by other users, or may be configured based on policies (e.g., policies of an organization or group).</p><p id="p-0361" num="0360">Further embodiments may involve receiving via the wireless network at a time before the second time period, an indication of at least one class of content of interest to the second user, determining that a first part of the added content is included in the at least one class of interest to the second user, and enabling the second user to view the first part of the added content. The at least one class of content of interest to the second user may be configured by the second user. For example, the second user may identify one or more classes of content, such as scientific content, research content, accounting content, financial content, administrative content, training content, professional content, personal content, or other categories of content. The at least one processor may receive an indication of one or more content classes, for example, at a time before the second time period at which the indication that the second wearable extended reality appliance is in the location of the particular virtual whiteboard is received.</p><p id="p-0362" num="0361">The at least one processor may determine whether any part of the content added by the first user to the particular virtual whiteboard is included in at least one class of interest to the second user.

In some examples, the first user may mark or tag each of the different parts of the added content with one or more suitable classes. The at least one processor may determine whether the class(es) for each of the different parts of the added content match one or more of the at least one class of interest to the second user. Based on determining that a first part of the added content is included in the at least one class of interest to the second user, the at least one processor may send the first part of the added content to the second wearable extended reality appliance, and enable the second user to view the first part of the added content via the second wearable extended reality appliance.</p><p id="p-0363" num="0362">For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, a first user <b>2016</b> may assign different content classes to the items that may be displayed on the virtual whiteboard <b>2012</b> (e.g., the text <b>2018</b>, the image <b>2110</b>, the document <b>2020</b>, or the document <b>2022</b>).

For example, the image data may be received from the image sensor, from the first wearable extended reality appliance, from an intermediate device external to the first wearable extended reality appliance, from a memory unit, and so forth. The image data may be analyzed to detect a physical object moving in a trajectory, for example using an object tracking algorithm. In one example, the physical object and the first user may be on opposite sides of the particular whiteboard. In one example, a presentation of the particular whiteboard via the first wearable extended reality appliance may hide, at least partly, the physical object from the first user. For example, a ray casting algorithm may be used to determine that the particular whiteboard hides, at least partly, the physical object from the first user. In one example, the trajectory of the physical object may be analyzed, for example using an extrapolation algorithm, to determine a likelihood that the physical object is about to move through a second portion of the particular whiteboard. The second portion and the first portion of the particular whiteboard may be disjoint, may be identical, may have some but not all area in common, may have no area in common, and so forth. Further, a visual indication of the second portion may be provided to the first user, for example via the first wearable extended reality appliance. In some examples, the visual indication may further indicate at least one of the physical object, a type of the physical object, a velocity of the physical object, the trajectory, a distance of the physical object from the particular whiteboard, or a likely time of intersection of the physical object with the second portion of the particular whiteboard by the physical object. In some examples, the type of the physical object may be determined, for example by analyzing the image data using an object recognition algorithm. Further, in response to a first determined type of the physical object (such as a small physical object, a fly, etc.), providing the visual indication may be avoided, and in response to a second determined type of the physical object (such as a large physical object, a person, etc.), the visual indication may be provided. In another example, the physical object may be a person, in response to a determination that the person is using a wearable device that provides the person with an indication of the particular white board, providing the visual indication may be avoided, and in response to a determination that the person is not using a wearable device that provides the person with an indication of the particular white board, the visual indication may be provided. In one example, the visual indication of the second portion may include halting the presentation of the second portion of the particular whiteboard via the first wearable extended reality appliance. In another example, the visual indication of the second portion may include a presentation of a virtual object indicating the second portion of the particular whiteboard (such as an arrow, a halo, and so forth).

For example, the second wearable extended reality appliance may be further configured to: determine that a specific content associated with a different virtual whiteboard is associated with a class that the second user of the second wearable extended reality appliance is not interested in viewing; and avoid displaying to the second user of the second wearable extended reality appliance the specific content. In some examples, the specific content may include advertisements.</p><p id="p-0369" num="0368">Viewing content in extended reality environment has significant advantages and disadvantages when compared to viewing content on a physical display. On one hand, the boundaries and size limit of the physical display vanishes, enabling viewing content of any size and in every place in the environment. Furthermore, the content may be three dimensional, and may interact with physical elements of the environment. Moreover, when it comes to privacy, content in extended reality may be viewed in private without the danger of someone catching a glimpse of the displayed content. On the other hand, display quality of extended reality appliances may be lesser than the one of physical displays, viewing the content may require usage of extended reality appliances which may be burdensome when used for long periods of time, and the content may not be easily shared with people that do not use extended reality appliances to share the extended reality environment. To enable users to enjoy the benefits of both mediums, it is desired to enable the user to easily move content from extended reality to physical displays and vise versa.</p><p id="p-0370" num="0369">Some disclosed embodiments may include a non-transitory computer readable medium containing instructions that when executed by at least one processor cause the at least one processor to perform operations for transferring virtual content to a physical display device. Virtual content may include a virtual object, inanimate virtual content, animate virtual content configured to change over time or in response to triggers, virtual two-dimensional content, virtual three-dimensional content, a virtual overlay over a portion of a physical environment or over a physical object, a virtual addition to a physical environment or to a physical object, a virtual promotion content, a virtual representation of a physical object, a virtual representation of a physical environment, a virtual document, a virtual character or persona, a virtual computer screen, a virtual widget, or any other format for displaying information virtually. In one example, the virtual object may be or include a virtual display screen (also referred to as a &#x201c;virtual display&#x201d; or a &#x201c;virtual screen&#x201d; herein), as described above. An example of such virtual display screen may include virtual screen <b>112</b>. Consistent with the present disclosure, the virtual content may include any visual presentation rendered by a computer or a processing device, for example presented in an extended reality environment by an extended reality appliance (for example, presented in an extended reality environment to a user via a wearable extended reality appliance). In one embodiment, the virtual content may include a virtual object that is a visual presentation rendered by a computer in a confined region and configured to represent an object of a particular type (such as an inanimate virtual object, an animate virtual object, virtual furniture, a virtual decorative object, virtual widget, or other virtual representation). The rendered visual presentation may change to reflect changes to a status object or changes in the viewing angle of the object, for example, in a way that mimics changes in the appearance of physical objects.</p><p id="p-0371" num="0370">A physical display device (also referred to as a &#x2018;physical display&#x2019;, a &#x2018;physical display screen&#x2019; or a &#x2018;physical screen&#x2019; herein) may include a television, a monitor, a computer screen, a laptop screen, a phone screen, a tablet, a smartwatch screen or any other tangible output device for the presentation of information in a visual form. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref> illustrates examples of various physical display devices, consistent with some embodiments of the present disclosure. For example, the physical display device may be included in a computer <b>2720</b>, in a laptop <b>2724</b>, or in a phone <b>2728</b>. Transferring virtual content to a physical display device may include relocating, transmitting, displacing, shifting, translating, or in any other way moving virtual content to the physical display device. It may be desirable to transfer virtual content to a physical device in order to view information presented in a virtual format in a different size or perspective, or to separate a presentation of virtual content that is too cluttered for proper viewing. For example, the virtual content may include several documents presented on top of one another or overlapping one another in some way. In this example, it may be desirable to transmit at least a portion of that virtual content, such as one of the documents, to a particular physical display device so that a user may view the information in that document more clearly. In another example, it may be desirable to transmit at least a portion of a virtual content to a particular physical display device so that other people, including people not using extended reality appliances or people not sharing the extended reality environment of the user, may view the virtual content. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref> illustrates an example of transferring virtual content to a physical display device, consistent connection with some embodiments of the present disclosure.

Multiple display devices located in the room may include two or more of the physical display devices described above. The multiple devices may include a variety of different types of physical display devices or a plurality of the same type of physical display device. For example, the multiple display devices may include three phones in the room. In another example, the multiple display devices may include one phone, one television, and one laptop in the room. It may be desirable to provide multiple display devices in the room so that the user may have a choice of ways in which to display the transferred virtual content, based on size, compatibility, or other features that may make a particular display device more appropriate for a given type of virtual content. For example, providing multiple display devices in the room including a phone, television, and laptop may allow a user to transfer virtual content better suited to each type of display device. The user may transfer messaging content to the phone, documents to the laptop, and videos to the television.</p><p id="p-0373" num="0372">A unique network identifier may include a MAC address, IP address, address, domain name, code, serial number, name, mark, sign, character, emblem, token, or any other sequence of words, numbers, letters, or symbols that indicate the identity of a display device. The unique network identifier may belong to or may be connected with one particular display device. It may be desirable to use a unique network identifier so that communication is established with trusted devices with associated recognized unique network identifiers, and to avoid communicating sensitive information with devices that the user may not recognize. For example, a user of the wearable extended reality appliance may be in a room with many different types of display devices, and some of these display devices may not belong to the user or may belong to other individuals. By using unique network identifiers, the transfer of virtual content to a display device in that room may be more secure since the user may only transfer virtual content to a display device with a recognized unique network identifier. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref> illustrates examples of various physical display devices, consistent with some embodiments of the present disclosure.

Receiving input may include obtaining an indication from a user, sensor information, from a device external to the wearable extended reality appliance (for example, from an input device, such as a keyboard, paired with the wearable extended reality appliance, from a computing device paired with the wearable extended reality appliance, and so forth), from a memory unit, from a database or a data-structure, or any other data or control signals by the at least one processor. Receiving input by obtaining an indication from the user may include any user interaction with any physical device configured to receive input from a user (such as a keyboard, a touch sensor, a computer mouse, a haptic glove, etc.) or from an environment of the user (for example through an image sensor, an audio sensor, a volumetric sensor, and so forth), and to provide the data to a computational device. In one example, receiving input by obtaining an indication from the user may include recognizing a gesture of the user (for example by analyzing image data using a visual gesture recognition algorithm), recognizing voice commands provided by the user (for example by analyzing audio data using a speech recognition algorithm), and so forth. The data provided to the computational device may be in a digital format and/or in an analog format. In one embodiment, the input device may store the input received from the user in a memory device accessible by a processing device (e.g., the at least one processor), and the processing device may access the stored data for analysis. In another embodiment, the input device may provide the data directly to a processing device, for example, over a bus or over another communication system configured to transfer data from the input device to the processing device. In some examples, the input received by the input device may include key presses, tactile input data, motion data, position data, direction data, image data, or any other data. Some examples of the input device may include a button, a key, a keyboard, a computer mouse, a touchpad, a touchscreen, a joystick, a microphone, or another mechanism from which input may be received. Receiving input by obtaining sensor information may include acquiring data from a sound sensor, vibration sensor, acoustic sensor, chemical sensor, magnetic sensor, position sensor, optical sensor, image sensor, pressure sensor, force sensor, thermal sensor, proximity sensor, or any other device that detects events or changes in its environment and sends the detected information to other electronics.</p><p id="p-0375" num="0374">In some embodiments, the input may be received from a pointing device associated with the wearable extended reality appliance. A pointing device may include a mouse, a touch screen, a joystick, a remote, or any other human interface device that allows a user to input spatial data to a computer. For example, the pointing device may be a mouse that is connected by either a wired or wireless connection to the wearable extended reality appliance.</p><p id="p-0376" num="0375">Some disclosed embodiments may further include analyzing the input from the pointing device to determine a cursor drag-and-drop movement of the specific virtual object on the target display device. A cursor may include a pointer, arrow, text, or any other indicator used to show the current position of user interaction on a display in response to input from the pointing device. A cursor drag-and-drop movement may include any movement associated with a pointing device in which the user selects a virtual object and drags it to a different location. The virtual object may be selected by clicking, highlighting, or hovering over the virtual object using the pointing device.

Receiving image data from the image sensor may include receiving the image data continuously, or at regular or irregular intervals. Continuously receiving the image data may be desirable when the user intends to transfer a plurality of virtual content items to one or more physical display devices. For example, when the virtual content includes a clock, a calendar, and a document, continuously receiving the image data may be appropriate so that the user may transfer one, some, or all of the virtual content to one or more physical display devices. Receiving the image data at intervals may be desirable when the user may only want to transfer virtual content during a specific period of time. For example, the user may only want to transfer virtual content while at work. In such cases, receiving the image data only during working hours of the day may be appropriate so that the user may transfer virtual content at a time of their choosing without placing the burden of continuous receipt of image data on an associated processing system (e.g., the at least one processor). In other examples, the image data may be received in response to a trigger. Some non-limiting examples of such triggers may include receiving the input to cause presentation of a specific virtual object in the virtual environment on a target display device, receiving an input from a user, entering a specific space (such as a room), and so forth.</p><p id="p-0380" num="0379">Some disclosed embodiments may include analyzing the image data to identify the target display device. Analyzing the image data may include object recognition, image segmentation, motion detection, video tracking, optical flow detection, or any other manner of extracting information from images acquired by the image sensor. For example, the processor may analyze the image data by performing object recognition on the image data to determine when a target display device is detected. Such object recognition may be accomplished through edge matching, divide-and-conquer search, greyscale matching, gradient matching, histograms of receptive field response, or any other technique for identifying objects in images or videos. In some examples, a machine learning model may be trained using training examples to identify display devices from images and/or videos. An example of such training example may include a sample image and/or a sample video of a sample display device, together with a label indicating the identity of the target display device. The trained machine learning model may be used to analyze the image data and identify the target display device. In some examples, a convolution of at least part of the image data may be calculated to obtain a result value of the calculated convolution. In response to a first result value of the calculated convolution, a first identity of the target display device may be determined, and in response to a second result value of the calculated convolution, a second identity of the target display device may be determined, the second identity may differ from the first identity.</p><p id="p-0381" num="0380">In some embodiments, analyzing the image data to identify the target display device may include determining product visual characteristics based on the image data and comparing the product visual characteristics with stored reference data to thereby determine an identity of the target display device. Product visual characteristics may include a label, logo, emblem, symbol, tag, brand name, design, stamp, sticker, insignia, mark, size, aspect ratio, frame color, or any other visible feature associated with a specific product. Stored reference data may include any information used to classify or categorize the product visual characteristics or an identity of a display device. For example, the stored reference data may include data associating various logos with specific display devices. In another example, the stored reference data may include data associating various brand names with specific display devices. The reference data may be provided by a user or generated by the processor. Using product visual characteristics and stored reference data to determine the identity of the target display device may be desirable to automate the identification of the target display device, so that the processor may perform the identification using image processing instead of a manual identification by the user for every display device in the room. For example, a target display device may have product visual characteristics in the form of a logo on the surface of the target display device. In this example, the image data may be analyzed to detect logos, for example using visual logo recognition algorithm, the processed logo data may be associated with a database of logos associated with various display devices, and the identity of the target display device may be identified based on a match in the database with the detected logo data. In another example, a target display device may have product visual characteristics in the form of a display size and/or a display aspect ratio. In this example, the image data may be analyzed to determine the display size and/or the display aspect ratio, for example based on the measurements of the target display device in the image data. The determined display size and/or display aspect ratio may be compared with a database of display sizes and/or display aspect ratios associated with various display devices, and the identity of the target display device may be identified based on a match in the database with the determined display size and/or display aspect ratio.</p><p id="p-0382" num="0381">Some disclosed embodiments may further include analyzing the image data to recognize content displayed by the target display device and to thereby determine an identity of the target display device. Content displayed by the target display device may include one or more of a symbol, image, sentence, word, letter, shape, sign, or any other visual information that may be displayed by the target display device. Using content displayed by the target display device may be desirable to automate the identification of the target display device, so that the processor may perform the identification using image processing instead of a manual identification by the user for every display device in the room. For example, the target display device may be configured to display a message that states, &#x201c;meeting room TV.&#x201d; In this example, the processor may analyze the image data to recognize the message &#x201c;meeting room TV&#x201d; to determine that the target display device is a television located in or associated with the meeting room.</p><p id="p-0383" num="0382">In some embodiments, analyzing the image data to identify the target display device may include determining a position based on the image data and comparing the position with stored position data to thereby determine an identity of the target display device. A position may include a location, area, environment, point, room, geography, locale, region, setting, site, space, surroundings, angle, direction, or any other indication of a way in which someone or something is arranged. The position may include a position of a user of the wearable user interface, another individual, a target display device, another display device, or any other object. Using a position may be desirable to automate the identification of the target display device, so that the processor may perform the identification using image processing instead of a manual identification by the user for every display device in the room. For example, the image data may be analyzed to identify that the target display device is in a meeting room. In this example, the meeting room information may be compared with stored position data that associates rooms with display devices to determine that the display device is a meeting room display device, such as a television or computer, as opposed to a personal display device, such as a phone.</p><p id="p-0384" num="0383">Some disclosed embodiments may further include detecting in the image data a visual code associated with the target display device and processing the visual code to determine the identity of the target display device. A visual code may include a QR code, barcode, textual code, numerical code, specific visual pattern, or any other visible indication of association with the target display device utilizing any combination of letters, words, number, symbols, or images. Using a visual code to determine the identity of the target display device may be desirable to automate the identification of the target display device, so that the processor may perform the identification using image processing instead of a manual identification by the user for every display device in the room. For example, a target display device may have a visual code in the form of a QR code presented on the screen of the target display device. In this example, the image data may be processed to detect information in the QR code that associates the QR code with a specific display device and this information may be used to determine the identity of the target display device.</p><p id="p-0385" num="0384">In some embodiments, the input may be received from the image sensor associated with the wearable extended reality appliance. This type of input may be desirable in order to reduce the number of devices used to transfer the virtual content to the physical display device. Additionally, since the user would be wearing the wearable extended reality appliance during the transfer, using the image sensor associated with the wearable extended reality appliance may ensure that the user can direct the input depending on the direction in which the user is facing.</p><p id="p-0386" num="0385">Some disclosed embodiments may further include analyzing the image data to identify a gesture initiated by a user of the wearable extended reality appliance that triggers a virtual collision between the specific virtual object and the target display device. A gesture may include any form of nonverbal communication in which bodily actions may be used to communicate. A gesture may include movement of the hand, fingers, leg, head, face, or other parts of the body. For example, a hand gesture may include pointing, dragging, clenching, opening, pinching, sliding, twisting, or rotating using the palm, one or more of the fingers, or the hand. In one example, the gesture may include a dragging of the virtual object to the target display device, a push the virtual object towards the target display device, and so forth. A virtual collision may include a contact, association, or any other encounter between the specific virtual object and the target display device. In some instances, the gesture may trigger a full transfer of the virtual object to the target display device. In other instances, the gesture may trigger a transfer of the virtual object to only a portion of the target display device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref> illustrates an example of a user gesture for transferring virtual content to a physical display device, consistent connection with some embodiments of the present disclosure. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref>, the virtual content <b>2910</b> includes virtual calendar <b>2716</b> and virtual clock <b>2718</b>. In this example, a user gesture <b>2918</b> of dragging the virtual clock <b>2718</b> to a target display device (i.e., computer <b>2916</b>) triggers a virtual collision between the virtual clock <b>2718</b> and the target display device by causing the virtual clock <b>2718</b> and the target display device to at least partly be in a same common region of the extended reality environment.</p><p id="p-0387" num="0386">Some disclosed embodiments may include upon identifying the target display device, determining a network identifier of the target display device. Determining a network identifier of the target display device may include using the identity of the target display device to access a data-structure or a database associating display devices with network identifiers, and thereby obtaining the network identifier of the target display device. In other examples, the network identifier of the target display device may be an encoding or another simple transformation of the identifier of the target display device. In other examples, determining a network identifier of the target display device may include scanning, examining, inspecting, or in any other way receiving information regarding a unique network identifier associated with a physical display device. The network identifier may be determined using an image sensor, a barcode reader, a magnetic stripe reader, or any other device that is capable of detecting an identifier. For example, a network identifier associated with a physical display device may be encoded on a barcode or another visual code, and the barcode number may be determined by using an image sensor to measure the intensity of light reflected back by the white spaces within the unique pattern of parallel bars in the barcode. The network identifier may also be obtained by requesting the target display device to transmit the identifier to the processor or the wearable extended reality appliance.</p><p id="p-0388" num="0387">Some disclosed embodiments may include using the determined network identifier of the target display device to establish a communications link with the target display device. Establishing a communications link may include creating a communications channel that connects the target display device to at least one other device. The communications channel may be either a wired communication channel or a wireless communication channel. A wired communication channel may utilize coaxial cables, Ethernet, or any other channel that transmits information over a wired connection. A wireless communication channel may utilize Wi-Fi, Bluetooth&#x2122;, or any other channel that transmits information without a wired connection. It may be desirable to establish a communications link with the target display device in order to ensure that information is only being communicated on a recognized communications channel, which may improve user privacy. For example, establishing a communications link with the target display device may include creating a Bluetooth&#x2122; or other wireless communication links between the target display device and another device so that the target display device and the other device may communicate wirelessly, allowing a wireless transfer of the virtual content to the target display device. Some non-limiting examples of such established communication link may include at least one of a communications link between the wearable extended reality appliance and the target display device, a communications link between a computing device associated with the wearable extended reality appliance and the target display device, a communications link between a computing device coordinating the extended reality environment and the target display device, a communications link between a computing device generating the virtual object and the target display device, a communications link between a computing device providing content for presentation to the wearable extended reality appliance and the target display device, and so forth. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>, a determined network identifier &#x201c;ID 2&#x201d; <b>2726</b> of laptop <b>2724</b> is used to establish a communications link <b>2832</b> with the target display device (i.e., laptop <b>2724</b>).</p><p id="p-0389" num="0388">In some embodiments, the communications link may be established between the wearable extended reality appliance and the target display device. It may be desirable to establish the communications link between the wearable extended reality appliance and the target display device in order to enable a direct connection between the two devices. This may improve the speed of transfer between virtual content presented on the wearable extended reality appliance to the target display device. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>, a wireless communications link <b>2832</b> may be established between the wearable extended reality appliance <b>2712</b> and the target display device in the form of laptop <b>2724</b>.</p><p id="p-0390" num="0389">In some embodiments, the communications link may be established between a computing device associated with the wearable extended reality appliance and the target display device. A computing device may include a smartphone, keyboard, computer, or any other device that may be used to accept inputs, process the inputs, and output information. It may be desirable to establish the communications link between a computing device associated with the wearable extended reality appliance and the target display device in order to reduce a burden on an existing communications link between the wearable extended reality appliance and the target display device, or in the case that the computing device is better located or equipped to form a communications link with the target display device. For example, in a large room, a wearable extended reality appliance may be connected to a smartphone and may be located at a distance beyond the Wi-Fi range of the target display device. In this example, the smartphone may be located at a distance within the Wi-Fi range of the target display device. In such an instance, a Wi-Fi communications link may be established between the smartphone connected to the wearable extended reality appliance and the target display device because the smartphone may be better positioned to establish that Wi-Fi link.</p><p id="p-0391" num="0390">Some disclosed embodiments may include transmitting data representing the specific virtual object to the target display device, wherein the transmitted data enables the target display device to present the specific virtual object. Transmitting the data may include communicating the data to the target display device using the established communications link. It may be desirable to use the established communications link in order to improve privacy by ensuring that a recognized communications channel is used to transfer the virtual content. Alternatively, transmitting the data may include communicating the data to the target display device using another communications link. It may be desirable to use another communications link to improve system efficiency and speed by reducing the burden on a single communications link for several types of communication. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>, data representing the virtual calendar <b>2716</b> is transmitted to the target display device <b>2724</b> through the communications link <b>2832</b>, and the transmitted data enables the target display device <b>2724</b> to present the virtual calendar <b>2716</b>.</p><p id="p-0392" num="0391">In some embodiments, the specific virtual object may be a virtual screen playing media content, and the transmission of the data may cause the media content to be presented through the target display device. In one example, virtual screen (also referred to as a &#x201c;virtual display&#x201d; or a &#x201c;virtual display screen&#x201d; herein) may include any bounded shape or presentation area, such as a rectangular window containing one or more virtual objects. Other examples are described above. Media content may include one or more of an image, data, text, sound, video, or any other information or experience directed at an end-user or audience in publishing, art, or communication. For example, the specific virtual object may be a virtual screen playing a movie, and the transmission of the data may cause the movie to be presented through the target display device. In some embodiments, the specific virtual object may be a virtual screen (also referred to as a &#x201c;virtual display&#x201d; or a &#x201c;virtual display screen&#x201d; herein) displaying content generated by a graphical operating system, and the transmission of the data may cause the content generated by the graphical operating system to be presented through the target display device. In one example, the graphical operating system may be paired with a physical keyboard, and text entered using the physical keyboard may be presented in a word processing application running over the operating system and (at least previously) displayed on the virtual screen. In this example, the transmission of the data may cause the word processing application running over the operating system to be displayed on the target display device, and therefore may cause text entered using the physical keyboard to appear on the target display device.</p><p id="p-0393" num="0392">Some disclosed embodiments may further include determining that the specific virtual object is classified as private, requesting a permission for displaying the specific virtual object through the target display device, and transmitting the data representing the specific virtual object to the target display device only after receiving the permission. Some disclosed embodiments may also include in response to receiving a denial of the permission, avoiding transmitting the information. A private virtual object may include a virtual object that is confidential, exclusive, secret, discreet, non-public, or in any other way belonging to or for the use of one particular person or group of people only. Transmitting the data only after receiving the permission for a private virtual object may be desirable when a user does not wish to share the private virtual object (e.g., personal information) with the general public and may want to authorize each request for the private virtual object to ensure that the user is comfortable with sharing the information with a specific individual or group of individuals. For example, the specific virtual object may be a banking application of the user of the wearable extended reality appliance. In this example, the user's financial advisor may request a permission for displaying the banking appliance through a television in a meeting room consisting of the user and the financial advisor. The user may grant the permission since the financial advisor may be a trusted individual whom the user may trust with sensitive and confidential financial information presented on the banking application. Thus, the data representing the banking application may be transmitted to the television. In another example, the user may be waiting in the same meeting room for his financial advisor to arrive. In the meantime, if another individual that the user does not know requests permission for displaying the banking application through the television, the user may deny the permission. In this example, the transmission of the information would be avoided in order to preserve the confidentiality of the user's financial information.</p><p id="p-0394" num="0393">Some disclosed embodiments may further include determining that the specific virtual object is classified as private, determining that the target display device is authorized for presenting the private information, and in response to the determination that the target display device is authorized for presenting the private information, transmitting the data representing the specific virtual object to the target display device. A private virtual object may include a virtual object similar to those described above. Transmitting the data in response to determining that the target display device is authorized for presenting the private information may be desirable to ensure that sensitive or confidential information is only presented on devices that are capable of and appropriate for displaying such information. For example, the specific virtual object may be a banking application of the user of the wearable extended reality appliance. In this example, the target display device may be a television in a meeting room of a bank associated with the banking application. In such an instance, the television may be determined to be authorized for presenting the banking application, and in response to this determination, the data representing the banking application may be transmitted to the television, so that financial information may be presented in a display device that is appropriate for the sensitive nature of the information. In another example using the same banking application, the target display device may be a computer in a living room of a friend whom the user is visiting. In this example, the computer may be determined to not be authorized for presenting the private information, and transmission of the data representing the banking application to the computer would be avoided in order to preserve the confidentiality of the user's financial information, which the user may not want the friend to view.</p><p id="p-0395" num="0394">Some disclosed embodiments may further include determining that the specific virtual object is classified as private, analyzing the image data to determine presence of individuals other than a user of the wearable extended reality appliance exposed to the target display device, in response to a determination of no individuals other than the user exposed to the target display device, transmitting the data representing the specific virtual object to the target display device, and in response to a determination of more than one individual is exposed to the target display device, avoiding transmission of the data representing the specific virtual object to the target display device. A private virtual object may include a virtual object similar to those described above. Individuals exposed to the target display device may include individuals within a specific geographical range of the target display device, or individuals that may be able to view information displayed on the target display device. Transmitting information to the target display device based on the absence of individuals other than the user of the wearable extended reality appliance may be desirable to ensure that the confidentiality of the user's sensitive information is preserved by not presenting that information to individuals other than the user. For example, the specific virtual object may be a document containing secret information that the user may not wish to share with others, and the user may be standing in an office room, where the target display device is a computer. In this example, the image data may be analyzed to determine whether other individuals are in the office room, and in response to a determination that no other individuals are present in the office room, the data representing the document may be transmitted to the computer. Alternatively, the image data may be analyzed to determine that someone else is in the office room, and in response to a determination of that other individual's presence in the room, transmission of the data representing the document to the computer may be avoided, in order to preserve the confidentiality of the information in the document. In some examples, a machine learning model may be trained using training examples to determine presence of individuals exposed to display devices. An example of such training example may include a sample image and/or a sample video of a sample room including a sample display device, together with a label indicating whether individuals in the sample room are exposed to the sample display device. The trained machine learning model may be used to analyze the image data and determine the presence of individuals other than a user of the wearable extended reality appliance that are exposed to the target display device. In some examples, the image data may be analyzed to detect persons in the room and to determine pose of the detected persons, for example using a visual person detection algorithm and a visual pose estimation algorithm. Further, the pose and location of a person may be used to determine whether the person is exposed to the target display device, for example using ray casting algorithm involving the location of the eyes of the person (based on the determined pose).</p><p id="p-0396" num="0395">Some disclosed embodiments may further include, after transmitting the data representing the specific virtual object to the target display device: determining that an individual other than the user is likely to be exposed to the target display device; and in response to the determination that the individual other than the user is likely to be exposed to the target display device, causing the target display device to cease presentation of the specific virtual object. An individual that is likely to be exposed to the target display device may include an individual within a specific geographical range or proximity of the target display device, an individual that may be able to view information displayed on the target display device, or an individual that is in a location where they may soon be within the specific geographical range of the target display device or be able to view information displayed on the target display device. Causing the target display device to cease presentation of the specific virtual object may include turning off the entire display of the target display device, removing the specific virtual object from the display of the target display device, or pixilating or blurring the virtual object to make it illegible. Ceasing presentation of the specific virtual object on the target display device in response to the determination that the individual other than the user is likely to be exposed to the target display device may be desirable to continuously preserve the confidentiality of sensitive information, even after an initial determination of an absence of other individuals is made. Continuing from the previous example where the data representing the document was transmitted to the computer, the processor may determine after this transmission that an individual other than the user is about to enter the office room, making the individual likely to be exposed to the computer. In this example, the computer may be turned off, or the document may be removed from the display presented on the computer, in order to preserve the confidentiality of the information in the document in view of the individual that may soon enter the office room.</p><p id="p-0397" num="0396">Some disclosed embodiments may further include causing the specific virtual object to disappear from the extended reality environment once the specific virtual object is presented through the target display device. Causing the specific virtual object to disappear from the extended reality environment after its presentation through the target display device may be desirable to reduce the processing burden on the system and the redundancy of displaying the same information on two different modalities (e.g., physical display devices and one or more virtual screens) at the same time. Causing the specific virtual object to disappear from the extended reality environment may also reduce a user's visual confusion upon being presented with the same information on two different displays, thereby allowing the user to better focus on the information presented. For example, the specific virtual object may be a movie, and presenting the movie through both the wearable extended reality appliance and a target display device may cause confusion to the user, and may not allow the user to understand the movie. In this example, the processor may cause the movie to disappear from the extended reality environment once the movie is presented through the target display device, in order to avoid user confusion.</p><p id="p-0398" num="0397">Some disclosed embodiments may further include displaying via the wearable extended reality appliance a virtual indicator indicating that the specific virtual object is presented through the target display device. A virtual indicator may include a color, pattern, shape, text, message, picture, symbol, or any other sign that that shows the condition or existence of the specific virtual object being presented through the target display device. It may be desirable to display the virtual indicator via the extended reality appliance so that a user of the wearable extended reality appliance may be put on notice of the specific virtual object being presented through the target display device. This may be relevant in cases where the specific virtual object was accidentally transmitted to the target display device. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref>, the virtual clock <b>2718</b> is the specific virtual object that is presented through the target display device in the form of computer <b>2916</b>. In this example, the virtual indicator may be a greyed-out virtual clock <b>2920</b> displayed via the wearable extended reality appliance to signal to the user of the wearable extended reality appliance that the virtual clock <b>2718</b> is being presented through computer <b>2916</b>.</p><p id="p-0399" num="0398">Some disclosed embodiments may further include generating a virtual controller associated with the target display device, the virtual controller enabling modification of display parameters of the target display device. A virtual controller may include a clicker, remote, joystick, wheel, pad, button, or any other mechanism for controlling any audio or visual aspect of an extended reality display. Generating a virtual controller associated with the target display device may be desirable to adjust a size, volume, angle, perspective, or any other audio or visual aspect of the target display device. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>, a virtual controller in the form of a remote <b>3020</b> is generated, wherein the remote <b>3020</b> is associated with the target display device in the form of computer <b>3016</b>. In this example, the remote <b>3020</b> may be used to enlarge or reduce the size of the virtual clock <b>2718</b> presented on computer <b>3016</b> to enable a user to view the virtual clock <b>2718</b> better. In another example, the target display device may be a television presenting a video with sound. In this example, a virtual remote may be generated to control the volume of the television so that a user may better hear the sounds associated with the video presented on the television.</p><p id="p-0400" num="0399">After the target display device begins presenting the specific virtual object, some disclosed embodiments may further include receiving additional input, and modifying the specific virtual object on the target display device based on the additional input. The additional input may be received from the user or the processor. The additional input may be received from the user through interaction with a user input device, such as a button, a key, a keyboard, a computer mouse, a touchpad, a touchscreen, a joystick, or another mechanism from which input may be received. The additional input may additionally, or alternatively, be received from the processor based on an automated assessment of further modifications that may be appropriate for the specific virtual object on the target display device. Modifying the specific virtual object may include adjusting or changing one or more of a size, angle, color, position, orientation, perspective, text, object, sound, or any other audio or visual aspect of the virtual object. It may be desirable to modify the specific virtual object on the target display device based on the additional input in order to allow a user to adjust a size of the virtual object to see it better, add text to a virtual document in order to complete work tasks, or in any other way change the virtual object to better fit the needs or desires of the user. For example, the specific virtual object may be a movie window, and the processor may determine that the size of the movie window is too large to fit entirely within a target television display. In this example, the processor may provide additional input to reduce the size of the movie window to fit within the screen of the television. In another example, the specific virtual object may be a document, and a user may provide additional input by typing into a keyboard text to be added to the document. In this example, the processor may receive the additional input to add the typed text to the document.</p><p id="p-0401" num="0400">After the target display device begins presenting the specific virtual object, some disclosed embodiments may further include receiving an additional input indicating a desire of a user of the wearable extended reality appliance to stop presenting the specific virtual object through the target display device; and in response to receiving the additional input, causing the target display device to cease presentation of the specific virtual object by the target display device. An additional input indicating a desire of the user of the wearable extended reality appliance to stop presenting the specific virtual object through the target display device may be received through interaction with a user input device, such as those described above. Causing the target display device to cease presentation of the specific virtual object by the target display device may include transmitting information configured to cause the target display device to stop displaying the content to the system controlling the physical display, halting transmission of data to a system controlling the target display device, or in any other way stopping the presentation of the specific virtual object on the target display device. Ceasing presentation of the specific virtual object by the target display device in response to receiving additional input indicating such a desire of the user may be desirable so that the user may prevent others from viewing sensitive information, or if the user no longer wants to view information on the target display device. For example, the specific virtual object may be a document and after a target computer presents the document, the user may finish reading the document. In this example, the user may click a button to provide additional input indicating that the user no longer wishes to present the document on the computer, and in response to receiving this additional input, data may be transmitted to a system controlling the computer to cease presentation of the document on the computer, since the user has finished reading the document.</p><p id="p-0402" num="0401">In some embodiments, the additional input indicating the desire of the user of the wearable extended reality appliance to stop presenting the specific virtual object through the target display device may include an indication that the wearable extended reality appliance left the room. An indication that the wearable extended reality appliance left the room may be provided through user input or sensor input. A user input may be received through interaction with a user input device, such as those described above. A sensor input may be received via data from a position sensor, image sensor, proximity sensor, or any other device that may generate information indicative of the presence or absence of the wearable extended reality appliance in the room. It may be desirable to stop presenting the specific virtual object through the target display device based on an indication that the wearable extended reality appliance left the room so that the processor is not burdened with presenting information that the user is not able to view, and so that others may not view the information after the user has left the room. For example, the room may be a living room, and a position sensor may provide information indicating that the wearable extended reality appliance has moved to a dining room. In this example, the indication that the wearable extended reality appliance has moved to a dining room may indicate the desire of the user of the wearable extended reality appliance to stop presenting the specific virtual object through the target display device in the living room, since the user is no longer in the living room to view the presented information.</p><p id="p-0403" num="0402">Some disclosed embodiments may further include, after ceasing the presentation of the specific virtual object, receiving an indication that the wearable extended reality appliance reentered the room, and causing a renewal of the presentation of the specific virtual object by the target display device in response to the reentrance. An indication that the wearable extended reality appliance reentered the room may be provided through user input or sensor input. A user input may be received through interaction with a user input device, such as those described above. A sensor input may be received via data from a sensor, such as those described above. It may be desirable to renew the presentation of the specific virtual object through the target display device in response to the reentrance in order to improve processing speed by avoiding repeating the steps of receiving input associated with the wearable extended reality appliance, receiving image data from the image sensor, analyzing the image data to identify the target display device, upon identifying the target display device, determining a network identifier of the target display device, using the determined network identifier of the target display device to establish a communications link with the target display device, and transmitting data representing the specific virtual object to the target display device. Continuing from the example of the living room above, after ceasing presentation of the specific virtual object, the position sensor may provide information indicating that the wearable extended reality appliance has reentered the living room. In this example, a renewal of the presentation of the specific virtual object by the target display device may be caused in response to the reentrance, so that a user may once again view the specific virtual object without having to repeat the initial steps.</p><p id="p-0404" num="0403">Some disclosed embodiments may further include receiving additional input to cause presentation of content from a second display device through the wearable extended reality appliance; receiving second image data from the image sensor, the second image data depicting the second display device; analyzing the second image data to identify the second display device; upon identifying the second display device, determining a network identifier of the second display device; using the determined network identifier of the second display device to establish a communications link with the second display device; receiving data representing the content from the second display device; and displaying through the wearable extended reality appliance the content from the second display device. The second display device may include a physical display device, such as one of those described above. It may be desirable to display through the wearable extended reality appliance the content from the second display device so that a user may view content in a virtual space which is not limited by the constraints of a physical display device, such as size or perspective. For example, the user may press a button to cause presentation of a movie from a second display device, such as a phone, through the wearable extended reality appliance. In this example, the processing steps described above may be performed so that the movie from the phone is displayed through the wearable extended reality appliance, so that the user may enlarge the size of the movie for better viewability.</p><p id="p-0405" num="0404">Some embodiments may include a method for transferring virtual content to a physical display device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref> is a flowchart of an exemplary method <b>3100</b> of coordinating virtual content display with mobility status, consistent connection with some embodiments of the present disclosure.

When sharing virtually presented visual content among computers, for example in a video call, it is useful to visually indicate portions of the virtually presented visual content, for example using a mouse cursor controlled by one user and visible to the other user. However, when sharing content among extended reality appliances, the usage of a cursor to indicate portions of the content may be counterproductive, as it breaks the natural experience that the usage of extended reality appliances calls for. That is, it fails to mimic the experience of discussing physically presented visual content. It is therefore desire to allow visual indication of a portion of the content produced by a first user through natural hand gestures to be visually available to a second user viewing the content using an extended reality appliance at a remote location. When the extended reality is a mixed reality or an augmented reality, the position from which the first user use the hand gesture to indicate the portion of the content may not be available for the second user, for example due to different layouts of the physical spaces of the two users (for example, the first user may stand at a location in relation to the content that corresponds to a wall in the physical space of the second user). Therefore, in some cases it is desired to adjust the visual indications to the physical environments of the users.</p><p id="p-0408" num="0407">Disclosed embodiments, including methods, systems, apparatuses, and non-transitory computer-readable media, may relate to simulating user interactions with shared content. Shared content may include any information communicated between two or more entities (e.g., users or devices). For example, the shared content may include visual content, textual content, audio content, graphical content, virtual white board, virtual display screen, two-dimensional content, three-dimensional content, animated content, inanimate content, live content, real-time content, Internet content, cinema content, television content, radio content, smartphone content, live events, physical objects, virtual objects, or any other type of information. In some examples, the shared content may be communicated between two or more wearable extended realty appliances. For example, content (physical or virtual) viewed by a user of a wearable extended reality appliance may be transmitted to another wearable extended reality appliance for display to another user.</p><p id="p-0409" num="0408">A user interaction may include any action associated with a user or an entity. For example, the user interaction may include a finger gesture, a hand gesture, an eye gesture, a mouth gesture, a face gesture, or an action of one or more other parts of a person's body. As an example, the user interaction may include any finger or hand motion, such as a drag, a pinch, a spread, a swipe, a tap, a pointing, a scroll, a rotate, a flick, a touch, a zoom-in, a zoom-out, a thumb-up, a thumb-down, a touch-and-hold, or any other action of a finger or hand. As another example, the user interaction may include a location or movement of the attention (e.g., gaze) of a user. As another example, the user interaction may include a sound (e.g., voice) of a user. Additionally or alternatively, the user interaction may include an action via an object (physical or virtual), such as a pen, an eraser, a pointer stick, a laser pointer, a cursor, or any other item.</p><p id="p-0410" num="0409">Simulating user interactions may include, for example, generating an indication of a user interaction of a user to another user. In some examples, a user may cause a user interaction (e.g., with particular content), and an indication of the user interaction may be transmitted for display to another user. A simulated user interaction may be based on a user interaction initiated by a user, and may be same as or similar to the initiated user interaction. In some examples, the simulated user interaction may be different from the initiated user interaction. As one example, the initiated user interaction may include a hand gesture, and the simulated user interaction may include a visual representation of the hand gesture. As another example, the initiated user interaction may include a hand gesture, and the simulated user interaction may include a visual indication of a pointer. The simulated user interaction may have one or more features same as or similar to the initiated user interaction, such as a location of a user interaction relative to content interacted with, an orientation of a user interaction relative content interacted with, a motion of a user interaction, a texture of a user interaction, or any other characteristic of a user interaction.</p><p id="p-0411" num="0410">Some disclosed embodiments may relate to simulating user interactions with shared content, as described in greater detail herein. Users of wearable extended reality appliances may automatically share user interactions with shared content. For example, when a first user stands in front of a whiteboard (physical or virtual) and points to a specific part of the whiteboard, a second user's wearable extended reality appliance may display a virtual representation of the whiteboard with a virtual indicator identifying the specific part of the whiteboard to which the first user points, as described herein.</p><p id="p-0412" num="0411">Some disclosed embodiments may include establishing a communication channel for sharing content and user interactions between a first wearable extended reality appliance (WER-Appliance) and at least one second wearable extended reality appliance.

A communication channel may include, for example, an IP (Internet Protocol) connection, a Wi-Fi connection, a WiMAX connection, a cellular connection (e.g., 2G, 3G, 4G, or 5G), a Bluetooth connection, a near-field communication (NFC) connection, a low-power wide-area networking (LPWAN) connection, an Ethernet connection, a power-line communication (PLC) connection, a satellite communication connection, a mobile network connection, a terrestrial microwave network connection, a wireless ad hoc network connection, or any other type of connection via a network. The communication channel may be wired or wireless. In some examples, the communication channel may be via a personal area network, a local area network, a metropolitan area network, a wide area network, a global area network, a space network, a peer-to-peer network, or any other type of computer network that may use data connections between network nodes.</p><p id="p-0413" num="0412">In some examples, the communication channel may be established between the first wearable extended reality appliance and the at least one second wearable extended reality appliance. For example, the at least one processor may cause networking resources to be allocated for the first wearable extended reality appliance and the at least one second wearable extended reality appliance, such as network addresses, port numbers, or other types of networking configurations. In some examples, the at least one processor may execute processes that may be specified in network protocols (e.g., the transmission control protocol (TCP), the user datagram protocol (UDP), or any other protocol). In some examples, the communication channel may be established between a centralize system and each one of the first wearable extended reality appliance and the at least one second wearable extended reality appliance. That is, in some examples there may be no communication between wearable extended reality appliances that does not pass through the centralize system. Such centralized system may include one or more servers, a cloud platform, a distributed computing system, and so forth. Some non-limiting examples of such centralize system may include a system that controls the extended reality environment, a system that provides virtual content for presentation to the wearable extended reality appliances, and so forth. In one example, establishing the communication channel may include adding an association of the first wearable extended reality appliance and the at least one second wearable extended reality appliance in a data-structure maintained by the centralize system. When data is received from the first wearable extended reality appliance for sharing with other wearable extended reality appliances, the centralized system may access the data-structure to determine that the received data, or information based on the received data, needs to be shared with the at least one second wearable extended reality appliance, and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0414" num="0413">Content may be shared via the communication channel.

For example, if a pointing end of the human hand (e.g., a tip of a pointing finger) touches on the object, the at least one processor may determine the specific portion of the object to be the location where the pointing end of the human hand touches on the object. As another example, if a pointing end of the human hand (e.g., a tip of a pointing finger) does not touch on the object, the at least one processor may determine the specific portion of the object to be a location where a pointing direction of the human hand as extended towards the object reaches the object, to be a location where a pointing end of the human hand is mapped onto the object (e.g., the mapping of the pointing end may be perpendicular, approximately perpendicular, or in any other desired angle to a nearby surface of the object), or to be any other desired location determined based on the pointing human hand. Additionally or alternatively, the specific portion of the object may be determined based on, for example, eye tracking of the eye(s) of a user initiating the at least one user interaction. For example, the attention (e.g., gaze) of the user determined based on the eye tracking may be used to confirm or adjust a location of the specific portion of the object.</p><p id="p-0434" num="0433">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref>, in step <b>3216</b>, instructions contained in a non-transitory computer-readable medium when executed by a processor may cause the processor to detect in the image data at least one user interaction associated with the object, the at least one user interaction including a human hand pointing to a specific portion of the object.</p><p id="p-0435" num="0434">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b></figref>, first user <b>3414</b> may initiate a user interaction <b>3510</b> associated with object <b>3428</b>.

Some disclosed embodiments may include identifying multiple parts of the object pointed to by the human hand at a particular order in time, and causing a display of visual indications of the multiple parts via the at least one second extended reality appliance at the particular order in time. The movement of the human hand may include any motion or action of the human hand. For example, the movement of the human hand may include moving the human hand in a particular gesture (e.g., a pointing finger) along a surface of the object, changing the human hand from being in one gesture (e.g., a pointing finger) to being in another gesture (e.g., a thumb-up), or any other motion or action of the human hand. As one example, the human hand may be in the gesture of a pointing finger, and may move along a surface of the object to point to multiple parts of the object. At least one processor may identify multiple parts of the object pointed to by the human hand at a particular order in time (e.g., sequentially), for example, based on image data captured by an image sensor and/or data captured by other sensor(s). The identified multiple parts of the object may have any desired interval between each other in terms of space or time. For example, the identified multiple parts may sequentially be spaced apart by any desired distance (e.g., 0.1 cm, 0.2 cm, 0.3 cm, 0.4 cm, 0.5 cm, 0.8 cm, 1 cm, 2 cm, 3 cm, 5 cm, 10 cm, or any other desired distance). As another example, the identified multiple parts may be captured at times that may sequentially be apart by any desired time period (e.g., 0.1 seconds, 0.2 seconds, 0.3 seconds, 0.4 seconds, 0.5 seconds, 0.8 seconds, 1 second, 2 seconds, 3 seconds, or any other desired time interval).</p><p id="p-0442" num="0441">The at least one processor may cause a display of visual indications of the multiple parts via the at least one second extended reality appliance at the particular order in time. For example, the at least one processor may transmit, to the at least one second extended reality appliance, a data stream indicating the identified multiple parts of the object. For example, as the at least one processor identifies a particular part of the multiple parts of the object, the at least one processor may transmit, to the at least one second extended reality appliance, a data segment, of the data stream, indicating the identified particular part of the object. As each one of the multiple parts of the object may be sequentially identified and indicated in a data segment of the data stream transmitted to the at least one second extended reality appliance, the at least one second extended reality appliance may cause display of visual indications of the multiple parts at the particular order in time (e.g., in connection with the displayed virtual representation of the object). The visual indications (e.g., relative to the displayed virtual representation of the object) may simulate the movement of the human hand (e.g., relative to the object). In some examples, the simulation of the movement of the human hand may be updated in real-time based on the movement of the human hand.</p><p id="p-0443" num="0442">Some disclosed embodiments may include initially determining that the human hand pointing to the specific portion of the object belongs to a user of the first wearable extended reality appliance and causing a first virtual indicator to identify the specific portion of the object; and subsequently determining that an additional human hand pointing to the specific portion of the object belongs to an individual other than the user of the first wearable extended reality appliance, and causing a second virtual indicator, different from the first virtual indicator, to identify the specific portion of the object. Hand source recognition may occur in any one of a number of ways, or a combination of ways. For example, based on a relative position of the hand, the system may determine whether the hand is that of a user of the first wearable extended reality appliance. This may occur because hands of wearers may have an orientation in the field of view that may be a telltale sign that the hand is that of the wearer. Such telltale signs might include detected finger orientation relative to an image sensor, or detection of arms extending toward a general direction of the image sensor. Similarly, hands of individuals other than the wearer may have differing finger orientations or may be detected as being associated with arms extending in a direction inconsistent with a direction associated with a wearer. Such signs may be determined by performing image analysis on the current hand image and comparing it with stored images or image data associated with orientations of hands of wearers. Similarly, hands of persons other than the wearer may have differing orientations and in a similar manner to determining that a hand is one of a wearer of the first wearable extended reality appliance, the system may determine that a detected hand is of a person other than the wearer.</p><p id="p-0444" num="0443">By way of another example, hands of differing individuals may differ. The system may recognize hands as being those of an extended reality device wearer (or even a particular individual), by examining unique characteristics of skin or structure. Over time as a wearer uses the system, features of the wearer's hands may be stored in a data structure and image analysis may be performed to confirm that a current hand in an image is that of the wearer. In a similar way, hands of individuals other than the wearer may be recognized, enabling the system to distinguish between a plurality of individuals based on characteristics of their hands. This feature may enable unique user interaction simulation. For example, if multiple individuals interact with the same object, virtual indicators simulating the user interactions may vary based on the person interacting with the object.</p><p id="p-0445" num="0444">At least one processor may determine whether a human hand interacting with the object belongs to the user of the first wearable extended reality appliance or another individual, for example, based on image data captured by an image sensor associated with the first wearable extended reality appliance.

In some examples, the at least one processor may perform hand identification based on particular objects associated with a hand (e.g., a particular ring for identifying a hand of the user). In some examples, the hand identification may be based on data captured by other sensor(s). The at least one processor may initially determine that the human hand pointing to the specific portion of the object belongs to a user of the first wearable extended reality appliance and cause a first virtual indicator to identify the specific portion of the object; and subsequently determine that an additional human hand pointing to the specific portion of the object belongs to an individual other than the user of the first wearable extended reality appliance and cause a second virtual indicator, different from the first virtual indicator, to identify the specific portion of the object. The first virtual indicator and/or the second virtual indicator may be displayed, for example, by the at least one second wearable extended reality appliance in connection with the displayed virtual representation of the object.

The detecting of the additional user interaction may be performed in a similar manner as the detecting of the at least one user interaction as described above. The additional user interaction may include any action that may change the orientation of the three-dimensional virtual object, such as a rotate gesture, a drag gesture, a tap gesture (e.g., to activate a function to change an orientation), a spread gesture, a click (e.g., via a computer mouse or a touchpad), or any other action for changing an orientation. The particular perspective may include any desired angle from which the three-dimensional virtual object may be viewed. The orientation of the three-dimensional virtual object may be measured using any desired method to represent orientations, such as the Euler angles, the system based on yaw, pitch, and roll, or any other way for measuring orientation. At least one processor may measure degree(s) of change of the orientation of the three-dimensional virtual object. Based on the detecting of the additional user interaction, at least one processor may transmit, to the at least one second wearable extended reality appliance, data indicating the change of the orientation of the three-dimensional virtual object. The data may include, for example, information of the measured degree(s) of change of the orientation of the three-dimensional virtual object. The at least one second wearable extended reality appliance may receive the data and may, based on the measured degree(s) of orientation change (e.g., included in the data), adjust the orientation of the three-dimensional virtual object displayed via the at least one second wearable extended reality appliance, so that the three-dimensional virtual object may be displayed via the at least one second wearable extended reality appliance from the particular perspective.</p><p id="p-0447" num="0446">Some disclosed embodiments may include receiving from the at least one second wearable extended reality appliance third data in response to a detection of a second user interaction with the virtual representation of the object.

Based on receiving the information, the second wearable extended reality appliance may cause display of the virtual representation of the object to have a relationship, with the surrounding environment of the virtual representation, that may be same as or similar to the relationship of the object with the surrounding environment of the object (e.g., distances of the object to a nearby wall, nearby furniture, the floor, or other items in the environment).</p><p id="p-0462" num="0461">Some disclosed embodiments may include receiving image data from an image sensor associated with the second wearable extended reality appliance, detecting in the image data a structure that prevents displaying the virtual representation of the object in the manner corresponding to the perspective of the first wearable extended reality appliance; and, upon detecting the structure, determining an alternative display of the virtual representation of the object, the alternative display presenting the virtual representation of the object from a perspective differing from the perspective of the first wearable extended reality appliance. The structure may include any item (physical or virtual) that may be in such a position and/or orientation that it may occupy (physically or virtually) the space (or a portion thereof) where the displayed virtual representation of the object may be located (e.g., when displayed from a perspective same as or similar to the perspective of the first wearable extended reality appliance). At least one processor may identify the structure, for example, based on analysis of the image data received from the image sensor. In some examples, the identification of the structure may be based on data captured by one or more of a distance sensor, a depth sensor, a range imaging sensor, or any other sensor. The at least one processor may determine the alternative display of the virtual representation of the object, for example, by identify a location, in the environment of the second wearable extended reality appliance, where there may not be such an obstructing structure, or by identify an orientation, of the virtual representation of the object, that may allow the virtual representation of the object to fit in at its current location. The alternative display may be implemented, for example, using the identified location or orientation. The alternative display may present the virtual representation of the object from a perspective differing from the perspective of the first wearable extended reality appliance.</p><p id="p-0463" num="0462">Some disclosed embodiments may include adjusting a display of a virtual indicator to point to the specific portion of the object from the perspective associated with the alternative display. For example, at least one processor may adjust the location and/or orientation of the virtual indicator, in a similar manner as the virtual representation of the object. The adjusting of the virtual indicator may be such that the location and/or orientation of the virtual indicator relative to the virtual representation of the object may simulate the location and/or orientation of the at least one user interaction relative to the object.</p><p id="p-0464" num="0463">In some embodiments, methods, systems, and non-transitory computer readable media for simulating visual pointers over shared content may be provided. In some examples, an indication that a first user and a second user are watching two replicas of the same computer window may be received. Further, an indication that the first user physically points to a first element of the computer window may be received. Further, a visual pointer pointing at the first element may be caused to be displayed to the second user. In one example, the first user may watch the replica of the computer window on a physical display and the second user may watch the replica of the computer window on a virtual display. In another example, the first user may watch the replica of the computer window on a virtual display and the second user may watch the replica of the computer window on a physical display. In yet another example, both users may watch the replica of the computer window on physical displays. In an additional example, both users may watch the replica of the computer window on virtual displays. In one example, such virtual display may be part of an augmented reality environment. In another example, such virtual display may be part of a virtual reality environment.</p><p id="p-0465" num="0464">In some examples, the indication that the first user physically points to the first element of the computer window may be based on an analysis of an image of the first user (such as an image captured by a wearable system used by the first user, or an image captured by a fixed camera positioned in the room). In some examples, the indication that the first user physically points to the first element of the computer window may be an indication that the first user is using a gesture to point to the first element of the computer window. For example, the gesture may be using a finger to point at the first element. In some examples, the visual pointer pointing at the first element may be a two-dimensional overlay over the content of the computer window. In some examples, the visual pointer pointing at the first element may be a two-dimensional visual pointer displayed outside the computer window, for example, using an augmented reality system used by the second user, or using a virtual reality system used by the second user. In some examples, the visual pointer pointing at the first element may be a three-dimensional visual pointer displayed outside the computer window, for example, using an augmented reality system used by the second user, or using a virtual reality system used by the second user. For example, the three-dimensional visual pointer may be a representation of a hand or may be a representation of an arrow.</p><p id="p-0466" num="0465">Allowing anyone to place virtual content anywhere in a shared extended reality environment may cause virtual content clutter and abuses such as placement of promotional content or undesirable content in inappropriate locations. Aspects of this disclosure that follows describe ways for applying location-based restrictions to manage content placement in extended reality environments.</p><p id="p-0467" num="0466">Some disclosed embodiments may involve systems, methods, and non-transitory computer readable media configured for managing content placement in extended reality environments. The term &#x201c;managing content placement&#x201d; may refer to using one or more rules that govern where users may place content in an extended reality environment. These rules may include permissions as to where to place virtual content and may be based on a variety of different parameters, such as time, location, size, or virtual content type. In some embodiments, virtual content may include any two-dimensional or three-dimensional representation of data. The virtual content may be inanimate or animate, and/or may be public or private. Public content may be visible to all wearable extended reality appliance users registered to a certain a shared extended reality environment, whereas private content may only be visible to a limited number of users whose appliances are registered to the certain a shared extended reality environment.</p><p id="p-0468" num="0467">In some embodiments, the managing of the content placement may involve applying rules that may vary between different types of users. For example, some rules may limit where an individual user may present virtual content. Other rules may enable expanded freedom to a user associated with a corporate entity to present virtual content in certain places, including office buildings, client offices, or public locations associated with or advertising the entity's services. The rules for managing content placement may also vary between public and private locations, i.e., there may be different rules for presenting virtual content in private places, such as user's home or office, compared to public places, such as a public park, a city street, a town square, a retail establishment, or any other public or semi-public space.</p><p id="p-0469" num="0468">Some disclosed embodiments may involve receiving a request from an entity to place a virtual content at a specific geographic location in at least one shared extended reality environment that includes a plurality of virtual objects. The term &#x201c;entity&#x201d; may refer to an individual, artificial intelligence (AI) software, an organization, a professional office, a service provider, a company, a corporation, partnership, or other individual, group or mechanism capable of making a request. In one example, the entity associated with the request may be a single wearable extended reality appliance user. However, the entity may not be limited a user of a wearable extended reality appliance; it may include virtual entities such as an AI software, or human users of other types of computerized devices. In one embodiment, the request from the entity may be a signal sent from the at least one processor associated with a non-transitory computer readable medium as part of the wearable extended reality appliance. In another embodiment, the request signal may be sent from the at least one processor associated with the entity. In some examples, receiving the request may include at least one of reading the request from a memory unit, receiving the request from an external device, receiving the request from a user (for example, via a user interface), or determining the request by analyzing data (such as data captured using one or more sensors, data read from memory, and/or data received from an external device).</p><p id="p-0470" num="0469">The specific geographic location identified in the request may be selected by the entity and may refer to a physical point or region on Earth identifiable utilizing any descriptor, metric or characteristic. For example, the geographic location may be represented as a combination of longitude/latitude, a street address, a room in an office, a conference hall, an area defined by a code, or any other identifiable place. The specific geographic location may include any surface on which virtual content may be presented. In some examples, the specific geographic location may include a screen, a billboard, a window, a wall, and/or other location that is conducive for displaying virtual content. The specific geographic location may be located in a myriad of different places. For example, a specific geographic area may host content in a town square, a wall or window in an office building, a public transmit area, or any other public or private place, subject to restrictions. The specific geographic location may be able to accommodate more than one virtual object at a time, depending on the virtual content display size. As described elsewhere in this specification, the specific geographic location may also vary in size depending on the type of the virtual content and where the virtual content is presented, such as in an office building conference room, a town square or park, or auditorium. For example, a specific geographic location in an office building conference room may only be able to accommodate one or two virtual objects at one time, but a specific geographic location in a public park may be able to accommodate more than three or four objects at the same time.</p><p id="p-0471" num="0470">As mentioned, the specific geographic location may be either public or private. If public, most if not all users may be able to view and access the presented content. For example, a specific geographic location may be a public park, a town square, a public transit station, a billboard on a highway, supermarkets or grocery stores, and/or other locations that are open to the public. A specific geographic location may also be in private location, i.e., a location that is not open to the public. For example, such a specific geographic location may be a conference room in an office building, a shared working space, and/or a school or university.</p><p id="p-0472" num="0471">Consistent with disclosed embodiments, the plurality of virtual objects may be viewable by a plurality of wearable extended reality appliances registered to the at least one shared extended reality environment. The term shared extended reality environment may refer to a common computer-generated perceptual surrounding. The shared extended reality environment may be a completely simulated virtual environment or a combined real-and-virtual environment wherein multiple users may perceive common content from different perspectives (or in some embodiments, from a common perspective). In one example, multiple shared extended reality environments may coexist in the same physical space, and a user of a wearable extended reality appliance may select which extended reality environments to view and interact with at the physical space by registering to the desired extended reality environments. In one example, multiple wearable extended reality appliance users registered to the extended reality environment may view the same content available in the extended reality environment. In some embodiments, the wearable extended reality appliance users may be all in a similar location, and thus their experiences may be shared. A wearable extended reality appliance user may register the appliance to multiple shared extended reality environments. Registering to a shared extended reality environment may refer to initially interacting with one or more shared extended reality environments, i.e., public or private shared extended reality environments. A user may register his or her appliance to one or more extended reality environments and may switch between the environments by adjusting settings on the wearable extended reality appliance. For example, a user may register to a public shared extended reality environment and may also register to multiple private shared extended reality environments. In one example, a single location, e.g., a room may be associated with content of multiple shared extended reality environments. Accordingly, a first wearable extended reality appliance may display a first set of virtual objects based on the shared extended reality environments to which the first wearable extended reality appliance is currently registered, and a second wearable extended reality appliance may display a second set of virtual objects (that may be different from the first set of virtual objects) based on the shared extended reality environments to which the second wearable extended reality appliance is currently registered. Registration may occur automatically when an extended reality appliance is in proximity to a location associated with an extended reality environment. Regardless of how registered, in some embodiments, returning to a location associated with an extended reality environment may cause an extended reality appliance to recognize the associated extended reality environment.</p><p id="p-0473" num="0472">In one embodiment, a public shared extended reality environment may be an extended reality environment that is free and open to most if not all users. The public shared extended reality environment may be akin to a public communication network, where entities may place virtual content, such as personal posts or advertisements. However, a user may selectively turn off the public shared extended reality environment if the user wishes to access one or more private shared extended reality environments, such as an office environment, family home, and/or school or university environment (i.e., an education space-based shared extended reality environment). An extended reality appliance user may register and connect to one shared extended reality environment or may register to a plurality of shared extended reality environments. Specifically, in the office environment example, only colleagues in the workplace may be able to access the shared extended reality environment. In a family home example, only family members may be able to access the shared extended reality environment. In the education space example, only students, instructors, and associated staff may access the shared extended reality environment. Such restrictions may be implemented through permissions, such as permissions granted by an administrator of a particular shared extended reality environment.</p><p id="p-0474" num="0473">In the previously described private shared extended reality space examples, the specified geographical location where virtual content may be presented may be a wall or window in an office conference room, a wall, TV screen, or window in a private home, a whiteboard, chalkboard, blackboard, or projector screen in a classroom, and/or other locations which are visible to users whose wearable extended reality appliances are registered to the private shared extended reality environment.</p><p id="p-0475" num="0474">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>37</b>A</figref> depicts a specific geographical location where virtual content may be displayed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>37</b>A</figref> shows a location <b>3710</b>, here, a conference room in an office building, where virtual content may be placed to be viewed by other wearable extended reality appliance users <b>3712</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>37</b>A</figref>, one or more of the users may have not registered to the public extended reality environment, where virtual content may be presented by outside entities. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>37</b>B</figref>, a user of wearable extended reality appliance <b>3714</b> in location <b>3710</b> may be registered to a public extended realty environment. Thus, virtual content, such as advertisements <b>3716</b>, may be visible to the user of wearable extended reality appliance <b>3714</b> and other users <b>3712</b> in the conference room.</p><p id="p-0476" num="0475">Some disclosed embodiments may further include using input from a wearable extended reality appliance used by the entity to determine the specific geographic location. In one example, the input from the wearable extended reality appliance may include positioning data captured using a positioning sensor included in the wearable extended reality environment (such as a global positioning sensor, an outdoor positioning sensor, an indoor positioning sensor, or any other positioning sensors as described above), and the specific geographic location may be immediately determined from the positioning data. In one example, image data captured using an image sensor included in the wearable extended reality appliance may be received. Further, the image data may be analyzed using at least one of an ego-positioning algorithm, an ego-motion algorithm or a visual odometry algorithm to determine the specific geographic location. In some examples, a user of the wearable extended reality appliance may provide information, for example through voice commands, gestures or physical input devices, and the specific geographic location may be determined based on the information provided by the user. For example, the information provided by a user may include textual information (for example, entered using a keyboard and/or determined by analyzing audio with speech recognition algorithms), and the textual information may be analyzed using a natural-language algorithm to determine the specific geographic location. In another example, the information provided by the user may include an indication of a location on a map (for example, through a hand gesture or a use of a virtual cursor), and the specific geographic location may be immediately determined from the location on the map.</p><p id="p-0477" num="0476">Some disclosed embodiments may involve obtaining information associated with the request. The obtained information may include any data or information relevant to the request for placing a virtual content at a specific geographic location. For example, the obtained information may include information related to at least one of the entity, the virtual content, the specific geographic location, the at least one shared extended reality environment, one or more virtual objects of the plurality of virtual objects, or one or more appliances of the plurality of wearable extended reality appliances registered to the at least one shared extended reality environment. For example, the obtained information may include details on the virtual content, image data (e.g., an image of the specific geographic location), license information, ownership information, identity information, whether the specific geographic location is public or private, affiliation information between the specific geographic location and the entity, content type information, the entity's location information, time of day information, virtual space constraint information, and/or more details associated with the specific geographic location, the content to be displayed, and the entity making the request. In some examples, obtaining the information may include reading the information from memory, receiving the information from an external device, receiving the information from a user (for example, through a user interface), determining the information by analyzing data, and/or capturing the information using one or more sensors. In one embodiment, a first entity may request to present virtual content and a second entity may receive the presentation request from the requesting entity. The second entity may determine whether to permit presentation of virtual content. In some embodiments, the second entity request specific information from the first entity about the specific geographic location.</p><p id="p-0478" num="0477">Some disclosed embodiments may involve accessing a plurality of content placement rules defining geographical restrictions on extended reality environment content placement. A content placement rule may be any definition that defines the appropriateness of information for placement in a particular location (or a category or type of location). The content placement rule may impose geographical restrictions, content type restrictions, time of day restrictions, and/or shared extended reality environment (i.e., public or private) restrictions. For example, a content placement rule may govern what time virtual content may be presented, size restrictions for presented virtual content, types of content that may be presented, and/or who may view the presented virtual content. Additional examples of content placement rules are described throughout this specification. In one embodiment, the content placement rules may be implemented throughout a shared extended reality space to regulate which content may be placed where, when, and/or for how long. Whether an entity's request to present content meets a content placement rule may be based on obtained information. In some examples, accessing the plurality of content placement rules may include accessing a data-structure including at least part of the plurality of content placement rules, accessing a database including at least part of the plurality of content placement rules, accessing a memory unit storing at least part of the plurality of content placement rules, and/or communicating with an external device maintaining at least part of the plurality of content placement rules.</p><p id="p-0479" num="0478">Some disclosed embodiments may involve, based on the obtained information, determining that the request from the entity to place the virtual content at the specific geographic location corresponds to a specific content placement rule. The specific content placement rule may govern whether content may be displayed at the specific geographic location. The specific content rule may be associated with the content type, i.e., the character of the content, whether the content is inanimate or animate, whether the content is meant to be publicly or privately displayed, and/or whether the content is two-dimensional or three-dimensional. Other content placement rules may be based on what the substance of the content, i.e., content meaning, appropriateness of the content to a determined or expected audience, where the content may be placed, the size of the presented virtual content is, and/or what time the content is to be displayed. A specific content placement rule may also be based on the type of shared extended reality environment in which the content may be placed. For example, there may be different content placement rules for public shared extended reality environments and private shared extended reality environments. In this example, some content (e.g., advertisements) may be permitted in public environments but may not be permitted in private environments. In some examples, the plurality of content placement rules may be stored in a data-structure associating request-related-information with content placement rules, and the data-structure may be accessed based on the obtained information to determine the specific content placement rule. In some examples, a plurality of conditions may be used to select which content placement rule corresponds to which request-related-information, and the obtained information may be analyzed using the conditions to determine the specific content placement rule. In some examples, a machine learning model may be trained using training examples to determine content placement rules based on request-related-information records. An example of such training example may include a sample request-related-information, together with a label indicating a content placement rule corresponding to the sample request-related-information. The trained machine learning model may be used to analyze the obtained information and determine the specific content placement rule.</p><p id="p-0480" num="0479">In some embodiments, the request for presenting the virtual content may correspond with a specific content placement rule. For example, there may be characteristics of the content presentation request that correspond with the content placement rule in a specific geographic location. Such characteristics may be content type, time of day restrictions, and/or display size restrictions. For example, an entity's virtual content request may involve presenting three-dimensional virtual content and the specific geographic location may have a content placement rule corresponding to three-dimensional virtual content, i.e., it is either permitted or not permitted.</p><p id="p-0481" num="0480">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>37</b>C</figref> illustrates choosing a specific geographic location based on obtained information. Here, a wearer of wearable extended reality appliance <b>3718</b> may gesture his or her hand <b>3720</b> to a specific location where he or she wishes to display content. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>37</b>C</figref>, the user's wearable extended reality appliance <b>3718</b> is not registered to the public extended reality environment, rather, the appliance is registered to the private extended reality environment. Thus, only office and business-related virtual content <b>3724</b> is displayed and the advertisements <b>3716</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>37</b>B</figref> are not displayed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>37</b>D</figref> illustrates a virtual object <b>3726</b> being displayed after determining, based on the desired geographic location, that the specific conditions for content placement are met. In this example, a specific condition for content placement may be that the type of content is office or business related. Therefore, it may be determined that the request from the entity to place the virtual content at the specific geographic location corresponds to a specific content placement rule.</p><p id="p-0482" num="0481">Some disclosed embodiments may further include determining whether the condition of the specific content placement rule is met based on the determined characteristic of the specific geographic location. A specific content placement rule may be based on a myriad of inputs and may be configured by the wearable extended reality appliance user receiving the presentation request. The determined characteristic may be any one of the characteristics described in this specification, such as whether the specific geographic location is public or private, whether there is enough space for the virtual object to be presented, and/or what type of content is permitted at the specific geographic location. For example, specific content placement rules may be content-based, i.e., based on whether the content is to be public, such as an advertisement, or private, such as content related to business or education. A specific content placement rule may also apply to a plurality of geographic locations. For example, a town or neighborhood may have content placement rules preventing the display of certain types of virtual content. These local content placement rules may be enforced by a local government or regulatory entity.</p><p id="p-0483" num="0482">In some embodiments, a condition of the specific content placement rule may prevent placement of content in the specific geographical location in an absence of a license permitting content placement by the entity in the specific geographical location. While content sharing may be encouraged, if anyone is able to post content anywhere, the shared extended reality environment may become cluttered with content. As a result, the users of the shared extended reality environment may be indifferent to the content displayed in the shared wearable extended reality environment, damaging the effectiveness of targeted content placed by various entities throughout the shared extended reality environment. In order to reduce the crowding of virtual content items in certain locations throughout the shared wearable extended reality environment, it may be desirable to adopt a licensing system to reduce unwanted content. Such licenses may govern, for example, which content may be presented at a specific geographic location at a specific time, which types of content may be presented (i.e., public or private content, two-dimensional or three-dimensional content, and/or inanimate or animate content), and/or how many virtual objects may be presented at a specific time. This licensing system may also be adapted to the private shared extended reality environment. For example, a license may be utilized to prevent members of the general public from posting advertisements or presenting other content inside private areas such as homes, offices, shops, or other private businesses. The licensing scheme may be relaxed in public spaces, but time, place, and content-type restrictions may be implemented.</p><p id="p-0484" num="0483">Entities may request or apply for a license to place content in private spaces, and the licenses may be evaluated based on the products the entities wish to advertise, the time and day that the content is to be presented, how many other virtual objects are present, and the type of business where the content is to be placed. In one example, a license to present in a specific geographic location may not be given for a private home because the value of the wearable extended reality appliance user's privacy may outweigh the benefit they may receive from the presenting entity. However, in another example, an owner of a specific geographic location such as a store or office may grant a license to display virtual content based on the benefit it receives from the requesting entity, which may be in the form of money payment.</p><p id="p-0485" num="0484">In a public shared extended reality environment, licenses may be granted or denied based on the type of content that is requested to be presented. For example, a requesting entity may need a specific license to present content related to age-restricted products such as tobacco or alcohol. In another example, the license may be limited based on the time of day. In this example, a license may be required to present content outside of normal business hours, such as nighttime or even presenting content for a 24-hour period. Content placement restrictions may also be implemented more broadly. For example, an entire city or town, rather than a single wearable extended reality appliance user, may implement content placement restrictions that may be related to content type, i.e., public or private content, two-dimensional or three-dimensional content, and/or inanimate or animate content. Content placement restrictions may also be based on time of day, as described later in this specification.</p><p id="p-0486" num="0485">In some embodiments, the plurality of content placement rules may govern a first extended reality environment and a second extended reality environment, and may further include preventing placement of the virtual content in the specific geographic location of the first extended reality environment and permitting placement of the virtual content in the specific geographic location of the second extended reality environment. As described elsewhere in this specification, wearable extended reality appliance users may register to a plurality of shared extended reality environments. A first extended reality environment may be a private shared extended reality environment and a second extended reality environment may be a public shared extended reality environment. As described elsewhere in this specification, private and public shared extended reality environments may have different content placement restrictions. In some embodiments, placement of the virtual content, such as an advertisement, may be prohibited in the first private shared extended reality environment, but may be permitted to be displayed in the second public shared extended reality environment. For example, advertisements may be prevented from being displayed in a private shared extended reality environment, such as an office, but may be permitted in a public shared extended reality environment, such as in a public park or public transit station.</p><p id="p-0487" num="0486">In some embodiments, obtained information associated with the virtual content presentation request may include information about an identity of the entity, and may further include determining whether the condition of the specific content placement rule is met based on the information about the identity of the entity. Information about an identity of the requesting entity may include whether it is a private person or a corporation, what type of business the entity typically engages in, where the entity typically operates, for example, where does it typically display virtual content, and/or how many other virtual objects the entity is currently displaying. Whether the condition of the specific content placement rule is met may be based on the above identity information. For example, a large corporation may wish to advertise products in a smaller setting, such as a school or university. Based on the identity of the entity, and where the entity wishes to place the virtual content, such information may be instrumental in determining where the condition of the specific content placement rule is met. Thus, for example, a content presentation request may be denied if the information contains details that are not desirable to a recipient of the content. Such details may include, for example, the type of product that the company typically advertises or typical customers. For example, a company that sells unhealthy food products or tobacco products may not meet the specific content placement rule if it wishes to advertise at a school or university campus.</p><p id="p-0488" num="0487">In some embodiments, obtained information associated with the request to present content may include information about a physical location of the entity, and the operations may further include determining whether the condition of the specific content placement rule is met based on the information about the physical location of the entity. A receiving wearable extended reality appliance user may accept or deny an entity's presentation request based on the entity's physical location. For example, if the requesting entity is located close to the specific geographic location, the request may be accepted. If the requesting entity is located remote from the specific geographic location, i.e., where the requesting entity wishes to present content, the presentation request may be denied.</p><p id="p-0489" num="0488">Additionally, an entity's physical location may differ based on the time the request was made. An entity's location at different times may be useful for a receiving wearable extended reality appliance user in determining whether to grant the presentation request because the differing locations may show whether the requesting entity is moving closer to the requested specific geographic location, which may factor favorably into granting a presentation request, or moving further away from the requested specific geographic location, which may factor unfavorably into granting a presentation request. For example, the entity's physical location may be that at the receiving time of the request, a time period before the receiving time of the request, a physical location during a time leading up to the receiving time of the request, and/or a physical location during a time shortly after the receiving time of the request. Depending on where the entity's physical location is at these times, the request to present content may be denied.</p><p id="p-0490" num="0489">In some embodiments, when the obtained information about the physical location of the entity indicates that at a time of making the request, the entity is located at a first location remote from the specific geographic location, the display of the virtual content may be prevented. Virtual content may be prevented from being displayed when an entity's physical location is remote from the geographic location where the virtual content is to be displayed. Display prevention may be a function of a distance of a requesting entity from the requested specific geographic location. Additionally, remoteness may be based on differences in time zone, elevation, and/or topography. The threshold distance, i.e., the distance where a presentation request may be granted or denied based on how remote the requesting entity is, may be configurable or may be a matter of design choice by the system designer.</p><p id="p-0491" num="0490">For example, if the requesting entity is remote from a particular location, e.g., fifteen kilometers or more, it may be undesirable to permit such an entity to display content at the particular location because it may cause cluttering public shared extended reality spaces. For example, if remote entities were permitted to present virtual content in areas that are far away from their physical locations, these areas may become overloaded with virtual content.</p><p id="p-0492" num="0491">Some disclosed embodiments may further include receiving updated information indicating that the entity is located at a second location proximate to the specific geographic location, for example after preventing the display of the virtual content based on the information about the physical location of the entity. Proximate may refer to how close the requesting entity is to the specific geographic location, and may be determined based on distance, time zone, and/or elevation. The processor may compare the proximate distance to the remote distance threshold to aid in determining whether the presentation request may be approved. This proximate distance threshold may be configured by the receiving wearable extended reality appliance user or may be designed into the system. The content the entity requested may be automatically displayed when the entity moves closer to the recipient of the request, i.e., within the proximate distance threshold. Whereas the remote threshold distance may govern whether requested content may be presented or not, the proximate distance threshold may govern the distance at which content may be automatically presented. For example, virtual content may be automatically presented when the requesting entity is within one to ten kilometers of the specific geographic location, and/or the requesting entity is within one kilometer and also at the same elevation as the specific geographic location.</p><p id="p-0493" num="0492">Some disclosed embodiments may further include automatically enabling the display of the virtual content at the specific geographic location in the at least one shared extended reality environment by at least some of the plurality of wearable extended reality appliances in response to receiving updated information. When an entity is remote from the specific geographic location and requests to display content relevant to its location, presenting the virtual content may overload the virtual space in the requested area. Although the requested content may meet other content placement restrictions, the requesting entity may be too remote for the receiving wearable extended reality appliance to accept the entity's request. However, when the requesting entity moves closer to a recipient of the request, the requested content may be automatically displayed. This may enable entities to plan distribution of virtual content along a route. The distance at which content is automatically displayed may be configured by the wearable extended reality appliance user at the specific geographic location. For example, the proximate threshold distance may be within ten, five, or one kilometer(s) of the specific geographic location. The proximate threshold distance may also be based on elevation. For example, content may be automatically displayed when the requesting entity and the specific geographic location are within one kilometer of each other and are also located at the same elevation.</p><p id="p-0494" num="0493">The obtained information associated with the request includes ownership information associated with the specific geographic location, and some disclosed embodiments may further include determining whether the condition of the specific content placement rule is met based on the ownership information. Ownership information associated with the specific geographic location may refer to whether the owner is a public or private user. If a private user, ownership information may include the entity's identity (e.g., personal name, company name, organization, and/or sponsor). In some embodiments, an entity may be permitted to display a specific virtual content in a specific geographic location that it owns and may be prohibited from displaying a specific virtual content in a specific geographic location that it does not own. In some cases, the specific geographic location in the request may be a private place or a public place. Private places may have more content placement rules than public places, even within the same shared extended reality environment. For example, a private place may be associated with restrictions as to what type of content may be displayed, what time the content may be placed, and where the content may be placed. In this example, an entity may only be able to post office or business-related content if the specific geographic location is in a private place such as an office building, owned by the entity. By contrast, an entity may be able to present a wider array of content if the ownership information indicates that the specific geographic location is in a public place, owned by the local town or city.</p><p id="p-0495" num="0494">By way of example, the obtained information may include ownership information that the specific geographic location is in a public place, such as a park. The owner of the specific geographic location may be the local town, which may have more relaxed presentation rules. In one example, the entity may wish to present virtual content comprising an advertisement for a soft drink. In this public environment, a specific content placement rule may state that advertisements for soft drinks are permitted. Thus, in this example, the content placement rule was met, and the entity was permitted to display an advertisement for a soft drink. In another example, the ownership information may indicate that the specific geographic location is in a private place owned by a private wearable extended reality appliance user. As in the previous example, the entity may wish to present virtual content comprising an advertisement for a soft drink. However, unlike the previous example, a condition of the specific content placement rule may state that no outside advertisements are permitted. Thus, the request to present the virtual content may be denied because the specific content placement rule is not met. In another example, the requesting entity may be an employee of a company and the specific geographic location is the company building, owned and occupied by the company. Here, the content placement rule may be met because, based on obtained ownership information, the requesting entity's place of work is at the specific geographic location.</p><p id="p-0496" num="0495">Consistent with one aspect, the obtained information associated with the virtual content presentation request may include affiliation information reflecting a connection of the entity with the specific geographic location, and some disclosed embodiments may further include determining whether the condition of the specific content placement rule is met based on the affiliation information. Affiliation information may refer to any connection that the requesting entity has with the specific geographic location. For example, a lobby of a building may be associated with the company located in the building. A sporting venue may be associated with the home sports team affiliated with the venue. A conference room may be affiliated with an office in which the conference room is located. The affiliation information may additionally or alternatively include information related to ownership interests between the requesting entity and the specific geographic location, prior instances where the entity presented virtual content at the specific geographic location, and/or whether the specific geographic location is public or private. Ownership interests may refer to whether the requesting entity owns the specific geographic location. For example, affiliation information reflecting a connection with the specific geographic location may be useful in determining whether a content placement rule is met because if the requesting entity is affiliated with the specific geographic location, the affiliation may suggest that the content placement rule is met. Additionally, the affiliation may suggest that the requesting entity has previously presented virtual content at the specific geographic location. An affiliation may be a franchisor-franchisee relationship, landlord-tenant relationship, employer-employee relationship, and/or any other business or otherwise working relationship that may suggest that the entity has previously engaged with the specific geographic location or has a measure of authority associated with the geographical location. For example, the requesting entity may be an employee of a store who wishes to present an advertisement in the store. Since the requesting entity is affiliated with the specific geographic location, the associated affiliation information may be used to determine whether the condition of the specific content placement rule is met.</p><p id="p-0497" num="0496">In another example, affiliation information may refer to prior instances where the requesting entity was permitted to present virtual content. This affiliation information may be relevant in both the public and private space. Here, if the affiliation information reflects that the requesting entity previously presented virtual content at the specific geographic location, this may indicate that the specific content placement rule was previously met and may be met at the current time as well. For example, a not-for-profit entity may have been granted permission to post information in a public space and the permission granted in the past may determine an ability to place content in the future.</p><p id="p-0498" num="0497">Consistent with one aspect, the obtained information associated with the virtual content presentation request may include information about a content type, and some disclosed embodiments may further include determining whether the condition of the specific content placement rule is met based on the information about the content type. A variety of different virtual content types may be presented. Content type may refer to one or more characteristics or properties of the virtual contents. Such characteristics or properties may include, for example, whether the virtual content is of a commercial or public informational nature, whether the content is of a public or private nature, whether the content is a document, video, or presentation, whether the content is two-dimensional or three-dimensional, and/or any other properties related to the subject matter or properties of the content (e.g., ownership or affiliation information associated with a presenter of the content or recipient of the content.) Public content may refer to content that is posted in the public extended reality environment. Public content may be visible to many or all wearable extended reality appliance users. Such public content may also include advertisements. Private content may refer to content that is posted in a private extended reality environment, i.e., a limited number of users may be able to view the presented virtual content. Private virtual content may be documents, videos, or presentations that are relevant to conducting business, education, or simply sharing between family members or friends. Determining the content type may be helpful in determining whether the content placement rule is met. For example, a content placement rule may limit presented content to private documents and other business-related content. Here, if a requesting entity wishes to present a public advertisement in a private environment, that request may be denied based on the content type-based content placement rule because the content placement rule is not met. In this example, the content placement rule may prevent the presentation of public content such as advertisements. However, if a requesting entity wishes to present a private document in a specific geographic location to a private user, that request may be approved because the content placement rule is met.</p><p id="p-0499" num="0498">Consistent with one aspect, the obtained information associated with the virtual content presentation request may include information about a time of day, and some disclosed embodiments may further include determining whether the condition of the specific content placement rule is met based on the information about the time of day. Time of day information may include the time of day at which the request to present virtual content is received, and/or a time of day when the virtual content is to be displayed. For example, a content placement rule may limit receiving presentation requests to normal 9 AM to 5 PM business hours. Here, if a receiving wearable extended reality appliance user receives a presentation request outside of normal 9 AM to 5 PM business hours, the content placement rule may not be met, and thus the presentation request may be denied. The time of day that the virtual content is to be displayed is also relevant to determining whether the specific content placement rule is met. For example, a content placement rule may limit presenting virtual content to normal working hours of 9 AM to 5 PM. Here, the specific content placement rule may not be met if a request to display private virtual content is outside the working hours of 9 AM to 5 PM. In another example, a content placement rule may limit presenting content outside of the operating hours of a public space. Here, an entity may request to present virtual content in a public park, but the park is only open from dawn to dusk. If an entity requests to present virtual content outside of those hours, the specific content placement rule may not be met, and the request to present virtual content may be denied.</p><p id="p-0500" num="0499">In some embodiments, there may be content placement rules based on the time of day that govern which type of content may be presented at which time. Here, one type of content may be presented at a first time of day, and a second type of content may be presented at a second time of day. For example, a specific rule may allow display of an advertisement related to coffee and breakfast in the morning, and soft drinks and lunch in the afternoon. In this example, the content placement rule may not be met if the requesting entity wishes to present content related to coffee and breakfast in the afternoon or late evening. Thus, the request to present virtual content may be denied.</p><p id="p-0501" num="0500">Consistent with one aspect, the obtained information associated with the virtual content presentation request may include virtual space constraint information associated with the specific geographic location, and some disclosed embodiments may further include determining whether the condition of the specific content placement rule is met based on the virtual space constraint information. Virtual space constraint information may refer to the number of objects that may be placed at the specific geographic location, the size of the objects that may be placed at the specific geographic location, the total virtual real estate available for placement and/or the specific arrangement of the objects at the specific geographic location (i.e., if some virtual content may be presented before other virtual content). Virtual space constraint information may also refer to how many virtual objects are in the vicinity of the specific geographic location. Virtual space constraints may exist so that there are not too many virtual objects presented in one specific geographic location, or in the vicinity of one specific geographic location. Virtual space constraints may limit the number of virtual objects that may be presented in a single geographic location and may depend on the size of the virtual space. Virtual space constraints may also depend on the size of the objects presented and are also related to the size of the virtual space. Virtual space constraints may also refer to a specific arrangement of objects at the specific geographic location. Depending on the size of the virtual space, virtual objects may need to be organized in a certain way to either avoid overlapping or overloading the virtual space or to be more visible to passersby.</p><p id="p-0502" num="0501">For example, a specific content placement rule may prevent more than four virtual objects from being presented in a virtual space. The content placement rule may be based on how many virtual objects are present in the virtual space and may also be based on the display size of the objects in the virtual space. If the display of one of the virtual objects is larger than another, fewer virtual objects may be able to be displayed. In this example, an entity may request to present virtual content in a specific geographic location. However, if the entity requests to present four large virtual objects, the request may be denied because even though the entity's request met the content placement rule regarding the number of virtual objects in the virtual space, it did not meet the size requirement, and thus the presentation request may be denied.</p><p id="p-0503" num="0502">In another example, a specific content placement rule may prevent the display of virtual content unless it is arranged in a specific way, i.e., two small virtual objects located adjacent to two larger virtual objects. If a requesting entity wishes to present content that does not meet the virtual space constraint, e.g., the request involves three small virtual objects located adjacent to one larger virtual object, the content placement rule may not be met, and the presentation request may be denied.</p><p id="p-0504" num="0503">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref> is a diagram that illustrates content placement rules <b>3824</b> that are associated with multiple input parameters that include information about the requesting entity, the specific geographic location, and content type. The input parameters may refer to the information obtained by a processing device. The processing device may be included in remote processing unit <b>208</b> (e.g., processing device <b>560</b>), included in XR unit <b>204</b> (e.g., processing device <b>460</b>), included in input device <b>202</b> (e.g., processing device <b>360</b>), or included in mobile communications device <b>206</b>. Input parameter <b>3810</b> may represent information about an identity of the entity, input parameter <b>3812</b> may represent information about a physical location of the entity, input parameter <b>3814</b> may represent virtual space constraint information, input parameter <b>3816</b> may represent ownership information, input parameter <b>3818</b> may represent affiliation information, input parameter <b>3820</b> may represent content type information, and input parameter <b>3822</b> may represent information about a time of day. The content placement rules <b>3824</b> may be configurable and may include rules related to public or private content, time restrictions, content type restrictions, ownership restrictions, affiliation restrictions, physical location restrictions, display size restrictions, and/or virtual object number restrictions. Based on the input parameters and the content placement rules <b>3824</b>, the processing device may execute one or more of the following operations: operation <b>3826</b> preventing the display of the virtual content, operation <b>3828</b> enabling the display of the virtual content, operation <b>3830</b> modifying the virtual content for display, and/or operation <b>3832</b> applying a time limitation for displaying the virtual content.</p><p id="p-0505" num="0504">Related embodiments may include receiving image data captured from an area of the specific geographic location via an image sensor associated with the requesting entity's wearable extended reality appliance. The image data may be captured either continuously or periodically, i.e., every few seconds. For example, an image sensor that acquires the image data may be located on the lens, bridge, or any other location on the wearable extended reality appliance so as to capture accurate image data. Captured image data may include color, brightness, light, and/or texture information, location information, geographic information, and/or height or depth information about the specific geographic location.</p><p id="p-0506" num="0505">Some disclosed embodiments may further include analyzing image data to determine a characteristic of the specific geographic location. For example, the characteristic of the specific geographic location may include indications of whether the location is inside or outside, i.e., an office, home, street, park, or other public or private location. In some examples, a characteristic of a geographic location may include the physical dimensions associated with the specific geographic location, i.e., the height, width, and depth of the surface where the content is to be presented. Another characteristic of a geographic location may include the number of people present at, or in the vicinity of, the specific geographic location. For example, the more people who are present at a specific geographic location, the more viewers of a presented virtual object, e.g., an advertisement, and thus there are more potential purchasers of the advertised product. A further characteristic of a geographic location may include the number of virtual objects present at, or in the vicinity of, the specific geographic location. For example, if an entity wishes to present virtual content so that it is visible to other wearable extended reality appliance users, one characteristic that the entity may analyze is how many virtual objects are already in that specific geographic location and if there is space to present another virtual object or a plurality of virtual objects. In this example, the specific geographic location may be a billboard on a highway, and two virtual objects may already be present on the billboard. Thus, the entity may not present virtual content there based on the presence of the other virtual objects. In another example, the requesting entity may opt to present virtual content at an area that is close to the billboard, but not so close as to confuse a viewer with cluttered content. In some examples, a machine learning model may be trained using training examples to determine characteristic of geographic locations from images and/or videos. An example of such training example may include a sample image and/or a sample video of a sample geographic location, together with a label indicating characteristic of the sample geographic location. The trained machine learning model may be used to analyze the image data to determine the characteristic of the specific geographic location. In some examples, the characteristic of geographic locations may be received from a user (for example through a user interface), may be read from memory, may be received from an external device, and/or may be obtained from a database.</p><p id="p-0507" num="0506">Some disclosed embodiments may involve implementing the specific content placement rule to prevent a display of the virtual content at the specific geographic location in the at least one shared extended reality environment by at least some of the plurality of wearable extended reality appliances when a condition of the specific content placement rule is not met. Each wearable extended reality appliance (or its user) may be checked against rules. Those appliances or users who meet the rules may be permitted to post content; those who do not may be prohibited. A specific content placement rule may apply to multiple shared extended reality environments and may involve multiple parties. Depending on the purpose of presenting virtual content, there may be more than one shared extended reality environment. Many if not all users may have access to a public shared extended reality environment in which various types of virtual content may be displayed. However, there may also be a plurality of private shared extended reality environments in which virtual content may be shared only between a limited number of users. For example, in one private shared extended reality environment, content may only be shared between a limited number of users who may be friends or family. In another example, there may be a private shared extended reality environment where content may be shared between a limited number of users who are coworkers or students. In some examples, implementing the specific content placement rule to prevent a display of the virtual content at the specific geographic location in the at least one shared extended reality environment may comprise avoiding adding the virtual content to the at least one shared extended reality environment, at all or at least at the specific geographic location.</p><p id="p-0508" num="0507">While specific types of content may be permitted in some shared extended reality environments, this content may not be permitted in other shared extended reality environments based on specific content placement rules at specific geographic locations. Content placement rules may be based on content type, time of day, virtual space constraints, and/or whether the specific geographic location is public or private. When a content placement rule is met, display of virtual content may be enabled. When a content placement rule is not met, display of virtual content may be prevented. For example, advertisements may be permitted in a public shared extended reality environment, but not in a private office environment or a private friends or family environment. Such a private environment may also be in a wearable extended reality appliance user's home, and it may be desirable to not have unwanted ads in one's home. The system may use the content placement rules to prevent unwanted content. In one example, users in home, office, and family environments, i.e., a plurality of users in different shared extended reality environments, may prevent the public content from being presented because it may interfere with their ability to present the content that they wanted, such as business-related content. In this example, presenting public advertisements in a private office setting may be distracting to employees. The group of users that may prevent the display of content may also be a local government or regulatory entity.</p><p id="p-0509" num="0508">Some disclosed embodiments may involve implementing the specific content placement rule to enable the display of the virtual content at the specific geographic location in the at least one shared extended reality environment by at least some of the plurality of wearable extended reality appliances when the condition of the specific content placement rule is met. In some examples, implementing the specific content placement rule to enable the display of the virtual content at the specific geographic location in the at least one shared extended reality environment may comprise adding the virtual content to the at least one shared extended reality environment at the specific geographic location.</p><p id="p-0510" num="0509">In some embodiments, content may be enabled to be presented, provided that a specific content placement rule is met. A content placement rule may be based on content type, time of day, virtual space constraints, and/or whether the specific geographic location is public or private. Content may be presented when the content placement rule is met, and the specific content placement rule may apply to more than one shared extended reality environment, i.e., both a public and private extended reality environment. In some embodiments, a plurality of wearable extended reality appliance users may implement a content placement rule, and that plurality of users may determine which content may be presented and which content may not be presented. Additionally, this plurality of users may determine whether virtual content may be presented in both private and public shared extended reality environments.</p><p id="p-0511" num="0510">A content placement rule may apply to content that is useful and informative to all users and/or conveys emergency information. For example, a content placement rule may permit news and weather reports to be displayed in emergency situations, such as when severe weather is approaching the area. In one embodiment, this content placement rule may be met when the public content that is requested to be presented is informative to all users, i.e., it includes urgent weather-related information, and thus may be enabled to be presented.</p><p id="p-0512" num="0511">A plurality of users, i.e., local government or regulatory entities, may determine which public content may be displayed in private shared extended reality environments. Additionally, permitting this content to be presented may meet the content placement rule described above, and thus may be presented by at least some private shared extended reality environments. Each unique content placement rule may be configured by an individual wearable extended reality appliance user or plurality of users.</p><p id="p-0513" num="0512">In some embodiments, implementing the specific content placement rule to enable virtual content display may include presenting the virtual content in a manner overlaying a physical object at the specific geographic location. When overlaying virtual content at the specific geographic location, there may be at least one physical object and at least one virtual object. Overlaying virtual content may refer to presenting virtual content atop a physical object. The physical object may be a screen, sign, poster, wall, window, or any other physical object wherein virtual content may be displayed. For example, a specific content placement rule to enable virtual content display may require virtual content to be presented on a screen or other flat surface. If there is no screen or other flat surface available, the request to present virtual content may be denied. By way of another example, a presented virtual object may be docked with another virtual object before being overlaid over the physical object, i.e., two virtual objects are docked with one another before they are presented over a physical object such as a screen. For example, presented virtual content may involve a first virtual object such as video content. A second virtual object that may be docked with the video content may be a volume adjustment bar. The content placement rule at the specific geographic location may stipulate that a second virtual object, here, a volume adjustment bar, must be associated with the virtual content before the content may be overlaid over the physical object. The content placement rule may be met if the first virtual object (the video content) and the second virtual object (the volume bar) are docked to one another before the content is presented over the physical object. In this example, the content placement rule is met, and the presentation request may be granted. In another example, the same content placement rule applies, i.e., virtual objects must be docked to one another before content may be displayed over physical object. In this example, if the first virtual object (the video content) is not docked with the second virtual object (the volume adjustment bar), the content placement rule is not met, and the presentation request may be denied.</p><p id="p-0514" num="0513">In some embodiments, implementing the specific content placement rule to enable virtual content display may include docking the virtual content to a physical object located in an area of the specific geographic location. Docking may refer to the action of linking, tethering, attaching, pairing, or in some way connecting a virtual object and a physical object. An example of a virtual object is a virtual screen (also referred to as a &#x2018;Virtual display&#x2019; or a &#x2018;Virtual display screen&#x2019; herein), and an example of a physical object may be a keyboard. When docked, the virtual object and the physical object may move together in tandem and change location and/or orientation. Virtual objects may also be docked with other virtual objects.</p><p id="p-0515" num="0514">In one implementation, the physical object may be movable, and some disclosed embodiments may further include receiving an input indicative of a movement of the physical object to a new location and enabling the display of the virtual content at the new location. A movable physical object may be one that is possible to relocate based on its size, weight, orientation, and/or other characteristic. A movable object may be a keyboard, a mouse, a touchpad, a pointing device, a microphone, a pencil, a pen, a stylus, a joystick, a person, a robot, and/or any other object that a wearable extended reality appliance user may dock with a virtual object.</p><p id="p-0516" num="0515">In some embodiments, input indicative of a movement of a physical object may be received from a sensor included in the physical object. Movement may also be detected based on position of the object. In one example, a sensor may be a motion sensor, image sensor, and/or a combination of a motion sensor and an image sensor. Other examples of using other sensors to determine movement of physical objects are discussed above. The captured motion or image data may be used in order to determine that the physical object has moved to a new location. The sensor(s) may be located on any part of the physical object so that a motion sensor may accurately capture changes in position and/or orientation, and the image sensor may capture changes in color, brightness, texture, and/or light so as to signal a change in location. A motion sensor may be associated with the physical object which sends a signal to the processor associated with the non-transitory computer readable medium that the keyboard has moved to a new location. Image data may also be used to determine that the movable physical object has moved to a new location, for example by analyzing the image data using an ego-motion algorithm. Once it is determined that the movable physical object has relocated, the virtual content may be displayed at the second location. The virtual content may be displayed at the second location because the virtual object is docked to the physical object.</p><p id="p-0517" num="0516">Some disclosed embodiments may further include receiving an input indicative of a movement of the physical object to a new geographic location. The processor, for example, based on captured image or motion data received from the physical object, or based on other input data as described above, may determine that the physical object has moved to a new geographic location. For example, the image data may be analyzed using an ego-motion algorithm or an ego positioning algorithm to determine that the physical object has moved to a new geographic location. The processor may also determine a change in physical location based on GPS data. In this example, a GPS is included as part of the movable physical object.</p><p id="p-0518" num="0517">Some disclosed embodiments may further include selecting a second content placement rule, based on the new geographic location. Content placement rules may change between two different geographic locations. A first geographic location may be private, and a second geographic location may be public. Content placement rules may also change between two public geographic locations. For example, for public locations, a first town may have different public content placement rules compared to a second town. In some embodiments, the movable physical object may be moved from a first location to a second location. Because the physical object is docked with a virtual object, the virtual object moves to the second location as well. Here, the second location may have a different content placement rule compared to the first location's content placement rule. For example, the first location may be a public location, and the second location may be private. The public location may have different content placement rules as compared to the private location. For example, advertisements may be permitted in the first public location, but not in the second private location.</p><p id="p-0519" num="0518">Some disclosed embodiments may include implementing the second content placement rule to prevent a display of the virtual content at the new geographic location when a condition of the second content placement rule is not met. Other disclosed embodiments may also include implementing the second content placement rule to enable the display of the virtual content at the new geographic location when the condition of the second content placement rule is met.</p><p id="p-0520" num="0519">In some embodiments, a content placement rule at a first specific geographic location may be met, enabling content to be presented. However, the content placement rule at a second specific geographic location may not be met, and the request to present content may be denied. The content placement rule may govern virtual content type, virtual space restrictions, time of day restrictions, and/or public or private shared extended reality space restrictions. The second specific geographic location may be in the same shared extended reality space (i.e., public or private), may be in a different shared extended reality space, and/or may be located close to or remote from the first specific geographic location. In other embodiments, a content placement rule at a first geographic location may not be met, and thus virtual content is prevented from being presented. However, a content placement rule at a second specific geographic location may be met, thus enabling virtual content to be presented.</p><p id="p-0521" num="0520">For example, advertisements may be permitted in the first public location, but not in a second private location. Thus, a requesting entity may be prevented from presenting virtual content in a second private location because the second content placement rule has not been met. In the example described above, the requesting entity was unable to present virtual content in the second location because they did not meet the second content placement rules. In that example, presenting advertisements was permitted in the first public location but not the second private location. In another example, however, a presenting entity may be presenting content that is permitted in both a public first location and a private second location. For example, the presented content may be a weather report that is beneficial to both public users and private users. Local government or regulatory entities may determine what content is permitted to be displayed in both public and private shared extended reality environments. In this example, the content placement rule in the private specific geographic location permits news reports to be presented but prevents advertising content from being presented. Thus, because the content placement rule of the second location is met, the content may be presented. If a user does not wish to view this content, he or she may create another shared extended reality environment and filter out the content that he or she does not wish to view. This user may add other users to the new shared extended reality environment based on the new content placement restrictions the user created.</p><p id="p-0522" num="0521">In some embodiments, implementing the specific content placement rule to enable virtual content display may include storing data associated with the virtual content and associating the data with the specific geographic location. Stored data may include content type of the displayed content, i.e., public or private content, inanimate or animate content, i.e., video or document content, two-dimensional or three-dimensional content, and/or the display size of the content. Data may be stored over time in the non-transitory computer readable medium. This data, over time, may be associated with a specific geographic location. The data may be placed in a record in a database or data structure, and/or the two items (i.e., the requested virtual content and the specific geographic location) may be linked in a database (such as a key-value database), data structure, or lookup table, in order to be associated with a specific geographic location. For example, an entity may present different types of virtual content at different specific geographic locations over a one-year period. The entity presents the same type of virtual content as the same location each time. Thus, over the one-year period, the processor associated with the non-transitory computer readable medium may preemptively associate certain virtual content with certain specific geographic locations and may preemptively determine that a specific content placement rule to enable content display is met or not met based on the stored data. In some embodiments, a machine learning algorithm may also be implemented to store test data over time, such that the processor may preemptively determine which virtual content may be permitted to be displayed, and which virtual content may be prevented from being displayed.</p><p id="p-0523" num="0522">For example, an entity may present an advertisement at a particular specific geographic location in a public shared extended space three or four times consecutively. When the wearable extended reality appliance receives the fifth request, the processor may automatically determine that the content placement rule is met based on the entity's prior placement of the content.</p><p id="p-0524" num="0523">In some embodiments, implementing the specific content placement rule to enable virtual content display may include determining a time limitation for displaying the virtual content at the specific geographic location. A time limitation may include a cap on how long specific virtual content may be displayed. A time limitation may be based on the content type of the displayed content, i.e., public or private content, inanimate or animate content, two-dimensional or three-dimensional content, and/or the display size of the content. Public content may be displayed for a longer time as compared to private content, depending on the content placement rule at a specific geographic location. Time limitations may also be tied to a specific time of day. Depending on the virtual content displayed, the time limitation may be a set time period, such as one hour or two hours, or may be based on the time of day, such as morning, afternoon, evening, or nighttime. The time limitation may also be based on normal 9 AM to 5 PM working hours. In this example, some virtual content may be time-limited to be displayed only during working hours, and some virtual content may be time-limited to only be displayed outside of working hours. In one example, displayed content may be public and in a high-trafficked area such as a town square or park. At peak times, such as when people are going to and from work, time limitations at that specific geographic location may be short. That is, virtual content may be displayed for a shorter time at peak traffic periods than at lower traffic periods.</p><p id="p-0525" num="0524">Time limitations may also exist for the hours themselves. For example, content may be prevented from being displayed at a specific geographic location at night or during the earlier morning. In another example, content placement rules at specific geographic locations may be related to working hours. Here, content placement rules may permit some content outside of working hours and not permit that content during working hours. Virtual content that may lie within this rule may include public advertisements for bars, clubs, or other social gathering spaces. Presenting virtual content related to these spaces during working hours may hinder productivity, and thus may not be permitted in a shared extended realty environment.</p><p id="p-0526" num="0525">In some embodiments, implementing the specific content placement may include modifying the virtual content for display at the specific geographic location. Modifying the display of content may refer to reducing certain display parameters and/or changing the subject matter of the displayed content and may occur in a myriad of ways. Modifying the display of content may include reducing brightness, intensity, or opacity of inanimate content, reducing the frame rate of animate content, changing the color scheme of displayed content, and/or reducing the display size of the virtual content. Modifying the display of content may also involve changing the content itself in order to meet the specific content placement restriction at the specific geographic location. For example, modifying the display of content may include modifying a gender of a character in an advertisement from a man to a woman.</p><p id="p-0527" num="0526">For example, if there are virtual space constraints at the specific geographic location, an entity may modify the size of the presented virtual content. An entity may also change the colors of the presented virtual content to meet specific geographic location requirements. For example, an office or classroom may have a desired color scheme for presented content. The content itself may also be changed based on the restrictions associated with the location. For example, if a school or place of worship is nearby, an entity that wishes to present content may need to ensure that the presented content is not offending. In another example, animated content may need to be changed to inanimate content if the geographic restrictions require it. In yet another example, three-dimensional content may need to be reconfigured as two-dimensional content to meet virtual space constraints.</p><p id="p-0528" num="0527">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b></figref> depicts a flow chart <b>3910</b> illustrating method <b>3910</b> of determining whether to display content. Method <b>3910</b> may include step <b>3912</b> of receiving a request from an entity to display virtual content. Method <b>3910</b> may also include step <b>3914</b> of receiving information associated with the entity's request. Such information, as discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref>, may include information about an identity of the entity, information about a physical location of the entity, ownership information, affiliation information, and/or content type information. Method <b>3910</b> may also include step <b>3916</b> of identifying a specific content placement rule. Such a rule may be based on the type of content the entity wishes to present, and/or whether it is public or private. Method <b>3910</b> may also include step <b>3918</b> of determining whether the content placement rule is met. When the condition associated with the specific content placement rule is not met (Step <b>3918</b>: NO), method <b>3910</b> may include step <b>3920</b>, where virtual content may be prevented from being displayed at the specific geographic location. However, method <b>3910</b> may also include step <b>3922</b>, where the processor may receive ongoing information, such as time of day information and virtual space constraint information and may reevaluate the requesting entity's query accordingly. When the condition associated with the specific content placement rule is met (Step <b>3918</b>: YES), method <b>3910</b> may include step <b>3924</b>, which may enable the display of the virtual content at the specific geographic location. Method <b>3910</b> may also include step <b>3926</b> of receiving additional information. Even though the content placement rule is met at one specific geographic location, the content placement rule may not be met at a second geographic location.

Virtual content, as described more fully in other portions of this disclosure, may include any non-physical representation of information that may be displayed. Virtual content may include two-dimensional virtual objects, three-dimensional virtual objects, animated content, unanimated content, textual data, or other graphical representations. The virtual content may be shared in a physical room or a virtual room with physical viewers and/or virtual viewers. The position and/or orientation of the virtual content may be determined based on one or more viewer locations for optimal user experience. Multiple individuals wearing extended reality appliances may, for example, be presented with a virtual screen that may be displayed to each viewer at a single location to all viewers in a room, with each viewer being presented with the same content but from a different perspective.</p><p id="p-0531" num="0530">Some disclosed embodiments may involve receiving sensor data indicative of a plurality of wearable extended reality appliances located in a room. Receiving sensor data may refer to collecting, acquiring, gathering, or getting any type of data that is output from a sensor or that is derived from signals output from a sensor. For example, receiving the sensor data may comprise at least one of reading the sensor data from memory, receiving the sensor data from an external device, receiving the sensor data from one or more sensors, capturing the sensor data using one or more sensors, and so forth. A sensor may refer to a device that detects and/or responds to an input from a physical or virtual environment. Non-limiting examples of sensors that may be used to provide sensor data indicative of a plurality of wearable extended reality appliances located in a room may include image sensors, audio sensors, motion sensors, temperature sensors, vibration sensors, infrared sensors, LIDAR sensors, or any other device capable of identifying the presence and/or the identity of wearable extended reality appliance. Other sensors that may be used to capture sensor data indicative of the plurality of wearable extended reality appliances being in the room, such as positioning sensor, are described above. For example, the sensor data may include sensor data captured using sensors included in wearable extended reality appliances, a processor within a server (e.g., server <b>210</b>) may receive sensor data from different processors within the wearable extended reality appliances, or a processor included in one of the wearable extended reality appliances may receive the sensor data. In another example, the sensor data may include sensor data captured using a sensor not included in any wearable extended reality appliance, such as an image sensor positioned in the room.</p><p id="p-0532" num="0531">A room may refer to an area, place, accommodation, or other similar space that may be occupied or where events may occur, such as a display of virtual content. The room may be a virtual room, a physical room, or a combination of a virtual and physical space. For example, data, for example in the form of multiple images captured at different times from an image sensor, may indicate, show, or portray that more than one wearable extended reality appliance are physically or virtually located in a physical or virtual room. For example, there may be two, three, four, or five wearable extended reality appliances in the room. In some examples, the room may be completely virtual, and, in other examples, the room may be completely physical.</p><p id="p-0533" num="0532">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b></figref> illustrates a plurality of wearable extended reality appliances <b>4102</b> located in a room <b>4100</b>.

It should be apparent to one ordinarily skilled in the art that the disclosed embodiments, for example, may include at least one processor for providing the functionality described herein. In some embodiments, at least one processor may be associated with a wearable extended reality appliance. The wearable extended reality appliance may be configured to acquire sensor data from an environment (for example, using one or more sensors included in the wearable extended reality appliance) and transmit the sensor data (or a portion of the sensor data) to, for example, a remote server. In some embodiments, the at least one processor may be configured to collect sensor data from a sensor associated with one or more wearable extended reality appliances. For example, if three extended reality appliance are in proximity to each other, one or more of them may transmit data obtained from an on-board sensor. For example, the sensor in one appliance may detect other appliances in proximity and transmit data identifying their presence and/or information reflective of their specific identity. Each wearable extended reality appliance may identify one or more other appliances to provide a collective indication of the appliances located within the same room or common physical (or virtual) space. The transmission of sensor data may occur over one or more networks, which may or may not involve remote servers. At least one processor may receive sensor data from a sensor associated with the wearable extended reality appliance or from some other sensor. At least one processor may use one or more programs or sets of program instructions to analyze data received from one or more sensors. For example, sensor data may be received by a processor within a server (e.g., server <b>210</b>) from a first wearable extended reality appliance, a second wearable extended reality appliance, or a third wearable extended reality appliance. Alternatively, sensor data may be received by the processor within the server (e.g., server <b>210</b>) from the first wearable extended reality appliance, the second wearable extended reality appliance, and the third wearable extended reality appliance. Sensor data may also be received by the processor within the server (e.g., server <b>210</b>) from a combination of a plurality of wearable extended reality appliances. For example, the sensor data may be in the form of images from an image sensor associated with a wearable extended reality appliance or may be in the form of values representing motion from a motion sensor associated with the wearable extended reality appliance.</p><p id="p-0535" num="0534">In some embodiments, the sensor data may be received from a sensor separated from the first wearable extended reality appliance, the second wearable extended reality appliance, and the third wearable extended reality appliance. A sensor may be considered to be &#x201c;separated&#x201d; from a wearable extended reality appliance when it is divided, not linked, not connected, or otherwise distinct from the wearable extended reality appliance. Non-limiting examples of a sensor that may be separated from a wearable extended reality appliance may include an infrastructure sensor mounted in a room (e.g., a physical conference room may have installed image sensors) or a moveable sensor placed in a room. The moveable sensor placed in a room may be a dedicated sensor configured for use with embodiments disclosed herein, or may be a sensor that is temporarily in the room, such as the camera on a laptop, phone, or wearable device other than a wearable extended reality appliance.</p><p id="p-0536" num="0535">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>42</b>A</figref> illustrates a sensor <b>4114</b> (e.g., two image sensors on two different walls) that is separate from a first wearable extended reality appliance, a second wearable extended reality appliance, and a third wearable extended reality appliance.

Further, the image data may be analyzed to determine that at least one of the first wearable extended reality appliance, the second wearable extended reality appliance, or the third wearable extended reality appliance may be physically located in the room. The analysis of the image data may involve a processor executing a sequence of stored instructions (e.g., a program) which takes inputs, process the inputs, and output the results to an output device. For example, at least one processor may receive the image data capture by the image sensor and may then execute a program in order to analyze the image data. For example, image data captured using an image sensor included in a particular wearable extended reality appliance (e.g., the first, second or third wearable extended reality appliance) may be analyzed using an ego-positioning algorithm, an ego-motion algorithm or a visual odometry algorithm to determine that the particular wearable extended reality appliance is in the room. In another example, image data captured using an image sensor not included in any wearable extended reality appliance may be analyzed using an object recognition algorithm to identify at least one of the first, second or third wearable extended reality appliance in the room.</p><p id="p-0538" num="0537">Non-limiting examples of image data may include one or more images of a whole room, part of the room, of a wearable extended reality appliance, of more than one wearable extended reality appliance, or of other objects or people in the room. Alternatively, or additionally, the sensor data may include audio data (e.g., information derived from sound signals) from an audio sensor (e.g., a microphone). Audio data, may, for example, represent sound or may be derivatives of sound. Non-limiting examples of audio data may include files in wave format, mp3 format, or WMA format. Or audio data may be information derived from a sound file such as a pattern or sound signature. A microphone may refer to an instrument for converting sound waves into electrical energy variations which may then be amplified, transmitted, or recorded. Examples of microphones may include dynamic microphones, condenser microphones, and ribbon microphones. Either such a microphone or a processor that receives sound signals from the microphone may process the sound digitally. For example, the audio sensor may be configured to collect audio data which may then be analyzed by a processor associated with the audio sensor. The analysis of the audio data may be recognize voices and differentiate between the recognized voices to determine that at least one of the wearable extended reality appliances is physically located in the room.</p><p id="p-0539" num="0538">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>42</b>A</figref> illustrates sensor <b>4114</b> in the form of two image sensors <b>4114</b> on two different walls in a physical conference room <b>4100</b>.

An appliance may be considered virtually located in a room if the appliance is not physically located in that room, but is participating (through information displayed) as if physically located in that room. The virtual presence may be represented by an avatar. An avatar may refer to a two-dimensional or three-dimensional virtual figure or virtual icon representative a user. A location that is &#x201c;reflective&#x201d; of a location of an avatar may refer to a location that is indicative, expressive, exhibitive, or similarly demonstrative of a location of that avatar. A user may refer to a person wearing an extended reality appliance. The determined location of the at least one wearable extended reality appliance may refer to a position or place within a coordinate system (e.g., a Cartesian coordinate system). For example, pixels of images captured by an image sensor may be compared to one another to determine that at least one of the wearable extended reality appliances may be virtually located in a room. For example, a user who is not physically located in a room will not be detected by image sensors in the room. This is one way of using image data to determine that a participant is virtually located in a room. In such an instance, an avatar may appear virtually in place of a participant while other participants are physically located in the room. The avatar may be a virtual copy of the user, a character, or any other virtual object representative of the user. For example, the avatar may be an extended reality display of Yoda.

In order to present information to each from perspectives corresponding to their unique locations, or for other uses, their locations may be determined. To this end, sensor data from the types of sensors described earlier may be used to identify each location of each wearable extended reality appliance. A single sensor may detect information from which all appliance locations may be determined, or data from multiple sensors may be aggregated to determine the locations of each wearable extended reality appliance. In some cases, data from the sensor in one appliance may be used to determine a location of another appliance and vice versa. Physical attributes of the room may also be used in location determination. For example, sensor data may be used to identify corners of a room or other physical attributes of the room, and the wearable extended reality appliances may be located relative to those physical attributes. Non-limiting examples of other such physical attributes may include the placement of furniture or other objects. Thus, pixels of images from an image sensor may be analyzed, for example using a visual object localization algorithm, to determine a first location in the room of a first wearable extended reality appliance, a second location in the room of a second wearable extended reality appliance, and a third location in the room of a third wearable extended reality appliance.

For example, pixels of images from the sensors <b>4114</b> separated may be analyzed to determine a first location <b>4106</b> in the room <b>4100</b> of a first wearable extended reality device, a second location <b>4108</b> in the room <b>4100</b> of a second wearable extended reality device, and a third location <b>4210</b> in the room <b>4100</b> of a third wearable extended reality device.</p><p id="p-0549" num="0548">Some disclosed embodiments may include determining a position for displaying the virtual object in the room based on the determined first location, the determined second location, and the determined third location. A display position may be determined based on the locations of each wearable extended reality appliance. For example, if three appliances are arranged side by side at a conference room table, a processor may determine that the best position to display the screen is opposite the three appliances as opposed to on a perpendicular side end of the table. Such a determination may take into account the fields of view of each wearable extended reality appliance. In some instances, the determination may take into account articles in the room. For example, if an easel displaying a whiteboard is immediately opposite users of wearable extended reality appliances, the determined placement may be such so as not to block the white board on the easel. Non-limiting examples of a position for displaying a virtual object in a room based on the determined locations may include a position between the determined locations, a position of intersection between the determined locations, a position closer to one of the determined locations, a position closer to two of the determined locations, a position furthest away from the determined locations, or a position closest to the determined locations. For example, if the three determined locations form a triangle, the position for displaying the virtual object in the room may be in the middle of the triangle. In another example, when the three determined locations form a single line or row, the position for displaying the virtual object in the room may be parallel and in front of the line or row.</p><p id="p-0550" num="0549">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>42</b>A</figref> illustrates a determined position <b>4112</b> for displaying a virtual object <b>4104</b> in a room <b>4100</b> based on a determined first location <b>4106</b>, a determined second location <b>4108</b>, and a determined third location <b>4210</b>. For example, the determined position <b>4112</b> is at a corner of the room <b>4100</b> between the determined first location <b>4106</b>, the determined second location <b>4108</b>, and the determined third location <b>4210</b>.</p><p id="p-0551" num="0550">In some embodiments, the determined position for displaying the virtual object may include a determined orientation of the virtual object in the room, and additional sensor data may be analyzed to determine that at least two of the first wearable extended reality appliance, the second wearable extended reality appliance, or the third wearable extended reality appliance changed orientation or location, and adjusting the determined orientation of the virtual object may be based on the orientation or location change. Orientation may refer to direction or the relative position of an object or individual. Individuals tend to change their orientations over time, by shifting their focus, turning their bodies, or changing their posture. When they do, the changes may impact a virtual presentation. Similarly, individuals may change their locations by moving from one spot to another. Sensor data may be used to determine that one or more of the wearable virtual reality appliances changed orientation or location, for example, if a user shifts in a chair so that the user's body position turns to the right, and another user's body position shifts to the left, the orientational movements may be detected, and a virtual display may shift to accommodate the new positions. Such orientational changes may be determined based on analysis of image data from one or more of the sensors described earlier, and the virtual object may be reoriented to accommodate the orientational changes of one or more users. Similar adjustments may be made for locational changes. For example, if two users were to move from one side of the room to another closer to a third user, a virtual display that was originally centered in the room may shift toward the center of the reoriented group. Or if a group encircles a virtual object, and some of the group members shift so that the center of the encirclement changes, the virtual object may move toward the new center Further, pixels from additional images from an image sensor may be analyzed to determine that at least two of a first wearable extended reality appliance, a second wearable extended reality appliance, or a third wearable extended reality appliance (which may include the individual wearing the appliance) changed orientation (e.g., from facing the center of the room to facing the door of the room). In some embodiments the determined orientation of the virtual object may be adjusted based on the orientation changes so that the virtual object also faces the door of the room.</p><p id="p-0552" num="0551">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b></figref> illustrates a determined position <b>4112</b> for displaying a virtual object <b>4104</b> which may include a determined orientation (e.g., facing two users) of the virtual object <b>4104</b> in a room <b>4100</b>. For example, pixels of images from additional images from sensors <b>4114</b> separated from wearable extended reality appliances may be analyzed by an at least one processor to determine that at least two of a first wearable extended reality appliance, a second wearable extended reality appliance, or a third wearable extended reality appliance changed orientation (e.g., from facing two users to facing three users). The determined orientation of the virtual object <b>4104</b> may be adjusted to facing three users in the room <b>4100</b> based on the orientation changes so that the virtual object <b>4104</b> still faces the users.</p><p id="p-0553" num="0552">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b></figref> illustrates a determined position <b>4112</b> for displaying a virtual object <b>4104</b> that includes a determined location (e.g., a corner of the room <b>4100</b>) of the virtual object <b>4104</b> in a room <b>4100</b>. For example, pixels from additional images from a sensor <b>4114</b> separated from wearable extended reality appliances may be analyzed to determine that at least two of a first wearable extended reality appliance, a second wearable extended reality appliance, or a third wearable extended reality appliance changed location (e.g., a third user entered the room). The determined location of the virtual object <b>4104</b> may be adjusted in the room <b>4100</b> based on the location changes so that the virtual object <b>4104</b> is not occluded.</p><p id="p-0554" num="0553">Some disclosed embodiments may include causing a first display of the virtual object at the determined position through the first wearable extended reality appliance, the first display being rendered from a first perspective. Additionally other disclosed embodiments may include causing a second display of the virtual object at the determined position through the second wearable extended reality appliance, the second display being rendered from a second perspective different from the first perspective. Still further, additional disclosed embodiments may include causing a third display of the virtual object at the determined position through the third wearable extended reality appliance, the third display being rendered from a third perspective different from the first perspective and the second perspective. A display that is rendered from a perspective may refer to a display delivered, depicted, or presented due to or because of an angle, aspect, context, viewpoint, or a similar point of view. In some embodiments, perspectives are simulated in the virtual world as they would appear in the real world. In the real world, three individuals sitting in different locations in the same room and viewing an object will each see the object somewhat differently, depending on their relative positions. In some disclosed embodiments, computer readable medium running on at least one processor collects data from sensors to determine differing locations or orientations of different wearers of extended reality appliances, and renders the view of each differently, to effectively simulate the perspectives they would see if viewing a real object from their respective orientations. Non-limiting examples of a display that is rendered from a perspective may include the display positioned to the left, the center, the right, higher up, or lower down from a user's focal point. A first display of the virtual object, a second display of the virtual object, and a third display of the virtual object rendered from their own perspective, respectively may be the same display. Alternatively, the first display of the virtual object, the second display of the virtual object, and the third display of the virtual object rendered from their own perspective, respectively may be different versions of the display. For example, the first display of the virtual object at a determined position through a first wearable extended reality appliance, rendered from the first perspective may be of the virtual object positioned lower in height in reference to the wearable extended reality appliance. As another example, the second display of the virtual object at a determined position through a second wearable extended reality appliance, rendered from the second perspective may be of the virtual object positioned higher in reference to the wearable extended reality appliance and straight in front of the wearable extended reality appliance. As yet another example, the third display of the virtual object at a determined position through a third wearable extended reality appliance, rendered from the third perspective may be of the virtual object positioned higher in reference to the wearable extended reality appliance and to the side of the wearable extended reality appliance. In some examples, the first perspective, second perspective and third perspective may be selected so that users of the first, second and third wearable extended reality appliances may all see a first portion of the virtual object at the same first position in the room, a second portion of the virtual object at the same second position in the room, and a third portion of the virtual object at the same third position in the room. For example, the first perspective, second perspective and third perspective may be selected so mimic the different projections of the objects when viewed from different positions in the room (for example, from the positions of the first, second and third wearable extended reality appliances, respectively).</p><p id="p-0555" num="0554">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>42</b>B</figref> illustrates a first display of a virtual object <b>4104</b> at a determined position <b>4112</b> through a first wearable extended reality appliance. In this example, the first display may be rendered from a first perspective of the virtual object <b>4104</b> positioned at an angle where the left side of the virtual object <b>4104</b> is closer to the first wearable extended reality appliance than the right side. By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>42</b>B</figref> also illustrates a second display of the virtual object <b>4104</b> at a determined position <b>4112</b> through a second wearable extended reality appliance. In this example, the second display may be rendered from a second perspective of the virtual object <b>4104</b> where the right side of the virtual object <b>4104</b> is almost as close as the left side of the virtual object <b>4104</b>. By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>42</b>B</figref> illustrates a third display of the virtual object <b>4104</b> at a determined position <b>4112</b> through a third wearable extended reality appliance. In this example, the third display may be rendered from a third perspective of the virtual object <b>4104</b> positioned where the right side of the virtual object <b>4104</b> is closer to the third wearable extended reality appliance than the left side.</p><p id="p-0556" num="0555">Some disclosed embodiments may include determining an identity of at least one of a user of the first wearable extended reality appliance, a user of the second wearable extended reality appliance, or a user of the third wearable extended reality appliance; and wherein determining the position for displaying the virtual object may be further based on the identity of the at least one user. Each user may have different physical characteristics and different preferences. A system may store information relating to those characteristics and preferences and alter the display based on them. For example, some users may prefer to sit farther from a screen. Other users may prefer to view two adjacent screens in an angled rather than linear arrangement. For example, by identifying particular users, a lookup may occur in a data structure of the user's characteristics/preferences, and the virtual display may be adjusted for each user accordingly.</p><p id="p-0557" num="0556">By way of another example, the identity of the at least one user may refer to a status or title or other classification. Information displayed to individuals in the same virtual room may differ based on their class. Higher ups, for example, may be presented with financial data that may not be presented to others. Non-limiting examples of an identity may include a boss, a manager, an employee, a partner, an associate, an owner, a non-employee, an independent contractor, a licensee, a licensor, or a relative. The same data may be presented differently based on identity. For example, if the user's identity is that of a partner, the position for displaying the virtual object may be directly in front of or closer to the partner so that the partner has the best or most clear view of the virtual object.</p><p id="p-0558" num="0557">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>42</b>A</figref> illustrates an identity <b>4218</b> (e.g., a partner) of at least one of a user of a first wearable extended reality appliance, a user of a second wearable extended reality appliance, or a user of a third wearable extended reality appliance. For example, when the determined identity <b>4218</b> of the user is a partner, a position <b>4112</b> for displaying a virtual object <b>4104</b> may be in clear view for the partner.</p><p id="p-0559" num="0558">Some disclosed embodiments may include determining a physical characteristic of at least one user of the first wearable extended reality appliance, the second wearable extended reality appliance, or the third wearable extended reality appliance; and wherein determining the position for displaying the virtual object may be further based on the physical characteristic of the at least one user. Non-limiting examples of physical characteristics may include the height of the at least one user or disabilities of the at least one user. For example, when a determined physical characteristic of a user is tall (which means that the user is used to looking at objects from a higher vantage point) virtual objects may be presented lower in the field of view on that tall user's wearable extended reality appliance. If the determined physical characteristic is that a user is near-sighted, the position for displaying the virtual object may be closer to that user so that the user may clearly see the virtual object. For example, if the determined physical characteristic is that the at least one user has hearing problems, the position for displaying the virtual object may be closer to the at least one user so that sounds associated with the virtual object are closer to the user.</p><p id="p-0560" num="0559">Some disclosed embodiments may include determining a layout of the room that may involve one or more physical locations of furniture in the room, and wherein the position for displaying the virtual object may be further determined based on the layout of the room. A layout may refer to an arrangement, format, configuration, design, or way in which a room set up. An example of a layout may include four chairs, a desk, and a presentation board. Non-limiting examples of furniture may include one or more chairs, desks, plants, and a presentation board. A position of a virtual object (e.g., a virtual display screen) may be determined based on the layout of the room. If four chairs are detected (via sensors and processing described earlier) as arranged in a U-shape, a processor may determine that a virtual object such as a virtual screen should be positioned opposite the open end of the U. In one example, the position for displaying the virtual object may be strategically placed to avoid occlusion of at least part of the virtual object by furniture in the room. In another example, the position of the virtual object may on a surface of an object, such as a wall or a table. In yet another example, an egress such as door to the room may be taken into account when positioning a virtual object so that persons entering or leaving the room avoid colliding with the virtual object.</p><p id="p-0561" num="0560">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>42</b>A</figref> illustrates a layout of a room <b>4100</b> that may include one or more physical locations of furniture <b>4120</b> in the room <b>4100</b>. For example, the layout of the room <b>4100</b> may include two chairs, a desk, and a vase of plants (that serves an example of a physical object <b>4124</b>). Further, a position <b>4112</b> for displaying a virtual object <b>4104</b> may be further determined based on the layout of the room <b>4100</b> that may involve the one or more physical locations of furniture <b>4120</b>. Advantageously, the position <b>4112</b> for displaying the virtual object <b>4104</b> may be in front of the one or more physical locations of furniture <b>4120</b> in the room <b>4100</b>.</p><p id="p-0562" num="0561">Some disclosed embodiments may include determining illumination conditions in the room, and the position for displaying the virtual object may further be determined based on the illumination conditions. An illumination condition may refer to the state of the room's brightness, radiance, glittering, glowing, or similar lighting level. Non-limiting examples of illumination conditions may include the lighting level of two overhead lights in a single room. For example, to avoid glare, a position for displaying a virtual object (e.g., a virtual display screen) may be based on illumination conditions so that the position for display avoids a direct light source with respect to a user. In another example, the determined illumination conditions in the room may be dim or dark so that the position for displaying the virtual object (e.g., a virtual movie screen) is based on the dimness or darkness and positioned in a darker area in the room. Alternatively, in another example, the determined illumination conditions in the room may be bright or well-lit so that the position for displaying the virtual object (e.g., a virtual object with a text document) is based on the bright conditions and positioned in a brighter area in the room for users to read the text easier. In yet another example, the determined illumination conditions may include locations of borders between shaded and non-shaded areas and the position for displaying the virtual object may be determined so that the virtual object is not across the border. Further, in another example, the determined illumination conditions may include an indication that the borders are about to move (for example, due to motion of the sun), and the position for displaying the virtual object may be determined so that the virtual object is not across the border during a selected time duration.</p><p id="p-0563" num="0562">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>44</b></figref> illustrates illumination conditions <b>4422</b> in a room <b>4100</b>. The illumination conditions <b>4422</b> may be provided by two overhanging lights in the room <b>4100</b>. For example, a position <b>4112</b> for displaying a virtual object <b>4104</b> may further be determined based on the illumination conditions <b>4422</b> so that the determined position <b>4112</b> avoids glare or a direct light source with respect to a user of a wearable extended reality appliance.</p><p id="p-0564" num="0563">Some disclosed embodiments may include determining a type of the virtual object, and the position for displaying the virtual object may further be determined based on the type of the virtual object. Non-limiting examples of a type of a virtual object may include animate virtual objects, inanimate virtual objects, two-dimensional virtual objects, three-dimensional virtual objects, virtual characters, virtual environments, virtual documents, virtual display screens, virtual widgets, or virtual overlays of a portion or whole of a physical environment or physical object. For example, the determined type of virtual object may be a virtual display screen and a position for displaying the virtual display screen may be determined on a wall of a room, for example because the virtual object is a virtual two-dimensional virtual display screen. In another example, the determined type of virtual object may be a three-dimensional product and the position for displaying the virtual solar system may be determined in the middle of the room to permit three-dimensional virtual viewing. In yet another example, the determined type of virtual object may be virtual rain and the position for displaying the virtual rain may be determined as falling or originating from the top of the room and falling to the ground of the room, for example because the type of the virtual object is rain.</p><p id="p-0565" num="0564">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b></figref> illustrates a type (e.g., a virtual display screen, a two-dimensional virtual object, a three-dimensional virtual object, etc.) of a virtual object <b>4104</b> and a position <b>4112</b> for displaying the virtual object <b>4104</b> may further be determined based on the type of the virtual object <b>4104</b>. For example, the determined type of virtual object <b>4104</b> may be a virtual display screen and the position <b>4112</b> for displaying the virtual object <b>4104</b> may be determined in the corner of the room as a virtual two-dimensional object.</p><p id="p-0566" num="0565">Some disclosed embodiments may include analyzing the sensor data to identify a physical object in the room and the position for displaying the virtual object may be determined so that none of the first display, the second display, and the third display may be occluded by the physical object. A ray casting algorithm may be used to determine the position in which none of the first display, the second display, and the third display are occluded by the physical object. Occluded may refer to blocked, prevented, or a similar obstruction. Non-limiting examples of physical objects may be a user, a piece of furniture (e.g., a chair, table, or door), a laptop, food, a drink, a presentation board. For example, pixels of images from an image sensor may be analyzed to identify a physical object (e.g., a row of chairs). Further, a position for displaying a virtual object (e.g., a virtual display screen) may be determined to be higher on a wall of a room so that none of a first display, a second display, and a third display may be occluded by the row of chairs. In another example, pixels of images from an image sensor may be analyzed to identify the physical object (e.g., a presentation board).

Additionally, a change, introduced by a user of the first wearable extended reality appliance to the virtual object may be detected. Further, the second display and the third display may be updated to reflect the change to the virtual object introduced by the user of the first wearable extended reality appliance. Displays may be associated with a single version if each display presents the same subject matter, even if viewed from differing perspectives. A user may introduce a change may adding material, virtually drawing on or coloring an object, rotating or translating the object, or otherwise modifying the object. When all users are presented with a single version and that single version is altered by one user, the alteration may be displayed to other users through each user's wearable extended reality appliance. For example, a first display of a virtual object (e.g., a virtual display screen), a second display of the virtual object, and a third display of the virtual object may be associated with a single version (e.g., a single view) of the virtual object so that each display is identical to each user, even after one user makes a change to the virtual object. Additionally, a user of a first wearable extended reality appliance may be advancing between virtual slides of a virtual slideshow on the virtual display screen and this change may be detected by a sensor connected to at least one of the first wearable extended reality appliance, a second wearable extended reality appliance, and a third wearable extended reality appliance. In another example, the virtual object may be a virtual display, and the change may include a presentation of text entered by the first user using a physical keyboard. In another example, the change may be introduced by a usage of a marking implement. Further, the second display and the third display may be updated to reflect the new virtual slide of the virtual presentation introduced by the user of the first wearable extended reality appliance.</p><p id="p-0571" num="0570">In some embodiments, the first display of the virtual object, the second display of the virtual object, and the third display of the virtual object may be associated with different versions of the virtual object. Additionally, a profile associated with a user of the first wearable extended reality appliance, a profile associated with a user the second wearable extended reality appliance, and a profile associated with a user of the third wearable extended reality appliance may be obtained. Further, a personalized version of the virtual object based on the profile associated with each user may be determined. In the prior example discussed, a single version of a virtual object was presented to all users. In this example, each user may be presented with a unique version depending on the user's preferences. For example, some users may have color preferences and those preferences may be carried through to their unique presentations via a look up of those preferences in a data structure which then causes alteration of the display to correspond to those preferences. Other users may have disabilities that may cause their virtual content to be displayed differently from others. For example, blinking and flashing may be avoided on virtual displays of individuals who have epilepsy to avoid a risk of seizure. Word spacing may change on displays of individuals with dyslexia. These are just examples of profile information that may be stored in a data structure that is accessed to determine how virtual objects will be displayed.</p><p id="p-0572" num="0571">Different versions may refer to different details of a virtual object. In other words, different versions may present different points of view of the virtual object. The display may thus be impacted by a profile which may include indications of permission level (e.g., top-secret), accessibility limitations (e.g., confidential information), or preferences to color scheme or disabilities (e.g., color blind). For example, a first display of a virtual object, a second display of the virtual object, and a third display of the virtual object may be associated with different versions of the virtual object. A profile for each user of a wearable extended reality appliance may be obtained. For example, the first profile may be a top-secret permission level, the second profile may be restricted to non-confidential information, and the third profile may indicate that the third user is color blind. For example, the personalized version of the virtual object may be based on the determined profiles associated with each user. Advantageously, the first profile may see all information presented since he or she has a top-secret permission level. The second profile may see only some or part of the information because he or she is restricted to non-confidential information. The third profile may see the virtual object differently because of a color-blind mode.</p><p id="p-0573" num="0572">Some disclosed embodiments may include receiving additional sensor data indicating a change to a status of the third wearable extended reality appliance, while the virtual object is displayed at the determined position through the first wearable extended reality appliance and through the second wearable extended reality appliance. Further, the virtual object may be repositioned based on the determined first location of the first wearable extended reality appliance and the determined second location of the second wearable extended reality appliance. A change to a status may include leaving a room, switching off, switching to a different extended reality environment not including the virtual object, and similar changes to a wearable extended reality appliance. For example, while a virtual object may be displayed at a determined position through a first wearable extended reality appliance and through a second wearable extended reality appliance, additional pixels of images from an image sensor may be received indicating that the third wearable extended reality appliance has switched off. Further, the virtual object may be repositioned based on a determined first location of the first wearable extended reality appliance and a determined second location of the second wearable extended reality appliance. In another example, additional pixels of images from the image sensor may be received indicating that the third wearable extended reality appliance is no longer in the room because the user has left the room with third wearable extended reality appliance.

The graphical display may be two-dimensional, three-dimensional, holographic, or may include various other types of visual characteristics. The first wearable extended reality appliance may cause one or more analog or digital signals to be generated or transmitted to a display device for presenting the graphical display for viewing by a user.

Virtual markings may broadly include any visual representation simulating in an extended reality environment writing/coloring/painting implement markings that exist in the physical world. Examples of types of virtual markings may include textual markings (e.g., words, sentences), punctuation markings (e.g., dots, commas), format markings (e.g., underlines, highlights), emoji markings (e.g., smiley, symbols), drawing markings (e.g., free hand sketching such as lines, figures, symbols, or any other individual or set of visible traces such as would occur in the physical world with pens, pencils, markers, chalk, or any other writing implement), colorization (such as might occur in the physical world with crayons, markers or paint brushes), texturizations (such as the addition of surface treatments), The virtual markings may be associated with one or more colors which may be rendered by software on top of one or more objects. The objects on which the virtual markings are drawn may refer to any physical or virtual items having a form which may be observed. For instance, an object may be an extended reality display of a 2D item or 3D item (e.g., a document, an image, a video, a virtual model, a shape, or any other intangible object) or a physical item, (e.g., food, furniture, a wall, a landscape, or any other tangible object).</p><p id="p-0585" num="0584">Some disclosed embodiments may include receiving an indication of an object. An indication of an object may refer to any data which may provide evidence of the existence of an object. The indication of the object may include type of data that enable identification of the object. The indication may include a location, form, color, size, distance to, material composition, and any other attribute which may describe the object. In some embodiments, the indication of the object may include one or more images of the object. The indication of the object may be received via a communications network, as described in greater detail herein. An indication of an object may be received, for example, via an image sensor that identifies an object in a field of view in the physical world. In another example, an indication of an object may be received from a rendering of an extended reality space that includes a virtual object, from a data-structure of virtual objects in an extended reality space, from an external device controlling the extended reality space, and so forth. By way of example, remote processing unit <b>208</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> may receive an indication of an object via communications network <b>214</b>. An indication of object may be a signal created by remote processing unit <b>208</b>, XR unit <b>204</b>, or input unit <b>202</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> to generate a virtual object or an identification of a physical object.</p><p id="p-0586" num="0585">In some embodiments, the object may be a virtual object presented by a wearable extended reality appliance. Additionally or alternatively, the object may be a physical object detectable in an image captured from the physical environment, for example using an image sensor included in the wearable extended reality appliance. By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>49</b></figref> illustrates an example of a virtual object <b>4910</b> presented to user <b>100</b> through wearable extended reality appliance <b>110</b> and an example of a physical object <b>4911</b>. User <b>100</b> may draw virtual markings on both objects. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>50</b></figref> illustrates a view of object <b>4910</b> as seen by user <b>100</b> through wearable extended reality appliance <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0587" num="0586">Some disclosed embodiments may include receiving from an image sensor an image of a hand of an individual holding a physical marking implement. An image sensor may include one or more sensors configured to capture visual information by converting light to image data, as described previously in this disclosure. A physical marking implement may refer to a tangible instrument that may be utilized by a user to provide inputs to make virtual colored markings on objects. A physical marking implement may take any form which may allow a user to make the virtual colored markings by performing movements with the physical marking implement. For instance, a physical marking implement may be or may resemble a stylus, pen, pencil, crayon, marker, chalk, paint brush, or any other instrument which a user may hold and move to make virtual colored markings on objects. Alternatively, a physical marking implement may take the form of an input device such as a mouse, a keyboard, a joystick, a touchpad or touch screen, or any other input device which may be used to provide an input to create virtual colored markings on objects. By way of example, a processing device may receive from image sensor <b>472</b> of XR unit <b>204</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> an image <b>5000</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>50</b></figref>, image <b>5000</b> may include a hand <b>5010</b> holding a physical marking implement <b>4920</b> having a tip <b>4922</b>, and an object <b>4910</b>.</p><p id="p-0588" num="0587">Some disclosed embodiments may include detecting in the image a color associated with the marking implement. Detecting in the image a color associated with the marking implement may include analyzing image data received from an image sensor to identify a color of the at least part of a marking implement being held by a user. For example, if the user is holding a red pen (or an implement configured to resemble a red pen) a processor may detect the color red. In another example, the marking implement may have a colored tip (for example, a blue tip), the image may be analyzed to detect the marking implement using an object detection algorithm, the region of the marking implement corresponding to the tip may be identified in the image using a template matching algorithm, and the values of the pixels in the identified region may be analyzed, for example using a statistical function or a histogram, to determine the color of the tip (for example, blue), thereby detecting that the color associated with the marking implement is the color of the tip (for example, blue). Alternatively, the marking implement may have a unique shape or code there that identifies it as being associated with the color red, and that unique shape or code may be recognized through image processing and look up in a data structure associating such shapes or codes with colors. In one example, detecting the color associated with the marking implement may first involve identifying the marking implement, which may occur by detection of a human hand holding the physical marking implement, for example using a hand detection algorithm. In some examples, a machine learning model may be trained using training examples to detect color associated with marking implements from images and/or videos. An example of such training example may include a sample image and/or a sample video of a sample marking implement, together with a label indicating the color associated with the sample marking implement. The trained machine learning model may be used to analyze the image and determine the color associated with the marking implement. By way of example, a processing device may detect from image <b>5000</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>50</b></figref>, a color associated with marking implement <b>4920</b>, e.g., red. Some examples of marking implements are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>52</b></figref>, represented as marking implements <b>5220</b>, <b>5222</b>, <b>5224</b>, and <b>5226</b>.</p><p id="p-0589" num="0588">Some disclosed embodiments may include receiving from the image sensor image data indicative of movement of a tip of the marking implement and locations of the tip. Image data may refer to signals or information received from or derived from the output of an image sensor. Image data may include images, grayscale images, color images, 2D images, 3D images, videos, 2D videos, 3D videos, frames, footages, color identification and/or data derived from or associated with any of the forgoing. A tip of the marking implement may refer to a distal end of a marking implement, for example of a marking implement associated with forming markings (e.g., what is referred to in the physical world as a pen, pencil, or crayon tip, a marking element of a magic marker, or the bristles of a paint brush). Non-physically functional virtual marking implements (i.e., an object that cannot produce physical drawings) may be considered marking implements within this disclosure in the sense that they are capable of causing virtual markings. Thus, the tip of the marking implement may be the end of a marking implement, such as a stylus, which may be used by a user to interact with a location on an image. In some embodiments, the tip of the marking implement may be a separate element which may be selectively attached and detached to a marking implement. In this example, differing tips may have differing colors and may be interchangeable. Movement of a tip of the marking implement may refer to any motion of the tip of the marking implement through space. Such movements may be detected through analysis of the image data using a visual object tracking algorithm. Locations of the tip may refer to one or more positions of the tip in space (such as a physical space, an extended reality space, etc.) as the tip moves through space or when the tip is stationary.</p><p id="p-0590" num="0589">In some embodiments, the tip of the marking implement may be detected as moving in 2D or 3D space. Data indicative of the movement or locations of the tip may refer to any data which may be analyzed to determine the movement or locations of the tip. For instance, the data indicative of the movement or locations of the tip may include positions, angles, distances, pixel locations, orientations, scales, speeds, accelerations, and any other property of the tip which may indicate a movement or location of the tip in 2D or 3D. In one example, the data indicative of the movement or locations of the tip may include a time series of locations or movement vectors associated with the tip. In another example, the data indicative of the movement or locations of the tip may include a group of locations or a group of movement vectors associated with the tip that are not sorted by time. In yet another example, the data indicative of the movement or locations of the tip may include a curved line associated with the movement or locations of the tip. By way of example, a processing device may receive from image sensor <b>472</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> image data indicative of movement of tip <b>4922</b> of marking implement <b>4920</b> and locations of tip <b>4922</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>51</b>A to <b>51</b>D</figref>. For instance, the processing device may receive a location <b>5102</b> of tip <b>4922</b> in image <b>5100</b>, a location <b>5112</b> of tip <b>4922</b> in image <b>5110</b>, a location <b>5122</b> of tip <b>4922</b> in image <b>5120</b>, and a location <b>5132</b> of tip <b>4922</b> in image <b>5130</b>. The processing device may also receive images from in between each of images <b>5100</b>, <b>5110</b>, <b>5120</b>, and <b>5130</b> in the series of events. Additionally, the processing device may receive data indicating the movement of tip <b>4922</b> based on images <b>5100</b>, <b>5110</b>, <b>5120</b>, and <b>5130</b>.</p><p id="p-0591" num="0590">Some disclosed embodiments may include determining from the image data when the locations of the tip correspond to locations on the object. In some examples, the locations of the tip may correspond to locations on the object when, while viewed from a particular distance and orientation, the tip of the physical marking implement may appear to hover directly over locations on the object or when the position of the tip of the physical marking implement overlaps or coincides with a position of a point on the object. For example, a virtual object may be presented in a field of view of a wearable extended virtual reality appliance, and the wearer may virtually color or mark-up the virtual object. A processor may detect the coincidence of the tip of the marking implement with a location on the virtual object. Similarly, in the case of a physical object, the processor may detect in a similar way a coincidence of the tip of the marking implement with the physical object. In some embodiments, determining from the image data when the locations of the tip correspond to locations on the object may include analyzing the image data using any of the method described above. By way of example, a processing device may determine from the image data when the locations of tip <b>4922</b> correspond to locations on object <b>4910</b>. For instance, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>51</b>A to <b>51</b>D</figref>, a processing device may determine from images <b>5100</b>, <b>5110</b>, <b>5120</b>, and <b>5130</b> that locations <b>5102</b>, <b>5112</b>, and <b>5122</b> of tip <b>4922</b> correspond to locations on object <b>4910</b>, whereas location <b>5132</b> of tip <b>4922</b> does not correspond to a location on object <b>4910</b>. In some examples, a distance of the determined locations of the tip from the locations on the object may be determined, for example by measuring the distance in the image data, by projecting a location of the tip on a 3D model of the object, and so forth. Further, when the distance is below a selected threshold, it may be determined that the location of the tip corresponds to the locations on the object, and when the distance is above the selected threshold, it may be determined that the location of the tip does not correspond to the locations on the object. In some examples, a machine learning model may be trained using training examples to determine when locations of tips of marking implements correspond to locations on objects. An example of such training example may include a sample image and/or a sample video frame of a sample marking implement and a sample object, together with a label indicating whether the location of the tip of the sample marking implement corresponds to locations of the sample object. The trained machine learning model may be used to analyze the image data and determine when the locations of the tip correspond to locations on the object.</p><p id="p-0592" num="0591">Some disclosed embodiments may include generating, in the detected color, virtual markings on the object at the corresponding locations. The virtual markings may be rendered on top of an object at one or more locations at which a user has performed a movement of a physical marking implement. In some embodiments generating the virtual markings in the detected color may include rendering the virtual markings in the color corresponding to the physical marking implement onto a virtual view of the object which may be observed by one or more users. By way of example, a processing device may generate, in the detected color, virtual markings on object <b>4910</b> at the corresponding locations. For instance, a processing device may generate, in red, the color associated with marking implement <b>4920</b>. Virtual marking <b>5134</b> on object <b>4910</b> may correspond to locations <b>5102</b>, <b>5112</b>, and <b>5122</b> of tip <b>4922</b> on object <b>4910</b>. In some examples, generating, in the detected color, virtual markings on the object at the corresponding locations may include adding the virtual markings to an extended reality environment or to a virtual object in the extended reality environment. In some examples, the virtual markings may be docked to the object in the extended reality environment, and may therefore move with the object when the object is moving.</p><p id="p-0593" num="0592">Some disclosed embodiments may include presenting to the individual holding the marking implement, the virtual markings via a wearable extended reality appliance. A wearable extended reality appliance may be a wearable device, such as a head-mounted device, for example, smart glasses, smart contact lens, headsets or any other device worn by a human for purposes of presenting an extended reality to the human, as described elsewhere in this disclosure. Presenting to the individual holding the marking implement, the virtual markings via a wearable extended reality appliance may refer to displaying the virtual markings through the wearable extended reality appliance such that the individual, who is looking at the object through the wearable extended reality appliance, may see the virtual markings. Thus, a user may virtually color or annotate a virtual or physical object in the user's field of view. Colorization of a physical object may involve image manipulation to present to the user a colorized overlay corresponding to the movements of the tip of the marking implement on the physical object. By way of example, visual marking <b>5134</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>51</b>A to <b>51</b>D</figref> may be presented to user <b>100</b> holding marking implement <b>4920</b> via wearable extended reality appliance <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>49</b></figref>. As another example, visual markings <b>5534</b> and <b>5536</b> may be displayed on extended reality display <b>5500</b> to user <b>100</b> holding marking implement <b>4920</b> via a wearable extended reality appliance such as wearable extended reality appliance <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0594" num="0593">Some disclosed embodiments may include presenting the virtual markings via a wearable extended reality appliance to a second individual located in proximity to the individual holding the marking implement. A second individual located in proximity may refer to two individuals being separated by a particular distance or a threshold distance. In one embodiment, the second individual is considered to be located in proximity to the individual holding the marking implement when their wearable extended reality appliances may communicate with each other. For example, an individual located in proximity to the individual holding the marking implement may be within 1 meter, 2 meters, 3 meters, 4 meters, 5 meters, 10 meters, 20 meters, 50 meters, or any other appropriate distance from the individual holding the marking implement. In other embodiments, the distances may be much greater, such that the individuals may be in two remote locations. Regardless, when wearable extended reality appliances are viewing the same space and one user marks-up a virtual or physical object, those markings detected by the image sensor of the virtual reality appliance associated with the individual doing the marking may be transmitted to the other individual, such that the same markings appear on the display of the other individual. By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>52</b></figref> illustrates individual <b>5200</b> and user <b>100</b> spaced apart by a distance <b>5240</b>. Second individual <b>5200</b> may be in proximity to user <b>100</b> because distance <b>5240</b> may be less than the threshold distance (e.g., 1 meter). As an example, virtual markings <b>5234</b> and <b>5236</b> may be presented to user <b>100</b> via wearable extended reality appliance <b>110</b> and to and individual <b>5200</b> via wearable extended reality appliances <b>5202</b>.</p><p id="p-0595" num="0594">Some embodiments may include receiving a second indication that the second individual performed an action for modifying a virtual representation of the object. An indication of an action may include any notification that an action took place or is taking place, the action being a manipulation of the marking implement. For example, notification may be a mirror display of the marking implement on displays of individuals who are part of a group viewing an object that is in the process of modification. Or some other indicator such as an icon or notice may appear on others' displays indicating that a revision by the marking element is either in progress or has occurred. For instance, a second individual may point to locations on the object to create new virtual markings or may wave their hands to erase existing virtual markings on the object. Those indications might be presented to others. Some embodiments may involve causing additional virtual markings on the object that corresponds to the action in response to the received second indication. The additional virtual markings may be modifications to the virtual representation of the object that may affect only the virtual representation of the second individual, or may affect the virtual representations of some or all the individuals viewing the object. By way of example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>52</b></figref>, a virtual marking <b>5234</b> may be presented via wearable extended reality appliance <b>5202</b> to a second individual <b>5200</b> located in proximity to user <b>100</b> holding marking implement <b>4920</b>. In some embodiments, second individual <b>5200</b> may perform an action for modifying the visual representation of object <b>4910</b> and send a second indication to rem a processing device via a network. In response to the second indication, the processing device may cause additional virtual markings to appear on object <b>4910</b> corresponding to the performed action. Additionally or alternatively, the action may cause the processing device to erase existing virtual markings such as virtual marking <b>5234</b> from the visual representation of object <b>4910</b>.</p><p id="p-0596" num="0595">Some disclosed embodiments may include presenting the virtual markings together with a virtual presentation of the object via wearable extended reality appliances to a plurality of individuals located remotely from the individual holding the marking implement. A plurality of individuals located remotely from the individual holding the marking implement may refer to two or more individuals being physically separated from the individual, for example, in different rooms, buildings, cities, countries, or in the same room but separated by a physical partition. For instance, a plurality of individuals may be presented the virtual markings and the virtual presentation of the object while being in a different location from the object and the individual holding the physical marking implement. As an example, the individual holding the physical marking implement and the plurality of individuals may be separated by a distance of 5 meters, 10 meters, 100 meters, 1 kilometer, 10 kilometers, 100 kilometers, 1000 kilometers, or any other distance which would mean the individual holding the marking implement and the plurality of individuals are physically separated. The plurality of individuals may each view the virtual markings and the virtual presentation of the object via a wearable extended reality appliance, or via a screen which the plurality of individuals may view together. As an example, a university professor may generate virtual markings on an object from an office or classroom, and students in their homes may be presented with the virtual markings together with a virtual presentation of the object. In one example, the object may be a virtual object, and the virtual presentation of the object may be based on a model of the virtual object. In another example, the object may be a physical object, and the virtual presentation of the object may be based on images of the object captured using the image sensor.</p><p id="p-0597" num="0596">Some disclosed embodiments may include receiving a second indication that at least one of the plurality of individuals performed an action for modifying the virtual representation of the object. In some embodiments, one or more individuals of the plurality of individuals discussed above may use their own marking implements to make changes to the object or may otherwise take an action signaling that the virtual representation of the object is to be modified. For instance, the one or more individuals may wave their hands to erase existing virtual markings on the object or may use their own marking implements to augment, modify, or erase the markings already added to the object. Additionally or alternatively, the one or more individuals may perform gestures or use their own marking implements to create new virtual markings on the object. In one example, receiving the second indication may include at least one of reading the second indication from memory, receiving the second indication from an external device (for example, from an external device associated with the at least one of the plurality of individuals, from an external device controlling the extended reality environment, etc.), determining the second indication by analyzing sensor data (such as image data captured using an image sensor, gesture data captured using haptic glove, etc.), and so forth. Some embodiments may involve, causing removal of at least part of the virtual markings on the object in response to the received second indication. For example, the modifications to the virtual representation of the object may affect only the virtual representation associated with the individual performing the action, or may affect the virtual representations of a part or all of the individuals viewing the object, including the individual holding the physical marking implement.</p><p id="p-0598" num="0597">By way of example, virtual marking <b>5134</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>53</b></figref> may be presented via wearable extended reality appliance <b>5310</b> to a plurality of individuals <b>5300</b> located remotely from user <b>100</b> holding marking implement <b>4920</b>. For instance, user <b>100</b> may be located in a room <b>5320</b> while plurality of individuals <b>5300</b> may be located in a different room <b>5330</b>, which may be anywhere in the world where communications network <b>214</b> may still reach wearable extended reality appliances <b>5310</b>. As an example, an individual <b>5302</b> from among individuals <b>5300</b> may perform an action for modifying the virtual representation of object <b>4910</b>, and a second indication may be sent to a processing device via a network. In response to the second indication, the processing device may cause the removal of at least part of virtual marking <b>5134</b> on object <b>4910</b>. In some embodiments, the modifications to the virtual representation of object <b>4910</b> may affect only the virtual representation associated with individual <b>5302</b>, may affect the visual representation associated with some or all individuals <b>5300</b>, may affect the visual representation associated with user <b>100</b>, or may affect the visual representation associated with user <b>100</b> and the visual representation associated with some or all individuals <b>5300</b>.</p><p id="p-0599" num="0598">Some disclosed embodiments may include presenting the virtual markings via a wearable extended reality appliance to a second individual while the second individual is located in an environment of a physical object and the individual holding the marking implement is no longer in the environment of the object. In one example, an environment of the object may refer to a space in which the object may reside (e.g., a room, a building, an exterior, or any other area where the object may be located). In another example, an environment of the object may refer to all positions with a line-of-sight to at least part of the object. For instance, a view of the object may be partially obscured by a wall for an individual present in a different room than the room in which the may be located. However, the individual may still be considered to be in the environment of the object because they have a line-of-sight to at least part of the object. In some embodiments, a first individual holding a physical marking implement may make virtual markings on an object and then leave the environment of the object. Upon leaving the environment of the object, the first individual may no longer be in the same space as the object and/or may not have a line-of-sight to any portion of the object. A second individual may enter the environment of the object and may still view the virtual markings that were made by the first individual previously. By way of example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b></figref>, an object may be a physical object, such as a table <b>5410</b>. In this example, user <b>100</b> may make a virtual marking <b>5412</b> on table <b>5410</b> using marking implement <b>4920</b> and may leave room <b>5430</b> to go to room <b>5420</b>, which is outside of the environment of table <b>5410</b>. Then, a second individual <b>5400</b> may enter room <b>5430</b> (and thus the environment of table <b>5410</b>) and may view virtual marking <b>5412</b> on table <b>5410</b> via wearable extended reality appliance <b>5440</b>.</p><p id="p-0600" num="0599">Some disclosed embodiments may include determining from the image data an intent of the individual to delete at least some of the virtual markings and removing the at least some of the virtual markings from the object. An intent to delete at least some of the virtual markings may be determined by analyzing received image data to determine that an individual is performing a gesture or the use of a marking implement associated with removing virtual markings. For instance, an individual may gesture in a certain way signaling a removal of markings (e.g. by virtually touching the markings to be deleted and either before or after pressing a physical or virtual button signaling deletion) or by use an opposite end of the marking implement as a virtual eraser. Image data may be analyzed to determine which end of the marking implement is in use&#x2014;the tip or the eraser, and the functionality associated with the end in use may thereby be implemented. These are just a few examples. Other actions or combinations of actions may be recognized by at least one processor analyzing image data to cause deletions. By way of example, a processing device may determine from image <b>5130</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>51</b>D</figref> an intent of user <b>100</b> to delete at least some of virtual marking <b>5134</b>. The processing device may determine such intent when, for example, user <b>100</b> performs a predetermined action or utilizes an opposing end <b>5138</b> of marking implement <b>4920</b> to indicate portions of virtual marking <b>5134</b> that user <b>100</b> wishes to erase. The processing device may then remove the indicated portions and render only the remaining portions of virtual marking <b>5134</b>.</p><p id="p-0601" num="0600">Some disclosed embodiments may include determining from the image data an intent of the individual to change the color of the virtual markings, presenting a virtual color palette via a wearable extended reality appliance to the individual holding the marking implement, determining a selection of a substitute color from the virtual color palette, and generating additional virtual markings on the object in the selected substitute color. Color changes may occur in a manner similar to deletions discussed above, through the use of a differing color marking implement detected in image data. Or, a virtual color palette may be provided, and an individual may gesture (e.g., point) to a new color which in response may change a color of a marking implement. Similarly, pointing toward a virtual eraser may change the function of the marking implement from a marker to an eraser. An individual may indicate an intent to change the color of the virtual markings by performing a gesture with a hand or with the physical marking implement. A gesture may include a conscious or unconscious movement of a hand of an individual which may be detected by a wearable extended reality appliance. For example, a gesture may include pointing, rotating, swiping, grabbing, tapping, or otherwise moving a hand or a finger with the intent to perform an action on a particular part of an extended reality display, an object, or the space visible through the wearable extended reality appliance. A virtual color palette may refer to a user interface enabling a selection of a variety of colors. The virtual color palette may be presented to the individual virtually via the wearable extended reality appliance. The virtual color palette may be virtually presented as a bounded area with smaller areas each representing a different range or shade of color. The virtual color palette may be presented to an individual as an overlay on top of objects visible through the wearable extended reality appliance or displayed via an extended reality display presented to the individual. The individual may perform a gesture with a body part or with the physical marking implement to indicate selection of a substitute color from the virtual color palette. For instance, a specific gesture such as swiping, tapping, double tapping, selecting, pointing, or other appropriate gesture may be recognized as a selection of a substitute color. Once the substitute color has been selected, any further virtual markings made on the object by the individual will be in the selected substitute color until the individual selects a new color. In some embodiments, the individual may select to have a part of or all of the existing virtual markings change color to a substitute color. By way of example, a processing device may determine from image data an intent of user <b>100</b> to change the color of the virtual markings. The processing device may then present a virtual color palette <b>5510</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b></figref> via wearable extended reality appliance <b>110</b> to user <b>100</b> holding marking implement <b>4920</b>. Then, the processing device may determine a selection of a substitute color from virtual color palette <b>5510</b> when, for instance, user <b>100</b> may point to a substitute color. The processing device may generate additional virtual markings on object <b>5520</b> in the selected substitute color. In some embodiments, user <b>100</b> may perform an action (e.g., a movement of the marking implement or an appropriate gesture made by the second individual to signal that a virtual representation of the object is to be modified, as discussed above) such that existing virtual marking <b>5534</b> may change color to the substitute color.</p><p id="p-0602" num="0601">Some disclosed embodiments may include detecting a type of the marking implement, accessing a repository of types of marking implements and corresponding mark characteristics associated therewith, and generating the virtual markings with a specific mark characteristic corresponding to the detected type of the marking implement. The type of the marking implement may be detected by analyzing the image data (i.e., data which may be used to represent graphic or pictorial data, as discussed above) by any of the methods described herein. For example, a data structure may hold characteristics of differing marking implements (e.g., pen, pencil, crayon, paint brush, magic marker, etc.) Image data may be compared with the characteristics stored in the data structure to identify the marking implement type (and, perhaps also an associated color.) When a match is determined, the marking characteristics associated with that marking implement may be retrieved from the data structure and applied. Thus, the visible characteristics of a virtual line (e.g., quality, consistency, shape) drawn by a pencil may differ in appearance from the characteristics of a line drawn by a paint brush, pen, crayon or magic marker. As another example, the type of the marking implement may be input by a user. A repository of types of marking implements and corresponding mark characteristics associated therewith may refer to a data store which may store information on different types of marking implements and their corresponding characteristics. In some embodiments, the types of marking implements may be associated with different widths of the virtual markings on the object. For example, a width of a pen stroke may be narrower than a width of a brush stroke. As other examples, the types of marking implements may be associated with different fonts, font styles, sizes, underline styles, and any other effects which may affect the appearance of a virtual marking. Some embodiments may include displaying a virtual representation of the detected type of the marking implement in virtual reality. For instance, an individual may be able to confirm that the detected type of the marking implement is indeed the marking implement they are holding. Generating the virtual markings with a specific mark characteristic corresponding to the detected type of the marking implement may include creating to be presented or otherwise displayed to an individual the virtual markings having properties associated with the marking implement used to create the virtual markings. For instance, a virtual marking created with a marking implement having a predetermined line width and color associated with it may be generated to have the predetermined line width and color. By way of example, three types of marking implements <b>5222</b>, <b>5224</b>, and <b>5226</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>52</b></figref>. In some embodiments, marking implements <b>5222</b>, <b>5224</b>, and <b>5226</b> may generate virtual markings having different widths, fonts, font styles, sizes, underline styles, and any other effects which may affect the appearance of a virtual marking. For example, a processing device may detect marking implement <b>5222</b> from image <b>5200</b> by analyzing image <b>5200</b> by any of the methods discussed herein. In this example, the processing device may access a repository of types of marking implements and corresponding mark characteristics associated therewith to determine that the width of the virtual marks generated by marking implement <b>5222</b> are &#x201c;thin.&#x201d; Accordingly, the processing device may generate the virtual markings with the specific mark characteristic (e.g., &#x201c;thin&#x201d;) and/or color corresponding to marking implement <b>5222</b>. In some embodiments, wearable extended reality appliance <b>110</b> may display a virtual representation <b>5530</b> of the detected type of the marking implement in virtual reality to user <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0603" num="0602">Some disclosed embodiments may include interpreting three-dimensional movements of the marking implement as two-dimensional inputs. While a user may move a marking implement in three-dimensional space, the out may be presented in two dimensions. In such an instance, the processor converts the three-dimensional detected movements of the marking implement into two-dimensional representations. In some embodiments, the two-dimensional virtual object may include a document, and the three-dimensional movements of the marking implement may be interpreted as handwriting virtual markings on the document in the detected color. By way of example, a processing device may interpret three-dimensional movements of marking implement <b>4920</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b></figref> as two-dimensional inputs to generate virtual marking <b>5534</b> including handwriting on object <b>5520</b>.</p><p id="p-0604" num="0603">Some disclosed embodiments may include interpreting three-dimensional movements of the marking implement as three-dimensional inputs. If a user is marking on a three-dimensional object, the processor may interpret the three-dimensional coordinates of the markings and translate them onto the corresponding three-dimensional representation of the object. For example, the three-dimensional virtual object may include a virtual representation of a physical object, and the virtual markings may include markings in the detected color on two traversed surfaces of the virtual representation of the physical object. The three-dimensional movements of the marking implement may be interpreted as three-dimensional inputs by interpreting the motion of the marking implement in a space with more than two coordinate axes. For instance, the two traversed surfaces of the virtual representation of the physical object may be on two planes which are at different angles to each other. That is, a three-dimensional virtual object may have numerous surfaces, some of which may be on different planes. A traversed surface may be one with which the tip of the marking implement overlaps. By way of example, object <b>4910</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>51</b>A to <b>51</b>D</figref> may be a three-dimensional object and a processing device may interpret three-dimensional movements of marking implement <b>4920</b> as three-dimensional inputs to generate virtual markings <b>5134</b> and <b>5136</b>, which may be on two different surfaces of the virtual representation of object <b>4910</b>.</p><p id="p-0605" num="0604">Some disclosed embodiments may include determining from the image data that the individual replaced the physical marking implement with a second physical marking implement associated with a second color, detecting in the image data the second color associated with the second marking implement, and generating additional virtual markings on the object in the second color. For instance, to change to a second color, an individual may simply switch to a second physical marking implement, which may be determined by analyzing the image data via any of the methods described herein. The color of second physical marking implement may be automatically detected such that the individual may not need to perform any additional actions. In one embodiment, a second physical marking implement may be associated with a second color via data stored in a repository which may be accessed once a specific physical marking implement is detected to determine which is the specific color associated with the specific physical marking implement. In some embodiments, the additional virtual markings in the second color may overlay the previous virtual markings associated with a first color. By way of example, instead of selecting a new color as discussed with respect to virtual color palette <b>5510</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b></figref>, user <b>100</b> may simply switch to a second physical marking implement <b>5222</b>, <b>5224</b>, or <b>5226</b> as shown in image <b>5200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>52</b></figref>. A processing device may detect the second color associated with second physical marking implement <b>5226</b> and generate additional virtual marking <b>5236</b> on object <b>5210</b> in the second color. In some embodiments, additional virtual marking <b>5236</b> in the second color may overlay virtual marking <b>5234</b> associated with the first color.</p><p id="p-0606" num="0605">Some disclosed embodiments may include determining from the image data that the individual holds a second physical marking implement associated with a second color in addition to the physical marking implement, detecting in the image data the second color associated with the second marking implement, determining from the image data locations of a tip of the second marking implement, and generating additional virtual markings on the object in the second color based on the determined locations of the tip of the second marking implement. In some embodiments, any number of additional physical marking implements may be held by an individual and detected by analyzing the image data via any of the methods described herein such that the virtual markings made by each physical marking implement retain the characteristics of the physical marking implement which performed the action to make the virtual marking. By way of example, a processing device may determine that user <b>100</b> may hold an additional physical marking implement <b>5222</b>, <b>5224</b>, and/or <b>5226</b> associated with an additional color in addition to physical marking implement <b>5220</b>, may detect the additional color associated with additional physical marking implement <b>5222</b>, <b>5224</b>, and/or <b>5226</b>, may determine locations of a tip of additional marking implement <b>5222</b>, <b>5224</b>, and/or <b>5226</b>, and may generate additional virtual markings on object <b>5210</b> in the additional color based on the determined locations of the tip of additional marking implement <b>5222</b>, <b>5224</b>, and/or <b>5226</b>.</p><p id="p-0607" num="0606">In some examples, contextual environmental data corresponding to a selected time period may be determined. For example, images and/or videos (such as the image data) may be analyzed using a person detection algorithm to determine the presence of one or more additional people (e.g., beside the individual holding the physical marking implement) at the selected time period, may be analyzed using a face recognition algorithm to determine the identity of the one or more additional people, may be analyzed using a visual action recognition algorithm to determine one or more actions performed by the one or more additional people at the selected time period, may be analyzed using a visual event detection algorithm to detect one or more events occurring at the selected time period, may be analyzed using a scene recognition algorithm to determine a type of the physical environment (such as outdoor, indoor, office, meeting room, home, etc.), and so forth. In one example, the contextual environmental data corresponding to the selected time period may include at least one of the one or more additional people, the identity of the one or more additional people, the one or more actions, the one or more events, or the type of the physical environment. In another example, audio captured from the environment of the individual holding the physical marking implement may be analyzed using speech recognition algorithm to determine a topic of a conversation taking place at the selected time period, may be analyzed using speaker diarization algorithm to identify contributors to the conversation at the selected time period, and so forth. In one example, the contextual environmental data corresponding to the selected time period may include at least one of the determined topic of the conversation or the identified contributors. Some disclosed embodiments may involve introducing changes or differentiators to different portions of the virtual markings that are associated with different time periods and/or different contextual environmental data. For example, portions of the virtual marking associated with different time periods corresponding to the creation of the portion of the virtual marking may have differing appearance (e.g., shading). In some examples, a data-structure may associate different portions of the virtual markings with determined contextual environmental data corresponding to the time period associated with the portions of the virtual markings. In one example, a user may provide (for example, via a user interface) an input indicative of a specific contextual environmental data or of a group of different contextual environmental data instances. In other examples, such input may be received from an external device, from a memory unit, from an automated process, and so forth. The data-structure may be searched based on the input to identify the portions of the virtual markings corresponding to the specific contextual environmental data or to the group of different contextual environmental data instances. The identified portions of the virtual markings may be provided, for example to the user that provided the input, to a different user, to an external device, to a memory unit, for presentation in an extended reality environment, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0608" num="0607"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>56</b></figref> provides a flowchart of an example method <b>5600</b> for making virtual colored markings on objects executed by a processing device of system <b>200</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

The coordinate system may be created by displaying a code on a mobile device. When the extended reality appliances scan the code, the wearable extended reality appliances share a common reference point and may use that reference point to generate a shared common coordinate system. Additionally, when the mobile device moves, the displayed code may be changed accordingly.</p><p id="p-0611" num="0610">Some disclosed embodiments may involve enabling wearable extended reality appliances to share virtual content. Sharing virtual content may refer to the distribution of text, photos, videos, links, or any other information across different displays of wearable extended reality appliances. For example, a wearable extended reality appliance may display virtual content in an extended reality environment. A second wearable extended reality appliance may not display any virtual content. The first wearable extended reality appliance may share its display of virtual content with the second wearable extended reality appliance in order for the second wearable extended reality appliance to display the same content as the first wearable extended reality appliance. In some examples, sharing virtual content may include the presentation of the same virtual content by a plurality of wearable extended reality appliances, for example in a same or similar position and orientation in an extended reality environment.</p><p id="p-0612" num="0611">Some disclosed embodiments may involve generating a visual code reflecting a first physical position of a mobile device, the visual code being configured to be read by a plurality of wearable extended reality appliances. The term &#x201c;visual code&#x201d; may include, for example, a machine-readable code consisting of an array of black and white squares, typically used for storing the address of a webpage or other information. Additionally or alternatively, the visual code may include one or more of numbers, letters, shapes, images, colors, or any other identifier that may be detected by an image sensor. For example, the visual code may be a QR code, Data Matrix code, bar code, alphanumeric code, or any other type of code. The visual code may be read by a plurality of wearable extended reality appliances using a device for recording visual images that may be incorporated within or attached to the wearable extended reality appliances. The device for recording visual images may be a camera, scanner, recorder, or any other type of recording device. The visual code may be displayed on a mobile device, such as a cell phone, tablet, dedicated hardware, or any other physical device capable of code display. In some examples, the information contained in the visual code may represent a physical position of a mobile device in a physical space. A physical position may be the place where an item is located. In some examples, the information contained in the visual code may represent a physical position of a presentation of the visual code in a physical space. For example, for a first presentation of the visual code at a first position on a display screen of the mobile device and a second presentation of the visual code at a second position (different from the first position) on the display screen of the mobile device while the mobile device is at the same position and orientation in the physical space, the first presentation and the second presentation may have different physical positions in the physical space, and the visual code may include different information to represent that. In another example, different positions of the presentation of the visual code on the display screen may compensate for different positions and/or orientations of the mobile device, so that the physical position of the presentation of the visual code is the same, and the visual code may include the same information in the different presentations to represent that. In some examples, the information contained in the visual code may represent a physical orientation of a mobile device in a physical space. A physical orientation may be the direction of an item in a physical space. In some examples, the information contained in the visual code may represent a physical orientation of a presentation of the visual code in a physical space. For example, for a first presentation of the visual code at a first orientation on a display screen of the mobile device and a second presentation of the visual code at a second orientation (different from the first orientation) on the display screen of the mobile device while the mobile device is at the same position and orientation in the physical space, the first presentation and the second presentation may have different physical orientations in the physical space, and the visual code may include different information to represent that. In another example, different orientations of the presentation of the visual code on the display screen may compensate for different positions and/or orientations of the mobile device, so that the physical orientation of the presentation of the visual code is the same, and the visual code may include the same information in the different presentations to represent that. A mobile device may be located in many different environments. For example, a mobile device may be located in an office environment, home environment, public space, or any other location. In one exemplary use case, a mobile phone (for example on a conference table) may display the visual code, and a group of individuals, each wearing an extended reality device, may capture an image of the visual code, providing a common reference point for the group.</p><p id="p-0613" num="0612">In some embodiments, the mobile device may be a smartphone paired with one of the plurality of wearable extended reality appliances. Pairing may involve creating a link between computing devices to allow communications between the devices. Paired devices may be able to transmit information between each other. For example, a smartphone may be paired with one of the plurality of wearable extended reality appliances so that information may be shared between the smartphone and the wearable extended reality appliance. In some embodiments, the mobile device may be paired with one of the plurality of wearable extended reality appliances. A wearable extended reality appliance may include smart glasses, head-mounted displays, head-up displays, virtual reality (VR) headset, or any other type of appliance.</p><p id="p-0614" num="0613">Prior to generating the visual code, some of the disclosed embodiments may involve determining the first physical position of the mobile device based on data received from at least one location sensor within the mobile device. A location sensor may detect a physical position that may include absolute position (i.e. location) or relative position (i.e. displacement from a position). For example, a location sensor may use GPS technology, outdoor positioning system or an indoor positioning system to determine absolute or relative location. As another example, a location sensor may provide coordinate locations relative to a predetermined reference frame. As another example, the location sensor may provide angular positions of relative to a predetermined reference frame. Additionally, one or more hubs of a wireless network such as a WiFi network may be used to determine location. A mobile device may contain a location sensor configured for use in determining a physical position of the mobile device.</p><p id="p-0615" num="0614">Some disclosed embodiments may involve presenting the visual code on a display of the mobile device for detection by the plurality of wearable extended reality appliances, to thereby enable the plurality of wearable extended reality appliances to share content in a common coordinate system upon the detection of the visual code. Detection of a visual code by a wearable extended reality appliance may include an appliance configured to identify the presence of a visual code. For example, as stated above, the wearable extended reality appliance may contain a recording, scanning, or imaging device. The recording, scanning, or imaging device may identify and scan the visual code. For example, the visual code may include a QR code, and image data captured using an image sensor included in a wearable extended reality appliance may be analyzed using a QR code detection algorithm to detect the visual code. In another example, the visual code may include a selected visual pattern, and the image data captured using an image sensor included in a wearable extended reality appliance may be analyzed using a visual pattern recognition algorithm (such as a template matching algorithm) to detect the visual code. Detecting the visual code may enable a plurality of wearable extended reality appliances to share content in a common coordinate system after the detection of the visual code. The term &#x201c;coordinate system&#x201d; refers to a common reference frame. A coordinate system may include, for example, an arrangement of reference lines or curves used to identify the locations of points in space. For example, in two dimensions, an x-y plane (that is, a Cartesian coordinates system with a specific origin point and specific directions for the axes) may be used to identify locations of points in space. As another example, in two dimensions, a polar coordinates system with a particular origin point and a specific reference direction may be used to identify locations of points in space. As another example, in three dimensions, an x-y-z plane (that is, a Cartesian coordinates system with a specific origin point and specific directions for the axes) or a spherical coordinates system with a specific origin point, a specific zenith direction and a specific reference plane may be used to identify locations of points in space. A physical space may contain an infinite number of coordinate systems. Prior to detecting the visual code, each wearable extended reality appliance may have its own coordinate system. After detecting the visual code, the plurality of wearable extended reality appliances may share a common coordinate system (which may replace their previous coordinate systems or may be used in addition to their previous coordinate systems). In one example, a common coordinate system may mean that each coordinate system of each extended reality appliance may be aligned and may have the same arrangements of reference lines or curves. In another example, a common coordinate system may enable different wearable extended reality appliances to present virtual content at the same physical location and/or physical orientation. Aligning coordinate systems may include ensuring that origins of the coordinate systems coincide and that the one or more coordinate axes associated with each coordinate system overlaps with or coincides with one or more coordinate axes of another coordinate system, or that other elements that define the coordinate systems coincide. In one example, aligning coordinate systems may include determining one or more transformation functions from one coordinate system to other coordinate systems and vice versa. By way of another example, the visual code, which may be generated and displayed by the mobile device, may define a common reference for a plurality of extended reality appliance wearers. Once they share the common reference, details of the shared coordinate system may be a matter of design choice.</p><p id="p-0616" num="0615">The coordinate system may be imperceptible to appliance wearers. For example, they may not see any particular visualization of the coordinate system, aside from the fact that the perspective view of each appliance wearer may differ based on their orientations relative to the common reference point. In other embodiments where the coordinate system is perceptible, each wearable extended reality appliance may display the same arrangement of lines with a common reference point. A common reference point may be a point in space with respect to which the position of an object in space is expressed. For example, a mobile device may represent the point in space where the x and y axis cross each other. As another example, a mobile device may represent the point in space where the x, y, and z axis cross each other. A common coordinate system may be created when each wearable extended reality appliances' coordinate system shares a common reference point. For example, each wearable extended reality appliance may read the visual code, determine the physical location of the mobile device based on the location information stored in the visual code, and make the physical location of the mobile device the origin of each wearable extended reality appliances' coordinate system, creating a common coordinate system. Content may be shared in the common coordinate system in the same manner as described above.</p><p id="p-0617" num="0616">In some embodiments, users of the plurality of wearable extended reality appliances may view a virtual object at a single location in a physical space. For example, prior to a common coordinate system, a wearable extended reality appliance may display a virtual object in its own coordinate system. And a second wearable extended reality appliance may display the same virtual object in its own different coordinate system, with the two coordinate systems unaligned. The virtual objects may appear in different locations in the two different coordinate systems. After scanning the visual code and forming a common coordinate system, the plurality of wearable extended reality appliances may display the virtual object in the same position in the common coordinate system.</p><p id="p-0618" num="0617">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>57</b></figref> illustrates an example of a plurality of wearable extended reality appliances with their own coordinate systems not aligned.

The term &#x201c;trigger&#x201d; may mean an action that causes an event or situation to happen. For example, a visual code may only be presented based on an identification of an action. In one embodiment, the trigger may be associated with an input received from a wearable extended reality appliance paired with the mobile device. An input may include data that may be created based on an event. The input may cause a trigger for a visual code to be presented on the mobile device. For example, a mobile device and a wearable extended reality appliance may pair and create an input that may cause a visual code to appear on the mobile device. In one example, the wearable extended reality appliance may include an image sensor, image data captured using the image sensor may be analyzed using gesture recognition algorithm, and identifying the trigger may include detection of a particular gesture of a user of the wearable extended reality appliance in the image data. In another example, the wearable extended reality appliance may include an audio sensor, audio data captured using the audio sensor may be analyzed using speech recognition algorithm, and identifying the trigger may include detection of a particular voice command in the audio data. In yet another example, the wearable extended reality appliance may identify a proximity of another wearable extended reality appliance, and identifying the trigger may be based on the identification of the proximity of the other wearable extended reality appliance. In another embodiment, the trigger may be associated with an input from at least one sensor within the mobile device, the input being indicative of an additional wearable extended reality appliance approaching the mobile device. A sensor may be a device that detects and responds to some type of input. Examples of sensors may include position sensors, pressure sensors, temperature sensors, force sensors, or any other type of sensor. A sensor may detect that an additional wearable extended reality appliance is near the mobile device. The sensor may create an input that may generate a trigger for a visual code to be presented on the mobile device. For example, a wearable extended reality appliance may appear in the same room as a mobile device. The mobile device may detect the wearable extended reality appliance via a sensor. The detection may create an input that may cause a visual code to appear on the mobile device. In another embodiment, an input may be received from a user of the mobile device. For example, a user of a mobile device may manually prompt a sensor on the mobile device in order to cause a presentation of the visual code. The user may manually prompt a sensor by pushing a button, selecting an application, downloading a link, or any other manual means.</p><p id="p-0621" num="0620">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>59</b></figref> illustrates an example of an additional wearable extended reality appliance joining a plurality of wearable extended reality appliances, where the additional appliance has a coordinate system not aligned with the common coordinate system.

A private extended reality environment may be an environment that may be accessible to a particular user or users and that may be inaccessible to other users. To gain access to a private extended reality environment, the one or more other users may need a password, permission, pin code, or another type of authentication information. For example, to gain access to a private extended reality environment, a wearable extended reality appliance may need to read a specific visual code. Reading the visual code may cause the wearable extended reality appliance to access the private extended reality environment.</p><p id="p-0624" num="0623">Some disclosed embodiments may involve preventing access to the private extended reality environment following passage of a temporal limit. A temporal limit may be a limit that is based on a length of time. A temporal limit may be measured in seconds, minutes, hours, days, and/or any other length of time. An extended reality environment may only be accessible for a specific and/or limited amount of time, or a specific period of time. For example, a wearable extended reality appliance may detect and read a visual code that may provide access to a private extended reality environment. The private extended reality environment may be configured to deny access after a predetermined amount of time (e.g., 10 minutes, 15 minutes, or any other predetermined time period). After expiry of the predetermined amount of time, the wearable extended reality appliance may no longer be able to display the extended reality environment. In some examples, reading the visual code in the specific period of time may provide the wearable extended reality appliance access to the private extended reality environment, while reading the same visual code after the specific period of time has passed may not provide the wearable extended reality appliance access to the private extended reality environment. In one example, the provided access may be limited to the specific period of time, while in another example, once the access was provided in the specific period of time, the access may be preserved for at least a selected amount of time after the specific period of time has passed. In one example, the visual code may be valid for granting access to the private extended reality environment for a specific period of time, which may prevent abuse of the visual code (for example, the usage of a picture of the visual code after the presentation of the visual code by the mobile device stopped).</p><p id="p-0625" num="0624">Some disclosed embodiments may involve preventing access to the private extended reality environment when the visual code is detected beyond a spatial limit. A spatial limit may be a limit that is based on an event existing or happening in a certain space. An extended reality environment may only be accessible when a wearable extended reality appliance detects a visual code within a certain defined space. For example, the spatial limit may require that the visual code must be detected in a certain room in an office. In another example, the spatial limit may require that the visual code must be detected within a certain distance of another wearable extended reality appliance. As another example, the spatial limit may be that the code must be detected in a certain room in a user's home. Access to the private extended reality environment may be denied if the visual code is not detected within the limit. For example, a wearable extended reality appliance may detect a code while in an office setting, and the wearable extended reality appliance may be provided access to the private extended reality environment. In another example, a wearable extended reality appliance may detect a code in a public setting (e.g., outside the office, in a park, in a public place), and the wearable extended reality appliance may be denied access to the private extended reality environment. In some examples, the spatial limit may require that the visual code must be detected within a certain distance of the mobile device presenting it, or in a specific space in which the mobile device presenting the visual code is located. This may prevent abuse of the visual code (for example, the usage of a picture of the visual code sent to a remote location away of the mobile device).</p><p id="p-0626" num="0625">Some disclosed embodiments may involve generating a first visual code configured to grant access to a first private extended reality environment, and generating a second visual code configured to grant access to a second private extended reality environment. A wearable extended reality appliance may be granted access to multiple different private extended reality environments from a single location. Each different private extended reality environment may be associated with its own visual code. For example, a wearable extended reality appliance may detect a first visual code associated with a first private extended reality environment, and the appliance may be granted access to the first private environment. The wearable extended reality appliance may wish to join a different private environment. A second visual code associated with a second private extended reality environment may be generated. The wearable extended reality appliance may detect the second visual code and be granted access to the second private environment.</p><p id="p-0627" num="0626">Some disclosed embodiments may involve detecting movement of the mobile device to a second physical position different from the first physical position. Detecting movement may include detecting a change in the position of an object relative to its surroundings. Movement may be detected by monitoring changes in sound waves, infrared light, visible light, radio frequency energy, or any other changes associated with a change in location.</p><p id="p-0628" num="0627">In some embodiments, the detected movement may include a change in an orientation of the mobile device without a change in a location of the mobile device, the altering of the presentation may include changing an orientation of the presented visual code to compensate for the change in the orientation of the mobile device. The term &#x201c;orientation&#x201d; may include the determination of the relative direction of something. A change in orientation may include a change in the relative direction of something. For example, a mobile device may be presented in a specific direction relative to another direction in a common coordinate system or another object. A mobile device may change relative directions without changing locations in a common coordinate system. For example, a top portion of a mobile device may be facing north in a common coordinate system that may be using cardinal directions. The mobile device may be turned upside down so the top portion of the mobile device may be facing south in the common coordinate system. As another example, the mobile device may be turned left so the top portion of the mobile device may be facing west in the common coordinate system. As another example, the mobile device may be turned right so the top portion of the mobile device may be facing east in the common coordinate system. A visual code that may be presented on a mobile device may also change orientations with the mobile device. For example, a mobile device may be turned upside down so the top portion of the mobile device may be facing south in a common coordinate system. A visual code may also be rotated 180 degrees so the top portion of the visual code may be facing south in the common coordinate system.</p><p id="p-0629" num="0628">In some embodiments, the detected movement may include a change in a location of the mobile device without a change in an orientation of the mobile device. When the change in the location of the mobile device is smaller than a selected threshold, the altering of the presentation may include changing a location of the presented visual code on the display of the mobile device to compensate for the change in the location of the mobile device. A selected threshold may be an amount that must be exceeded for a certain reaction, result, or condition to occur. A threshold may be based on distance, location, position, or any other measurement. In one examples, a threshold may be pre-determined or selected by a user. In one example, the threshold may be selected based on a display size of the mobile device, based on a current location of the visual code on the display screen of the mobile device, and so forth. A threshold may be selected and when a change in location of a mobile device is smaller than the threshold, the display of the visual code on the mobile device may also be changed. In some embodiments, the display may be moved by a distance proportional to the change in location of the mobile device. For example, a threshold may be set to 5 feet. A change in a location of the mobile device may be 4 feet. The change may be smaller than the threshold and therefore a presentation of the visual code may also be moved 4 feet from the first physical position. In another embodiment, a threshold may be set to a specific location. For example, a threshold may be set to only the location of an office conference room. A first physical location of a mobile device may be in the office conference room and a second physical location of the mobile device may also be in the office conference room. The difference between the first and second physical location is below the threshold and therefore a presentation of the visual code may also be moved on the display of the mobile device to compensate for the change in the location of the mobile device. For example, the movement of the visual code on the display of the mobile device may cancel with the movement of the mobile device so that the position of the visual code in the physical environment stays the same. In this example, the threshold may be selected so that the display screen of the mobile device is large enough for relocating the visual code in a way that cancels the movement of the mobile device. In another example, each deviation of the visual code from a selected position on the display screen may encode a non-linear correction to the movement of the mobile device.</p><p id="p-0630" num="0629">In some embodiments, the detected movement may include a change in a location of the mobile device and a change in an orientation of the mobile device. When the change in the location of the mobile device is smaller than a selected threshold, the altering of the presentation may include changing a location of the presented visual code on the display of the mobile device to compensate for the change in the location of the mobile device and changing an orientation of the presented visual code to compensate for the change in the orientation of the mobile device. A change in orientation may occur as described above. Additionally, a selected threshold may be determined as described above. For example, a threshold may be set to 5 feet. By way of an example, a change in location of the mobile device between the first physical position and the second physical position may be 4 feet and a mobile device may be rotated by four degrees. The change may be smaller than the threshold and therefore a presentation of the visual code may also be moved 4 feet from the first physical position and rotated by four degrees.</p><p id="p-0631" num="0630">Some disclosed embodiments may involve, upon detecting movement of the mobile device, altering the presentation of the visual code so that the visual code is unavailable for use in content sharing. Altering the presentation of the visual code may include changing a visual property of the code. For example, the visual code may disappear, may be distorted, or may be changed in any way that makes it unreadable or invalid. For example, the visual code may disappear so a camera on a wearable extended reality appliance may no longer be able to read the visual code. Likewise, when the visual code is distorted or modified to make it unreadable, the camera on the wearable extended reality appliance may no longer be able to read the visual code. A wearable extended reality appliance may not be able to share content in a common coordinate system when the appliance can no longer read the visual code. In other embodiments, an amount of change in location or orientation beyond a threshold may result in generation of a new visual code, requiring wearable appliance users to detect the new visual code in order to participate in (or to continue participating in) a common virtual reality experience.</p><p id="p-0632" num="0631">When the detected movement includes a change in an orientation of the mobile device without a change in a location of the mobile device, some of the disclosed embodiments may involve rendering the visual code unavailable for use in content sharing. As described above, the orientation of a mobile device may be changed. In such a situation, a prior visual code may become unreadable as described above. For example, a top portion of a mobile device may be facing north in a common coordinate system that may be using cardinal directions. The mobile device may be rotated so the top portion of the mobile device may be facing south in the common coordinate system. Based on the change in orientation, the visual code may be unreadable by the wearable extended reality appliance and the appliance may be unable to share content.</p><p id="p-0633" num="0632">In one implementation, the detected movement may include a change in a location of the mobile device without a change in an orientation of the mobile device, and some disclosed embodiments may involve rendering the visual code unavailable for use in content sharing. As described above, when the orientation and location of a mobile device displaying the visual code changes, the visual code may become unreadable as described above. For example, a first physical position of a mobile device may be in an office conference room. A second physical position of a mobile device may be in an office hallway. The change in location may be the difference between the mobile device being in the office conference room and the mobile device being located in the office hallway. A visual code may disappear when the mobile device moves into the office hallway. Therefore, the visual code may not be available to be read by the wearable extended reality appliance, and the appliance may not be able to share content in the preexisting shared coordinate system.</p><p id="p-0634" num="0633">In some embodiments, altering of the presentation may include removing the presentation of the visual code from the display of the mobile device. A mobile device may no longer display a visual code after moving positions in a physical space. In another embodiment, altering of the presentation may include shrinking the presentation of the visual code, enlarging the presentation of the visual code, changing intensity of the visual code, changing the color scheme of the visual code, adding a visual indicator indicative of the visual code being obsolete, distorting the presentation of the visual code, or any other alterations to the visual appearance of the visual code. For example, altering the presentation may make the visual code undetectable by one or more wearable extended reality appliances. As another example, altering the presentation may enable one or more wearable extended reality appliances to determine the visual code is obsolete.</p><p id="p-0635" num="0634">In some embodiments, the altering of the presentation may include presenting an updated visual code on the display of the mobile device, the updated visual code being configured for detection by an additional wearable extended reality appliance, to thereby enable the additional wearable extended reality appliance to share content in the common coordinate system upon the detection of the updated visual code. In some embodiments, altering the presentation may include presenting a new visual code. A new visual code may include a different pattern, different type of code, different coloring, or any other type of difference compared to the original visual code. An additional wearable extended reality appliance may be present in a physical space and may read the updated visual in order to display the common coordinate system and the virtual objects located in the common coordinate system.</p><p id="p-0636" num="0635">Some disclosed embodiments may involve generating the updated visual code to reflect the second physical position of the mobile device. In some examples, the second physical position may reflect a new common reference point for a common coordinate system. An updated visual code may contain information identifying the second physical position. For example, one or more wearable extended reality appliances may already be sharing a common coordinate system. The users of the one or more wearable extended reality appliances may want to share a common coordinate system with an additional wearable extended reality appliance. A mobile device may be moved to a different position in the physical space and display an updated visual code. The plurality of wearable extended reality appliances may scan the updated visual code to enable a common coordinate system with the second physical position of the mobile device as a common reference point. In some examples, since the second physical position is different from the first physical position, the updated visual code may include a correction factor for determining the common coordinate system. The correction factor may be based on a displacement between the first physical position and the second physical position, on a change in the direction of the mobile device, and so forth. In one example, the first physical position may be used as a reference point for the common coordinate system, and the updated visual code may be configured to enable a determination of the first physical position based on the second physical position, for example by encoding the displacement between the two physical positions.</p><p id="p-0637" num="0636">In some embodiments, the second physical position of the mobile device may be determined based on an analysis of an image data depicting at least part of the visual code and captured by an image sensor included in a particular wearable extended reality appliance of the plurality of wearable extended reality appliances after the detection of the visual code by the plurality of wearable extended reality appliances. The image data captured by the image sensor may be analyzed using a visual pattern recognition algorithm to localize the visual code in the image data. The location of the visual code in the image data may be compared with the location of the visual code at the time of the detection of the visual code by the plurality of wearable extended reality appliances to determine that a mobile device may have moved positions. For example, a mobile device may be located in a first physical position in a space. The image sensor may capture the mobile device and a visual code being displayed on the mobile device at a first location. The mobile device may move in a left direction in the space to a second physical position. The image sensor may capture the visual code at a different location and determine that the mobile device has moved positions in the space.</p><p id="p-0638" num="0637">In some embodiments, the movement of the mobile device may be detected based on a comparison of a position of the visual code in the image data and a position in the common coordinate system corresponding to the first physical position of the mobile device. In some examples, the position of the visual code in the image data may corresponds to a specific position in the common coordinate system. The image data may be analyzed using visual pattern recognition algorithm to identify the position of the visual code in the image data. The position of the visual code in the image data, the size of the visual code in the image data and/or the capturing parameters of the image data (such as a position of the image sensor, an orientation of the image sensor, zoom or other optical characteristics associated with the capturing of the image data, etc.) may be used to determine the specific position in the common coordinate system. The specific position in the common coordinate system may be compared with the position in the common coordinate system corresponding to the first physical position of the mobile device. A movement of the mobile device may be detected when the specific position in the common coordinate system is different from the position in the common coordinate system corresponding to the first physical position of the mobile device, or when the distance between the specific position in the common coordinate system and the position in the common coordinate system corresponding to the first physical position of the mobile device is longer than a selected threshold.</p><p id="p-0639" num="0638">In one implementation, the visual code may include at least one dynamic marker indicative of detected movements of the mobile device, and some disclosed embodiments may involve changing the at least one dynamic marker when generating the updated visual code. A dynamic marker may include an indicator with characteristics that may change, or different indicators having differing characteristics. For example, a marker that is dynamic may have characteristics that vary over time in one or more of information presented, color saturation, color scheme, brightness, or any other change that is capable of conveying differing information as a result of the changes. Alternatively, a dynamic marker may be one that changes completely. For example, at a first position the marker may reflect a first bar code or QR code, and in a second position the marker may reflect an entirely different bar code or QR code. An updated visual code may include a change in the code based on a detected movement of a mobile device. For example, a mobile device may move in a physical space. The processor may detect the movement of the mobile device. Based on the movement, the dynamic marker of the visual code may change. For example, alphanumeric information may change, symbols, icons or other graphics, may change, and/or a change in color saturation, color scheme, or brightness may occur.</p><p id="p-0640" num="0639"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>61</b></figref> illustrates a flow chart of an exemplary method <b>6110</b> that may be executed by a processor to perform operations for sharing virtual content.
