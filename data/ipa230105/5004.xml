However, multiple consumers may find themselves purchasing equity securities less regularly than they would prefer and not investing in the companies that such consumers spend at the most. Moreover, consumers tend to feel more favorable about spending money and using certain credit/debit cards when a rewards program provides benefits related to consumption and purchasing activity in the form of equity investment opportunity. However, the ability of rewarding purchasing habits and supporting investments via rewards in equity securities to consumers has been hindered by the lack of wide bandwidth network operations that enable communication between one or more remote servers, a mobile computer device in the hands of the consumer, a fixed computer device at a point-of-sale (POS) of a retail store or any other vendor, and an efficient centralized operation that quickly accesses a database, matches data strings, and determines appropriate reward actions for the consumer, in real time.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a first embodiment, a computer-implemented method is provided that includes receiving a string from a remote station, the string associated with an interaction event between a user and the remote station. The computer-implemented method also includes verifying that the string includes a content validation for a user account in a network service, mapping at least a portion of the string to a ticker symbol associated with an entry in a database, and transmitting, to the user, a message indicating that a fractional value associated with the ticker symbol has been added to the user account in the network service.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a second embodiment, a system includes a memory circuit storing instructions and one or more processors configured to execute the instructions. Upon execution of the instructions by the one or more processors, the system is configured to receive a string from a remote station, the string associated with a purchase by a user, to verify that the string includes a content validation for a user account in a network service, and to map at least a portion of the string to a ticker symbol associated with an entry in a database. The system is also configured to transmit, to the user, a message indicating that a fractional value associated with the ticker symbol has been added to the user account in the network service.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In yet another embodiment, a computer-implemented method includes selecting a string based on a pre-selected name, mapping the string to a symbol for a third party, forming a regular expression based on the string, and parsing an event report from a remote device to find a match for the regular expression. The computer-implemented method also includes evaluating a matching value between the event report and the string, determining a fractional value of the third party based on the matching value, and providing a reward message to a user identified in the event report, based on the fractional value of the third party.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a system configured for providing cardholders with stock rewards in debit [or credit] card transactions, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a detailed view of a client device and a server as used in the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a more detailed view of a processing architecture for a stock rewards transaction, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates lists created by the Match Analyzer tool in a stock rewards transaction engine, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates graphic payloads for display in cardholder mobile devices over pre-selected advertisement campaigns, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates more graphic payloads for display in cardholder mobile devices in multiple advertisement strategies, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates steps in a method for mapping at least a portion of a transaction string to a publicly traded enterprise listed in a network service for a broker server, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates steps in a method for providing a value added to a user account upon an interaction event at a remote station, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates steps in a method for rewarding users subscribed to a network service upon a receipt of an event report from a remote device, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example computer system with which the client and server of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> and the methods of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>9</b></figref> can be implemented, according to some embodiments.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the figures, elements and steps having the same or similar reference labels have the same or similar description and features, unless otherwise stated.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a full understanding of the present disclosure.

The rewards may include fractional shares of stock of publicly traded enterprises or exchange-traded funds (ETF) upon purchase transactions, wherein the fractional amount is determined based on a purchase amount and a reward policy. More specifically, the present disclosure relates to cardholder rewards upon use of a debit card or a credit card, the rewards including a fractional share of stock of a merchant, or a related publicly traded enterprise, or an ETF. The merchant may be associated to the retail store where the consumer made the purchase, or a manufacturer or provider of a specific branded consumer product or line of products sold at a certain store.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A system as provided herein is configured to enable a cardholder who subscribes to a network service to earn fractional shares of stock of certain publicly traded companies and/or ETFs on certain qualifying purchases made using a card. The card may be a debit or credit card associated with an account in a financial institution associated with the network service. The network service may include a banking service (e.g., including a debit or credit account), a broker service (e.g., servicing a brokerage account), or a combination thereof. For example, in some embodiments, a combination is desirable to include debit card transactions handled by one party and a brokerage account to hold securities handled by an independent party.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Embodiments as disclosed herein include devices and methods of using the devices for matching a cardholder transaction at a store, at a merchant outlet, at an online merchant, or a service provider, with an asset in a publicly traded enterprise. The asset in the publicly traded enterprise may be a stock of the store owner, the merchant, or the service provider, if any of the above is publicly traded. In some embodiments, the asset in the publicly traded enterprise may be a stock of a publicly traded enterprise owning some interest in the store, the merchant, or the service provider.

Business rules block <b>246</b> may be updated based on historical data collected by stock rewards engine <b>240</b>, using machine learning and other algorithms in neural network <b>244</b>. In some embodiments, bonuses based on prior activity or pending some future action may be available to any cardholder subscribing to the service provided by stock rewards engine <b>240</b>. Business rule block <b>246</b> may also classify different cardholders in tiers. For example, a cardholder may be included in a premium tier. Business rule block <b>246</b> may determine that premium tier users get double rewards. Additionally, business rules block <b>246</b> may assign bonuses available to premium tier users (e.g., during the month of February premium users who spend at intuit, which owns turbotax, mint, and quickbooks, get 3% while non-premium users get the normal rate). In some embodiments, business rules block <b>246</b> may also list or include a default ETF selected by a cardholder. The cardholder may select, via application <b>222</b>, a default ETF to assign rewards when match analyzer tool <b>242</b> is not able to find a merchant match to a public company in database <b>252</b>. In some embodiments, when the cardholder has not selected a default option, business rules block <b>246</b> may select a universal default ETF.

In some embodiments, a cardholder swipes a debit or credit card, or enters the debit or credit card information through an online purchasing service. A banking server <b>330</b>A hosting or handling the debit or credit card notifies a broker server to which the cardholder is subscribed (e.g., via a message posted to a web-hook, e-mail service, or any other communication via the network) of the transaction. For example, in some embodiments, transaction events are read from a simple notification service (SNS) Topic <b>302</b> created by the banking server <b>330</b>A. In some embodiments, banking server <b>330</b>A operates an SNS server or e-mail server to receive/transmit such notifications between cardholders, POS devices, and a broker server <b>330</b>B. In some embodiments, the banking server <b>330</b>A may use a publicly available distributed streaming platform as a message bus. The transaction message is received and parsed by a processor in broker server <b>330</b>B, the processor executing commands stored in a memory of broker server <b>330</b>B or in a database <b>352</b> (e.g., processor <b>212</b>-<b>2</b> executing instructions stored in stock rewards engine <b>240</b>). Execution of the code may cause broker server <b>330</b>B to whitelist universal unique identifiers (UUIDs) in block <b>304</b> to include cardholders enrolled in the network service (and exclude those who are not enrolled). Also, execution of the code includes applying a matching logic (e.g., using match analyzer tool <b>242</b> or neural network <b>244</b>) to map a transaction string (e.g., transaction record <b>227</b>) to a ticker symbol indicative of a publicly traded enterprise enrolled in the network service. Execution of the code also causes broker server <b>330</b>B to determine a reward amount for the cardholder based on the transaction amount and a cardholder policy.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, the processor in broker server <b>330</b>B executes an initial validation to verify features of the transaction based on the transaction string. The features of the transaction may include a nature of the transaction, e.g., &#x201c;Is this a checking transaction? If yes, proceed;&#x201d; or &#x201c;Does the transaction contain card data? If yes, proceed.&#x201d; When the initialization checks are validated (e.g., with a &#x201c;yes&#x201d; answer to the above questions), the transaction passes to a match analyzer tool (e.g., match analyzer tool <b>242</b>). The match analyzer tool analyzes the transaction and returns a match result, which contains a ticker symbol, and a match status (match, miss, or blacklist). The match status enables a clear distinction between a blacklist hit and a miss or a positive match. In some embodiments, when a blacklist hit occurs, the system may provide generic stock (e.g., ETF). In some embodiments, when broker server <b>330</b>B returns a blacklist result, the reward transaction may be canceled. In some embodiments, when the match analyzer tool returns a miss result, broker server <b>330</b>B may provide a default stock option to the cardholder. In some embodiments, broker server <b>330</b>B may detect a fraudulent transaction, or the transaction may be returned, canceled, or refunded at the POS or shortly thereafter. In such configurations, a business rule may apply and broker server <b>330</b>B may return cash to the cardholder, or cancel the rewards process altogether.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">When broker server <b>330</b>B identifies a ticker symbol (e.g., using the match analyzer tool), the broker server sends a message in block <b>306</b>, via a communications server <b>330</b>-<b>2</b>, e.g., a simple queue service (SQS) message, to banker server <b>330</b>A, or directly to the cardholder through a push notification on the mobile device (e.g., client devices <b>110</b>-<b>1</b> or <b>210</b>). The SQS message may include the ticker symbol, the merchant name, and an icon of the asset (e.g., a logo for the publicly traded enterprise). In some embodiments, banker server <b>330</b>A then pushes a notification to the cardholder (e.g., via a messaging API or e-mail API in the mobile device). The notification may inform the cardholder of the stock reward, the amount, the ticker symbol, or an icon of the publicly traded enterprise, and an update of the debit account. Moreover, in some embodiments, broker server <b>330</b>B may store the UUID of the cardholder, the reward amount, the investment asset, the merchant name, the time the transaction was posted, and any other transaction details in database <b>352</b> at block <b>308</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates positive matching list <b>448</b>A-<b>1</b> and positive matching list <b>448</b>A-<b>2</b> (hereinafter, collectively referred to as &#x201c;positive matching lists <b>448</b>A&#x201d;) created by match analyzer tool <b>442</b> in a stock rewards transaction engine <b>440</b>, according to some embodiments. Match analyzer tool <b>442</b> parses a transaction string provided by a remote device (e.g., transaction record <b>227</b> in client device <b>210</b>) to identify merchant names, industry codes, and other information that may be matched to an entry in any one of lists <b>448</b>. In some embodiments, the string includes the merchant name, and a merchant category code (MCC) is provided along with the transaction string, and is not derived from it. In some embodiments, an MCC is a four-digit number for retail financial services, used to classify a business by the types of goods or services it provides. For example, an MCC may be assigned either by merchant type (e.g., one for hotels, one for office supply stores, and the like), or by merchant name. MCCs may be assigned to a merchant by a debit/credit card company (e.g., banking server <b>330</b>A) when the business first starts accepting that card as a form of payment. In some embodiments, positive matching lists <b>448</b>A include ticker symbols associated with merchant names, the ticker symbols being, for example, identifiers for a publicly traded company, merchant, or enterprise (e.g., the string &#x201c;AAPL&#x201d; associated with Apple Inc. and the like). In some embodiments. positive matching list <b>448</b>A-<b>2</b> may be a &#x201c;secondary&#x201d; positive matching list, including weaker matching strings. For example, the transaction string may indicate a purchase at a certain venue (e.g., a popular hamburger chain) processed and handled via a mobile electronic appliance by a well-known electronics manufacturer. In such configuration, positive matching list <b>448</b>A-<b>1</b> may include the name of the popular hamburger chain, and positive matching list <b>448</b>A-<b>2</b> may include the name of the well-known electronics manufacturer. In some embodiments, the reverse may be true (e.g., as determined in the broker server by business rules, machine learning algorithms, and the like), and the well-known electronics manufacturer is included in matching list <b>448</b>A-<b>1</b> and the popular hamburger chain is included in matching list <b>448</b>A-<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As another example of the use of a secondary matching list <b>448</b>A-<b>2</b>, a merchant name that contains &#x201c;google&#x201d; may match secondarily with google (GOOGL). For example, the string &#x201c;google something&#x201d; will match as GOOGL, but the string &#x201c;google kayak&#x201d; will match as &#x201c;booking.com&#x201d; (the provider of &#x201c;kayak&#x201d; travel services) as a primary matching list <b>448</b>A-<b>1</b> and as GOOGL as a secondary matching list <b>448</b>A-<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">To determine a match, match analyzer tool <b>442</b> builds several regular expressions to use for fast matching. In some embodiments, each regular expression is created from different lists of strings, including an exclusion list <b>448</b>B-<b>1</b>, a blacklist <b>448</b>B-<b>2</b> (hereinafter, collectively referred to as &#x201c;negative matching lists <b>448</b>B&#x201d;), positive matching list <b>448</b>A-<b>1</b>, and positive matching list <b>448</b>A-<b>2</b>. Positive matching lists <b>448</b>A and negative matching lists <b>448</b>B will be collectively referred to, hereinafter, as &#x201c;matching lists <b>448</b>.&#x201d; Matching lists <b>448</b> may be stored in a database (e.g., databases <b>152</b>, <b>252</b>, and <b>352</b>), according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Exclusion list <b>448</b>B-<b>1</b> may include a list of strings that are sub-strings taken directly from real merchant names previously passed through the broker server. Each one of these strings may be combined into a single exclusion regular expression that aims to filter out a merchant from incorrectly matching on a stock for a publicly traded company or ETF. For example, in some embodiments, it may be desirable that a merchant name &#x201c;LOWES CORNER MARKET&#x201d; (which shares the same name as the retail company known as Lowe's Companies, Inc., which has the stock ticker symbol &#x201c;LOW&#x201d;) matches the asset &#x201c;LOW&#x201d; in the exclusion list. This avoids rewarding the cardholder with fractional shares of &#x201c;LOW&#x201d; stock when a cardholder has made a grocery purchase at &#x201c;LOWES CORNER MARKET.&#x201d; Accordingly, exclusion list <b>448</b>B-<b>1</b> avoids such matching by using the regular expression to identify merchant strings that should return fractional shares of a general ETF instead of stock in a specific publicly traded company.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, match analyzer tool <b>442</b> creates blacklist <b>448</b>B-<b>2</b> including strings used to build regular expressions intended to identify blacklisted merchants. A blacklisted merchant may include a payment processor or other merchants for which it is not desired to award fractional shares. For example, when a cardholder uses the card in a transaction with a competitor (e.g., cardholder <b>101</b> and card <b>111</b>), or potential competitor, of the network service hosting the broker server (e.g., broker server <b>130</b>B, <b>330</b>B), then the broker server may list the competitor's name in blacklist <b>448</b>B-<b>2</b>. In some embodiments, blacklist <b>448</b>B-<b>2</b> may be useful for complying with local rules and regulations for cardholders and stock transactions in certain markets.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">For negative matching lists <b>448</b>B, a match to a transaction string excludes the enterprise associated with the match (e.g., the ticker symbol matching the merchant name in the transaction string) from the fractional stock transaction.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, match analyzer tool <b>442</b> also creates lists to build regular expressions into positive matching lists <b>448</b>A. Matching lists <b>448</b> may include:</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">A &#x201c;Basic&#x201d; matching list <b>402</b>, wherein a merchant name that contains &#x201c;kayak&#x201d; matches to &#x201c;booking.com&#x201d; stock (ticker BKNG).

In some embodiments, when the transaction string includes a merchant name such as &#x201c;XYZ Video Game Company,&#x201d; the cardholder may have purchased a video game at a store (or online). In some embodiments, the transaction string &#x201c;XYZ Video Game Company&#x201d; may not match a ticker symbol for an enterprise with public stock options in the server network. In such configuration, the Match Analyzer tool may find a match to an enterprise with public options in the server network and within the same, or similar, industry. Accordingly, the Match Analyzer tool may determine an ETF in the server network called &#x201c;Gamers FTW!&#x201d; (the underlying ETF being ETFMG Video Game Tech ETF, having a ticker symbol &#x201c;GAMR&#x201d;). Further, the Match Analyzer tool then can use the GAMR category to award the cardholder fractional shares based on the purchase, instead of a pre-determined default ETF such as &#x201c;Stocks Worldwide&#x201d; (VT ticker symbol). In some embodiments, when the Match Analyzer tool is unable to find even an inexact match such as the GAMR ticker symbol, the system may revert to the pre-determined default ETF ticker symbol.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some embodiments, the match analyzer tool may perform the following steps in method <b>700</b>:</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">S1.

Use the regular expression to capture the portion of the merchant name in the transaction string that matches a large regular expression match (basic/starts-with/ends-with/exact).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">S2a. When there is a match, then: S2a(i): grab the first capture from the matching regular expression and inspect the complex patterns map with the first capture to see if there is a more complex pattern to use. In some embodiments, when there is a more complex match hit (e.g., to a blacklist or an exclusion list), then return a miss result, unless there is a more advanced match (e.g., as in secondary match list <b>448</b>A-<b>2</b>). Some embodiments include pattern matching capabilities that allow specifying more complicated regular expressions which may be desirable for certain merchants (based on the syntax and wording of the merchant's name). And S2a(ii): determine whether the capture from the regular expression has an equivalent ticker symbol, based on a &#x201c;rewards map&#x201d; in one of the above lists created by the Match Analyzer tool. This will either return the ticker symbol string (indicating match) or will return a miss result.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">S2b. When there is no match, then S2b: Return miss result and provide a default reward transaction. The default reward transaction may include a default stock rewarded to the cardholder based on cardholder preferences (e.g., as ascertained by artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithm, or manually set by the cardholder in the broker server account).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">S3.
