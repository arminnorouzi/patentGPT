DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order to add or expand at least one function of a conventional active pen, at least one button is disposed on the active pen. One button can correspond to one function, such as setting a color. When the active pen includes only one button, only one function can be added or expanded. When multiple functions need to be added or expanded, a number of required buttons must also be increased accordingly. However, disposing buttons on the active pen destroys mechanical strength of the active pen, and thus a mechanical design of the active pen is more complicated. Furthermore, disposing more buttons not only increases cost of the active pen, but also makes internal circuits of the active pen more complicated. In addition, in the prior art, information of functions corresponding to buttons must be transmitted to a touch panel through a wireless communication module of the active pen. Disposing the wireless module also increases the cost and power consumption of the active pen.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, there is a need to solve the above-mentioned problems in the prior art.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An objective of the present disclosure is to provide a touch control system and sensing method thereof and an active pen capable of solving the problems in the prior art.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The touch control system of the present disclosure includes: a touch panel; an active pen having a plurality of functions, wherein the functions are used for controlling the active pen or the touch panel and initiated only by at least one voice signal, and the active pen includes: a voice receiving module configured to receive the at least one voice signal; a voice analyzing module configured to analyze the at least one voice signal to generate a controlling command; and a control module configured to determine that the controlling command is used for controlling the active pen or the touch panel; and a touch controller electrically coupled to the touch panel and configured to receive, in response to the controlling command used for controlling the touch panel, the controlling command.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a sensing method of a touch control system of the present disclosure, the touch control system includes a touch panel, an active pen, and a touch controller. The active pen includes a voice receiving module, a voice analyzing module, and a control module. The active pen has a plurality of functions. The functions are used for controlling the active pen or the touch panel and initiated only by at least one voice signal. The sensing method of the touch control system includes: receiving the at least one voice signal by the voice receiving module; analyzing the at least one voice signal to generate a controlling command by the voice analyzing module; determining that the controlling command is used for controlling the active pen or the touch panel by the control module; and receiving, in response to the controlling command used for controlling the touch panel, the controlling command by the touch controller.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An active pen of the present disclosure has a plurality of functions.
