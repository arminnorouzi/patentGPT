Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">EP 2 168 636 A1 describes an equipment for introducing openings into a surface of an object and for supplying a fluid into a space through the previously created opening. This equipment comprises a pressure source for supplying a pressurized fluid, a lance with a nozzle arrangement and a conduit between the pressure source and the nozzle arrangement for supplying the pressurized fluid from the pressure source to the nozzle arrangement. The pressurized fluid flows out of the nozzle arrangement onto the surface essentially in the form of a jet, wherein an additive contained in a vessel may be entrained due to a pressure difference generated by the pressurized fluid in the nozzle arrangement. The nozzle arrangement has, as viewed in the flow direction, a first nozzle, a second nozzle, and an intermediate chamber between the first and the second nozzle. The pressurized fluid flows into the first nozzle and leaves the nozzle arrangement through the second nozzle. At least one inlet or multiple inlets opens or open into the intermediate chamber of the nozzle arrangement, wherein each inlet is connected to the conduit or a pipe, which is connected to a vessel containing the respective additive, or in the case of multiple inlets, connected to different vessels. On each inlet, an actuation means for a valve is provided to release or prevent the respective supply of the additive into the intermediate chamber. The actuation means are arranged directly on the nozzle arrangement on their respective inlets. The additive acting as an abrasive may be fed into the intermediate chamber via an inlet. If a second inlet is provided, an extinguishing foam or an extinguishing powder can be supplied to the nozzle arrangement by means of said second inlet, wherein this is also possible only after opening the valve and be sucked into the intermediate chamber of the nozzle arrangement by the pressurized fluid and be ejected out of the nozzle arrangement together with the fluid in the form of a fine mist.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">IT VI20 120 326 A describes a lance with first and second handles arranged at a distance from one another, wherein the lance can be used to extinguish fires. By means of a first valve arrangement in the region of the first handle, the supply of a pressurized fluid can be enabled or prevented. Immediately adjoining the first handle, a control valve is provided in order to be able to feed the pressurized fluid either to a first pipe arrangement and/or to a second pipe arrangement extending in parallel with the former. The second handle is in turn mounted on the first pipe arrangement so as to pivotable with its handle end from a position closer to the operator to a position further away from the operator. Using the second handle, the fluid jet to be dispensed from the first pipe arrangement with its respective spray cone can be adjusted. In this regard, the fluid may be fed to an inner channel in order to dispense a more concentrated fluid jet from the first pipe arrangement. If the second handle and a control valve connected thereto is pivoted, the fluid is fed to an outer channel surrounding the inner channel on the outside, and a fluid jet with a relatively greater spray cone is dispensed.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A lance for extinguishing a fire in a space, which is closed by at least one closing element, has become known from DE 20 2017 102 091 U1. The lance comprises at least a first handle, which can be grasped by an operator and at least one first duct with a first inlet and a first outlet, which can be fluidically connected to a first feed line of a pressurized fluid. Moreover, the lance comprises a first controlling lever, which acts upon the at least one first duct to allow the operator to control the selective inflow of the pressurized fluid therethrough. At least one second duct with a second inlet and a second outlet is provided, which can be fluidically connected to a second feed line of an abrasive powder. A second controlling lever acts on the at least one second duct to allow an operator to control the selective inflow of the abrasive agent therethrough. A first nozzle has a pair of first inlet openings, each of which being fluidically connected to the first outlet and the second outlet. A Venturi-effect mixing means serves to mix the pressurized fluid and the abrasive powder upon selective activation of the inflow of the fluid and the powder through the second duct. A first outlet opening is provided for spraying a concentrated jet of the mixture of the pressurized fluid and the abrasive powder. The at least one first handle comprises the first and second controlling lever, wherein the controlling levers are arranged closely together to allow the operator to actuate the first controlling lever and the second controlling lever with the same hand used to grasp the at least one first handle. This lance has generally proven successful in the case of application, but it was often difficult to selectively operate the adjacently arranged controlling levers while wearing protective gloves.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">DE 197 09 098 A1 describes a cleaning device for cleaning objects, which may be impinged upon by water, pressurized air, and chemical agents individually and/or a mixture thereof for the purpose of cleaning. For this purpose, a mixing and metering block is provided, which has feed lines for the individual cleaning components and an outlet for the discharge of the cleaning components in an individual or mixed state. Between the feed lines and the outlet, a single adjustable means is arranged, which is suitable for releasing all supplied components in a mixed, individual or metered manner, or to block at least one of these components.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The object of the present invention was to overcome the shortcomings of the prior art and to provide a lance which can be operated easily and safely by a user to allow them to optionally control the discharge of the additive with only one hand and to do this independently of handling the discharge of the fluid.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This object is achieved by a lance according to the claims.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The lance according to the invention is preferably used for extinguishing a fire during a firefighting operation, wherein first, an access opening through a solid body, such as a wall, a wall part, a car body part, a battery, or the like, must be created in order to be able to introduce or insert the pressurized fluid, in most cases water, for firefighting into the space located behind the solid body. For creating the at least one access opening, an additive, in particular a solid granulate material or another cutting agent, is added to or mixed in the pressurized fluid, and this mixture is applied by means of the lance to the site at which the access opening is to be created.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The lance may also be referred to as a piercing nozzle or thermal lance and comprises</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">a lance body,</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">a handle arrangement, which handle arrangement is arranged or formed on the lance body and comprises a first handle and a second handle, wherein the two handles are arranged at a distance from one another in the direction of the longitudinal extension of the lance body, and wherein every handle can each be grasped by a hand of the user for operating the lance,</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">at least a first channel with a first channel inlet and a first channel outlet, wherein the first channel inlet can be connected to a feed line of the pressurized fluid,</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">a first actuating means arrangement, which first actuating means arrangement is arranged in the region of the first handle of the handle arrangement, and a first actuating means is in direct operative connection to the first channel, wherein the first actuating means can be adjusted from a locked position to a flow position and vice versa and thus, the flow of the pressurized fluid through the first channel can be adjusted,</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">at least one container with at least one removal opening, wherein the first additive can be accommodated in the first container,</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">at least one second channel with a second channel inlet and a second channel outlet, wherein the second channel inlet is flow-connected to the at least one removal opening of the first container,</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">a second actuating means arrangement, which second actuating means arrangement comprises at least a second actuating means, wherein the second actuating means can be adjusted from a closed position into a release position and vice versa and thus, the flow of the first additive through the second channel can be adjusted,</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">a nozzle arrangement with a first nozzle body, wherein at least one first inlet opening, one second inlet opening, at least one outlet opening, and a mixing chamber are formed or arranged in the first nozzle body, and wherein the inlet openings open into the mixing chamber, and the mixing chamber is flow-connected to the at least one outlet opening,</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">wherein the first channel outlet of the first channel is flow-connected to the at least one first inlet opening of the first nozzle body, and</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">wherein the second channel outlet of the second channel is flow-connected to the second inlet opening of the first nozzle body, wherein it is further provided</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">that the second actuating means arrangement comprises a control pin, which control pin is mounted on the lance body so as to be pivotable about its longitudinal axis, and that the second handle of the handle arrangement is rotationally coupled to the control pin of the second actuating means arrangement, in particular the second handle and the control pin are formed in one piece, and the second handle and the control pin are jointly pivotable about their longitudinal axis,</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">that the at least one second actuating means of the second actuating means arrangement is arranged in the control pin,</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">that at least one third channel with a third channel inlet and a third channel outlet is provided, and the third channel inlet is flow-connected to the outer environment,</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">that the at least one first channel and the at least one third channel are arranged or formed in the lance body,</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">that the third channel outlet of the third channel is directly flow-connected to the at least one first inlet opening of the first nozzle body,</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">that the second actuating means of the second actuating means arrangement is in direct operative connection to the third channel, and the second actuating means arrangement is arranged in the region of the second handle,</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">that the third channel is continuously open between its third channel inlet and its third channel outlet when the second actuating means is in the release position, and thus, a flow of ambient air through the third channel to the mixing chamber is made possible, and</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">that the third channel is closed between its third channel inlet and its third channel outlet when the second actuating means is in the closed position, and thus, a flow of ambient air through the third channel to the mixing chamber is prevented, and in this operating mode, the first additive can be sucked into the mixing chamber from the first container via the second channel, and that the first channel comprises a first partial channel and a second partial channel in its longitudinal section between the second actuating means arrangement and the first channel outlet, and the first partial channel is arranged inside the second partial channel.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The advantage achieved thereby consists in that, with a simple adjustment movement of the second actuating means of the second actuating means arrangement, the flow and the intake of ambient air into the mixing chamber of the first nozzle body is controlled selectively and thus, in further consequence, the admixture of the first additive to the pressurized fluid is made possible or prevented. The flow and/or the intake of the first and/or through the second channel starting from the first container into the mixing chamber is determined by releasing or closing the separate and independent third channel in the region of the second actuating means arrangement. The first handle of the lance is held with one hand, and the first actuating means arrangement is operated with the same hand, as well. Thus, inadvertent operating errors are also avoided as the two actuating means arrangements are arranged at a distance from one another in the direction of the longitudinal extension. The second actuating means arrangement can be operated easily and safely using the other hand due to the distance from the first handle. Thus, a clear spatial separation of the two actuating means arrangements is achieved.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Moreover, it is also provided if the at least one first channel and the at least one third channel are arranged or formed in the lance body. Thus, a compact design of the lance body is achieved.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The second actuating means arrangement further comprises a control pin, which control pin is mounted on the lance body so as to be pivotable about its longitudinal axis. By providing a separate, essentially cylindrically-formed control pin, a variety of control positions of the individual actuating means are realized easily due to an easy rotation and/or pivot movement of the control pin and the actuating means located or arranged therein.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Moreover, the first channel comprises a first partial channel and a second partial channel in its longitudinal section between the second actuating means arrangement and the first channel outlet, and the first partial channel is arranged inside the second partial channel. By dividing the first channel following the second actuating means arrangement, an even more universal use of the lance and, associated therewith, the discharge of different types of jets is made possible. Thus, not only a solid jet but also a spray jet is made possible depending on the respective partial channel the pressurized fluid is passed through.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Finally, it is moreover provided that the second handle of the handle arrangement is rotationally coupled to the control pin of the second actuating means arrangement, in particular if the second handle and the control pin are formed as one piece. Thereby, an easy switching to the respectively desired operating mode of the lance is carried out without re-grasping and letting go of the second handle. This is carried out with only the same hand which also grasps the second handle.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">A different embodiment is characterized in that the second channel is formed by a separate connecting line, and the connecting line is arranged so as to extend outside the lance body or inside the lance body. By providing a separate connecting line, which is arranged so as to extend outside the lance body, an easy replaceability of the first container and/or the first nozzle body can be made possible.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A further embodiment provides that the second actuating means of the second actuating means arrangement is formed by a through hole, in particular by at least one bore, passing through the control pin in the radial direction. Due to the combination of the control pin with the through hole and its coordinated arrangement, a robust and durable actuating and/or control device can be created.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Another embodiment is characterized in that the second actuating means arrangement moreover comprises a third actuating means, and the third actuating means is in direct operative connection to the second channel, wherein the third actuating means is adjustable out of a closed position into a release position and vice versa and thus, the flow of the first additive through the second channel can be adjusted directly. Thus, an additional control option for the second channel can be created in the region of the second actuating means arrangement. The third actuating means thus additionally interacts with the second actuating means. In this regard, an opposing control position of the second and third actuating means is always provided, namely such that when the second actuating means is in the closed position, the third actuating means is in the release position and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A further preferred embodiment is characterized in that the third channel is closed when the second actuating means is in the closed position and the third actuating means is in its release position, and the second channel is continuously open, or that the third channel is continuously open when the second actuating means is in the release position and the third actuating means is in its closed position and the second channel is closed. Thus, a secure locking and/or closed position of the second channel when the second actuating means is in the release position can be achieved. Thus, an undesired removal of the first additive out of the first container could be securely prevented, even if the third channel is inadvertently shift of the third channel.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Moreover, it may be advantageous if the second actuating means and the third actuating means of the second actuating means arrangement are arranged at a distance from one another in the axial direction of the control pin and offset from one another when viewed in the circumferential direction. Depending on the circumferential offset, the extent of the adjustment movement and the associated switch of the operating mode of the lance can thus be achieved.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Another embodiment is characterized in that a second nozzle body is provided, which second nozzle body is arranged upstream of the first nozzle body in the flow direction of the pressurized fluid, and the first channel outlet of the first channel is arranged or formed in the second nozzle body. By providing a second nozzle body, an even more individual discharge option of the fluid out of the lance can be facilitated.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">A further preferred embodiment is characterized in that the third channel is also arranged or formed in the second nozzle body. Thus, a channel formation of the third channel that is safe and protected from external environmental influences can be created.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Moreover, it may be advantageous if the first nozzle body of the nozzle arrangement is removably held on the lance body, in particular removably held on the second nozzle body. Thus, an easy exchange possibility of the first nozzle body is created. This way, for example a damaged or worn first nozzle body can be exchanged easily for a new first nozzle body, whereby the period of use of the entire lance can be increased significantly.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">A further possible embodiment has the features that the first partial channel ends before the first channel outlet, as viewed in the axial direction, and opens into the second partial channel surrounding the first partial channel, and moreover at least an end section of the first partial channel is arranged with respect to the first channel outlet in an aligning orientation thereto. Thus, a straight and central discharge direction of the pressurized fluid out of the first partial channel, through the first channel outlet and further to the first nozzle body can be created.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A different alternative embodiment is characterized in that the second actuating means arrangement further comprises an actuating means group with at least one first actuator member and one second actuator member, which actuator members of the actuating means group are in direct operative connection to the first channel. By providing a separate actuating means group with multiple actuator members, the forwarding of the fluid in the respectively subsequent partial channel can be selectively preselected and optionally adjusted.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">A further possible and possibly alternative embodiment has the features that the actuator members of the actuating means group are each formed by a breakthrough passing through the control pin in the radial direction, in particular are each formed by at least one bore. This also allows producing a compact adjusting device for controlling the fluid throughput that is less susceptible to errors.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">A further embodiment provides that the actuator members of the actuating means group are arranged at a distance from one another in the axial direction and circumferentially offset, by an offset angle, from one another when viewed in the circumferential direction, and optionally only one of the actuator members at a time makes the flow of the pressurized fluid possible. Thus, a secure separation of the intake of the fluid into the respective partial channel can be ensured.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">A further embodiment provides that the first actuator member of the actuating means group is in direct operative connection to the first partial channel, and the second actuator member of the actuating means group is in direct operative connection to the second partial channel. Thus, a clear assignment of the corresponding actuator member to the respectively associated partial channel is ensured.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A different alternative embodiment is characterized in that the third channel is closed when the second actuating means is in the closed position, and simultaneously, the flow connection between the first channel and the first partial channel is established by means of the at least one first actuator member, and moreover the flow connection between the first channel and the second partial channel is interrupted by means of the second actuator member. Due to the respective control position of the second actuating means with respect to the actuator members of the actuating means group, a solid jet of the fluid together with the first additive to be discharged can thus be achieved in this control position.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Moreover, it may be advantageous if the third channel is continuously open when the second actuating means is in the release position, and simultaneously, the flow connection between the first channel and the first partial channel is established by means of the at least one first actuator member, and moreover the flow connection between the first channel and the second partial channel is interrupted by means of the second actuator member. Due to this specified control position, the discharge of a solid jet of the fluid, but without the addition and/or admixture of the first additive, can be made possible. If a further container with a further additive is provided and if said further container is flow-connected to the third channel via the second actuating means, the respective additives stored in both the first container and the second container can be sucked in simultaneously. In this operating mode, the pressurized fluid out of the lance is also discharged in a solid jet.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Moreover, it may be advantageous if, when the first nozzle body is removed, the third channel is closed when the second actuating means is in the closed position, and simultaneously, the flow connection between the first channel and the first partial channel is interrupted by means of the at least one first actuator member, and moreover the flow connection between the first channel and the second partial channel is established by means of the second actuator member. By previously removing and/or taking off the first nozzle body and the correspondingly selected control position, the discharge of a spray jet out of the lance is thus made possible.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Moreover, it may be advantageous if a further container for a further additive to be accommodated therein is provided, and the further container is flow-connected to the second actuating means arrangement and further to the third channel via a fourth channel. Thus, when the second actuating means arrangement is in the operating position in which a solid jet with the admixed first additive is discharged, the possibility of not sucking in the ambient air directly into the third channel but rather indirectly via the second container is created. For sucking in the further additive, a separate container opening is to be provided to allow for an inflow and intake of ambient air into the container interior.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">A different alternative embodiment is characterized in that at least one of the containers is removably held on the lance body. Thus, the container or the containers can be refilled or replaced easily and quickly during operation.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">A further possible alternative embodiment is characterized in that a pivot arrangement is provided, by means of which pivot arrangement at least the first container is held so as to be pivotable on the lance body. Thus, the container or also the respective containers can be oriented relative to the lance body such that the intake point is always at the position closest to the bottom.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">A further possible and possibly alternative embodiment has the features that at least one container opening is provided, which at least one container opening opens into a container interior of the container. This may allow the ambient air to flow into the container interior. Otherwise, a vacuum would build up in the interior due to the suction effect applied to the additive.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Finally, a further embodiment provides that the container interior is flow-connected to the outer environment via the container opening, and at least one filter element is arranged in the container opening. Thereby, depending on selection and design of the filter element, an inadvertent inflow of contaminations, dust particles, the previously dispensed additive and/or of humidity may be reduced or entirely prevented.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">A possible alternative embodiment is characterized in that at least the further container is provided and the second actuating means arrangement further comprises the third actuating means, wherein, in a first operating position of the second actuating means arrangement, the third actuating means and the first actuator member of the actuating means group are each in their respective release position, and the second actuating means is in its closed position, and the third channel is closed, and wherein, in a second operating position of the second actuating means arrangement, the first actuator member of the actuating means group and the second actuating means are each in their respective release position, and the third actuating means is in its closed position, and the second channel is closed. With this design and arrangement of the actuating means and the actuator members of the second actuating means arrangement and the respectively selected operating position, a switching operation for admixing or adding the additive required in each case can be carried out in a quick and user friendly manner.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Moreover, it may be advantageous if the additive is selected from the group of solid granulate material, abrasive agent, extinguishing powder, extinguishing additive, foaming agent, dry ice, decontamination agent. Thereby, a high possibility of variation for a number of different purposes and operating conditions may be created.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Other objects and features of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description considered in connection with the accompanying drawings.

Moreover, the specifications of location, such as at the top, at the bottom, at the side, chosen in the description refer to the directly described and depicted figure and in case of a change of position, these specifications of location are to be analogously transferred to the new position.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The term &#x201c;in particular&#x201d; shall henceforth be understood to mean that it may refer to a possible more specific formation or more detailed specification of an object or a process step, but need not necessarily depict a mandatory, preferred embodiment of same or a mandatory practice.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the following description and in the claims, the term direct or indirect are each used for how the actuating means or the actuating means group acts on the corresponding channel. In this regard, the term direct is to be understood to mean that the respective actuating means or one of the actuator members of the actuating means group itself physically acts on the associated channel and allows or prevents the flow and/or throughflow of the corresponding medium. The term indirect is to be construed such that the respective actuating means or one of the actuator members of the actuating means group is physically in operative connection to one of the channels and allows or closes the flow and/or the throughflow of the respective medium in the corresponding channel, wherein, however, depending on the operating position in another one of the channels, the flow and/or throughflow of a different medium is also allowed or prevented.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>12</b></figref> each show a lance <b>1</b> or its individual components, which may also be referred to as a piercing nozzle. Such lances <b>1</b> serve, for example during a firefighting operation, to fight fires in which the source of the fire is initially impossible to access as the space is closed and/or enclosed by walls. In order to gain access to the space containing the source of the fire, at least one access opening is to be created through the wall. Depending on the material or material composition of the wall, the creation or introduction of the access opening is associated with increased effort. Generally, a pressurized fluid, such as water, is used to fight fires or blazes. Additionally, admixing or adding at least one additive <b>2</b> to the pressurized fluid is known. The basic concept of the lance <b>1</b> is always the same, however, only different operating modes and/or additional embodiments are shown and described in the individual Figures.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">If the lance <b>1</b> is designed as a universal lance, it may be used to dispense only the fluid and/or also a mixture, a solution, a suspension, or an emulsion of the at least one first additive <b>2</b> and the fluid together. This is carried out preferably at high to very high pressures above the ambient pressure.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The lance <b>1</b> comprises multiple component parts, wherein these are mentioned and described below. Thus, the lance <b>1</b> comprises a lance body <b>3</b>, which may also be formed of multiple lance body parts. A handle arrangement <b>4</b> for operating and holding the lance <b>1</b> is arranged on the lance body <b>3</b>. The handle arrangement <b>4</b> itself comprises a first handle <b>5</b> and a second handle <b>6</b>, wherein the two handles <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> are arranged at a distance from one another in the direction of the longitudinal extension of the lance body <b>3</b>. Due to this often common spacing, a user of the lance <b>1</b> can grasp the first handle <b>5</b> with one hand and use the other hand to grasp the second handle <b>6</b> and thus, grasp and operate the lance <b>1</b> in a sufficiently secure manner. In order to be able to apply a high pressure force and/or pressing force of the lance <b>1</b> to that point of the wall in which the access opening is to be introduced, a shoulder support, which is not described in further detail, may be provided on the lance <b>1</b>, in particular its lance body <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Moreover, at least one first channel <b>7</b> with a first channel inlet <b>8</b> and a first channel outlet <b>9</b> arranged at a distance from the former in the flow direction is provided, wherein the channel <b>7</b> allows establishing a flow connection between the first channel inlet <b>8</b> and the first channel outlet <b>9</b>. The first channel inlet <b>8</b> can be connected, in particular coupled, to an adumbrated feed line <b>10</b>. In order to control the supply of the fluid and, in further consequence, the flow of the fluid at least through the first channel <b>7</b>, a first actuating means arrangement <b>11</b> is provided, which is arranged in the region of the first handle <b>5</b> of the handle arrangement <b>4</b>. In order to make this control and the associated locked position or flow position of the first channel <b>7</b> possible, the first actuating means arrangement <b>11</b> comprises at least one first actuating means <b>12</b>. In this regard, the first actuating means <b>12</b> can preferably be mechanically adjusted, manually from the locked position to the flow position and vice versa and is in direct operative connection to the first channel <b>7</b>. Depending on the preselected position of the first actuating means <b>12</b>, the flow of the pressurized fluid through the first channel <b>7</b> can be adjusted.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">At least one first container <b>13</b> is provided for accommodating the first additive <b>2</b> and arranging it directly, immediately adjacent to the lance body <b>3</b>. The container <b>13</b> is held on the lance body <b>3</b> so as to be removable as needed and has at least one removal opening <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In order to establish a line connection for transporting the first additive <b>2</b>, at least one second channel <b>15</b> with a second channel inlet <b>16</b> and a second channel outlet <b>17</b> is provided. The second channel inlet <b>16</b> is flow-connected to the removal opening <b>14</b> of the first container <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">A nozzle arrangement <b>18</b> with a first nozzle body <b>19</b> is arranged on the end of the lance <b>1</b> facing away from the first handle <b>5</b>, which nozzle body <b>19</b> serves to discharge the fluid or the mixture of the fluid and the first additive <b>2</b>. The nozzle arrangement <b>18</b> may also comprise a second nozzle body <b>20</b>, wherein it is arranged upstream of the nozzle body <b>19</b> as viewed in the flow direction of the pressurized fluid. If the second nozzle body <b>20</b> is provided, the first channel outlet <b>9</b> of the first channel <b>7</b> may be arranged or formed in the second nozzle body <b>20</b>. Moreover, it may be advantageous if the first nozzle body <b>19</b> of the nozzle arrangement <b>18</b> is removably held on the lance body <b>3</b>, in particular removably held on the second nozzle body <b>20</b>. In this case, the second channel <b>15</b> is to be formed in a separable or interruptible manner between its second channel inlet <b>16</b> and its second channel outlet <b>17</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The first nozzle body <b>19</b> has at least one first inlet opening <b>21</b>, one second inlet opening <b>22</b>, at least one outlet opening <b>23</b>, and a mixing chamber <b>24</b>. Following the inlet openings <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, one inlet channel each is formed, inside which the respective medium is passed through. The inlet openings <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> on their part open into the mixing chamber <b>24</b>, wherein the mixing chamber <b>24</b> is flow-connected to the at least one outlet opening <b>23</b>. The first inlet opening <b>21</b> together with the second inlet opening <b>22</b> defines a longitudinal axis <b>25</b>, which extends parallel with respect to the longitudinal extension of the lance body <b>3</b>. The longitudinal axis <b>25</b> also defines the general jet direction of the fluid or the mixture of the fluid and the additive <b>2</b> to be discharged. Preferably, the first inlet opening <b>21</b> has an orientation pointing in the direction of the longitudinal axis <b>25</b> and is thus oriented in the direction towards the lance body <b>3</b>. The second inlet opening <b>22</b> has an angled arrangement relative thereto, wherein this may preferably be a normal orientation with respect to the longitudinal axis <b>25</b>. It is also possible for an acute angle to be enclosed between the second inlet opening <b>22</b> and the longitudinal axis <b>25</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Moreover, the first channel outlet <b>9</b> of the first channel <b>7</b> is flow-connected to the at least one first inlet opening <b>21</b> of the first nozzle body <b>19</b>. The second channel outlet <b>17</b> of the second channel <b>15</b> is flow-connected to the second inlet opening <b>22</b> of the first nozzle body <b>19</b>. Thus, the fluid can be fed into the mixing chamber <b>24</b> via the first channel <b>7</b> and the first additive <b>2</b> can be fed into the mixing chamber <b>24</b> via the second channel <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In the region of the lance body <b>3</b>, the lance <b>1</b> moreover comprises at least one third channel <b>26</b> having a third channel inlet <b>27</b> and a third channel outlet <b>28</b> arranged at a distance therefrom. The third channel inlet <b>27</b>, in turn, is flow-connected to the outer environment. Thus, an inflow or intake of ambient air into the third channel <b>26</b> can be made possible. The third channel outlet <b>28</b>, in turn, is also flow-connected to the first inlet opening <b>21</b> of the first nozzle body <b>19</b>. This can take place as the first inlet opening <b>21</b> has a larger inlet cross-section. However, it would also be possible to divide the first inlet opening <b>21</b> into at least two partial openings. In that case, for example the first channel <b>7</b> could open into the first partial opening, and the third channel <b>26</b> could open into the second partial opening.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">For the optional control of the passage through the third channel <b>26</b>, a second actuating means arrangement <b>29</b> is thus provided, which comprises at least a second actuating means <b>30</b>. The second actuating means <b>30</b> itself may be adjusted from a closed position into a release position and vice versa. Thus, the flow of the first additive <b>2</b> through the second channel <b>15</b> can be adjusted. The second actuating means <b>30</b> directly interacts with the third channel <b>26</b> but indirectly controls the intake or the flow of the first additive <b>2</b> through the second channel <b>15</b>. Thus, a direct operative connection between the second actuating means <b>30</b> and the third channel <b>26</b> is provided. Moreover, it can be seen that the second actuating means arrangement <b>29</b> is arranged in the region of the second handle <b>6</b> of the lance <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">If the second actuating means <b>30</b> is in its release position, the third channel <b>26</b> is continuously open, and &#x201c;external air&#x201d; can additionally be sucked into the mixing chamber <b>24</b> via the third channel <b>26</b> when the fluid flows through the first channel <b>7</b>. The first additive <b>2</b> cannot be sucked out of the first container <b>13</b> into the mixing chamber <b>24</b> via the second channel <b>15</b> in this operating mode. However, if the second actuating means <b>30</b> is in its closed position, the third channel <b>26</b> is closed and ambient air cannot flow through. In this operating mode, the first additive <b>2</b> is sucked out of the first container <b>13</b> into the mixing chamber <b>24</b> via the second channel <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Preferably, the at least one first channel <b>7</b> and the at least one third channel <b>26</b> are located in the lance body <b>3</b> and are thus arranged or formed in the lance body <b>3</b>. The second channel <b>15</b> may preferably be formed by a separate connecting line. Moreover, the connecting line may be arranged so as to extend outside the lance body <b>3</b>, as it is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>. However, it would also be possible to arrange or form the connecting line forming the second channel <b>15</b> inside the lance body <b>3</b>. This is adumbrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> as a possible variant.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">If the second nozzle body <b>20</b> is provided or arranged or formed on the lance body, both the first channel <b>7</b> and the third channel <b>26</b> are arranged or formed in the second nozzle body <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The second actuating means arrangement <b>29</b> situated in the region of the second handle <b>6</b> may comprise a control pin <b>31</b> or be formed by one. The control pin <b>31</b> is further mounted on the lance body <b>3</b> so as to be pivotable or rotatable about its longitudinal axis. Preferably, the second handle <b>6</b> of the handle arrangement <b>4</b> is rotationally coupled to the control pin <b>31</b> of the second actuating means arrangement <b>29</b>. An integral design of the second handle <b>6</b> and the control pin <b>31</b> is also possible. The control pin <b>31</b> is rotatably accommodated in a hollow-cylindrical hole, in particular a bore, which is formed or arranged in the lance body <b>3</b>. When viewed in the flow direction, the channels <b>7</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>47</b> open into the hollow-cylindrical hole and continue downstream.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The control pin <b>31</b> generally has a cylindrical basic shape, possibly with different diameters. In this exemplary embodiment, the previously described second actuating means <b>30</b> may be formed by a through hole <b>32</b> passing through the control pin <b>31</b> in the radial direction, or a through hole <b>32</b> passing through in the normal direction with respect to the longitudinal axis of the control pin <b>31</b>. Preferably, the through hole <b>32</b> is formed by at least one bore, which passes through the control pin <b>31</b> fully.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">For forming different forms of jets of the pressurized fluid, it may also be provided in this lance <b>1</b> that the first channel <b>7</b> comprises or is divided into a first partial channel <b>33</b> and at least a second partial channel <b>34</b> in its longitudinal section between the second actuating means arrangement <b>29</b> and the first channel outlet <b>9</b>. Regarding the form of jets, this lance <b>1</b> allows the distinction between a so-called solid jet and a spray jet. The solid jet constitutes a rather circumferentially concentrated jet pattern of the fluid, whereas the spray jet constitutes a spatially much greater jet pattern. The cone angle of the solid jet is substantially smaller than that of the spray jet.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Here, the first partial channel <b>33</b> is that channel which is arranged inside the second partial channel <b>34</b> and through which the fluid is conducted preferably centrally through the lance body <b>3</b> to form the solid jet. The second partial channel <b>34</b> surrounds the first partial channel <b>33</b>. The first partial channel <b>33</b> ends before the first channel outlet <b>9</b> when viewed in the axial direction and opens into the second partial channel <b>34</b> surrounding the first partial channel <b>33</b>. In its end section, the second partial channel <b>34</b> has a conically tapering cross-sectional shape. In order to form the spray jet, a deflection body <b>35</b> may be provided in the end region or in the end section of the second partial channel <b>34</b>. In this exemplary embodiment, the first partial channel <b>33</b> passes through the deflection body <b>35</b>, preferably centrally, and opens into the conically tapering second partial channel <b>34</b>. Thus, the at least one end section of the first partial channel <b>33</b> is arranged in an aligning orientation with respect to the first channel outlet <b>9</b>. In the deflection body <b>35</b>, at least one or preferably multiple flow openings for the fluid to be conducted may be provided.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">For the optional supply of the two partial channels <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, the second actuating means arrangement <b>29</b> may further comprise an actuating means group <b>36</b> with at least a first actuator member <b>37</b> and a second actuator member <b>38</b>. As described above, the second actuating means arrangement <b>29</b> is located in the region of the second handle <b>6</b> as well as preferably also in the control pin <b>31</b>.
