This method includes measuring relative permittivity on the basis of the behavior of a high-frequency wave that travels back and forth between measurement probes. Specifically, this method includes transmitting an electromagnetic wave along a metallic probe embedded in a medium, and calculating a water amount in the medium from relative permittivity measured on the basis of a reflection response of the electromagnetic wave.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">There is a problem in which, since the TDR measures relative permittivity using the characteristics of a propagation of an electromagnetic wave in the vicinity of a probe in a medium, a gap produced in the vicinity of the probe has a great impact on the measurement, and thus it is difficult to measure relative permittivity correctly. In order to solve the problem described above, a technology is disclosed that measures, using two probes that respectively serve as a transmission-side probe and a reception-side probe, relative permittivity of a medium between the probes, the two probes each including a tiny opening for an electromagnetic wave, the two probes being situated at a certain distance from each other (for example, refer to Patent Literature 1).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Patent Literature 1: WO2018/221051</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In this case, the gap produced in the vicinity of the probe is smaller than the distance between the probes, and thus does not have a great impact on a result of the measurement. This results in being able to calculate relative permittivity (proportional to a water amount) with a reduced error. When a plurality of tiny openings is provided to each probe, this makes it possible to measure a water amount at a plurality of locations in the medium at the same time.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">When a plurality of tiny openings is provided to each probe, propagation paths for a plurality of electromagnetic waves are formed. On the other hand, it has turned out that, when a measurement distance between a certain tiny opening provided to the transmission-side probe and a certain tiny opening provided to the reception-side probe, and a measurement distance between another tiny opening provided to the transmission-side probe and another tiny opening provided to the reception-side probe (total lengths of signal transmission paths) are equal, paths unintentionally have equal propagation lengths. This results in causing noise, and thus in causing an error in measurement.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of the circumstances described above, it is an object of the present technology to provide a sensor apparatus and a water amount measurement apparatus that make it possible to reduce an error in measurement, and to improve the accuracy in the measurement of relative permittivity of a medium or a water amount in the medium.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A sensor apparatus according to an embodiment of the present technology includes a sensor head and a measurement unit.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The sensor head includes a first probe and a second probe.
