Poxviruses are divided into two subfamilies based on host range. The Chordopoxviridae subfamily, which infects vertebrate hosts, consists of eight genera, of which four genera (Orthopoxvirus, Parapoxvirus, Molluscipoxvirus, and Yatapoxvirus) are known to infect humans. Smallpox is caused by infection with variola virus (VARV), a member of the genus Orthopoxvirus (OPV). The OPV genus comprises a number of genetically related and morphologically identical viruses, including camelpox virus (CMLV), cowpox virus (CPXV), ectromelia virus (ECTV, &#x201c;mousepox agent&#x201d;), horsepox virus (HPXV), monkeypox virus (MPXV), rabbitpox virus (RPXV), raccoonpox virus, skunkpox virus, Taterapox virus, Uasin Gishu disease virus, vaccinia virus (VACV), variola virus (VARV) and volepox virus (VPV). Other than VARV, at least three other OPVs, including VACV, MPXV and CPXV, are known to infect humans. So far, vaccination with &#x201c;live&#x201d; VACV is the only proven protection against smallpox. An aggressive program of vaccination led to the eradication of smallpox in 1980 and routine smallpox vaccination of the public was stopped. However, a need remains to find new safe and effective means of vaccinating individuals against VARV and other OPVs.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A variety of preparations of VACV have been used as smallpox vaccines. Most of these comprised of a number of related viruses (e.g., Dryvax), and one comprises a single molecular clone, ACAM2000. However, like Dryvax and other VACV vaccines, even ACAM2000 is associated with serious side effects including cardiomyopathy and pericarditis. To reduce risks, the ACAM2000 vaccine, like other live vaccines, has numerous contraindications that preclude individuals with cancer, immunodeficiencies, organ transplant recipients, patients with atopic dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, heart conditions, and patients on immunosuppressants. It is estimated that 15-50% of the US population would fall under one of these categories, therefore confirming the need for the development of a safer vaccine or vaccination protocol (Kennedy et al., 2007 Kennedy R, Poland G A. 2007. T-Cell epitope discovery for variola and vaccinia viruses. Rev Med Viroll 7: 93-113). Therefore, there is a need for the development of a vaccine that is equivalent in efficacy to Dryvax or ACAM2000&#x2122;, but that is safer.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides chimeric poxviruses assembled and replicated from chemically synthesized DNA. Because chemical genome synthesis is not dependent on a natural template, a plethora of structural and functional modifications of the viral genome are possible. Chemical genome synthesis is particularly useful when a natural template is not available for genetic replication or modification by conventional molecular biology methods.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention provides synthetic chimeric poxviruses (e.g., synthetic chimeric OPV or scOPV), methods for producing such viruses and the use of such viruses, for example, as immunogens, in immunogenic formulations, in in vitro assays, as vehicles for heterologous gene expression, or as oncolytic agents.

Other types of modifications include, for example, &#x201c;caps&#x201d;, substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog; internucleotide modifications such as, for example, those with uncharged linkages (e.g., methyl phosphonates, phosphotriesters, phosphoamidates, carbamates, etc.) and with charged linkages (e.g., phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, etc.); those containing pendant moieties, such as, for example, proteins (e.g., nucleases, toxins, antibodies, signal peptides, poly-L-lysine, etc.); those with intercalators (e.g., acridine, psoralen, etc.); those containing chelators (e.g., metals, radioactive metals, boron, oxidative metals, etc.); those containing alkylators; those with modified linkages (e.g., alpha anomeric nucleic acids, etc.); as well as unmodified forms of the polynucleotide(s). Further, any of the hydroxyl groups ordinarily present in the sugars may be replaced, for example, by phosphonate groups, phosphate groups, protected by standard protecting groups, or activated to prepare additional linkages to additional nucleotides, or may be conjugated to solid supports. The 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; terminal OH can be phosphorylated or substituted with amines or organic capping group moieties of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Other hydroxyls may also be derivatized to standard protecting groups. Polynucleotides can also contain analogous forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that are generally known in the art, including, for example, 2&#x2032;-O-methyl-, 2&#x2032;-O-allyl, 2&#x2032;-fluoro- or 2&#x2032;-azido-ribose, carbocyclic sugar analogs, alpha- or beta-anomeric sugars, epimeric sugars such as arabinose, xyloses or lyxoses, pyranose sugars, furanose sugars, sedoheptuloses, acyclic analogs and abasic nucleoside analogs such as methyl riboside. One or more phosphodiester linkages may be replaced by alternative linking groups. These alternative linking groups include, but are not limited to, embodiments wherein phosphate is replaced by P(O)S(&#x201c;thioate&#x201d;), P(S)S (&#x201c;dithioate&#x201d;), (O)NR<sub>2 </sub>(&#x201c;amidate&#x201d;), P(O)R, P(O)OR&#x2032;, CO or CH<sub>2 </sub>(&#x201c;formacetal&#x201d;), in which each R or R&#x2032; is independently H or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl (1-20 C) optionally containing an ether (&#x2014;O&#x2014;) linkage, aryl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or araldyl.

The Orthopoxvirus (OPV) genus comprises a number of poxviruses that vary greatly in their ability to infect different hosts. Vaccinia virus (VACV), for example, can infect a broad group of hosts, whereas variola virus (VARV), the causative agent of smallpox, only infects humans. A feature common to many, if not all poxviruses, is their ability to non-genetically &#x201c;reactivate&#x201d; within a host. Non-genetic reactivation refers to a process wherein cells infected by one poxvirus can promote the recovery of a second &#x201c;dead&#x201d; virus (for example one inactivated by heat) that would be non-infectious on its own.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Purified poxvirus DNA is not infectious because the virus life cycle requires transcription of early genes via the virus-encoded RNA polymerases that are packaged in virions. However, this deficiency can be overcome if virus DNA is transfected into cells previously infected with a helper poxvirus, providing the necessary factors needed to transcribe, replicate, and package the transfected genome in trans (Sam C K, Dumbell K R. Expression of poxvirus DNA in coinfected cells and marker rescue of thermosensitive mutants by subgenomic fragments of DNA. Ann Virol (Inst Past). 1981; 132:135-50). Although this produces mixed viral progeny, the problem can be overcome by performing the reactivation reaction in a cell line that supports the propagation of both viruses, and then eliminating the helper virus by plating the mixture of viruses on cells that do not support the helper virus' growth (Scheiflinger F, Dorner F, Falkner F G. Construction of chimeric vaccinia viruses by molecular cloning and packaging. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 1992; 89(21):9977-81).</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">Previously, a method where the high-frequency recombination reactions catalyzed by a Leporipoxvirus, Shope fibroma virus (SFV), can be coupled with an SFV-catalyzed reactivation reaction, to rapidly assemble recombinant VACV strains using multiple overlapping fragments of viral DNA (Yao X D, Evans D H. High-frequency genetic recombination and reactivation of orthopoxviruses from DNA fragments transfected into leporipoxvirus-infected cells. Journal of Virology. 2003; 77(13):7281-90). For the first time, the reactivation and characterization of a functional poxvirus (synthetic chimeric horsepox virus [scHPXV]) using chemically synthesized, overlapping double-stranded DNA fragments is described. The principles can be analogously applied and extrapolated to other poxviruses, including but not limited to camelpox virus (CMLV), cowpox virus (CPXV), ectromelia virus (ECTV, &#x201c;mousepox agent&#x201d;), horsepox (HPXV), monkeypox virus (MPXV), rabbitpox virus (RPXV), raccoonpox virus, skunkpox virus, Taterapox virus, Uasin Gishu disease virus, vaccinia virus (VACV), and volepox virus (VPV).</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">It is further shown here that one embodiment of a synthetic chimeric poxvirus of the invention (e.g., a synthetic chimeric horsepox virus), can infect and immunize mice against a lethal VACV challenge and can do so without causing any disease during the initial immunization step.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Synthetic Chimeric Poxviruses of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0135" num="0134">The invention provides functional synthetic chimeric poxviruses (scPVs) that are initially replicated and assembled from chemically synthesized DNA.

An scPV of the invention may be based on the genome sequences of naturally occurring strains, variants or mutants, mutagenized viruses or genetically engineered viruses. The viral genome of an scPV of the invention comprises one or more modifications relative to the wild type genome or base genome sequence of said virus. The modifications may include one or more deletions, insertions, substitutions, or combinations thereof. It is understood that the modifications may be introduced in any number of ways commonly known in the art. The modified portions of the genome may be derived from chemically synthesized DNA, cDNA or genomic DNA.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">Chemical genome synthesis is particularly useful when a natural template is not available for genetic modification, amplification, or replication by conventional molecular biology methods. For example, a natural isolate of horsepox virus (HPXV) is not readily available to obtain template DNA but the genome sequence for HPXV (strain MNR-76) has been described. The HPXV genome sequence, however, is incomplete. The sequence of the terminal hairpin loops was not determined. In a surprising result, a functional synthetic chimeric HPXV (scHPXV) was generated by using terminal hairpin loops based on VACV telomeres in lieu of HPXV terminal hairpin loop sequences. In some embodiments, the poxvirus belongs to the Chordopoxvirinae subfamily. In some embodiments, the poxvirus belongs to a genus of Chordopoxvirinae subfamily selected from Avipoxvirus, Capripoxvirus, Cervidpoxvirus, Crocodylipoxvirus, Leporipoxvirus, Molluscipoxvirus, Orthopoxvirus, Parapoxvirus, Suipoxvirus, or Yatapoxvirus.

In some embodiments, the modifications may include the attenuation or deletion of one or more virulence factors. In some embodiments, the modifications may include the addition or insertion of one or more virulence regulatory genes or gene-encoding regulatory factors.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">Traditionally, the terminal hairpins of poxviruses have been difficult to clone and sequence, hence, it is not surprising that some of the published genome sequences (e.g., VACV, ACAM 2000 and HPXV MNR-76) are incomplete. The published sequence of the HPXV genome is likewise incomplete, probably missing &#x2dc;60 bp from the terminal ends. Thus, the HPXV hairpins cannot be precisely replicated and prior to this invention, it was not known whether HPXV could be replicated and assembled from polynucleotides based on only the known portion of the HPXV genome. Nor was it known that hairpins from one virus would be operable in another. In an exemplary embodiment, 129 nt ssDNA fragments were chemically synthesized using the published sequence of the VACV telomeres as a guide and ligated onto dsDNA fragments comprising left and right ends of the HPXV genome.

Briefly, overlapping DNA fragments that encompass all or substantially all of the viral genome of the scPV are chemically synthesized and transfected into helper virus-infected cells. The transfected cells are cultured to produce mixed viral progeny comprising the helper virus and reactivated scPV. Next, the mixed viral progeny are plated on host cells that do not support the growth of the helper virus but allow the synthetic chimeric poxvirus to grow, in order to eliminate the helper virus and recover the synthetic chimeric poxvirus. In some embodiments, the helper virus does not infect the host cells. In some embodiments, the helper virus can infect the host cells but grows poorly in the host cells. In some embodiments, the helper virus grows more slowly in the host cells compared to the scPV.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">In some embodiments, substantially all of the synthetic chimeric poxviral genome is derived from chemically synthesized DNA.

In some embodiments, the poxviral genome is derived from a combination of chemically synthesized DNA and naturally occurring DNA.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">The number of overlapping DNA fragments used in the methods of the invention will depend on the size of the poxviral genome. Practical considerations such as reduction in recombination efficiency as the number of fragments increases on the one hand, and difficulties in synthesizing very large DNA fragments as the number of fragments decreases on the other hand, will also inform the number of overlapping fragments used in the methods of the invention.

In some embodiments, the synthetic chimeric poxviral genome is assembled from 2-14 overlapping DNA fragments. In some embodiments, the synthetic chimeric poxviral genome is assembled from 4-12 overlapping DNA fragments.

See, e.g., Sambrook et al., 1989.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">Alternatively, PCR allows reproduction of DNA sequences. PCR technology is well known in the art and is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,195, 4,800,159, 4,754,065 and 4,683,202, as well as PCR: The Polymerase Chain Reaction, Mullis et al. eds., Birkauswer Press, Boston, 1994.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">RNA can be obtained by using the isolated DNA in an appropriate vector and inserting it into a suitable host cell. When the cell replicates and the DNA is transcribed into RNA, the RNA can then be isolated using methods well known to those of skill in the art, as set forth in Sambrook et al., 1989, supra, for example.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">In other embodiments, nucleic acids of the invention also include nucleotide sequences that hybridize under highly stringent conditions to the nucleotide sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 1-10, or 50-58, or sequences complementary thereto. One of ordinary skill in the art will readily understand that appropriate stringency conditions which promote DNA hybridization can be varied. For example, one could perform the hybridization at 6.0&#xd7; sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC) at about 45&#xb0; C., followed by a wash of 2.0&#xd7;SSC at 50&#xb0; C. For example, the salt concentration in the wash step can be selected from a low stringency of about 2.0&#xd7;SSC at 50&#xb0; C. to a high stringency of about 0.2&#xd7;SSC at 50&#xb0; C. In addition, the temperature in the wash step can be increased from low stringency conditions at room temperature, about 22&#xb0; C., to high stringency conditions at about 65&#xb0; C. Both temperature and salt may be varied, or temperature or salt concentration may be held constant while the other variable is changed. In one embodiment, the invention provides nucleic acids which hybridize under low stringency conditions of 6&#xd7;SSC at room temperature followed by a wash at 2&#xd7;SSC at room temperature.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">Isolated nucleic acids which differ due to degeneracy in the genetic code are also within the scope of the invention. For example, a number of amino acids are designated by more than one triplet. Codons that specify the same amino acid, or synonyms (for example, CAU and CAC are synonyms for histidine) may result in &#x201c;silent&#x201d; mutations which do not affect the amino acid sequence of the protein. One skilled in the art will appreciate that these variations in one or more nucleotides (up to about 3-5% of the nucleotides) of the nucleic acids encoding a particular protein may exist among members of a given species due to natural allelic variation. Any and all such nucleotide variations and resulting amino acid polymorphisms are within the scope of this invention.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">The present invention further provides recombinant cloning vectors and expression vectors that are useful in cloning a polynucleotide of the present invention.

Such a coding sequence is preferably in operative association with the regulatory element coding sequences, as described above. Reporter genes that are useful in the invention are well-known in the art and include those encoding green fluorescent protein, luciferase, xylE, and tyrosinase, among others. Nucleotide sequences encoding selectable markers are well known in the art, and include those that encode gene products conferring resistance to antibiotics or anti-metabolites, or that supply an auxotrophic requirement. Examples of such sequences include those that encode resistance to ampicillin, erythromycin, thiostrepton or kanamycin, among many others.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">The vectors containing the polynucleotides of interest and/or the polynucleotides themselves, can be introduced into the host cell by any of a number of appropriate means, including electroporation, transfection employing calcium chloride, rubidium chloride, calcium phosphate, DEAE-dextran, or other substances; microprojectile bombardment; lipofection; and infection (e.g., where the vector is an infectious agent such as vaccinia virus).

Genome of horsepox virus. Journal of Virology. 2006; 80(18):9244-58). The 212,633 bp genome is divided into 10 overlapping fragments (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>). These fragments were designed so that they shared at least 1.0 kbp of overlapping sequence (i.e. homology) with each adjacent fragment, to provide sites where homologous recombination will drive the assembly of full-length genomes (Table 1). These overlapping sequences will provide sufficient homology to accurately carry out recombination between the co-transfected fragments (Yao X D, Evans D H. High-frequency genetic recombination and reactivation of orthopoxviruses from DNA fragments transfected into leporipoxvirus-infected cells. Journal of Virology. 2003; 77(13):7281-90). It is possible that shorter or longer overlaps will serve a similar purpose. The terminal 40 bp from the HPXV genome sequence (5&#x2032;-TTTATTAAATTTTACTATTTATTTAGTGTCTAGAAAAAAA-3&#x2032;) (SEQ ID NO: 59) is not included in the synthesized inverted terminal repeat (ITR) fragments. Instead, a SapI restriction site is added at the 5&#x2032;-terminus (GA LITR) and 3&#x2032;-terminus (GA_RITR) of the ITR fragments followed by a TGT sequence. These SapI restriction sites are used to ligate the VACV terminal hairpins onto the ITR fragments (described below).</p><p id="p-0203" num="0202">Each fragment is chemically synthesized and subcloned into a plasmid using terminal SfiI restriction sites on each fragment. To assist with sub-cloning these fragments, AarI and BsaI restriction sites are silently mutated in all the fragments, except for the two ITR-encoding fragments (Table 2). The BsaI restriction sites in the two ITR-encoding fragments are not mutated, in case these regions contain nucleotide sequence-specific recognition sites that are important for efficient DNA replication and concatamer resolution.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0203">A yfp/gpt cassette under the control of a poxvirus early late promoter is introduced into the HPXV095/J2R locus within GA_Fragment_3) so that reactivation of HPXV (scHPXV YFP-gpt::095) will be easy to visualize under a fluorescence microscope. The gpt locus also provides a potential tool for selecting reactivated viruses using drug selection. HPXV095 encodes the HPXV homolog of the non-essential VACV J2R gene and by co-transfecting Fragment_3 and other HPXV clones into SFV-infected BGMK cells, along with VACV DNA, a variety of hybrid viruses are recovered, validating the selection strategy (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B</figref>).

All of the BsaI and AarI sites in every fragment except the ITRs are mutated, in case sequence-specific sites within this region are unknowingly required for efficient genome replication and concatamer resolution. As described above, to facilitate the addition of the terminal hairpin loop structures from VACV onto the end of the ITRs, a SapI recognition site is included next to the left- and right-terminal end of both LITR and RITR fragments, respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). These SapI sites are embedded within the flanking vector sequences, and the SapI enzyme cuts downstream of the site, outside of the recognition sequence and in the HPXV DNA. Thus when DNA is cut with SapI, it leaves sticky ends within the DNA copied from the HPXV sequence and thus permits the assembly of a precise sequence copy (through a subsequent ligation), containing no extraneous restriction sites. The other ends of the LITR and RITR fragments (the internal ends with respect to the genome map) are each bounded by SfiI recognition sites, as are both ends of the remaining HPXV fragments. All of these DNAs are supplied in a plasmid form for easy propagation. To prepare the internal fragments for transfection into SFV-infected cells, these plasmids are digested with SfiI to release the plasmid from each scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 fragment (see below for how the LITR and RITR fragments are processed). Following digestion, each reaction is purified to remove any contaminating enzyme, but the plasmid is not removed from the digestion and is co-transfected alongside each scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 fragment. This does not interfere with the reaction and is done to minimize the amount of DNA manipulation and possible fragmentation of these large DNA fragments.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0208">While the reaction efficiency may be affected by the number of transfected fragments, greater than or less than 10 overlapping fragments may be used in the methods of the invention. Without being bound by theory, &#x2dc;15 fragments may represent a practical upper limit without further optimization of the reactivation reaction. The ideal lower limit would be a single genome fragment, but in practice the telomeres are most easily manipulated as more modest-sized fragments (e.g., &#x2dc;10 kb).</p><heading id="h-0020" level="1">Example 2.

The two strands of the duplex genome are connected by hairpin loops to form a covalently continuous polynucleotide chain. The loops are A+T-rich, cannot form a completely base-paired structure, and exist in two forms that are inverted and complementary in sequence (Baroudy B M, Venkatesan S, Moss B). Incompletely base-paired flip-flop terminal loops link the two DNA strands of the vaccinia virus genome into one uninterrupted polynucleotide chain. Cell. 1982; 28(2):315-24) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). They are called slow [S] and fast [F] forms based upon their electrophoretic properties and probably fold into partially duplex hairpin structures that cap the ends of the linear dsDNA genome (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>). The published sequence of the HPXV genome is incomplete, probably missing &#x2dc;60 bp from the terminal ends, making it impossible to precisely replicate the HPXV hairpins. Instead, 157 nt ssDNA fragments were chemically synthesized using the published sequence of the VACV telomeres as a guide and leaving a 5&#x2032; overhang comprised of three nucleotides at the end of each hairpin (5&#x2032;-ACA; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>) (Baroudy B M, Venkatesan S, Moss B). Incompletely base-paired flip-flop terminal loops link the two DNA strands of the vaccinia virus genome into one uninterrupted polynucleotide chain. Cell. 1982; 28(2):315-24). This overhang is complementary to the ends generated by cutting cloned LITR and RITR fragments with SapI.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0213">Sequences derived from VACV are used based upon data suggesting a close common ancestry between HPXV and VACV. It may be possible to use other terminal hairpins from other poxviruses since there are sequence features that are commonly conserved between the hairpin ends of different Chordopoxviruses. For example, the resolution sites in the hairpin ends are highly conserved in both sequence and functionality (they resemble late promoters).</p><p id="p-0219" num="0214">These single-stranded oligonucleotides are heated to 95&#xb0; C. and then quickly chilled on ice to form the incompletely base-paired terminal hairpin (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>). Next, each oligonucleotide is phosphorylated and ligated separately at 20-fold molar excess with either the left or right ITR fragment previously digested with both SapI and SfiI. Digestion of the ITRs with these enzymes results in a 5&#x2032;-TGT overhang at the 5&#x2032; termini of each ITR, which was complementary to the 5&#x2032;-ACA overhang in the terminal hairpin loop structure. This produces a hairpin-terminated copy of each ITR.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0215">To confirm that a hairpin-terminated structure is added to both ITR fragments, restriction digestion of the ITR fragments with PvuII is performed. Since it is impossible to visualize the addition of a &#x2dc;70 bp terminal hairpin onto the terminus of a &#x2dc;10 kb ITR by gel electrophoresis, a small amount of each ligation is digested with PvuII. If no terminal hairpin is ligated to the ITR, then digestion with PvuII results in a 1472 bp product (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>, lanes 2 and 5). If, however, the terminal hairpin loop is successfully added to the HPXV ITRs, then an increase in the size of the ITR fragment is seen on an agarose gel (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, compare lane 2 with 3 and 4; compare lane 5 with 6 and 7). These data suggest that under these conditions almost all of the HPXV ITRs contain terminal hairpin loops at one end of the fragment.</p><heading id="h-0023" level="1">Example 3.

Cells are infected with Shope Fibroma Virus (SFV) in serum-free MEM at a MOI of 0.5 for 1 h at 37&#xb0; C. The inoculum is replaced with 3 ml of warmed MEM containing 5% FCS and returned to the incubator for an additional hour. Meanwhile, transfection reactions are set up as follows. Lipofectamine complexes are prepared by mixing approximately 5 &#x3bc;g total synthetic HPXV DNA fragments in 1 ml OPTI-MEM&#xae; with Lipofectamine2000 diluted in 1 ml OPTI-MEM&#xae; at a ratio of 3:1 (Lipofectamine2000 to total DNA). A sample calculation to determine the relative amount of each HPXV fragment is shown in Table 4. The complexes are incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes and then added dropwise to the BGMK cells previously infected with SFV. Approximately 16 h post infection, the media is replaced with fresh MEM containing 5% FCS. The cells are cultured for an additional 4 d (total of 5 d) at 37&#xb0; C. Virus particles were recovered by scraping the infected cells into the cell culture medium and performing three cycles of freezing and thawing. The crude extract is diluted 10<sup>&#x2212;2 </sup>in serum-free MEM and 4 ml of the inoculum is plated on 9-16 150 mm tissue culture plates of BSC-40 cells to recover reactivated scHPXV YFP-gpt::095. One hour post infection, the inoculum is replaced with MEM containing 5% FCS and 0.9% Noble Agar. Yellow fluorescent plaques are visualized under an inverted microscope and individual plaques are picked for further analysis.

High-frequency genetic recombination and reactivation of orthopoxviruses from DNA fragments transfected into leporipoxvirus-infected cells. Journal of Virology. 2003; 77(13):7281-90; and Yao X D, Evans D H. Construction of recombinant vaccinia viruses using leporipoxvirus-catalyzed recombination and reactivation of orthopoxvirus DNA. Methods Mol Biol. 2004; 269:51-64). Several biological features make this an attractive model system. First, SFV has a narrow host range, productively infecting rabbit cells and certain monkey cell lines, like BGMK. It can infect, but grows very poorly on cells like BSC-40. Second, it grows more slowly compared to Orthopoxviruses, taking approximately 4-5 days to form transformed &#x201c;foci&#x201d; in monolayers of cells, a characteristic that is very different from Orthopoxviruses, which produce plaques within 1-2 days in culture. This difference in growth between Leporipoxviruses and Orthopoxviruses allows one to differentiate these viruses by performing the reactivation assays in BGMK cells and plating the progeny on BSC-40 cells. In some embodiments, other helper viruses (such as but not limited to fowlpox virus) may be used. In some embodiments, different cell combinations may be used.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0219">BGMK cells are infected with SFV at a MOI of 0.5 and then transfected with 5 &#x3bc;g of digested GA HPXV fragments (Table 4) 2 h later. Five days post transfection all of the infectious particles are recovered by cell lysis and re-plated on BSC-40 cells, which only efficiently support growth of HPXV (or other Orthopoxviruses). The resulting reactivated scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 plaques are visualized under a fluorescence microscope. The visualization is enabled by the yfp/gpt selectable marker in the HPXV095/J2R locus within Frag_3 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). Virus plaques are detected in BSC-40 monolayers within 48 h of transfection. The efficiency of recovering scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 is dependent on a number of factors, including DNA transfection efficiency, but ranges up to a few PFU/&#x3bc;g of DNA transfected.</p><heading id="h-0027" level="1">Example 4.

Genomic scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 DNA is isolated from BSC-40 cells infected with scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 and used as a template. Genomic DNA from VACV-infected BSC-40 cells is used as a control to confirm the presence of BsaI sites within each PCR product. Following PCR amplification, reactions are subsequently digested with BsaI for 1 h at 37&#xb0; C. PCR reactions are separated on a 1% agarose gel containing SYBR&#xae; safe stain to visualize DNA bands.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0222">Further analysis of scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 genomes by restriction digestion followed by pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) is carried out on genomic DNA isolated using sucrose gradient purification (Yao X D, Evans D H. Construction of recombinant vaccinia viruses using leporipoxvirus-catalyzed recombination and reactivation of orthopoxvirus DNA. Methods Mol Biol. 2004; 269:51-64). Briefly, 100 ng of purified viral genomic DNA is digested with 5 U of BsaI or HindIII for 2 h at 37&#xb0; C. Digested DNA is run on a 1% Seakem Gold agarose gel cast and run in 0.5&#xd7; tris-borate-EDTA electrophoresis (TBE) buffer [110 mM tris; 90 mM borate; 2.5 mM EDTA]. The DNA is resolved on a CHEF DR-III apparatus (BioRad) at 5.7V/cm for 9.5 h at 14&#xb0; C., using a switching time gradient of 1 to 10 s, a linear ramping factor, and a 120&#xb0; angle. This program allows resolution of DNA species from 1 kbp to &#x3e;200 kbp. To resolve fragments from 75 bp to 5 kbp, electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gel cast and run in 1.0&#xd7;TBE at 115V for 2 h at room temperature is carried out. The DNA is visualized with SYBR&#xae; gold stain.

isolated from plaques grown from the reactivation assay is confirmed by PCR, restriction digestion, and whole genome sequencing. The PCR analysis is based on the mutated BsaI sites within all but the ITR HPXV fragments. Primer sets are designed to flank each BsaI site in scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 (Table 5). It is confirmed that these primer sets would also amplify a similar region within VACV WR. After PCR amplification of an approximate 1 kb region surrounding these mutated BsaI sites within scHPXV YFP-gpt::095, each reaction is digested with BsaI and the resulting DNA fragments are analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Since no BsaI sites are mutated in VACV (wt), enzymatic digestion successfully digests each PCR product, resulting in a smaller DNA fragment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, VACV). The PCR products generated from scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 genomic DNA are resistant to BsaI digestion, suggesting that the BsaI recognition site is successfully mutated in these genomes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 (PP1) and scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 (PP3)). The primer products for primer set 7C did not result in any amplification of DNA in the scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 PP1 and PP3 samples. To confirm whether this primer set was non-functional or if this area of Fragment 7 did not get assembled into the resulting scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 genome, PCR was performed on the original GA_Frag_7 plasmid DNA and this reaction was also unsuccessful in amplifying a product.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0224">Genomic DNA is next isolated from sucrose-gradient purified scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 genomes, digested with BsaI or HindIII, and separated by agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm that the majority of the BsaI sites in scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 are successfully mutated. Interestingly, undigested genomic DNA from 3 different scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 clones run noticeably slower on a gel compared to VACV, confirming that the genome of scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 (213,305 bp) is larger than VACV-WR (194,711 bp) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, compare lanes 2-4 with lane 5). The scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 clones are resistant to BsaI digestion, resulting in one large DNA fragment (&#x2dc;198000 bp) and a smaller DNA fragment at around 4000 bp after separation by PFGE (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, lane 7-9). This is in contrast to the VACV-WR genome, which when digested with BsaI, leads to a number of DNA fragments being separated on the gel (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, lane 10). Since the expected DNA sizes following digestion of scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 genome with BsaI are relatively small (Table 6), these digestion products are separated by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis and it is confirmed that the scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 generates the appropriate-sized fragments (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>, lanes 2-4). It is also confirmed that scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 produces the correct size of DNA fragments following HindIII digestion, suggesting that these recognitions are maintained during synthesis of the large DNA fragments (Table 6; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, lanes 12-14; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>, lanes 6-8). Overall, in vitro analysis of the scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 genome suggests that reactivation of HPXV from chemically synthesized DNA fragments is successful.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00006" num="00006"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 6</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Expected sizes of scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 DNA </entry></row><row><entry>fragments digested with either BsaI or HindIII.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="91pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>scHPXV YFP-</entry><entry>scHPXV YFP-</entry></row><row><entry>Fragment</entry><entry>gpt::095 digested</entry><entry>gpt::095 digested</entry></row><row><entry>#</entry><entry>with BsaI (bp)</entry><entry>with HindIII (bp)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="70pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="91pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>1</entry><entry>198,833</entry><entry>53,822</entry></row><row><entry>2</entry><entry>4046</entry><entry>24,848</entry></row><row><entry>3</entry><entry>4046</entry><entry>19,283</entry></row><row><entry>4</entry><entry>968</entry><entry>16,056</entry></row><row><entry>5</entry><entry>968</entry><entry>15,176</entry></row><row><entry>6</entry><entry>778</entry><entry>13,836</entry></row><row><entry>7</entry><entry>778</entry><entry>13,558</entry></row><row><entry>8</entry><entry>767</entry><entry>12,679</entry></row><row><entry>9</entry><entry>767</entry><entry>8877</entry></row><row><entry>10</entry><entry>391</entry><entry>8637</entry></row><row><entry>11</entry><entry>391</entry><entry>6493</entry></row><row><entry>12</entry><entry>138</entry><entry>5803</entry></row><row><entry>13</entry><entry>138</entry><entry>4631</entry></row><row><entry>14</entry><entry>64</entry><entry>4115</entry></row><row><entry>15</entry><entry>60</entry><entry>2216</entry></row><row><entry>16</entry><entry>54</entry><entry>1560</entry></row><row><entry>17</entry><entry>54</entry><entry>1442</entry></row><row><entry>18</entry><entry>32</entry><entry>273</entry></row><row><entry>19</entry><entry>32</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0234" num="0225">Since HPXV095 encodes the HPXV homolog of the non-essential VACV J2R gene, by co-transfecting Fragment_3 and other HPXV clones into SFV-infected BGMK cells, along with VACV DNA, a variety of hybrid viruses are recovered, validating the selection strategy (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B</figref>).

Clones 1-3 are obtained by purifying the DNA from this first hybrid genome and transfecting it again, along with HPXV fragments 2, 4, 5, and 7, into SFV-infected cells. PCR primers were designed to target both HPXV and VACV (Table 5) are used to amplify DNA segments spanning the BsaI sites that are mutated in the scHPXV clones. Following PCR amplification, the products are digested with BsaI to differentiate VACV sequences (which cut) from HPXV (which do not cut). The VACV/HPXV hybrids exhibit a mix of BsaI sensitive and resistant sites whereas the reactivated scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 clone is fully BsaI resistant.</p><heading id="h-0030" level="1">Example 5.

The sequence reads are mapped onto the wild-type HPXV (DQ792504) and scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 reference sequences to confirm the presence of specific modifications in the scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 genome. To confirm that the VACV terminal repeat sequences are correctly ligated onto the terminal end of the left ITR, sequencing reads in this area of the genome are analyzed. A string of Cs is added to the beginning of the scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 genome reference sequence to capture all of the sequence reads that mapped in this region. This is done because the program used to assemble the sequence reads will otherwise truncate the display of sequences at the point where the scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 genome reference sequence ends.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0229">It is clear from the mapped reads that although the SapI recognition site is present in the scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 reference genome, all of the sequencing reads lack this sequence. This confirms that the approach described herein produces an authentic HPXV sequence at the site where the synthetic hairpin was ligated to the ends of the ITRs. The complete sequence of the VACV WR terminal hairpin loop is also successfully obtained, which proves to be identical to the sequence of the synthetic ssDNA that is ligated onto the TIR ends. Overall, these data suggest that the VACV-WR terminal hairpin loops are successfully ligated onto the HPXV ITR sequences and recovered in the infectious viruses. Moreover, the 1:1 distribution of F- and S-reads in each of five viruses suggested that both ends are required to produce a virus.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0230">Next, it is verified that each nucleotide substitution to silently mutate the BsaI sites has correctly been incorporated into the scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 genome. Sequencing reads are mapped to the HPXV (DQ792504) reference sequence. The overall ILLUMINA&#xae; sequencing read covers scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 from region 96,050 to 96,500. There are two conflicts in this region that do not align correctly with reference HPXV. Upon magnification of these regions it is clear that at position 96,239 there is a T to C substitution and at position 96,437 there is an A to G substitution in the scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 genome. It was verified that all of the nucleotide substitutions that are introduced in order to mutate the selected BsaI and AarI recognition sites are created in the scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 genome (Table 2).</p><p id="p-0240" num="0231">Finally, it is determined that the nucleotide substitutions in HPXV044, designed to create unique restriction sites in GA_Frag_2, are also incorporated into the scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 genome. The sequencing reads that map to HPXV044 (region 44,400 to 45,100). Within this region there are two regions where the sequencing reads conflict with that of the sequence in the HPXV YFP-gpt::095 reference sequence. Upon magnification of these regions, it is clear that two T to G substitutions are introduced into the non-coding strand of HPXV044 at positions 44,512 and 45,061, thus creating AvaI and StuI restriction sites in Frag_2. Overall, the sequencing data corroborates the in vitro genomic analysis data and confirms that scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 is successfully reactivated in SFV-infected cells.</p><heading id="h-0035" level="1">Example 6.

Since a natural HPXV isolate is unavailable, the growth of scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 is compared to the prototypic poxvirus, VACV (strain WR), Cowpox virus (CPX), a poxvirus that is closely related to HPXV and a clone of Dryvax virus, DPP15. Monkey kidney epithelial cells (BSC-40), Vero cells, a human carcinoma cell line (HeLa), and primary human fibroblasts cells (HEL) are infected with VACV WR, CPX, DPP15, or scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 at a low MOI and infected cells are harvested over a 72 h time course. In BSC-40 cells, the rate of virus replication and spread is comparable among all viruses tested (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>). Importantly, scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 replicates as well as any of the other poxviruses tested. The virus grew to somewhat lower titers on HEL cells and Vero cells, and least well on HeLa cells.

A statistically significant decrease in plaque size of scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 compared to VACV WR and even cowpox virus (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>) is observed. Interestingly, in BSC-40 cells, scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 produces the smallest plaques when compared to all other Orthopoxviruses tested (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>). Also, while different VACV strains produce extracellular viruses that form smaller secondary plaques, these are not produced by scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>). Overall, these data suggest that reactivation of scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 using the system described herein does not introduce any obvious defects in virus replication and spread in vitro when compared to other Orthopoxviruses. Moreover, the plaque size of scHPXV YFP-gpt::095 is similar to that of cowpox virus (CPXV), suggesting that synthetic virus reactivation does not have any deleterious effects on the small plaque phenotype that has previously been observed with other HPXV-like clones (Medaglia M L, Moussatche N, Nitsche A, Dabrowski P W, Li Y, Damon I K, et al.

Thirty days post virus inoculation, mice are subsequently challenged with a lethal dose of VACV-WR (10<sup>6 </sup>PFU/dose) via intranasal inoculation. Mice are closely monitored for signs of infection as described above. Mice are weighed daily and mice that lose greater than 25% of their body weight in addition to other morbidity factors are subjected to euthanasia. We expect that mice inoculated with PBS prior to administration of a lethal dose of VACV-WR show signs of significant weight loss and other morbidity factors within 7-10 days post inoculation. Approximately 14 days post lethal challenge with VACV-WR all mice are euthanized and blood is collected to confirm the presence of VACV-specific neutralizing antibodies in the serum by standard plaque reduction assays.</p><heading id="h-0042" level="1">Example 11.

Briefly, through DNA synthesis a 5&#x2032; overhang comprised of three nucleotides is left at the end of each hairpin (5&#x2032;-ACA; as described in Examples 1 and 2). Meanwhile, the plasmid clones encoding the left and right VACV ITR fragments are designed to encode a SapI recognition site located immediately adjacent to the first nucleotide encoding the start of the VACV genome. Digesting the ITR clone with SapI creates a three base overhang (5&#x2032;-TGT), complementary to the 5&#x2032;-ACA overhang in the terminal hairpin loop structure. The left or right ITR fragments is mixed with a &#x2dc;20-fold molar excess of the terminal loops and ligated.

As described previously, the SFV helper virus will catalyze the recombination between fragments sharing flanking homologous sequences, resulting in the creation of full-length VACV genomes that can be packaged and released from the cell. It is unlikely that hybrid viruses will be produced in this assay. After 4 days, the BGMK cells are harvested and reactivated VACV virus particles are released by freeze-thaw, followed by plating on the susceptible BSC-40 cells. The reactivated VACV (ACAM2000) plaques are the only viruses to form plaques on BSC-40 cells. Plaques are picked to produce clonal virus stocks followed by isolation of genomic DNA to be sequenced by nextGen ILLUMINA&#xae; sequencing to confirm the integrity of the recovered viruses and identify whether scACAM2000 is successfully reactivated.</p><heading id="h-0044" level="1">Example 12.
