If such information is not secured well enough, it might be used by any intruder to notice their daily activities and eventually can be utilized to harm them through various means.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Privacy in 5G networks will be crucial because it will bring huge transformation in terms of new daily life applications and access modes of digital services. Also, 5G will bring new enhancements in terms of architectural and service-oriented requirements as compared to traditional mobile networks (3G, 4G), so it will require strong privacy policies and regulations. 5G privacy will be vital for whole eco-systems including users and various other stakeholders. Therefore, to have complete public acceptance and adoption of the 5G network, it is mandatory that privacy issues are well addressed. User privacy of 5G mobile network can be divided into three main categories: data, location and identity privacy.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Data privacy represents the confidentiality and privacy of stored data. As the advancement towards 5G mobile networks is rapid and concrete, consumers will be giving more preference to mobile networks as compared with traditional internet-based services.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Consequently, 5G mobile networks are expected to have high data speed and low latency, which eventually result into huge volume of data. For example, lawful interception generates sensitive user data and thus require data protections while storing and utilizing that data.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Location Privacy: With the advent of 5G technology, location based services (LBS) are getting more important as users can access useful services based on knowing the location information. Also, nowadays, several LI features possess the capabilities of monitoring, based on location-based services. However, along with such kind of services, users would be continuously tracked by various actors through their personal gadgets or devices embedded in the environment and that could cause serious concerns to user's privacy.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Identity privacy refers to protecting the identity information of the subscriber and the device/user equipment (UE). With 5G and internet-of-things (IoT), it is expected that billions of devices will be connected to the internet. In such digitalization, every entity (user or device) would be categorized by some identity to access or deliver required services. Using identities, services and personal information can be accessed. Thus, it is important to have secure and efficient identity management mechanism in 5G networks.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, the integration of new technologies such as software defined network (SDN), network function virtualization (NFV) and cloud computing concepts into 5G networks will open numerous new privacy challenges. In 5G, various heterogeneous service providers and operators will store and use personal data of consumers with or without their permission. There will be different stakeholders involved in the whole 5G LI eco-system for providing different services. Hence, the personal data of an increasing number of users will go through the hands of multiple actors also in an LI process, even if they are not the direct targets of interceptions, but they represent the other party of a communication.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">3GPP (3<sup>rd </sup>Generation Partnership Project) TS 33.127 V15.2.0 discloses the LI architecture and functions in a 3GPP network.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In view of the above, an object of the present disclosure is to overcome drawbacks related to user privacy in the context of LI. This object is achieved in a first aspect by a method of managing LI information in a telecommunication network.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The method of the first aspect comprises determining that an identity of a non-target communicating entity, with which a target communicating entity is communicating, is to be obfuscated in a report of LI of the target communicating entity to a law enforcement agency (LEA). For example, such a determination may comprise determining that the identity of the non-target communicating entity is to be obfuscated only in reports of IRI. Lawful interception of the target communicating entity is performed and information pertaining to the performed LI of the target communicating entity is reported to the LEA. The reported information comprises non-obfuscated identity information of the target communicating entity and obfuscated identity information of the non-target communicating entity.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">That is, drawbacks of prior art are overcome in that the LEA is prevented from obtaining information about communicating entities, e.g. subscribers, that are not targets of LI and thereby protecting the privacy of these non-target communicating entities. As privacy compliance has become a prevalent business concern due to an increasing number of regulations designed to protect unauthorized access to personally identifiable information, such a method enables, e.g., a communication services provider to reduce costs related to security and cases of disputes with users that are not under lawful interception. Such advantages will be accentuated, e.g., in the context of monitoring of devices associated with the concept of internet of things (IoT). That is, methods as disclosed herein will facilitate monitoring of only specific sensitive devices, but the persons not being appointed targets of interception will be protected in their privacy.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the method comprises receiving by an LI ADMF, from the LEA via an LI_HI1 interface, a LITaskObject comprising a data field configured to indicate whether or not identity information of the non-target communicating entity is to be obfuscated in a report of LI of the target communicating entity to the LEA. This data field comprises an indication that identity information of the non-target communicating entity is to be obfuscated. The LITaskObject comprises a DeliveryType data field that indicates that only IRI is to be subject of LI. A Mediation and Delivery Function 2 (MDF2) receives, from the ADMF via an LI_X1 interface, TaskDetails comprising a data field configured to indicate whether or not identity information of the non-target communicating entity is to be obfuscated, the data field comprising an indication that identity information of the non-target communicating entity is to be obfuscated. The MDF2 receives, from a POI via an LI_X2 interface, event data comprising information pertaining to the performed LI of the target communicating entity. The MDF2 then transmits, to a LEMF via an LI_HI2 interface, a report that comprises information pertaining to LI of the target communicating entity and in which report the identity information of the non-target communicating entity is obfuscated.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some of these embodiments, the transmission of the report comprises omitting at least part of the identity information of the non-target communicating entity. Moreover, in some embodiments, the MDF2 performs hashing of at least part of the identity information of the non-target communicating entity and then the transmission of the report comprises transmitting the hashed identity information of the non-target communicating entity.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In other embodiments, the method comprises receiving by a LI ADMF from the LEA via an LI_HI1 interface, a LITaskObject comprising a data field configured to indicate whether or not identity information of the non-target communicating entity is to be obfuscated in a report of LI of the target communicating entity to the LEA. This data field comprises an indication that identity information of the non-target communicating entity is to be obfuscated. The LITaskObject comprises a DeliveryType data field that indicates that only IRI is to be subject of LI. A POI receives, from the ADMF via an LI_X1 interface, TaskDetails comprising a data field configured to indicate whether or not identity information of the non-target communicating entity is to be obfuscated, the data field comprising an indication that identity information of the non-target communicating entity is to be obfuscated. The POI transmits, to a MDF2 via an LI_X2 interface, event data comprising information pertaining to LI of the target communicating entity and comprising obfuscated identity information of the non-target communicating entity. The MDF2 then transmits, to a LEMF via an LI_HI2 interface, a report that comprises information pertaining to LI of the target communicating entity and in which report the identity information of the non-target communicating entity is obfuscated.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some of these embodiments, the transmission of the event data comprises omitting at least part of the identity information of the non-target communicating entity. Moreover, in some embodiments, the POI performs hashing of at least part of the identity information of the non-target communicating entity, and then the transmission of the event data comprises transmitting the hashed identity information of the non-target communicating entity.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a further aspect there is provided a computer system comprising a plurality (i.e. at least two) of server blades, each server blade comprising a processor and a memory. The memory contains instructions executable by the processor whereby the computer system is operative to perform a method as summarized above in connection with the first aspect.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In yet a further aspect there are provided a computer program comprising instructions which, when executed on at least one processor cause a processor to carry out a method according to any of the aspects as summarized above. In yet a further aspect there is provided a carrier comprising such a computer program, wherein the carrier is one of an electronic signal, an optical signal, a radio signal and a computer readable storage medium.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">These further aspects and embodiments of these further aspects provide the same effects and advantages as summarized above in connection with the method of the first aspect.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i></figref>are schematically illustrated block diagrams of LI systems,</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i></figref>are flowcharts of methods,</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a signaling diagram illustrating a method,</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> schematically illustrates a computer system, and</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> schematically illustrates a computer system.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>schematically illustrates a first functional representation of a telecommunication network <b>100</b> comprising a core network <b>105</b> and an access network <b>103</b> in which two communicating entities, a target communicating entity <b>101</b> and a non-target communicating entity <b>102</b> are connected.

The LICF <b>141</b> contains a master record of all sensitive information and LI configuration data. The LICF <b>141</b> is ultimately responsible for all decisions within the overall LI system. The LICF <b>141</b>, via the LIPF <b>142</b> acting as its proxy, is responsible for auditing other LI components (POIs, MDFs etc.). The LICF <b>141</b> is responsible for communication with the LEA <b>131</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The LICF <b>141</b> provides intercept information derived from the warrant for provisioning at the CC-POI <b>145</b> and IRI-POI <b>146</b>, CC-TF <b>143</b> and IRI-TF <b>144</b>, MDF2 <b>133</b> and MDF3 <b>134</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Except for the communication with the LEA <b>131</b>, all other communication between the LICF <b>141</b> and any other entities is proxied by the LIPF <b>142</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The LICF <b>141</b> also maintains and authorizes a master list of POIs, TFs and MDFs.

The role of the LIPF <b>142</b> varies depending on implementation of network functions and of the ADMF <b>108</b> itself (e.g. virtual or non-virtual). In its simplest form, the LIPF <b>142</b> is the secure proxy used by the LICF <b>141</b> to communicate with POIs, TFs, MDFs, e.g. the CC-POI <b>145</b> and IRI-POI <b>146</b>, CC-TF <b>143</b> and IRI-TF <b>144</b>, MDF2 <b>133</b> and MDF3 <b>134</b> or other infrastructure required to operate LI within the telecommunication network <b>100</b>.

The MDF <b>132</b> (including the MDF2 <b>133</b>) converts the intercepted traffic into the required standard format and provides it (by modified LI-HI2) to a collection function running at the LEMF <b>136</b>.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0195">It is to be noted that hashing is a procedure of using an algorithm to map data of any size to a fixed length. This is called a hash value (or sometimes hash code or hash sums). Whereas encryption is a two-way function, hashing is a one-way function. While it's technically possible to reverse hash something, the computing power required makes it unfeasible. Hashing is one-way. As the skilled person will realize, the specific hashing algorithm used in action <b>226</b> and action <b>244</b> may be left to an implementor of the present disclosure. For example, any algorithms of the so-called secure hashing algorithm 2 (SHA-2) family or secure hashing algorithm 3 (SHA-3) family may be utilized in actions <b>226</b> and <b>244</b>.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0196">In the context of the present disclosure, hash values are useful in troubleshooting because they will be different for different non-target identities. This allows a troubleshooter to distinguish IRIs that are related to different communications from duplicated records (a situation that can happen in the field).</p><p id="p-0155" num="0197">Moreover, hash values can provide useful statistics to the LEA <b>131</b> without revealing the identity of the non-target communicating entity <b>102</b>. For example, the LEA <b>131</b> will know if the target communicating entity <b>101</b> calls the same number, a small group of numbers or many numbers. This can be important to the investigation.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0198">If the same salt is used in calculating the hash value for two interceptions, the LEMF <b>136</b> can compare the hashes across interceptions. For example, this would allow the LEMF <b>136</b> to know that two different target communicating entities called the same number, albeit the LEMF <b>136</b> will not know what number. This is also rather important to establish connections between different investigations.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0199">If the hashing algorithm and salt is disclosed (assuming the applicable regulation allows) it can be used to exclude some suspect (the hashing cannot be reversed but it is possible to hash a given telephone number and verify whether such a number was involved in previous calls). The same mechanism can be useful when a new target communicating entity <b>101</b> is added to an investigation. Then the LEMF <b>136</b> can calculate the hash of the new suspect and check whether it was involved in already intercepted calls.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0200">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, and with continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, a computer system <b>400</b> will be described in some detail.
