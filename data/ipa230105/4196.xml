Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to a multi-shaft pivot shaft device, and more particularly to a multi-shaft pivot shaft device including an assembled section and a fixed section. A drive unit (or transmission module and linking module) and a reaction module are disposed between the assembled section and the fixed section so as to achieve a complex moving effect of displacement and rotation (or angle adjustment) and enlarge the distance between the assembled section and the fixed section.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">There are various electronic apparatuses provided with covers or display screens, such as mobile phones, notebooks, PDA and electronic books. The covers or display screens are pivotally mounted on the electronic apparatuses via pivot pins or rotary shafts, whereby the covers or the display screens can be freely rotated and opened/closed under external force. For example, Taiwanese Patent No. 97222022 discloses a rotary shaft structure and Taiwanese Patent No. 98207366 discloses a pivot pin structure.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order to operate the display module (such as the screen) and/or the apparatus body module of the electronic apparatus in more operation modes to widen the application range thereof, a conventional multi-shaft mechanism mounted between the display module and the apparatus body module has been developed to rotate the display module and/or the apparatus body module by different angles in accordance with different operation modes. For example, Taiwanese Patent No. 99211350 discloses a dual-shaft hinge device, U.S. Pat. No. 7,512,426 B2 discloses a mobile communications device with synchronizing hinge, Taiwanese Patent No. 109203175 discloses a radial rotary shaft structure and Taiwanese Patent No. 101224879 discloses a multi-segment rotary shaft structure.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">With respect to the operation, motion and structural design of such rotary shaft or pivot shaft device, the conventional pivot shaft device has some shortcomings as follows: 1. When a user operates and opens the display module, the display module cannot be moved far away from the heat dissipation opening system on the rear side of the apparatus body module (this will affect the heat dissipation efficiency of the electronic apparatus). 2. When a user operates and opens the display module, the display module cannot be lowered (and/or stretched) to raise the apparatus body module for a user to easily operate the keyboard section.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To speak representatively, the conventional rotary shaft or pivot shaft and the relevant connection components thereof have some shortcomings in use and structural design. The rotary shaft structure and the relevant components as well as the application condition thereof can be redesigned to eliminate these shortcomings and change the use form to widen the application range. For example, in condition that the specification of the pivot shaft (or the size of the rotary shaft) of the pivot shaft device or the relevant components is not enlarged, the distance/position between the display module and the apparatus body module can be increased or the moving range of the display module can be increased. In addition, a drive unit (or transmission/linking unit) and/or reaction module (or angle adjustment unit) are provided, whereby the display module can be lowered (or stretched) to raise the apparatus body module for a user to easily operate the keyboard section and/or adjust the angle so as to achieve a complex moving effect.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">All these issues are not taught or substantially disclosed in the above references.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is therefore a primary object of the present invention to provide a multi-shaft pivot shaft device for enlarging the displacement amount or moving range of an electronic apparatus (or a display module) in opening process. The multi-shaft pivot shaft device includes an assembled section, a fixed section and a drive unit (or transmission module and linking module) disposed between the assembled section and the fixed section and a reaction module disposed between the assembled section and the fixed section. The assembled section, the fixed section and the drive unit are pivotally connected with a shaft system. When the assembled section is moved (or stretched) from an initial position to a set position (or an end position in a direction away from the initial position), the drive unit is displaced (lowered) and/or the assembled section is (slightly) rotated back or reversely in cooperation with the reaction module (in a subsidiary direction to achieve angle adjustment effect) so as to achieve a complex moving effect. In addition, the distance between the assembled section and the fixed section is enlarged (to prevent the heat dissipation opening of the electronic apparatus from being blocked) so that the heat dissipation efficiency of the electronic apparatus can be enhanced and the operation of the user is facilitated.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the multi-shaft pivot shaft device, the reaction module is disposed between the assembled section and the linking module. The assembled section, the fixed section, the transmission module, the linking module and/or the reaction module are pivotally connected with a shaft system. When the assembled section is moved (or stretched) from an initial position to a set position (or an end position in a direction away from the initial position), the transmission module and the linking module are driven and displaced (lowered) and/or the assembled section is rotated back in cooperation with the reaction module in a subsidiary direction to adjust the angle so as to achieve a complex moving effect. In addition, the distance between the assembled section and the fixed section is enlarged (to prevent the heat dissipation opening of the electronic apparatus from being blocked) so that the heat dissipation efficiency of the electronic apparatus can be enhanced and the operation of the user is facilitated.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the multi-shaft pivot shaft device, the transmission module includes a first transmission unit, a second transmission unit, which moves in response to the move of the first transmission unit and a third transmission unit, which moves in response to the move of the second transmission unit. The linking module includes a first linking unit and a second linking unit, which moves in response to the move of the first linking unit. The second linking unit is connected with the fixed section. The assembled section is mounted on the display module of the electronic apparatus. The fixed section is disposed on the apparatus body module of the electronic apparatus, whereby the display module raises the apparatus body module and the angle of the display module is automatically adjusted (or the display module is reversely rotated) and positioned in an angle or a position for a user to easily watch.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the multi-shaft pivot shaft device, the reaction module is disposed between the assembled section and the first linking unit. In addition, the assembled section, the first linking unit, the second linking unit and the fixed section are respectively formed with driving portions, which are drivingly connected with each other. The first, second and third transmission units are respectively formed with driving sections, which are drivingly connected with each other. When the assembled section is moved, the first, second and third transmission units and the first and second linking units and/or the reaction module are driven to achieve the complex moving effect.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention can be best understood through the following description and accompanying drawings, wherein:</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective assembled view of the present invention assembled with an electronic apparatus, showing that the display module and apparatus body module of the electronic apparatus are connected with each other via the pivot shaft device in cooperation with the torque module;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective partially exploded view according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, showing that the display module and apparatus body module of the electronic apparatus are connected with each other via the pivot shaft device in cooperation with the torque module;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective exploded view of the present invention, showing the structures of the pivot shaft device and the torque module;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a sectional view of the present invention, showing that the display module is moved in an opening direction in cooperation with the structure of the transmission module, in which the phantom lines showing that the electronic apparatus is positioned in an initial position (or closed position);</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a sectional view of the present invention, showing that the display module is moved in an opening direction in cooperation with the structure of the linking module, in which the phantom lines showing that the electronic apparatus is positioned in an initial position (or closed position);</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a sectional view of the present invention, showing that the display module reaches a set position (or end position) in cooperation with the structure of the transmission module;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a sectional view of the present invention, showing that the display module reaches a set stretched position (or end position) in cooperation with the structure of the linking module; and</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a perspective view of the present invention, showing that the display module reaches a set stretched position (or end position).</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>.

The multi-shaft pivot shaft device and the relevant component structures have been redesigned to be different from the conventional pivot shaft device.
