Using the magnet repulsion and attraction force mechanical energy is retrieved. Magnet shield is used to achieve continuous mechanical energy by controlling the meeting point of two magnets.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Energy is the core fundamental demand for individuals and countries. To generate energy there should be some input required in form for Coal, Water, Wind, Nuclear and other means. However, those are expensive for certain countries or a single family to generate energy to live a self-sufficient life. To solve the problem my invention has come out using Permanent Magnet as an input source and through custom design continuous mechanical energy will be generated. From that mechanical energy other forms of energy can be retrieved like generating electricity power or driving automobiles or operating household appliances and any automated products. Since the input source for this engine is a permanent magnet depending on fossil fuels can be totally avoided and generate power through clean energy.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Based on my research and experiment, continuous energy from permanent magnets cannot be retrieved by gradually/linearly positioning of two permanent magnets facing each other with the same pole. To solve the problem, in this design a Permanent magnet shield is used to generate spontaneous repulsive or attraction force from the magnet. Spontaneous force from magnets can be generated from the magnets by making two magnets meet each other facing the same pole in a very short distance and at a very short interval. </p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In most of the permanent magnet based energy generation concept/experiments, permanent magnets are used to position against another permanent magnet to achieve repulsive or attraction using flywheel or other means. In all the existing approaches the distance between the two magnets are separated by graduaVlinearly. In gradual/linearly separation designs the repulsive or attraction force between the magnets or external force like Flywheel will gradually bring the system to a stable position after few movement. The reason is according to magnets it will start repulsion or attractions as soon as it meets from far distance. So gradually either the magnet force or flywheel force will win and brings the system to stable and will not allow the cycle to be continuous. To overcome the problem, I have used magnetic shield to block the magnet force that brings the system stable and unblocks the magnetic force only while generating a force. So that continuous energy can be retrieved. The key point of this design/invention is; both two magnets will not know how far they are separated from each other until the magnetic shield opens. The key advantage of this product is it provides an ability to fit in any existing engine structure type for example: Parallel, Twin, V-Twin, flat twin or radial type design.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic view of engine, where the magnet in the middle that is attached to the connecting rod is pushed down by the repulsive force of the top permanent magnet as well as it pulled down by the magnet that is located in the bottom of the engine.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> While the middle magnet moves down; it will hit the lever on it path and pull it down along with it.

The input for this engine is Permanent magnets. The engine structure is made up of non-magnet reactive material, inside the engine there are three Permanent magnets are used to generate efficient energy (Two magnets can also be used to handles less loads. First magnet is placed on the top of the structure facing its north pole toward the bottom of the engine structure, as mentioned in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> (no: <b>1</b>). The second magnet is placed in the bottom of the structure facing its North Pole facing toward the upper portion of the engine, as mentioned in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> (no: <b>3</b>). The third magnet is placed between the top and bottom magnet with it north pole facing toward the top and the South Pole face the bottom of the cylinder, as mentioned in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> (no: <b>2</b>).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The engine is designed to allow the third magnet <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> (no: <b>2</b>) to move up and down inside the structure as presented in the diagram <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. A power transmission rod is connected to the moving magnet. The other end of the rod is connected to the crankshaft as shown in the diagram <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> (no: <b>5</b>). In the design the purpose of the crankshaft is repositioning the moving magnet using the reciprocate action either through flywheel or other loads. A door <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> (no: <b>4</b>) is made up of material that can block the magnet fields of moving magnet reaching the top and bottom fixed magnets. To open and close the magnet shied door a lock <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> (no: <b>6</b>) is designed to hold the door and releases to open the path as shown in the diagram. To open the Magnetic shield doors a spring <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> (no: <b>7</b>) is used to pull each half of the door away from each other and opens the path of all magnets and allow the magnetic fields to reach the other magnets as shown in the diagram <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

The knob will pull the shield doors towards each other until the door get lock; as shown in the diagram <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> (no:<b>12</b>).</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Working Details</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">To start the engine, the flywheel is rotated to move the piston (middle magnet) to the top of the engine. When the piston hits the magnetic shield lock, the lock opens the magnetic shield doors that blocking the magnetic fields of top and bottom magnet. This action will allows the magnetic fields of fixed magnets to reach the moving magnet. Since the moving and top magnet are-setup to meet each other facing with the same pole and the bottom magnet facing opposite pole, the top magnet will push the moving magnet away and the bottom magnet will pull the moving magnet towards it. Using this approach; force is generated effectively using the attraction and repulsion characteristics of the magnets. This particular process produces force to move the connected rod and rotate the crankshaft and generate mechanical energy. While the moving magnet moves towards the bottom part of the engine, before it gets attracted by the magnet in the bottom of the engine or reaches the bottom magnet; the shield doors will close by piston through pulling the lever <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> (no:<b>10</b>) and blocks the magnetic fields between the moving magnet and bottom &#x26; top magnet. Due to the flywheel effect the moving magnet reciprocates and moves toward the top magnet freely without any repulsive and attraction force and hits the lock and releases the door <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> (no:<b>4</b>), the cycle continues until the shield doors are forcefully closed and cut off the magnetic field path between the magnets. </p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Design 2: Approach using external power to control the magnetic shield doors.
