In a consequent pole rotor described in Patent Reference 1, for example, to increase an average magnetic flux density between a stator and a rotor, an occupancy angle of the first magnetic pole portion having a first polarity and an occupancy angle of a second magnetic pole portion having a second polarity and serving as a pseudo-magnetic pole are set.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">PATENT REFERENCE</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2004-201406</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the technique disclosed in Patent Reference 1, holes in which permanent magnets are placed communicate with spaces adjacent to the holes. This configuration reduces magnetic flux leakage passing through regions between the holes in which the permanent magnets are placed and the spaces. That is, the configuration reduces magnetic flux leakage flowing from north poles of the permanent magnets into south poles of the permanent magnets. Conventional techniques, however, do not consider magnetic flux leakage other than effective magnetic flux flowing from a consequent pole rotor into target tooth of a stator. That is, magnetic flux leakage flowing into a tooth adjacent to the target tooth is not taken into consideration. Thus, in the conventional techniques, even if a large permanent magnet is disposed in the consequent pole rotor, magnetic flux from the permanent magnet cannot be effectively used.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore an object of the present disclosure to increase effective magnetic flux flowing from a permanent magnet of a consequent pole rotor into a target tooth of a stator in order to reduce magnetic flux leakage flowing into tooth adjacent to the target tooth.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A motor according to an aspect of the present disclosure includes:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">a consequent pole rotor including a rotor core, a permanent magnet, a first magnetic pole region, and a second magnetic pole region, the rotor core having a first magnet insertion hole and a second magnet insertion hole adjacent to the first magnet insertion hole, the permanent magnet being disposed in the first magnet insertion hole, the first magnetic pole region functioning as a first magnetic pole, the second magnetic pole region serving as a second magnetic pole, the second magnetic pole being a pseudo-magnetic pole, the pseudo-magnetic pole being formed of a part of the rotor core between the first magnet insertion hole and the second magnet insertion hole;
