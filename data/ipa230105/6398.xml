On account of these high current intensities, such plug-in connectors are referred to as heavy-duty plug-in connectors. They usually have an at least partially metallic plug-in connector housing, which is earthed in the prescribed manner for example by a ground terminal region of the plug-in connector.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Plug-in connectors with ground terminals are generally known in the prior art.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">They are usually provided with earthing screws, which are for example arranged on earthing elements of their contact carriers or else on modular holding frames. Such a PE (&#x201c;protection earth&#x201d;/protective earth) contact is shown for example in the document EP 0 860 906 B1.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, there have been efforts to make this connection technique more convenient. Thus, for example, the document WO 2011/069522 A1 describes a plug-in connector with an integrated modular system that has a PE connection by means of a crimp terminal.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The document DE 10 2013 108 383 A1 discloses a plug-in connector module for a plug-in connector modular system which on the one hand may comprise a terminal for crimp contacts and on the other hand provides an earthing clamp for electrically contacting the modular holding frame. If required, this also allows grounding cross sections of already existing connections to ground to be additionally increased.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A disadvantage of this prior art is that, although the aforementioned type of protective earthing can be conveniently operated, it also has a considerable space requirement. However, in principle the installation space for an industrial plug-in connector is limited. For many applications, the number of plug-in contacts and their current-carrying capacity, in particular with respect to air gaps and creepage paths, is a decisive criterion.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the disclosure is to provide a plug-in connector, in particular a heavy-duty plug-in connector, that has a ground terminal which can be conveniently assembled and allows the arrangement of the greatest possible number of electrical plug-in contacts in a given installation space.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">This object is achieved by the features of the independent claims.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A plug-in connector comprises a plug and a mating plug.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The plug has a pin contact carrier and a number of pin contacts that are received or are to be received therein. The pin contacts have in each case a terminal region and a contact pin. The pin contact carrier comprises a holding portion and a plugging portion with a peripheral collar.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The terminal region of the pin contacts is received in continuous pin contact receptacles of the holding portion and fixed therein, or at least can be received and fixed therein. As a result, the pin contacts in the received state are held stably in the pin contact carrier and protrude with their exposed contact pins into the plugging portion thereof.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The mating plug has a socket contact carrier and a number of socket contacts that are received or are to be received therein. The socket contacts have in each case a terminal region and a contact socket. The socket contact carrier has a terminal portion and a mating plugging portion.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The socket contact carrier has continuous socket contact receptacles for completely or at least partially receiving the socket contacts. In this case, the socket contact receptacles run both through the terminal portion and through the mating plugging portion of the socket contact carrier. In the received state, the socket contacts are arranged with their terminal region in the terminal portion and with their contact sockets in the mating plugging portion of the socket contact carrier and are held therein.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The pin contact carrier and the socket contact carrier can be plugged together. In the plugged state, the peripheral collar of the pin contact carrier encloses the mating plugging portion of the socket contact carrier. At the same time, the pin contacts received in the pin contact carrier are connected in an electrically conducting manner to the socket contacts received in the socket contact carrier, in that a respective contact pin is completely or at least partially received by a respective contact socket.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The plug-in connector also has at least one ground terminal region. This ground terminal region includes a pin contact carrier formation and a socket contact carrier formation. In the plugged state, the pin contact carrier formation and the socket contact carrier formation engage in one another or butt against one another or are at least arranged adjacently.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The plug-in connector also comprises a first protective earthing element, which is fastened, or at least can be fastened, on an outer region of the pin contact carrier formation.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A number of pin contacts are received or can be received in the pin contact carrier formation. One of these pin contacts is a ground pin contact. That pin contact receptacle in which the terminal region of the ground pin contact is received or is to be received is a ground pin contact receptacle and is distinguished by an opening through to the outer region of the pin contact carrier formation. Through this opening, the received ground pin contact is connected in an electrically conducting manner to the first protective earthing element.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The plug-in connector also comprises a second protective earthing element, which is fastened or can be fastened on an outer region of the socket contact carrier formation.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A number of socket contacts are received or are to be received in the socket contact carrier formation. One of these socket contacts is a ground socket contact. That socket contact receptacle in which the ground socket contact is received or is to be received is a ground socket contact receptacle and is distinguished by a passage through to the outer region of the socket contact carrier formation. Through this passage, the received ground socket contact in the inserted state is connected in an electrically conducting manner to the second protective earthing element.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The term &#x201c;plug-in contacts&#x201d; should be understood here and hereinafter as meaning pin and socket contacts that can be plugged together and as a result can be electrically connected to one another, a pin contact and a socket contact that can be plugged together with it respectively forming a &#x201c;contact pair&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The term &#x201c;ground plug-in contacts&#x201d; should be understood as meaning those plug-in contacts which do not serve functionally for electrical current and/or signal transmission but just for connecting to ground, and accordingly are also referred to individually as &#x201c;ground pin contacts&#x201d; and &#x201c;ground socket contacts&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A ground pin contact and a ground socket contact that can be plugged with it form a &#x201c;ground contact pair&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The term &#x201c;contact carrier&#x201d; is an umbrella term for the pin contact carrier and the socket contact carrier.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The term &#x201c;plug-in contact receptacles&#x201d; is an umbrella term for the pin and socket contact receptacles of the pin and socket contact carriers, which for their part are grouped together under the umbrella term &#x201c;contact carriers&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Accordingly, the pin contact carrier formation and the socket contact carrier formation are grouped together under the umbrella term &#x201c;contact carrier formations&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Advantageous designs of the invention are specified in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The pin and socket contacts may in each case be configured in one piece and formed from metal, for example in the form of a metallic turned part that is in particular coated with an electrical contact material. The contact carriers, i.e. the pin contact carrier and the socket contact carrier, are preferably insulators, which are produced from an electrically insulating material, for example plastic, for example by an injection-molding process. The protective earthing elements consist of an electrically conductive material, for example metal, in particular of sheet metal, for example of spring steel. The protective earthing elements are preferably stamped and bent parts.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As mentioned at the beginning, the plug-in connector may have an at least partially metallic plug-in connector housing. The plug-in connector housing may comprise a plug housing and a mating plug housing, the plug housing being a component part of the plug and the mating plug housing being a component part of the mating plug. Then, the pin contact carrier can be fastened, in particular can be screwed, in or on the plug housing by means of the first protective earthing element and preferably also by means of the third protective earthing element. The socket contact carrier can be fastened, in particular can be screwed, in or on the mating plug housing by means of the second protective earthing element and preferably also by means of the fourth protective earthing element. Consequently, a connection to ground at least on one side of the plug-in connector housing can also be established by the ground terminal region.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The invention is advantageous because in this way a particularly great number of plug-in contacts, that is to say pin and socket contacts, can be arranged in the limited installation space of the plug-in connector, in particular within the socket contact carrier or the pin contact carrier. Finally, the ground terminal region may also serve additionally for receiving those plug-in contacts that are intended for electrical current and/or signal transmission, which are therefore not ground plug-in contacts. As a result, additional installation space is used for electrical current and/or signal transmission. The resultant particularly high number of plug-in contacts also allows overall a comparatively high current to be transmitted in the limited installation space, which represents an additional advantage in the area of electrical energy transmission.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The plug-in contacts are usually plugged into the plug-in contact receptacles, i.e. into the pin and socket contact receptacles, of the respective contact carrier, and held therein, for example by a locking engagement, with an electrical line respectively connected thereto, which may in particular be a component part of a cable comprising a number of electrical lines.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Consequently, during the assembly of the plug-in connector, the pin and socket contacts, each provided with an electrical line of a cable, can be inserted on the cable connection side into the pin contact receptacles of the pin contact carrier or into the socket contact receptacles of the socket contact carrier and fixed therein.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In particular, the ground plug-in contacts, i.e. the ground pin contacts and the ground socket contacts, can be connected in the same way to an earthing line, i.e. an electrical PE (&#x201c;protective earth&#x201d;) line, which may likewise be a component part of said cable.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The ground plug-in contacts can then be plugged into their respective ground plug-in contact receptacle and fixed therein. This means that work during assembly is greatly facilitated, because there is no need to perform a separate step for the protective earthing connection.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">This makes the assembly of the ground plug-in contacts very convenient in comparison with a conventional, PE (&#x201c;protective earth&#x201d;) screw contact. For example, a PE line of the cable to be connected needs to be provided with a ground plug-in contact in the same way as any other electrical line of the same cable needs to be provided with any other plug-in contact of the plug-in connector. The respective ground plug-in contact may then be plugged on the cable connection side into the respective ground plug-in contact receptacle of the respective contact carrier, in order to allow the desired ground connection both on the plugging side and by way of the protective earthing element on the plug-in connector housing side.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In a preferred design, the plug-in contacts may be crimp contacts, i.e. the terminal region of the pin contacts and the terminal region of the socket contacts is configured in each case as a crimp terminal. Then, for example a line core of the respective line can be connected to the respective crimp terminal by plastic deformation thereof, for example by means of a crimping tool and/or a crimping machine. For example, the crimp terminal of the respective plug-in contact may be configured as hollow, for example in the form of a hollow cylinder, that is to say comprises a cavity. The line core of the corresponding electrical line, which may for example also be said PE line, is inserted into the cavity for the crimping. Then, the crimp terminal can be pressed together, for example by using the crimping tool and/or the crimping machine, so that the line core is pinched in the crimp terminal of the respective plug-in contact in an electrically conducting manner and at least in a force-fitting manner, and in particular also at least partially in a form-fitting manner.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In a preferred design, when plugging the plug with the mating plug, the ground pin contact may lead the other contact pins of the plug. This can be realized for example by the design of the ground pin contact receptacle in the pin contact carrier formation. For this purpose, a locking mechanism of the ground pin contact receptacle that is intended for fixing the ground pin contact may for example be arranged somewhat further down in the holding portion than is the case with the other pin contact receptacles. Consequently, for its fixing in the pin contact carrier, the ground pin contact can be inserted deeper into the holding portion of the pin contact carrier than the other pin contacts, and as a result its contact pin protrudes further into the plugging portion than the contact pin of the other pin contacts. This is advantageous because a ground terminal that leads during plugging, which is required for safety reasons, is made possible in this way, without a separate, in particular longer, ground pin contact having to be used for this. Therefore, it is not necessary to use pin contacts of different lengths for this, that is to say for example pin contacts with contact pins of different lengths, but instead the same pin contacts as for the electrical current and signal transmission are used for connecting to ground. As a result, only one type of pin contacts is used for the entire plug-in connector, which simplifies the structural design of the plug-in connector considerably.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The ground pin contact can consequently be structurally identical to the other pin contacts and the ground socket contact can furthermore also be structurally identical to the other socket contacts. Then the ground plug-in contacts only differ from the other plug-in contacts by their function and possibly by their arrangement in the respective contact carrier.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">This function of the ground plug-in contacts is, among other things, that a PE line is respectively connected to the ground plug-in contacts, for example is crimped on. The ground plug-in contacts are then plugged furthermore into the ground plug-in contact receptacles especially provided for this, i.e. into the ground pin contact receptacles of the pin contact carrier or into the ground socket contact receptacles of the socket contact carrier. These ground plug-in contact receptacles that are especially provided for this purpose differ from the other plug-in contact receptacles or socket contact receptacles by said opening or passage through to the outer side of the ground terminal region. Finally, through this opening or through this passage, the ground plug-in contacts are brought into electrical contact with the respective protective earthing element, for example for the ground plug-in contacting of the plug-in connector housing, and in this way can for example earth the plug-in connector housing.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the plugged state, the contact pin of the at least one ground pin contact can be plugged with the contact socket of the at least one ground socket contact, i.e. in the plugged state it is at least partially received by it and is thus in engagement with it, whereby the ground pin contact and the ground socket contact are connected to one another in an electrically conducting manner. This is particularly advantageous because the ground potentials of the plug and the mating plug are thus connected to one another particularly reliably and with particularly good conducting characteristics. The ground pin contact and the ground socket contact then form a ground contact pair, and consequently establish a particularly reliable and low-impedance ground connection between the plug and the mating plug, in particular also on the plugging side.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The pin contact carrier formation may be of a substantially cuboidal configuration, that is to say for example have a rectangular cross section, in which for example the corners are rounded. The pin contact carrier may also comprise a basic form which consists of a basic cuboid onto which the cuboidal pin contact carrier formation is formed. The pin contact carrier formation may in this case be significantly smaller than the basic cuboid, i.e. its volume may for example be respectively less than a quarter of the volume of the basic cuboid.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The socket contact carrier formation may also be of a substantially cuboidal configuration, and may in particular correspond to the pin contact carrier formation, that is to say in particular have a comparable cross section. The socket contact carrier formation may in the plugged state be arranged on the plugging side adjacent to the pin contact carrier formation, and may in particular adjoin it. In a preferred design, the socket contact carrier formation may in the plugged state be enclosed on at least three sides by the collar of the pin contact carrier in the region of its pin contact carrier formation, in particular in a force-fitting manner, i.e. the pin contact carrier formation and the socket contact carrier formation may engage in one another, in particular in a form-fitting manner, in the plugged state.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In a preferred design, the pin contact carrier may comprise in addition to said, preferably substantially cuboidal, pin contact carrier formation also a further, preferably substantially cuboidal, pin contact carrier formation, so that it comprises altogether two, preferably substantially cuboidal, pin contact carrier formations. These two pin contact carrier formations may be formed on two side faces of the basic cuboid lying opposite one another, in particular lying symmetrically opposite one another, and together with this basic cuboid form the basic form of the pin contact carrier.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In a preferred design, the socket contact carrier may also comprise in addition to said, preferably substantially cuboidal, socket contact carrier formation also a further, preferably substantially cuboidal, socket contact carrier formation, so that it comprises altogether two, preferably substantially cuboidal, socket contact carrier formations, which are formed on two side faces of a basic cuboid lying opposite one another, in particular lying symmetrically opposite one another, and together with this basic cuboid form the basic form of the socket contact carrier.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In a preferred design, the plug-in connector may have in addition to said ground terminal region a further ground terminal region, the further ground terminal region comprising the further contact carrier formations, i.e. the further pin contact carrier formation and the further socket contact carrier formation.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Then a further ground pin contact may be arranged in the further pin contact carrier formation and a further ground socket contact may be arranged in the further socket contact carrier formation, the further ground pin contact and the further ground socket contact forming a further ground contact pair.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">For this purpose, the further pin contact carrier formation may comprise a further ground pin contact receptacle with a further opening and the further socket contact carrier formation may comprise a further ground socket contact receptacle with a further passage. As a result, the further ground pin contact and the further ground socket contact can be connected in an electrically conducting manner to a third and a fourth protective earthing element respectively, and thus contribute to said connection to ground to the plug-in connector housing.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Finally, in an advantageous design, a connection to ground on both sides of the at least partially metallic plug-in connector housing, and as a result also a particularly homogeneous connection to ground, can be achieved by the further ground terminal region. Such a, particularly homogeneous, connection to ground provides particularly effective shielding, in particular in the high frequency range. Furthermore, the plug-in connector can have as a result altogether a particularly large grounding cross section, for example twice as large as with only one ground terminal region. Such a particularly large grounding cross section may therefore be of use for example when designing for the transmission of particularly high current intensities.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">These two ground terminal regions of the plug-in connector may then be configured structurally identically or at least symmetrically in relation to one another and may be opposite one another, in particular symmetrically, on the contact carriers. The further ground terminal region may comprise two further protective earthing elements, specifically a third and a fourth protective earthing element, of which the third protective earthing element is arranged on the outer region of the further pin contact carrier formation and the fourth protective earthing element is arranged on the outer region of the further socket contact carrier formation.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In another, particularly preferred design, the further pin contact carrier formation may however also be a purely additional pin contact carrier region, which serves exclusively for electrical energy and/or signal transmission and consequently not for connecting to ground. The further pin contact carrier formation is in this case therefore not intended to receive a further ground pin contact. Consequently, therefore, no further ground pin contact receptacle is required in the further pin contact carrier formation either, i.e. no further opening is necessary in the pin contact carrier formation either. This is particularly advantageous because, by dispensing with a further ground pin contact, all the more other pin contacts can be received in the additional pin contact carrier region.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Then, the third protective earthing element may nevertheless be attached to the further pin contact carrier formation for fastening in or on the plug housing, although no protective earthing at all is necessary at this point. Finally, in this way furthermore the fastening function of the protective earthing element can be used.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Accordingly, the further socket contact carrier formation may also be a purely additional socket contact carrier region, which serves exclusively for electrical energy and/or signal transmission and consequently not for connecting to ground. The further socket contact carrier formation is in this case therefore not intended to receive a further ground socket contact. Therefore, no further ground socket contact receptacle is required in the further socket contact carrier formation either, i.e. no further passage is necessary in the pin contact carrier formation either. It is particularly advantageous here that, by dispensing with a further ground socket contact, all the more other socket contacts can be received in the additional socket contact carrier region.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Furthermore, the further socket carrier formation may comprise the fourth protective earthing element for fastening in or on the mating plug housing, although no protective earthing at all is necessary at this point. Finally, in this way at least the fastening function of the protective earthing element can be used.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Consequently, the plug-in connector may also in this structural form comprise altogether four protective earthing elements, two of which, specifically the first and third protective earthing elements, are arranged on the two pin contact carrier formations and the other two, specifically the second and fourth protective earthing elements, are arranged on the two socket contact carrier formations. In this case, the protective earthing elements may be identically configured, even if the third and fourth protective earthing elements have only a fastening function, while the first and second protective earthing elements have both a fastening function and an electrically conducting function, specifically said function of connecting to ground the ground plug-in contacts to the plug-in connector housing.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">This structural form is therefore appropriate if on the one hand the grounding cross section of a single PE line and a single ground contact pair is regarded as adequate, but on the other hand the highest possible number of plug-in contacts is required. The plug-in connector then has instead of the further ground terminal region an additional plug-in contact carrier region, which comprises the additional pin contact carrier region and the additional socket contact carrier region. This plug-in contact carrier region therefore has been or is provided exclusively with plug-in contacts that are not intended as ground plug-in contacts. As a result, the number of plug-in contacts that are arranged or are to be arranged therein and are intended for electrical energy and signal transmission can be increased once again, depending on the structural form, for example by one or two plug-in contacts. Altogether, one ground contact pair and four further contact pairs may then be arranged for example in the ground terminal region and six further contact pairs may be arranged in the additional plug-in contact region.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The use of the third and fourth protective earthing elements on the plug-in contact carrier region for the mechanical fastening thereof on the plug-in connector housing has the advantage of particularly economical production, because no separate holding element has to be designed and produced. Furthermore, a symmetrical appearance of the plug-in connector is ensured as a result, even if it only comprises a single ground terminal region.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Those pin contacts that are located in said basic cuboid of the pin contact carrier, that is to say are arranged outside the pin contact carrier formation, may be arranged offset in relation to one another, in order to arrange the greatest possible number of plug-in contacts in the given installation space. Those socket contacts that are located in the basic cuboid, that is to say are arranged outside the socket contact carrier formation, are then of course arranged in the same form, specifically offset in relation to one another, in order to form a contact pair respectively with the pin contacts. The term &#x201c; . . . arranged offset in relation to one another . . . &#x201d; means in this case that the center points of these adjacent plug-in contacts form an isosceles triangle. This of course means here and hereinafter also that the associated plug-in contact receptacles in the respective contact carrier are arranged offset in relation to one another in the same way as the plug-in contacts. Consequently, the plug-in contact receptacles in the respective contact carrier are arranged offset in relation to one another outside the contact carrier formations.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Those plug-in contacts that are received in the contact carrier formations, i.e. in the pin contact carrier formations and socket contact carrier formations, are in this case excepted from the aforementioned offset arrangement on account of the small installation space in these regions. If on the other hand one wished to speak of an arrangement structure at all in the case of the aforementioned number of for example four, five or six contact pairs per contact carrier formation, a possible arrangement of these plug-in contacts may best be described as arranged in rows and columns running at right angles, i.e. at right angles to one another. This means that the center points of the adjacent plug-in contacts form rectangles, in particular squares. In the ground terminal region, this structure can however only be realized to a restricted extent in a number of possible structural forms due to the particular structural features of the ground plug-in contact receptacles, specifically the opening or the passage.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The ground plug-in contacts, i.e. the ground pin contacts and ground socket contacts, can finally form an intended exception within this structure, that is to say &#x201c;diverge&#x201d; from this pattern, i.e. represent an exception with respect to their arrangement. This serves the purpose of allowing for those special structural features of the corresponding plug-in contact/socket contact receptacle that exist as a result of said opening or said passage. Finally, for example depending on the structural form, the necessary stability can possibly be ensured by a somewhat increased distance of the ground pin contact receptacle from the edge of the pin contact carrier.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">At least two pin contacts and at least two socket contacts may be arranged in each ground terminal region, one of these at least two pin contacts being said ground pin contact and one of the two socket contacts being said ground socket contact. Accordingly, in each ground terminal region there may be arranged at least one further contact pair that is not a ground contact pair, which therefore can be used for electrical current and energy transmission. This already represents an advantage of the invention over the prior art. Finally, there is consequently an increase in the number of contact pairs in comparison with an arrangement in which the ground terminal region is only used for connecting to ground.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In a preferred design, at least five contact pairs are arranged in each ground terminal region, one of these five contact pairs being the ground contact pair. Consequently, in this ground contact region at least four further contact pairs are therefore available for electrical energy and signal transmission. As a result, the aforementioned advantage increases correspondingly. The center points of these four contact pairs and their plug-in contact receptacles in the associated contact carrier can be arranged at right angles to one another. The ground contact pair however diverges from this pattern for the reasons mentioned above.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the additional plug-in contact carrier region there may possibly be arranged for example six contact pairs, which serve exclusively for electrical energy and signal transmission. The center points of the adjacent plug-in contact receptacles of the additional plug-in contact carrier region may be arranged in relation to one another in the form of a rectangle, in particular a square.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Altogether, for example ten more contact pairs than is the case in the prior art can in this way be used, which represents a particular advantage.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">It is of course advantageous for the electrical energy and signal transmission to arrange even more than four, five or six contact pairs intended for electrical current and/or signal transmission in the ground terminal region or in the additional plug-in contact carrier region, for example more than seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven or twelve or even more. There may also be precisely four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven or twelve or any other conceivable number of such contact pairs arranged in the ground terminal region or in the additional plug-in contact carrier region.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">On the other hand there are of course also the structural conditions, in particular the minimum spacing of the contacts and the given overall dimensions of the plug-in connector and/or of the plug-in connector housing, so that the final structural form can be optimized for the respective application by weighing up these and further relevant, for example electrical parameters.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the way described, a plug-in connector can be configured particularly compactly and, in a contact carrier installation space with a cross-sectional area of about 11-12 cm<sup>2</sup>, comprise at least 56 plug-in contacts, preferably 57 plug-in contacts and particularly preferably 58 plug-in contacts and more. In addition, the installation space contains four flange regions, which are arranged in the respective corners and are in each case about 1 cm<sup>2</sup>, so that the overall, rectangular installation space including the flanges is in this example approximately 3 cm*5 cm. This is mentioned by way of example for the best overall balance between the number of plug-in contacts and the available installation space.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Of course, other plug-in connector sizes with a comparable density of plug-in contacts, i.e. a number of plug-in contacts corresponding to the installation space, can also be realized in the same way. As mentioned at the beginning, the plug-in contacts may in this case each have for example a current-carrying capacity of at least 1 A, 2 A, 4 A, 6 A and/or 10 A and more. To increase the air gaps and the creepage paths, hollow-cylindrical formations and cylindrical depressions may in this case be alternately arranged on the pin contact carrier, on the plugging side at the continuous plug-in contact receptacles.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Of said 56 to 58 plug-in contacts of the aforementioned example, one or two plug-in contacts may for example be used as ground plug-in contacts, so that, by this structural form, for example 54, 55, 56, 57 or more contacts can be made available for electrical current and signal transmission in the installation space specified above with said current-carrying capacity. This is a considerable advantage over the prior art for a plug-in connector with such a convenient connection to ground.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The protective earthing element may be a stamped and bent part. The protective earthing element may be formed from sheet metal. Preferably, the protective earthing element may comprise a spring contact, in particular a contact lug. If the protective earthing element is for example arranged on the pin contact carrier formation, the spring element, in particular the contact lug, can reach through the opening thereof, in order to connect the protective earthing element in an electrically conducting manner to the received ground pin contact. If the protective earthing element is arranged on the socket contact carrier formation, it can reach with its spring element, in particular the contact lug, through the passage thereof, in order to connect the protective earthing element in an electrically conducting manner to the ground socket contact. In particular, the contact lug may comprise for this purpose a contact projection, for example a bossing, with which it at least partially reaches through the opening or the passage and by which it is in electrical contact with the respective plug-in contact.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The protective earthing element may have at least one angled-away flange with at least one screw openings, which serves being screwed on the at least partially metallic plug-in connector housing, and in particular being brought into electrical contact therewith for protective earthing.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">As already mentioned, in a preferred design the at least partially metallic plug-in connector housing of the plug-in connector comprises the plug housing and the mating plug housing. The plug housing is in this case a component part of the plug and the mating plug housing is a component part of the mating plug. The pin contact carrier is received in the plug housing, or at least can be received therein, and the socket contact carrier is received in the mating plug housing, or at least can be received therein.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The plug housing and the mating plug housing may be in each case at least partially electrically conductive and for example consist of metal. They may be connected, or at least connectable, in an electrically conducting manner to the respective ground plug-in contact by way of the respective protective earthing element of the received pin contact carrier or socket contact carrier.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The protective earthing element may have at least one screw opening, which serves the purpose of screwing the inserted pin contact carrier in or on the plug housing, and also the inserted socket contact carrier in or on the mating plug housing, and thereby both mechanically fastening, and consequently electrically contacting, their respective at least one ground plug-in contact. In particular, the protective earthing element has two angled-away flanges, each with at least one such screw opening.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">As already mentioned, in a preferred design the protective earthing element is a stamped and bent part, which is preferably made of metal, for example of sheet metal, in particular of spring steel, the protective earthing element having in particular a basic portion from which a contact spring, in particular a contact lug, is punched out. Preferably, laterally of the basic portion, two side parts are bent away at right angles therefrom, opposite one another in parallel. Furthermore, a locking means, in particular a locking window, may be arranged in each of the two side parts for locking engagement on a respective mating locking means, in particular a locking pin, of the contact carrier formations. Bent away at right angles from the ends of the side parts there is respectively a said flange with respectively a screw opening. These flanges serve for being screwed on the plug-in connector housing for fastening, and possibly also for protective earthing.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The basic portion may be slightly bent in in the region of its contact lug. For the electrical contacting with the respective ground plug-in contact, i.e. with the ground pin contact or the ground socket contact, the contact projection may be stamped in the contact lug.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0077" num="0076">An exemplary embodiment of the invention is explained in more detail below and is shown in the drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>a, b </i></figref>show a pin contact carrier, looking toward the plugging portion and the holding portion;</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a, b </i></figref>show a socket contact carrier, looking toward the mating plugging portion and the terminal portion;</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>a, b </i></figref>show a protective earthing element, looking toward an outer side and an inner side;</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i></figref>show the pin contact carrier with protective earthing elements to be fastened thereon and fastened thereon, from various views;</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i></figref>show the socket contact carrier with protective earthing elements to be fastened thereon and fastened thereon, from various views;</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a complete plug-in connector with a ground terminal region in an exploded representation;</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b><i>a, b </i></figref>show the assembled plug-in connector in the unplugged state and in the plugged state;</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b><i>a, b </i></figref>show the two contact carriers plugged together, looking toward a ground terminal region in a partially transparent representation.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The figures contain partially simplified, schematic representations.
