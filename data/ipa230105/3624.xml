Technical Field</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure is related to an agent and a method for cryopreservation, more particularly to an agent and a method for cryopreservation of mitochondria.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Mitochondria (called &#x201c;mitochondrion&#x201d; in singular form) are places where oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis occur. Since ATP is used as a source of energy in a cell, the mitochondria are described as the powerhouse of the cell. In addition to generate energy required by the cell, the mitochondria also participate in cell division, cell signaling and apoptosis of the cell, and the mitochondria has the ability to control the cell-division cycle. Since mitochondria are quite important organelles in the human body, problems with their function fail may result in diseases such as mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, and the neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson's disease.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For these mitochondrial diseases, mitochondrial transplantation is one of the therapies. By preservation of healthy mitochondria, the healthy mitochondria can be transplanted into cells to replace the damaged mitochondria when mitochondrial diseases are found, thereby relieving the symptoms of mitochondrial diseases.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Due to a bilayer membrane structure in a mitochondrion, mitochondria are more fragile than cells. Although a variety of cryoprotectants for cells have been developed, these cryoprotectants are not suitable for the cryopreservation of mitochondria. As to the cryopreservation of mitochondria by using conventional cryoprotectants for cells, mitochondria often become swollen or even broken, resulting in the inability of mitochondria to function properly after thawing. The prevention of damage to mitochondria during cryopreservation has become an important issue, so that there is a demand of cryoprotectants specialized to the cryopreservation of mitochondria.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to one aspect of the present disclosure, an agent for cryopreservation includes trehalose, HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) and serum albumin (SA).

It will be apparent, however, that one or more embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are schematically shown in order to simplify the drawings.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to one embodiment of the present disclosure, an agent for cryopreservation includes trehalose with a molar concentration of 150 mM to 300 mM, HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) with a molar concentration of 10 mM to 20 mM, and serum albumin (SA) with a mass percentage concentration of 0.1% to 1%. The agent for cryopreservation does not include potassium chloride (KCl), ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). In other words, an agent for cryopreservation according to one embodiment of the present disclosure may include trehalose, HEPES and SA, wherein a molar concentration of the trehalose in the agent is from 150 mM to 300 mM, a molar concentration of the HEPES in the agent is from 10 mM to 20 mM, and a mass percentage concentration of the SA in the agent is from 0.1% to 1%; and the agent for cryopreservation may not include KCl, ethylene glycol, EGTA and EDTA. The agent for cryopreservation can be used for preparation of a cryoprotectant for cryopreservation of mitochondria, such as a cryoprotectant for cryopreservation of mitochondria obtained from mammal cells. The mammal cells, for example, are human cells. In one embodiment, the agent for cryopreservation does not include sodium chloride NaCl, KCl, ethylene glycol, EGTA and EDTA.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to cryopreservation, the trehalose in the agent can protect mitochondrial membrane to main integrity of a mitochondrion and normal function of the mitochondrial membrane. The HEPES in the agent can keep pH of the cryoprotectant at a nearly constant value, and HEPES can also make the cryoprotectant as an isotonic solution for mitochondria. The SA in the agent can keep constant osmotic pressure of the cryoprotectant and that of the mitochondria. In some embodiments, the SA may be derived from an individual which is the same species as one in which the mitochondria are designated to be cryopreserved; for example, human serum albumin (HSA) is selected for the cryopreservation of human mitochondria, and dog serum albumin (DSA) is selected for the cryopreservation of canine mitochondria. In some other embodiments, the SA may be derived from an individual which belongs different species from one in which the mitochondria are designated to be cryopreserved.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to a conventional cryoprotectant, KCl therein is provided for adjusting the cryoprotectant to be a buffer solution and isotonic solution for mitochondria. Also, EGTA and EDTA in the conventional cryoprotectant can capture calcium ions which are generated when cell are damaged so as to prevent a large amount of calcium ions from entering the mitochondria to thereby cause changes in mitochondrial membrane permeability which may result in mitochondrial swelling or even lysis.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">However, compared to the conventional cryoprotectant, the cryoprotectant according to the present disclosure does not include KCl, ethylene glycol, EGTA and EDTA.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a case that there is no KCl, ethylene glycol, EGTA and EDTA, the mitochondria cryopreserved by using the cryoprotectant of the present disclosure can enjoy better integrity and ATP synthesis ability. Therefore, the cryopreserved mitochondria maintain better function after they are thawed, which in turn leads to better performance in subsequent usage.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">An embodiment of the present disclosure provides an agent for cryopreservation consists of trehalose with a molar concentration of 150 mM to 300 mM, HEPES with a molar concentration of 10 mM to 20 mM, and SA with a mass percentage concentration of 0.1% to 1%. In other words, an agent for cryopreservation according to one embodiment of the present disclosure may consist of trehalose, HEPES and SA, wherein a molar concentration of the trehalose in the agent is from 150 mM to 300 mM, a molar concentration of the HEPES in the agent is from 10 mM to 20 mM, and a mass percentage concentration of the SA in the agent is from 0.1% to 1%.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The efficacy of the elements of the agent in this embodiment and the effectiveness of the agent for preparation a cryoprotectant for cryopreservation of mitochondria are as described in the aforementioned embodiment, and will not be repeated hereafter.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to the two embodiments mentioned above, the molar concentration of the trehalose is from 150 mM to 300 mM, preferably 200 mM to 300 mM, more preferably 250mM to300 mM. The molar concentration of the HEPES is from 10mM to 20 mM, preferably 10 mM to 16 mM, more preferably 10 mM to13 mM. The mass percentage concentration of the SA is from 0.1% to 1%, preferably 0.1% to 0.7%, more preferably 0.1% to 0.3%.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to some other embodiments of the present disclosure, a ratio of the molar concentration of the trehalose to that of the HEPES (trehalose/HEPES) may be from 13 to 17, preferably 14 to 16, more preferably 15.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to some other embodiments of the present disclosure, the agent for cryopreservation is aqueous and can be used directly, and the solvent used herein may be deionized water, but the present disclosure is not limited thereto. According to some other embodiments of the present disclosure, the agent for cryopreservation is solid, and the solid agent should be firstly prepared into liquid form with pure water (e.g., deionized water) or other solvent acceptable to the cell to be ready for use. As to the solid agent for cryopreservation, a weight ratio among dried trehalose, dried HEPES and dried serum albumin may be represented by X:Y:Z, in which X is from 92.42 to 112.96, Y is from 2.14 to 2.62, and Z is from 0.9 to 1.1; preferably, X:Y:Z is 102.69:2.38:1.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A method for cryopreservation of mitochondria according to one embodiment of the present disclosure is described as follows. Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> showing a flow chart illustrating a method for cryopreservation of mitochondria according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. A method for cryopreservation of mitochondria may be applied to the cryopreservation of mitochondria obtained from mammal cells, such as human cells, and the method may include the following steps.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a first step S<b>101</b>, the container is precooled.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In detail, the container may be placed in liquid nitrogen for precooling for 20 seconds to 40 seconds. The container may be test tube, centrifuge tube or vial.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Next, in a second step S<b>102</b>, the agent (or cryoprotectant) and mitochondria are provided in the container.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In detail, the precooled container is rewarmed at room temperature for 5 seconds to 15 seconds, and then the aforementioned agent of the present disclosure as well as the mitochondria are placed into the bottom of the container. When the agent and the mitochondria have been placed in the container, an operator can tap the container to aggregate the agent and the mitochondria to the bottom of the container, which prevents mitochondria residues on the inner wall of the container. The mitochondria residues on the inner wall of the container may be not rinsed with the agent for cryopreservation, so that these residual mitochondria easily swell or break during cryopreservation because they are not protected by the agent.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a third step S<b>103</b>, the agent and the mitochondria accommodated in the container is cooled down.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In detail, the container accommodating the agent and the mitochondria may be placed in liquid nitrogen for 5 seconds to 15 seconds for cooling, and the agent and the mitochondria in the container are in a frozen state after cooling.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In a fourth step S<b>104</b>, the container accommodating the agent and the mitochondria is taken from the liquid nitrogen, and the agent for cryopreservation and the mitochondria in the container, which have been cooled down, are preserved.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In detail, the container accommodating the agent and the mitochondria may be taken from the liquid nitrogen, and the container as well as the cooled agent and mitochondria accommodated therein may be placed in a refrigerator for cryopreservation at a temperature of &#x2212;70&#xb0; C. to &#x2212;90&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">When someone wants to thaw the cryopreserved mitochondria, the container containing the agent and frozen mitochondria is taken from the refrigerator, and is thawed by gently shaking for 45 seconds to 65 seconds in warm water at 25&#xb0; C. to 35&#xb0; C. After the agent and the mitochondria in the container are completely thawed, the container with the agent and the mitochondria are inserted into crushed ice pool to keep the mitochondria at 4&#xb0; C. to 10&#xb0; C. for subsequent usage. An example of said subsequent usage is the use of mitochondria for mitochondrial transplantation to treat mitochondrial-related diseases.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to the method for cryopreservation of mitochondria in the present disclosure, the thawed mitochondria, even though they were cryopreserved, can enjoy better integrity and ATP synthesis ability. Therefore, the cryopreserved mitochondria maintain better function after they are thawed, which in turn leads to better performance in subsequent usage.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The following demonstrates the effect of improved integrity and ATP synthesis ability of the mitochondria cryopreserved by using the agent (or cryoprotectant) of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The following experiment is conducted by using mitochondria obtained from human stem cells. The stem cells can be prepared in a flask with a medium including 10 wt% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and cultured for 168 hours to be ready for use. The stem cells may be embryonic stem cells, induced stem cells, amniotic mesenchymal stem cells, placental mesenchymal stem cells, chorionic mesenchymal stem cells, umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells, adipose derived stem cells (ADSC), bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, or other sources of adult stem cells.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The mitochondria used in the experiment are prepared as follows. Firstly, about a mount of 10<sup>8 </sup>to 10<sup>9 </sup>ADSCs are taken from the cell-culture dish. Next, the ADSCs are loaded into test tube with mitochondria isolation buffer (Ibc: 225 mM mannitol, 75 mM sucrose, 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), and the ADSCs are homogenized with the buffer by using gentleMACS&#x2122; dissociator. The broken ADSCs are placed in Percoll at a volume percentage of 30%, and the precipitate is removed by ultra-high speed centrifugation at 95,000g for 30 minutes (min), followed by high speed centrifugation at 13,000g for 10 min to isolate precipitated mitochondria. Then, the isolated mitochondria were rinsed with mitochondrial protein separation buffer for subsequent experiments.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The cryopreservation of the mitochondria is described as follows. Firstly, centrifuge tubes are pre-cooled in liquid nitrogen for 30 seconds. Next, the centrifuge tube are taken from the liquid nitrogen and rewarmed at room temperature for 10 seconds. Next, 300 micrograms (&#x3bc;g) of mitochondria which have been isolated from stem cells and 60 microliters (&#x3bc;L) of agent (or cryoprotectant) are placed into the space at the bottom of the centrifuge tube. Next, each tube is slightly tapped to ensure that the mitochondria and the agent are aggregated at the bottom of the tube.

Then, some amount of ADP is added into the wells as the material for ATP synthesis, and the ATP synthesis oxygen consumption rate in the mitochondria is detected at this time. Then, some ATP synthesis inhibitors are added to decrease the activity of the mitochondria to synthesize ATP, and non-ATP synthesis oxygen consumption rate in the mitochondria is detected at this time. The ATP synthesis inhibitors may be oligomycin. Next, an appropriate concentration of anti-coupler is added to the wells, and the mitochondria are allowed to idle in the limiting condition without disrupting the electron transport chain of the inner mitochondrial membrane to assess oxygen consumption rate of the electron transport chain of the inner mitochondrial membrane. The anti-coupler may be carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP). Finally, electron transport chain inhibitors are added into the wells to completely stop mitochondrial oxygen consumption, thereby determining background value of the oxygen consumption rate.
