More specifically, the present disclosure presents a computing device and a method for inferring an airflow of a VAV appliance operating in the area of the building.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Systems for controlling environmental conditions, for example in buildings, are becoming increasingly sophisticated. An environment control system may at once control heating and cooling, monitor air quality, detect hazardous conditions such as fire, carbon monoxide release, intrusion, and the like. Such environment control systems generally include at least one environment controller, which receives measured environmental values, generally from external sensors, and in turn determines set-points or command parameters to be sent to controlled appliances.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An example of controlled appliance is a Variable Air Volume (VAV) appliance. VAV appliances are deployed in various areas of a building, to regulate the temperature, humidity level and CO2 level in these various areas. The VAV appliances are generally controlled by one or more environment controller deployed in the building to implement an environment control system.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A VAV appliance generally includes an airflow sensor, capable of measuring an airflow generated by the VAV appliance during operations. The measured airflow is used directly by the VAV appliance for auto-regulating the operations of the VAV appliance, and can also be transmitted to an environment controller for providing a feedback on the operations of the VAV appliance.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The accuracy of the airflow measured by the airflow sensor is therefore of paramount importance to ensure proper operations of the VAV appliance. However, when the VAV appliance is installed, the airflow measured by the airflow sensor may not be accurate. This lack of accuracy is caused by a default in the configuration of the airflow sensor, by specific environmental conditions not compatible with the factory configuration of the airflow sensor, etc.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To correct the lack of accuracy of the airflow sensor, an intervention by a specialized technician is usually required. The technician measures the real airflow of the VAV appliance, compares it to the air flow measured by the airflow sensor, and reconfigures the airflow sensor accordingly. This procedure is well known in the art and is referred to as balancing. Practically, it consists in adjusting a K factor of the airflow sensor, as will be detailed later in the description.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The configuration procedure being made by a technician makes it costly financially and in terms of delay before the VAV appliance is fully operational after its initial deployment. The procedure is also prone to human errors. Thus, it would be beneficial to automate this configuration procedure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Current advances in artificial intelligence, and more specifically in neural networks, can be taken advantage of for automating the determination of the real airflow of the VAV appliance.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, there is a need for a computing device and a method for inferring an airflow of a VAV appliance operating in an area of a building.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to a first aspect, the present disclosure relates to a method for inferring an airflow of a controlled appliance operating in an area of a building.
