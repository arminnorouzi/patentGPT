Description of the Prior Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A light-adjusting device (also known as an electrically controlled light-adjusting device, an electrically controlled device or an intelligent light-adjusting device) is a kind of electrochromic device which may adjust the color or intensity of light by applying a control voltage to a functional material layer of the device.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently, extensive research has been conducted on the development of electrically controlled light-adjusting devices. However, there are still many technical issues to be overcome. For example, how to further reduce the light transmittance of the light-adjusting device in a low transmission state to increase shielding efficiency and enlarge adjustable range between a high transmission state and a low transmission state are still under aggressive research in the technical field.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure is directed to an electronic device and a method for forming the same.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One embodiment of the present disclosure provides a method for forming an electronic device. First, a first liquid crystal cell is provided. The first liquid crystal cell includes a first substrate and a third substrate. Subsequently, a pre-cutting step is performed to form at least a pre-cutting mark on the third substrate. Following, a second liquid crystal cell is formed by disposing a second substrate with a second conductive layer to the third substrate. After that, a cutting step is performed to cut off portions of the first substrate and the second substrate and concurrently removing a portion of the third substrate along the pre-cutting mark.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">One embodiment of the present disclosure provides electronic device including a first substrate, a second substrate on the first substrate, a third substrate between the first substrate and the second substrate, a first optical media layer between the first substrate and the third substrate, and a second optical media layer between the second substrate and the third substrate. A sidewall of the third substrate is recessed from a sidewall of the first substrate and a sidewall of the second substrate to form a recessed portion, and another sidewall of the third substrate protrudes from another sidewall of the first substrate and another sidewall of the second substrate to form a protruding portion.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">One embodiment of the present disclosure provides electronic device including a first substrate, a second substrate on the first substrate, a third substrate between the first substrate and the second substrate, a first optical media layer between the first substrate and the third substrate, and a second optical media layer between the second substrate and the third substrate, wherein the first substrate, the third substrate and the second substrate are displaced layer by layer along a direction parallel to a surface of the first substrate to form a stepped structure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The electronic device provided by the present disclosure may have a reduced overall thickness and manufacturing cost by sharing the third substrate between the first liquid crystal cell and the second liquid crystal cell. Furthermore, by performing the pre-cutting step, it would be easier to remove the unnecessary portions of the substrates of the first liquid crystal cell and the second liquid crystal cell during the cutting step. The recessed portion, protruding portion, and/or stepped structure of the electronic device may facilitate electrical connecting to the conductive layers of the first liquid crystal cell and the second liquid crystal cell.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">These and other objectives of the present disclosure will no doubt become obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art after reading the following detailed description of the embodiment that is illustrated in the various figures and drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> are schematic diagrams illustrating the cross-sectional structures of an electronic device at different manufacturing steps according to a first embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating the cross-sectional structure of an electronic device according to a second embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating the cross-sectional structure of an electronic device according to a third embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> are schematic diagrams illustrating the orientations of the liquid crystal molecules and the dye molecules of the dye-doped liquid crystal layer according to some embodiments, in which:</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating the orientations of the positive liquid crystal molecules and the positive dye molecules of the dye-doped liquid crystal layer when no electrical field is applied;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating the orientations of the positive liquid crystal molecules and the positive dye molecules of the dye-doped liquid crystal layer when an electrical field is applied.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating the orientations of the negative liquid crystal molecules and the negative dye molecules of the dye-doped liquid crystal layer when no electrical field is applied.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating the orientations of the negative liquid crystal molecules and the negative dye molecules of the dye-doped liquid crystal layer when an electrical field is applied.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a path of light passing through an electronic device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present disclosure may be understood by reference to the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the drawings as described below.

First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the first substrate <b>10</b> is provided. Subsequently, the first conductive layer <b>12</b> is formed on the surface <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the first substrate <b>10</b> by, for example, deposition, plating, or coating. Later, the first alignment layer <b>14</b> is formed on the first conductive layer <b>12</b>. After forming the sealant <b>40</b> and the dummy sealant <b>42</b>, a one drop fill (DOF) process may be performed to drop the liquid crystal molecules with doped dye molecules in the region surrounded by the sealant <b>40</b> thereby forming the first dye-doped liquid crystal layer <b>50</b>. Afterword, the third substrate <b>30</b> having the third conductive layer <b>32</b> and the third alignment layer <b>34</b> disposed thereon is bonded to the first substrate <b>10</b>. In other embodiments, the first liquid crystal cell <b>1</b>A may be manufactured by bonding the first substrate <b>10</b> and the third substrate <b>30</b> to make the space for accommodating the liquid crystal molecules and then injecting the liquid crystal molecules with doped dye molecules into the space by performing a vacuum suction process. The above manufacturing process should be known in the art and the detailed manufacturing steps are not narrated herein for the sake of simplicity. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, before the third substrate <b>30</b> is bonded to the first substrate <b>10</b>, the fourth conductive layer <b>36</b> may be formed in advance on the second surface <b>30</b><i>b </i>that is opposite to the first surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the third substrate <b>30</b> in order to simplify the process. It should be understood that in other embodiments, the fourth conductive layer <b>36</b> may be formed on the second surface <b>30</b><i>b </i>of the third substrate <b>30</b> after bonding the first substrate <b>10</b> and the third substrate <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The first substrate <b>10</b> and the third substrate <b>30</b> may be hard substrates or flexible substrates. The materials of the first substrate <b>10</b> and the third substrate <b>30</b> may include glass, quartz, sapphire, plastic, other suitable materials, or a combination thereof. The plastic materials of the first substrate <b>10</b> and the third substrate <b>30</b> may include, for example, polyimide (PI), polycarbonate (PC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), other suitable plastic materials, or a combination thereof, but not limited thereto. According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the first substrate <b>10</b> and the third substrate <b>30</b> may be soda-lime glass substrates, but are not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The first conductive layer <b>12</b> and the third conductive layer <b>32</b> may include transparent conductive materials, such as indium tin oxide (ITO), antimony doped tin oxide (ATO), and fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO), but not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The first alignment layer <b>14</b> and the third alignment layer <b>34</b> have the ability to align liquid crystal molecules, so that the liquid crystal molecules are aligned in a specific alignment direction. The first alignment layer <b>14</b> and the third alignment layer <b>34</b> may be manufactured by, for example, coating an alignment material (such as polyimide, PI) on the substrate and then performing an alignment treatment to the alignment material, such as rubbing alignment treatment, photo alignment treatment, ion beam alignment treatment, plasma beam alignment, but not limited thereto. According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the alignment directions of the first alignment layer <b>14</b> and the third alignment layer <b>34</b> are substantially perpendicular to each other.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The first dye-doped liquid crystal layer <b>50</b> includes liquid crystal molecules and at least one type of dye molecules. Due to the refractive index anisotropy of liquid crystal molecules, light with different polarization directions will have different refractive indices when passing through liquid crystal molecules. Accordingly, liquid crystal materials may modulate the polarization direction of light. Each of the liquid crystal molecules may a shape equivalent to long strip (long rod). The direction of a long axis (molecular axis) of each of the liquid crystal molecules is consistent with the direction of an optic axis of the liquid crystal molecule. In addition, according to the dielectric anisotropy of the liquid crystal molecules, the liquid crystal molecules may be positive-type (positive dielectric anisotropy) or negative-type (negative dielectric anisotropy). More specifically, when the long axis of the liquid crystal molecule is parallel to the direction of the applied electric field, the liquid crystal molecules is positive-type. On the other hands, when the short axis of the liquid crystal molecule is parallel to the direction of the applied electric field, the liquid crystal molecule is negative-type. According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the first dye-doped liquid crystal layer <b>50</b> may include nematic liquid crystal molecules, smectic liquid crystal molecules, or cholesterol liquid crystal molecules, but are not limited thereto. The first dye-doped liquid crystal layer <b>50</b> may further include other components, such as chirality molecules or other property-adjusting components.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The dye molecules in the first dye-doped liquid crystal layer <b>50</b> may be any suitable dichroic dyes. For example, the dye molecules suitable for the first dye-doped liquid crystal layer <b>50</b> may have a geometric anisotropy, long-rod shaped with a long axis (molecular axis) and a short axis, and different absorption rates for visible light along the long axis and the short axis. In particular, selective absorption of dichroic dyes is more obvious for polarized lights. Dye molecules absorbing light component parallel to the long axis (light absorption axis) are positive-type dichroic dye. In contrast, dye molecules absorbing light component parallel to the short axis are negative-type dichroic dye.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">It is noticeable that the orientations of the dye molecules and the liquid crystal molecules in the dye-doped liquid crystal layer <b>50</b> are significantly correlated and the long axes of the dye molecules are usually parallel to the long axes of the liquid crystal molecules. This is because that the dye molecules may be forced to twist by the liquid crystal molecules. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, the molecular axis <b>50</b>&#x2032; of the liquid crystal molecules are naturally parallel to the first alignment direction <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the first alignment layer <b>14</b>, and the molecular axis <b>50</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; of the dye molecules are parallel to the molecular axis <b>50</b>&#x2032; of the liquid crystal molecules and the first alignment direction <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the first alignment layer <b>14</b>. For example, in an embodiment, the first alignment direction <b>14</b><i>a </i>may be the direction D<b>2</b>, and consequently the molecular axis <b>50</b>&#x2032; of the liquid crystal molecules and the molecular axis <b>50</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; of the dye molecules are parallel to the direction D<b>2</b>. Therefore, by controlling the orientations of the liquid crystal molecules by applying an electric field, the control over the orientations and the light-absorbing states of the dye molecules may be achieved.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The type of dye molecules may be selected based on filling ability and compatibility with the liquid crystal molecules. Other factors such as light resistance (light stability) and heat resistance (thermal stability) are also important. According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the dye molecules of the dye-doped liquid crystal layer <b>50</b> may absorb visible light. For example, the dye molecules may absorb light of wavelength between 380 nm and 780 nm. According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the dye molecules, for example, may be azo-based dichroic dyes or anthraquinone-based dichroic dyes.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The second liquid crystal cell <b>1</b>B may be manufactured on the first liquid crystal cell <b>1</b>A. For example, the fourth alignment layer <b>38</b> is then formed on the fourth conductive layer <b>36</b> on the second surface <b>30</b><i>b </i>of the third substrate <b>30</b>. Afterward, a pre-cutting step is performed on the third substrate <b>30</b> to form a pre-cutting mark <b>60</b> on the third substrate <b>30</b> to define a portion of the third substrate <b>30</b> (and the conductive layers thereon) to be removed in a later process. The pre-cutting mark <b>60</b> may be approximately located between the sealant <b>40</b> and the dummy sealant <b>42</b>. The dummy sealant <b>42</b> may provide temporary support for the pre-cut portion of the third substrate <b>30</b> and prevent it from peeling off in subsequent processes. The materials and manufacturing methods of the fourth conductive layer <b>36</b> and the fourth alignment layer <b>38</b> may be the same with respect to the first conductive layer <b>12</b>, the third conductive layer <b>32</b>, the first alignment layer <b>14</b> and the third alignment layer <b>34</b> as described above, and are not repeated here for the sake of simplicity.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Subsequently, the sealant <b>44</b> and the dummy sealant <b>46</b> disposed outside the sealant <b>44</b> are formed on the second surface <b>30</b><i>b </i>of the third substrate <b>30</b>. The second dye-doped liquid crystal layer <b>52</b> is then formed in the area surrounded by the sealant <b>44</b>. Afterward, the second substrate <b>20</b> having the second conductive layer <b>22</b> and a second alignment layer <b>24</b> formed on the surface therefore is provided and bonded to the third substrate <b>30</b> by the sealant <b>44</b> and the dummy sealant <b>46</b>.

According to an embodiment, the second dye-doped liquid crystal layer <b>52</b> may be formed by one drop fill (DOF) process before bonding the second substrate <b>20</b> to the third substrate <b>30</b>, or by vacuum suction process after bonding the second substrate <b>20</b> to the third substrate <b>30</b>, but not limited thereto. Subsequently, a cutting step is performed to cut the first substrate <b>10</b> along the cutting mark <b>62</b> and cut the second substrate <b>20</b> along the cutting mark <b>64</b>. Then, the unnecessary portions of the first substrate <b>10</b>, the second substrate <b>20</b> and the third substrate <b>30</b> and films thereon are removed along the cutting marks <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> and the pre-cutting mark <b>60</b> to obtain the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. It is noteworthy that the pre-cutting mark <b>60</b> is formed by partially cut the third substrate <b>30</b> without cutting through the third substrate <b>30</b>. The unnecessary portions of the third substrate <b>30</b> are removed at the same time when cutting the first substrate <b>10</b> and the second substrate <b>20</b>.

According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the second dye-doped liquid crystal layer <b>52</b> may include the same composition as the first dye-doped liquid crystal layer <b>50</b>. For example, the second dye-doped liquid crystal layer <b>52</b> and the first dye-doped liquid crystal layer <b>50</b> may have same liquid crystal molecules and dye molecules, but the proportion of the compositions may be adjusted according to demand.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to some embodiments of the present disclosure, the pre-cutting and cutting steps may make the sidewalls of the first substrate <b>10</b>, the third substrate <b>30</b>, and the second substrate <b>20</b> misaligned along the normal direction of the surface <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the first substrate <b>10</b> (such as the direction D<b>1</b>). That is, the sidewalls of the first substrate <b>10</b>, the third substrate <b>30</b>, and the second substrate <b>20</b> are not located on a same vertical plane. In this way, the required electrical connections between the first conductive layer <b>12</b>, the third conductive layer <b>32</b>, the fourth conductive layer <b>36</b>, and the second conductive layer <b>22</b> may be obtained.

In other words, the light absorption axes of the dye molecules may be kept parallel to the alignment direction of the alignment layer, so that the light absorption efficiency of the dye molecules may be improved. Problems of light leakage at a large viewing angle may also be reduced. Furthermore, by forming two stacked liquid crystal cells to absorb specific polarized lights by sharing the third substrate, the overall thickness of the electronic device may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Those skilled in the art will readily observe that numerous modifications and alterations of the device and method may be made while retaining the teachings of the disclosure.
