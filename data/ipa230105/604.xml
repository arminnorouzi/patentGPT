No. 63/217,447 filed Jul. 1, 2021 entitled Midline Marker for Sling Implant, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Anatomical tissues may become weakened or damaged by age, injury, or disease. The weakening of the structural integrity of anatomical tissues may have significant medical consequences. One such consequence is the development of Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) affecting primarily women, but also men. The most common treatment of SUI involves placement of implants, for example, a sling, a patch, or a mesh, under the bladder neck or the mid-urethra to provide a urethral support platform. Providing support to the mid-urethra maintains the urethra in the normal anatomical position and eliminates the symptoms of SUI.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The placement of a sling at the mid-urethra to treat SUI involves some procedural challenges. Such procedural challenges involve visualizing the mid-section of the sling during the implantation and/or identification of the twisting of the protective cover or sleeve of the sling during implantation. The midsection of the sling should typically be located where an anatomical site, such as a mid-urethra or bladder neck of the patient, needs to be supported. To visualize the mid-section of the sling, different types of colored markers or tabs are being used at a mid-section of the protective sleeve as a visual guide to allow the ready identification of the mid-section of the sling during the implantation. However, the designs of the market-available markers or tabs may still impede clear visualization of the sub-urethral portion of the sling and may not provide enough rigidity to the sleeve material at the central point and contribute to undesirable twisting of the sleeve of the sling during implantation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Hence, there exists a need to develop a robust midline marker to mark the midsection of the sling which can be easily attached to the mid-section of the protective sleeve of the sling as a visual aid to allow ready identification of the mid-section of the sling during implantation and which provides rigidity to the sleeve material at the central point and inhibits twisting of the sleeve during the surgery.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention generally relates to systems and methods for treatment of stress urinary incontinence both male and female humans or animals.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention may include a sleeve, a sling inserted within the sleeve, and a midline marker through which the sleeve may be routed.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The sleeve may comprise a first portion, a second portion, and an opening or gap between the first portion and the second portion.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The sleeve may comprise an opaque surface and a transparent surface. The opaque surface may be colored, and the transparent surface may be clear to provide contrast between the surfaces. The opening or gap may be positioned at the approximate mid-point of a length of the sleeve.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The sling may comprise an elongated member such as a rectangular, elongated strip comprised of a color that is different from the color of the opaque surface of the sleeve. One or both ends of the sling may be tapered.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The midline marker may aid in implantation of the sleeve and sling at a desired location with a patient's body by, e.g., inhibiting the sleeve from sliding off or otherwise being removed from the sling during placement of the sling.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The mid-section of the sleeve may be wrapped around the midline marker to form a channel through the center of the midline marker.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The midline marker may comprise a base and a pair of walls extending upwardly from the base.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The midline marker may comprise a first opening extending along the first wall and a second opening extending along the second wall. The first and second openings of the midline marker may be aligned.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The midline marker may comprise a third opening at or near a bottom of the midline marker.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The midline marker may be colored with a color different than both the color of the opaque surface of the sleeve and the color of the sling.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention may include a pair of dilator tubes attached at the terminal ends of the sleeve. The dilator tubes may comprise a contrast color different than the colors of the opaque surface of the sleeve, the sling, and the midline marker for easy visualization of each component during the placement of the sling.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Each dilator tube may comprise a notch positioned at or near the proximal portion. The notch may be suitable for the entry of a needle of a delivery device for delivering the sleeve and sling assembly inside the body of a patient.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The delivery device for the implantation of the sling may include a needle attached to a handle. The needle may be sized and shaped to slidably fit within the lumens of the dilator tubes. The needle and the handle of the delivery device may be substantially in the same plane or in different planes, and the needle may include sections located in different planes. The needle may include a conical distal tip and may have a sharp or blunt end. The distal tip of the needle may be designed for suitably being placed inside the tapered closed of the dilator tube during the delivery of the implant system.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present invention may provide a method for delivering a sling of a sling assembly at the mid-urethra of a patient to treat SUI. In the sling assembly, the transparent surface of the sleeve may pass through the slots or openings and wrap over the walls of the midline marker to form a channel over the central region of the midline marker and the sling may be positioned inside the pockets of the sleeve. During the procedure, the sling assembly may be delivered inside the body of a patient through the delivery device and adjusted at the correct treatment location by tracking the position of the midline marker which may be positioned at approximately mid-point of the sleeve of the sling. The medical operator may insert various cutting tools known in the art to cut the transparent surface of the sleeve through the channel formed over the center of the midline marker. This will enable the sleeve to be slid off from the sling and finally out of the body of the patient. Once the sleeve is separated, the medical operator may be able to grip the midline marker to remove, it leaving the sling positioned at the respective mid-urethra or bladder neck of the patient.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">These and other aspects, features and advantages of which embodiments of the invention are capable of will be apparent and elucidated from the following description of embodiments of the present invention, reference being made to the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a top view of a protective sleeve without a sling according to one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a top view of a sling according to one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrates a top view of a transparent side of the protective sleeve including the sling according to one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> illustrates a top view of a substantially opaque side of the protective sleeve including the sling according to one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> illustrates a top view of a transparent side of a colored protective sleeve including the sling according to one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> illustrates a top view of a substantially opaque side of the colored protective sleeve including the sling according to one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of a midline marker according to one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a side view of a midline marker according to one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a perspective front view of a midline marker according to one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of an assembly of the midline marker of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>7</b></figref> with the protective sleeve of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> according to one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates a perspective side view of the assembly of the midline marker and the protective sleeve as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> according to one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates a perspective top view of the assembly of the midline marker and the protective sleeve as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> according to one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of an assembly of the midline marker with the protective sleeve including the sling according to one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates a top view of a dilator tube according to one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> illustrates a top view of an assembly of the midline marker with the protective sleeve having the sling and the dilator tube according to one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> illustrates a side view of the attachments of the protective sleeve with the dilator tube and the sling with the dilator tube.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> illustrates a top view of a sling delivery device according to one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> illustrates a sling delivery system employing the full sling assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> and the sling delivery device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Specific embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.
