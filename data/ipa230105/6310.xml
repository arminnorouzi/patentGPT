It is urgent to increase the operating voltage of a lithium-ion battery to meet higher requirements posed in the market.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An existing method for increasing the operating voltage of the lithium-ion battery is to connect two electrode assemblies in series in the same packaging shell.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Such a series connection structure is generally a three-layer composite structure containing a bonding layer, a partition layer, and a bonding layer in sequence, in which a partition plate is adopted. To implement sealing, the partition plate needs to be hermetically connected to both an upper packaging body and a lower packaging body of the packaging shell simultaneously. Because the partition plate is relatively thick, the increase of the energy density of the lithium-ion battery is affected. In addition, the partition plate is not conducive to folding a seal edge, or an internal stress is excessive after the edge folding, consequently reducing the sealing reliability of the lithium-ion battery.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This application provides an electrochemical device and an electronic device containing same to increase an energy density thereof.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A first aspect of this application provides an electrochemical device. The electrochemical device includes a packaging shell, a first electrode assembly, a second electrode assembly, and a partition plate. The packaging shell includes a first packaging body and a second packaging body. The first packaging body is provided with a first dent and a first flange connected to a sidewall of the first dent, and the second packaging body is provided with a second dent and a second flange connected to a sidewall of the second dent. The first electrode assembly is disposed in the first dent, and the second electrode assembly is disposed in the second dent. The partition plate includes a partition layer and a first bonding layer located on a first surface of the partition layer. The first surface is opposite to an inner surface of the first packaging body. The partition plate is located between the first packaging body and the second packaging body. Along a first direction, the first flange and the second flange each comprise a first region and a second region; in the first region, the flange overlaps the partition plate in a second direction; in the second region, the flange extends beyond an edge of the partition plate. The first direction is a width direction of the first flange and the second flange, and the second direction is a thickness direction of the partition plate. Airtightness is implemented between the first region of the first flange and the first bonding layer, and airtightness is implemented between the second region of the first flange and the second region of the second flange, so that the partition plate fits with the first packaging body and the second packaging body to form mutually independent cavities on two sides of the partition plate respectively.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The partition plate according to this embodiment of this application includes the partition layer and the first bonding layer, and is relatively thin and occupies a relatively small space inside the packaging shell, thereby helping to increase the energy density of the electrochemical device. In addition, the reduced thickness of the partition plate and a hot sealing manner provided in this application can reduce a thickness of a seal edge, and further reduce a folding stress of the seal edge, thereby improving the sealing reliability of the electrochemical device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an implementation solution of this application, the first bonding layer is located at least in a peripheral region of the first surface of the partition layer, and an area of the peripheral region is not less than an area of the first region. Therefore, all other regions of the partition plate may be set to be the partition layer while it is ensured that the partition plate is hermetically connected to the first region, thereby further reducing the thickness of the partition plate.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an implementation solution of this application, the partition plate further includes a second bonding layer located on a second surface of the partition layer. The second bonding layer is located at least on the periphery of the second surface of the partition layer. The first region of the second flange and the second bonding layer are in airtight connection. Therefore, the partition plate can be bonded to both the first flange and the second flange, and can make the electrochemical device more hermetic as a whole, thereby further improving the sealing reliability of the electrochemical device.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an implementation solution of this application, along the first direction, the second region further includes a second sub-region I and a second sub-region II. The second sub-region II is located on a side of the second sub-region I away from the first region. A thickness of the second sub-region II is less than a thickness of the second sub-region I. Therefore, the seal edge is further thinned to reduce the folding stress of the seal edge, thereby improving the sealing reliability of the electrochemical device.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an implementation solution of this application, a width of the first region is greater than or equal to 0.8 mm, and a width b of the second region is greater than or equal to 0.8 mm.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an implementation solution of this application, a material of the partition layer includes at least one of a metal material, a first polymer material, or a carbon material; and a material of the first bonding layer and/or the second bonding layer includes the first polymer material.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an implementation solution of this application, the metal material includes at least one of Ni, Ti, Cu, Ag, Au, Pt, Fe, Co, Cr, W, Mo, Al, Mg, K, Na, Ca, Sr, Ba, Si, Ge, Sb, Pb, In, Zn, stainless steel (SUS), a combination or alloy thereof, or the like.

The packaging shell <b>40</b> includes a first packaging body <b>41</b> and a second packaging body <b>42</b>, where the first packaging body <b>41</b> is provided with a first dent <b>411</b> and a first flange <b>412</b> connected to a sidewall of the first dent <b>411</b>, and the second packaging body <b>42</b> is provided with a second dent <b>421</b> and a second flange <b>422</b> connected to a sidewall of the second dent <b>421</b>. The first electrode assembly <b>11</b> is disposed in the first dent <b>411</b>. The second electrode assembly <b>12</b> is disposed in the second dent <b>421</b>. The partition plate <b>20</b> includes a partition layer <b>201</b> and a first bonding layer <b>202</b> located on a first surface of the partition layer <b>201</b>. The partition plate <b>20</b> is located between the first packaging body <b>41</b> and the second packaging body <b>42</b>. Along a first direction x (that is, a width direction of the first flange <b>412</b> and the second flange <b>422</b>), the first flange <b>412</b> and the second flange <b>422</b> each include a first region <b>601</b> in which the flange overlaps the partition plate <b>20</b> in a second direction y (that is, a thickness direction of the partition plate <b>20</b>), and a second region <b>602</b> in which the flange extends beyond an edge of the partition plate <b>20</b>. Airtightness is implemented between the first region <b>611</b> of the first flange and the first bonding layer <b>202</b>, and airtightness is implemented between the second region <b>612</b> of the first flange and the second region <b>622</b> of the second flange, so that mutually independent cavities (not shown in the drawing) are formed on two sides of the partition plate <b>20</b> respectively. The electrode assembly <b>10</b> and an electrolyte (not shown in the drawing) are sealed in each of the cavities independently.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The first flange <b>412</b> includes a top seal edge <b>4121</b>, a bottom seal edge <b>4122</b>, a first lateral seal edge <b>4123</b>, and a second lateral seal edge <b>4124</b>. The width direction of the first flange <b>412</b> varies adaptively with the top seal edge <b>4121</b>, the bottom seal edge <b>4122</b>, the first lateral seal edge <b>4123</b>, and the second lateral seal edge <b>4124</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the width direction of the top seal edge <b>4121</b> and the bottom seal edge <b>4122</b> is the direction indicated by w<sub>1</sub>, and the width direction of the first lateral seal edge <b>4123</b> and the second lateral seal edge <b>4124</b> is the direction indicated by w<sub>2</sub>. A person skilled in the art understands that the width direction of the second flange <b>422</b> is interpreted in the same way as the width direction of the first flange <b>412</b>, and is not interpreted herein in detail.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the electrochemical device <b>100</b> according to this application, the partition plate <b>20</b> includes a partition layer <b>201</b> and a first bonding layer <b>202</b> located on a first surface of the partition layer <b>201</b>. A total thickness of two layers of partition plates is generally less than a total thickness of two layers of aluminum plastic films. Therefore, the partition plate <b>20</b> according to this application is relatively thin. The partition plate <b>20</b> applied to the electrochemical device <b>100</b> can reduce the volume and weight of the electrochemical device <b>100</b>, thereby increasing the energy density of the electrochemical device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Understandably, alternatively, depending on the variation of adjacent positions between the first bonding layer <b>202</b> and the first packaging body <b>41</b> and the second packaging body <b>42</b>, airtightness is implemented between the first region <b>621</b> of the second flange and the first bonding layer <b>202</b>, and airtightness is implemented between the second region <b>612</b> of the first flange and the second region <b>622</b> of the second flange. This prevents a relatively thick seal edge from being formed by extending the edge of the partition plate <b>20</b> to the outermost ends of the first flange <b>412</b> and the second flange <b>422</b>, where the thick seal edge includes three stacked layers: the first flange <b>412</b>, the partition plate <b>20</b>, and the second flange <b>422</b>. The thickness of the seal edge in this application is less than the thickness of the three-layer stacked seal edge. This facilitates folding of the seal edge and reduces the folding stress of the seal edge, thereby improving the sealing reliability of the electrochemical device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments of this application, the first bonding layer <b>202</b> is located at least in a peripheral region of the first surface of the partition layer <b>201</b>, and an area of the peripheral region is not less than an area of the first region. Understandably, in some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the first bonding layer <b>202</b> overlays the periphery of the first surface of the partition layer <b>201</b>. In other embodiments, the first bonding layer <b>202</b> overlays the entire first surface of the partition layer <b>201</b>. With the first bonding layer <b>202</b> disposed, the partition plate <b>20</b> is hermetically fixed to the first packaging body <b>41</b> or the second packaging body <b>42</b> to form a cavity. Then, the first packaging body <b>41</b> and the second packaging body <b>42</b> are sealed to form another cavity. The internal space of the packaging shell <b>40</b> is partitioned into two independent cavities. In this way, each electrode assembly <b>10</b> together with the electrolyte is sealed in an independent cavity. Ion insulation is implemented between the cavities to avoid a short circuit inside the electrochemical device <b>100</b> and electrolyte decomposition under a high voltage. Further, the disposition ensures a sufficient region of bonding between the edge of the partition plate <b>20</b> and the first region <b>601</b>, thereby improving the safety performance of the electrochemical device <b>100</b> in use and ensuring an effective electrical energy output of the electrochemical device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments of this application, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the partition plate <b>20</b> further includes a second bonding layer <b>203</b> located on a second surface of the partition layer <b>201</b>. The second bonding layer <b>203</b> is located at least on the periphery of the second surface of the partition layer <b>201</b>. Airtightness is implemented between the first region <b>621</b> of the second flange and the second bonding layer <b>203</b>. Specifically, in some embodiments, the first bonding layer <b>202</b> overlays the periphery of the first surface of the partition layer <b>201</b>, and the second bonding layer <b>203</b> overlays the periphery of the second surface of the partition layer <b>201</b>. In some other embodiments, the first bonding layer <b>202</b> overlays the periphery of the first surface of the partition layer <b>201</b>, and the second bonding layer <b>203</b> overlays the entire second surface of the partition layer <b>201</b>. The second bonding layer <b>203</b> is located on the second surface of the partition layer <b>201</b> so that airtightness is implemented between the first region <b>621</b> of the second flange and the second bonding layer <b>203</b>. In this way, airtightness is implemented between the first region <b>611</b> of the first flange and the first bonding layer <b>202</b> of the partition plate <b>20</b>, and airtightness is implemented between the first region <b>621</b> of the second flange and the second bonding layer <b>203</b>. In this way, the partition plate <b>20</b> is bonded to both the first flange <b>412</b> and the second flange <b>422</b>, thereby improving the overall airtightness of the electrochemical device <b>100</b>, reducing electrolyte leakage hazards more effectively, and improving the sealing reliability of the electrochemical device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments of this application, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the width a of the first region <b>601</b> is greater than or equal to 0.8 mm, and the width b of the second region <b>602</b> is greater than or equal to 0.8 mm. By controlling the width a of the first region <b>601</b> to fall within the above range, at least some extent of airtightness is ensured between the first region <b>601</b> and the partition plate <b>20</b>. By controlling the width b of the second region <b>602</b> to fall within the above range, at least some extent of airtightness is ensured between the first packaging body <b>41</b> and the second packaging body <b>42</b>. Therefore, by setting the width a of the first region <b>601</b> and the width b of the second region <b>602</b> to fall within the above ranges simultaneously, the solution disclosed herein can further improve the sealing performance of the electrochemical device <b>100</b>, and thereby improve the sealing reliability of the electrochemical device <b>100</b>. In some embodiments of this application, for simplicity of the sealing process, the thickness of the first region <b>601</b> is the same as the thickness of the second region <b>602</b>. In other words, the outer surfaces of the first flange <b>412</b> and the second flange <b>422</b> that contain the first region <b>601</b> and the second region <b>602</b> are flat.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Further, along the second direction, the first flange <b>412</b> and the second flange <b>422</b> overlap to form a seal edge. A single-fold structure or a double-fold structure may be selected as the folded-edge structure of the seal edge, depending on the width a of the first region <b>601</b> and the width b of the second region <b>602</b> as well as the total thickness of the electrochemical device <b>100</b>. With the single-fold structure or double-fold structure formed, the electrochemical device <b>100</b> is further downsized, thereby increasing the energy density of the electrochemical device <b>100</b>. The bonding material required for forming the single-fold structure or double-fold structure is not particularly limited in this application as long as the objectives of this application can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments of this application, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, along the first direction x, the second region <b>602</b> further includes a second sub-region I <b>6021</b> and a second sub-region II <b>6022</b>. The second sub-region II <b>6022</b> is located on a side that is of the second sub-region I <b>6021</b> and that is away from the first region <b>601</b>. The thickness of the second sub-region II <b>6022</b> is less than the thickness of the second sub-region I <b>6021</b>, so that the second region <b>602</b> forms a stepped shape. Understandably, the second region <b>612</b> of the first flange includes a second sub-region I <b>6121</b> of the first flange and a second sub-region II <b>6122</b> of the first flange. The second region <b>622</b> of the second flange includes a second sub-region I <b>6221</b> of the second flange and a second sub-region II <b>6222</b> of the second flange. This can reduce the sealing thickness at the ends of the first flange <b>412</b> and the second flange <b>422</b>, reduce the folding stress, and improve the sealing effect of the packaging shell <b>40</b>, thereby improving the sealing reliability of the electrochemical device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The manner of forming the second region <b>602</b> is not particularly limited in this application, as long as the objectives of this application can be achieved. In some embodiments, regions that are of the first flange <b>412</b> and the second flange <b>422</b> and that extend beyond the edge of the partition plate <b>20</b> are sealed by using a heat-sealing head. The surface of the heat-sealing head is designed to be stepped. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, a second sub-region II <b>6022</b> is formed on a side that is of the second sub-region I <b>6021</b> and that is away from the first region <b>601</b>. In this way, the stepped design of the heat-sealing head can also reduce the thickness of the seal edge, so as to form a relatively thin second sub-region II <b>6022</b>. Therefore, the design facilitates folding of the seal edge and reduces the folding stress of the seal edge. In addition, an extrusion force brought by the designed steps further helps to exhaust the gas at the heat-seal joint between the first flange <b>412</b> together with the second flange <b>422</b> and the end face of the partition plate <b>20</b>, thereby increasing the bonding force between the end face of the partition plate <b>20</b> and the second region <b>602</b>, and improving the sealing effect.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Specifically, in some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the second sub-region I <b>6021</b> transitions to the second sub-region II <b>6022</b> through a vertical step. The vertical step designed increases the bonding force between the end face of the partition plate <b>20</b> and the second region <b>602</b>, and enhances airtightness between the partition plate <b>20</b> and the second region <b>602</b>. In some other embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the second sub-region I <b>6021</b> transitions to the second sub-region II <b>6022</b> through an oblique step. The oblique step designed prevents the packaging shell <b>40</b> from undergoing an excessive tensile stress during heat sealing, thereby reducing the hazard of tearing of the packaging bag caused by the excessive stress, and further improving the sealing reliability of the electrochemical device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments of this application, the material of the partition layer <b>201</b> includes at least one of a metal material, a first polymer material, or a carbon material. The material of the first bonding layer <b>202</b> and/or the second bonding layer <b>203</b> includes the first polymer material. In this application, the type of the metal material is not particularly limited, as long as the objectives of this application can be achieved. For example, the metal material may include at least one of Ni, Ti, Cu, Ag, Au, Pt, Fe, Co, Cr, W, Mo, Al, Mg, K, Na, Ca, Sr, Ba, Si, Ge, Sb, Pb, In, Zn, stainless steel (SUS), a combination or alloy thereof, or the like. In this application, the type of the first polymer material is not particularly limited, as long as the objectives of this application can be achieved. For example, the first polymer material may include at least one of polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, polyethylene glycol naphthalate, polyether ether ketone, polyimide, polyamide, polyethylene glycol, polyamide imide, polycarbonate, cyclic polyolefin, polyphenylene sulfide, polyvinyl acetate, polytetrafluoroethylene, polymethylene naphthalene, polyvinylidene difluoride, polyethylene naphthalate, polypropylene carbonate, poly(vinylidene difluoride-hexafluoropropylene), poly(vinylidene difluoride-co-chlorotrifluoroethylene), organosilicon, vinylon, polypropylene, acid anhydride modified polypropylene, polyethylene, ethylene and a copolymer thereof, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, polyether nitrile, polyurethane, polyphenylene ether, polyester, polysulfone, poly(amorphous &#x3b1;-co-olefin), or a derivative thereof.

The metal material is reliable for serving a partitioning function, and is highly tough and compact, and can be processed to a thinner size to increase the energy density of the electrochemical device <b>100</b>. Preferably, the material of the partition layer <b>201</b> includes a carbon material. The carbon material achieves excellent safety performance and heat conductivity, and is very reliable under a high temperature. Preferably, the material of the partition layer <b>201</b> includes a first polymer material. The density of the first polymer material is low, thereby reducing the weight of the partition plate and increasing the energy density of the electrochemical device <b>100</b>. In addition, the first polymer material generates are less prone to generate scraps in a case of mechanical abuse (such as nail penetration, impact, and crush), and is more effective in wrapping a mechanically broken surface, thereby improving safety performance in the case of mechanical abuse, increasing the safety test pass rate, and further improving the safety performance of the electrochemical device <b>100</b>. Preferably, the material of the partition layer <b>201</b> includes a composite material compounded of at least two of a first polymer material, a metal material, or a carbon material. The type of the composite material is not particularly limited, as long as the objectives of this application can be achieved. For example, the composite material may include a Ni-metal foil composite PP film, an Ag-metal foil composite PET film, a polyurethane-stainless steel-polyurethane composite material, a PP-Al-PP composite material, or the like.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments of this application, the thickness of the partition plate <b>20</b> is 30 &#x3bc;m to 100 &#x3bc;m, and preferably, 50 &#x3bc;m to 80 &#x3bc;m.

When the partition plate <b>20</b> is excessively thin (for example, thinner than 30 &#x3bc;m), the capability of the partition plate <b>20</b> in separating from the electrolytic solution will be affected, and the electrolytic solution in the cavities on both sides of the partition plate <b>20</b> is prone to penetrate the partition layer <b>201</b> of the partition plate <b>20</b>, consequently affecting the electrochemical performance of the electrochemical device <b>100</b>. When the partition plate <b>20</b> is excessively thick (for example, thicker than 100 &#x3bc;m), the volume of the electrochemical device <b>100</b> is increased, consequently reducing the energy density of the electrochemical device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In this application, the thicknesses of the partition layer <b>201</b>, the first bonding layer <b>202</b>, and the second bonding layer <b>203</b> are not particularly limited, as long as the objectives of this application can be achieved.

For example, the thickness T (unit: mm) and the width W (unit: mm) of the seal edge satisfy 0.01&#x2264;T/W&#x2264;0.05. With the ratio of T to W falling within the above range, it is ensured that the battery is well sealed and the service life of the battery is increased. When the ratio of T to W is too low, the sealing thickness may be insufficient and the sealing effect may be poor, consequently reducing the environmental stability of the battery. For example, the water vapor in the environment is prone to penetrate into the battery, thereby increasing the moisture content in the battery, decomposing the electrolyte, and reducing the service life of the battery. If the ratio of T to W is too high, the sealing width W may be too small, also leading to a poor sealing effect and reducing the environmental stability of the battery. For example, the water vapor in the environment is prone to penetrate into the battery, thereby increasing the moisture content in the battery, causing problems such as electrolyte decomposition, and reducing the service life of the battery. In this application, neither the sealing thickness nor the sealing width is particularly limited, as long as the objectives of this application can be achieved. For example, the width W of the seal edge is preferably 1 mm to 7 mm. It needs to be noted that, in a sealing process, the polymer material in the packaging shell <b>40</b> and the sealing material are sealed together by hot pressing. Therefore, the sealing thickness T includes a thickness of a product of fusing the sealing material with the polymer material in the inner layer of the packaging shell <b>40</b>.
