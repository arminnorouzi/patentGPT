It is often the interface presented by the computing device that defines or constrains the way in which a human is allowed to interact with the computing device. Computing devices used in gaming environments, often referred to as gaming devices, Electronic Gaming Machines (EGMs), or the like, tend to have a specific interface that requires the user to interact with the device in a particular way. In a casino where revenue is driven by humans playing games (e.g., interacting with gaming devices), it is important to make the interface of the gaming device attractive and easy to use so that the user experience with the gaming device is not only enjoyable, but an experience that the user wants to duplicate.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A gaming device interface may be improved by incorporating additional user input devices, user output devices, or combinations thereof. Other solutions to improving interactions between humans and computers is to provide humans with machine-readable tokens or tags that, when presented to a computer, enable the computer to execute a particular function or provide some particular output. Again, in the context of casinos and gaming environments, users may be provided with tickets (e.g., a card or paper with a barcode or QR code printed thereon), loyalty cards (e.g., a plastic card having a magstripe provided thereon), or the like. A user may be allowed to present the ticket or loyalty card to a gaming device (e.g., by having the ticket scanned or swiping the plastic card through a magstripe reader) to cause the gaming device to perform some particular function.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In certain embodiments, the present disclosure relates to a method, gaming system, and server that enable gaming features with a tag having conductive, coded ink provided thereon. In some embodiments, a method of providing game features to a user is provided, comprising: providing a tag with an encoded physical medium that is readable by a touch-capable user interface; determining that the tag has been read by a touch-capable user interface of a gaming device in combination with detecting a gesture of the user at the touch-capable user interface of the gaming

with detecting the gesture of the user at the touch-capable user interface of the gaming device; and updating, based on enabling the gaming device to provide the predetermined game feature, an electronic record associated with the tag to indicate that the predetermined game feature has been enabled based, at least in part, on determining that the tag has been read by the touch-capable user interface of the gaming device in combination with detecting the gesture of the user at the touch-capable user interface of the gaming device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, a gaming system is provided, comprising: a processor; and a computer-readable storage medium, coupled with the processor, comprising instructions that are executable by the processor, where the

disclosure will be described in connection with a tag (e.g., an identification tag) having printed conductive, coded ink on at least one surface thereof. As will be described in further detail herein, the printed conductive, coded ink may correspond to one example of an encoded physical medium that is readable by a touch-capable user interface of a gaming device. The printed conductive, coded ink, in some embodiments, is readable by one or more capacitive sensors provided in the touch-capable user interface. While the term &#x201c;printed&#x201d; is used to refer to the conductive, coded ink, it should be appreciated that the ink may be applied to the tag using any type of material application process (e.g., inkjet printing, screen printing, masking, film deposition, Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD), adhesion, etc.). Another example of an encoded physical medium that is readable by a touch-capable user interface includes an optically-readable physical medium. The optically-readable physical medium may have data that is readable by a touch-capable user interface that employs optical sensors instead of or in addition to capacitive sensors. In some embodiments, the physical medium is encoded based on the pattern in which the physical medium is provided on the tag. As an example, the patterning of the physical medium when printed on the tag may be similar to the patterning of traditional ink when printing a barcode or QR code. The particular way in which the physical medium is provided on parts of the tag (and not provided on other parts of the tag) may be recognized and decoded by a device reading the tag with its touch-capable user interface.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Because the tag can have its encoded physical medium read by a touch-capable user interface, there is no need to equip a gaming device with additional interface devices for the sole purposes of reading data from the tag. Rather, the same interface device that is used to interact with a user (e.g., the touch-capable user interface) can also be used to read data from the tag. As compared with traditional magstripe cards, which require the gaming device to have a dedicated magstripe reader to read the magstripe card, gaming devices according to the present disclosure can read data from a tag with an interface device that is providing other capabilities and functions. This ultimately decreases the costs associated with producing a gaming device and increases the likelihood that users will enjoy their experience with the gaming device.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, the tag(s) described herein may take on many different types of form factors. For example, a tag could be a ticket, a voucher, or a plastic card. The tag may be activated by first putting it on any touch-capable user interface and by touching the tag at one or more predefined areas, so that the touch-capable user interface recognizes both the finger's position through the tag and the tag's unique code at the finger's specific position. Following, the unique code on the tag may trigger a certain action on the device.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Embodiments discussed herein may focus on such identification tags available in the casino or gaming environment, in terms of anonymous player tags with conductive, coded ink. This type of tag can be activated/used with any capacitive or optical-sensing device (e.g. an EGM's touch screen, a mobile communication device's touch screen, etc.). The tag might be a type of a re-usable, anonymous player tag with enhanced player interaction and with added functionality. One aspect of the present disclosure is to provide players with a personal but anonymous tag they can use within a casino environment and save information on, without giving the casino personal information.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Benefits provided by the present disclosure include, without limitation: the ability to avoid verifying personal contact information; easy and fast &#x201c;account&#x201d; creation and login (e.g., a player just has a tag with a unique tag identification (ID) number&#x2014;but no need to share personal information, hand over signatures, or other confirmations); the anonymous tag can be activated with a simple gesture; enables the creation and saving of progress/settings/game statistics without person-related information; can be used with any capacitive or optical-sensing display device (e.g., no hardware upgrade is required and no card reader is required; and there becomes an opportunity of entirely substituting ticket-in/ticket-out devices in EGMs by using a player convenient, secure, and cost-saving alternative with conductive, coded ink tags.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, the user/player may be provided an anonymous player tag when they visit the casino. Specifically, the player would receive a new tag in &#x201c;default mode&#x201d; at the entrance (for free or for a fee). During the casino visit, the tag is useable at multiple different games and machines, data collected is saved to the card. At the end of the user's/player's visit the tag may be returned to the casino and data is deleted from the tag after the visit.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an alternative embodiment, the user/player visiting the casino may be provided a new tag (for free or for a fee) and keep it as long as wanted, re-use it over multiple casino visits, and give it back or throw it away whenever it is no longer desired. The user/player may be allowed to keep the tag as a &#x201c;personal casino card&#x201d;, although it does not contain private information.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">One aspect of the present disclosure is to provide an anonymous player tag. In some embodiments, the tag has a unique tag ID so that the gaming system can clearly distinguish between different tags. The tag ID is in no way related to any type of personal player information&#x2014;so the usage of these tags enables complete anonymity.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Another aspect of the present disclosure is to provide a database with server and ID-related information linked therein. In some embodiments, the tag's ID is stored in a database which administers multiple different tag IDs for a population of tags. To each tag ID, specific information might be linked (e.g., number of remaining uses, number of uses in the past, date of last usage, number of different usage types such as usage A or usage B, handout date of the tag, expiring date of the tag, etc.). The use of a database as disclosed herein may enable players to save play progress all while maintaining anonymity within the gaming system. For instance, playing progress made in the casino with a certain tag might be saved to the tag's ID. The progress made might be restored at an EGM at another time. Progress may be saved in a number of different ways. As one example, progress may be saved and then restored using EGM settings such as volume, language, and wager settings. As another example, loyalty and experience information may be saved and stored by tracking collected loyalty points or experience points as part of a casino loyalty program. As another example, cash information may be saved by transferring cash/credit information from a tag's memory to an EGM and vice versa. In this particular example, the tag ID may be used as an alternative to a ticket-in-ticket-out (TITO) system that causes each EGM to print a different ticket when a user is done playing the EGM. Instead, the information associated with the user's game play status at an EGM can be stored in connection with the tag ID at a centralized database and then retrieved from another EGM when the user presents their tag to the next EGM.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Another aspect of the present disclosure is to enable cross game and device usage. For instance, usage of a tag as disclosed herein may provide the ability of using one tag on multiple gaming machines of the same or different type. Activating a tag might enable different or similar functionality at different machines. Game progress, bonuses, experience points might be collected at EGM A and transferred to another EGM B to continue collecting there whereas EGM B might be of the same or another kind as EGM A.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Another aspect of the present disclosure is to provide a time-dependent activation context. In some embodiments, activating a tag in different activation contexts might lead to different activation actions in the gaming environment/casino. For instance, a context based on daytime may result in activating a tag with a daytime context that leads to other results than in the evening (e.g., happy hour between X p.m. and Y p.m. &#x2014;where &#x201c;All activations count double&#x201d;). As another example, a context may be based on a casino event. In this example, activating a tag at a specific casino events might lead to other results than on a regular day (e.g. at an Egypt event, all activations on an Egyptian-themed EGM give better conditions). As yet another example, the tag activation may be based on game experience and the tag may be configured to trigger different actions at the gaming device based on activation history of the tag such as Activation 1: &#x201c;Newcomer activation&#x201d;, Activation 2: &#x201c;Advanced activation&#x201d;, and Activation 3: &#x201c;Experienced activation&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As mentioned above, the tag may enable anonymity. The tag may also be configured to provide one or more additional privacy functions. In some embodiments, the tag might contain specific functions for player security/privacy matters to validate the user and prevent thievery (e.g. combine with an on-display code terminal, digital signage or similar lock mechanisms which only allow card activation by entering the correct code).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, the tag may facilitate reservations of another machine, for example during tournament participation. The tag may be used to reserve a free space at another gaming device by activating the tag at the current gaming device. The other gaming device may be locked for a period of time until the player has arrived at the other machine.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, personalized tags may be utilized. Instead of anonymous tags, also personalized tags are considerable because a tag's ID could be directly related to personal player information such as name, gender, age, etc., through which personalized offerings are enabled (e.g. birthday bonus, personal welcome greetings, etc.). In this way, the personalized tag may facilitate advanced features such as a connect to mobile feature. In a connect to mobile feature, the user could place the tag on a personal mobile communication device's screen to save and restore information via the mobile communication device. Enabling usage of a player's mobile communication device may result in cross-channel offerings such as transferring game progress from casino to online casino and vice versa. Likewise, the mobile communication device may be used to enable a secure and trusted connection to the player's personal bank account, thereby facilitating money transfers from the bank account to the tag ID and vice versa. Additional details will now be described for various in which a tag (whether anonymous or personalized) as disclosed herein may be used to enhance a player's experience in a gaming environment.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Gaming System</heading><p id="p-0052" num="0051">With reference initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, details of an illustrative gaming system <b>100</b> will be described in accordance with at least some embodiments of the present disclosure. The components of the gaming system <b>100</b>, while depicted as having particular instruction sets and devices, are not necessarily limited to the examples depicted herein. Rather, a system according to embodiments of the present disclosure may include one, some, or all of the components depicted in the system <b>100</b> and does not necessarily have to include all of the components in a single device. For instance, the components of a server <b>116</b> may be distributed amongst a plurality of servers and/or other devices (e.g., gaming devices, EGMs, mobile communication devices, etc.) in the system <b>100</b> without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The gaming system <b>100</b> is shown to include a communication network <b>104</b> that interconnects and facilitates machine-to-machine communications between one or multiple gaming devices <b>108</b>, a server <b>116</b>, and one or more databases <b>148</b>, <b>152</b>.

As a more specific example, the processor <b>120</b> may be provided as a microprocessor, Central Processing Unit (CPU), or plurality of microprocessors that are configured to execute the instructions sets stored in memory <b>124</b>. Upon executing the instruction sets stored in memory <b>124</b>, the processor <b>120</b> enables various game management, player authentication, and wager management functions of the server <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The memory <b>124</b> may include any type of computer memory device or collection of computer memory devices. Non-limiting examples of memory <b>124</b> include Random Access Memory (RAM), Read Only Memory (ROM), flash memory, Electronically-Erasable Programmable ROM (EEPROM), Dynamic RAM (DRAM), etc. The memory <b>124</b> may be configured to store the instruction sets depicted in addition to temporarily storing data for the processor <b>120</b> to execute various types of routines or functions. As an example, the memory <b>124</b> may a player profile management instruction set <b>136</b> that enables the processor <b>120</b> to store data into a player profile database <b>148</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In addition to managing player profile information, the server <b>116</b> may also be provided with a code validation instruction set <b>132</b> that, when executed by the processor <b>120</b>, enable the server <b>116</b> to manage tag ID numbers in a tag database <b>152</b>. As will be discussed in further detail herein, the tag database <b>152</b> may contain rich data associated with a population of tags <b>160</b> including a tag <b>156</b> that has been activated by a user <b>112</b>. Each tag <b>156</b> in the population of tags <b>160</b> may initially correspond to an inactivated tag and may remain in that state until such time as a player <b>112</b> presents the tag to an appropriate gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> to activate the tag. As will be discussed in further detail herein, activation of a tag <b>156</b> may require the player <b>112</b> to provide a gesture in combination with presenting the tag <b>156</b> to the gaming device <b>108</b> and/or mobile communication device <b>144</b>. The gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> may provide information extracted from the tag <b>156</b> (and possibly information related to the player's <b>112</b> gesture) to the server <b>116</b>. The server <b>116</b> may then utilize the code validation instruction set <b>132</b> to compare the data extracted from the tag <b>156</b> with data stored in the tag database <b>152</b> to determine whether to activate the tag and, if desired, whether to activate the tag <b>156</b> with a particular context or within a particular mode of operation (e.g., whether to enable certain features through future use of the tag <b>156</b>). Although depicted as being separate from the server <b>116</b>, the player profile database <b>148</b> and the tag database <b>152</b> (or data represented therein) may be stored internal to the server <b>116</b> (e.g., within the memory <b>124</b> of the server <b>116</b> rather than in a separate database).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">As will be discussed in further detail herein, a gesture may correspond to any action, motion, movement, combination of actions, combination of motions, combinations of movements, or the like that are taken by the user <b>112</b> or that are imparted to an object (e.g., a stylus) by the user <b>112</b> and that are recognizable by the gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b>. The way in which a gesture is recognizable by a gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> may depend upon the nature of the user interface provided on the gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device. In some embodiments, a gesture may only be recognizable by the gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> if there is a physical contact made between the user <b>112</b> (or an object moved by the user <b>112</b>) and the user interface of the gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b>. A touch-capable user interface having an array of capacitive sensors may correspond to a user interface that requires physical contact. Alternatively, a touch-capable user interface having one or more optical sensors that are used to detect and track motion of a user <b>112</b>, motion of a user's <b>112</b> finger, or motion of an object may not necessarily require direct physical contact to recognize motion and, therefore, recognize a gesture provided by the user. Non-limiting examples of gestures may include a tap, multiple taps within a predetermined amount of time, a touch, a swipe, a multi-directional swipe, a multi-finger touch, a multi-finger tap, a multi-finger swipe, drawing objects, palm presses, combinations thereof, or the like.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The memory <b>124</b> is also depicted to include a game management instruction set <b>140</b>. The game management instruction set <b>140</b>, when executed by the processor <b>120</b>, may enable the server <b>116</b> to facilitate various gameplay features and functions at the gaming devices <b>108</b> and/or mobile communication devices <b>144</b>. For instance, the game management instruction set <b>140</b> may be configured to manage wagers placed by players <b>112</b> at gaming devices <b>108</b> and/or mobile communication devices <b>144</b>, track game states at gaming devices <b>108</b> and/or mobile communication devices <b>144</b>, determine outputs to provide to the player <b>112</b> via a gaming device <b>108</b> and/or mobile communication device <b>144</b>, and/or manage game rules, settings, or preferences within the gaming system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The player profile management instruction set <b>136</b>, when executed by the processor <b>120</b>, may enable the server <b>116</b> to manage one or more data fields for a player profile, for example, stored in the player profile database <b>148</b> and/or cause a gaming device <b>108</b> to update an appropriate credit meter for the player <b>112</b> within the gaming device being played by the player <b>112</b>. In some embodiments, the player profile management instruction set <b>136</b> may be configured to create one or more player profiles and associated data structures within the player profile database <b>148</b>. A player profile, in some embodiments, may include player <b>112</b> identification information and a wager account record for the player. In some embodiments, the player profile management instruction set <b>136</b> may be responsible for managing electronic records of all players <b>112</b> within the gaming system <b>100</b> or a subset of players <b>112</b> within the gaming system <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the player profile management instruction set <b>136</b> may be responsible for updating a player profile to indicate that an associated player <b>112</b> is attempting to earn a bonus or jackpot based on an aggregation of events that can occur within the gaming system <b>100</b>. The player profile management instruction set <b>136</b> may be configured to work in synchronization with the code validation instruction set <b>132</b> to update a player profile in response to a player <b>112</b> activating a tag <b>156</b> and/or using a tag <b>156</b> during gameplay at a gaming device <b>108</b> and/or mobile communication device <b>144</b>. The player profile management instruction set <b>136</b> may also be configured to manage an anonymous player's <b>112</b> account based on that player's utilization of a tag <b>156</b> within the system <b>100</b>.

The display area <b>400</b> may be provided in some or all of a particular display screen <b>252</b> or with multiple display screens <b>252</b>. The display area <b>400</b> may be separated into two or more display portions or sub-areas <b>404</b>. Although shown as including six different portions <b>404</b>, it should be appreciated that the display area <b>400</b> may include greater or fewer portions <b>404</b>, in similar or different proportions and/or sizes, than illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>.

The display portions <b>404</b> may or may not also correspond to predetermined input areas of the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b>. As will be discussed in further detail herein, the placement of a tag <b>156</b> at a particular location (e.g., within a particular portion <b>404</b>) of the display area <b>400</b> and reading of data from the tag <b>156</b> with sensors located in that particular location may cause different actions to occur at the gaming machine <b>108</b> and/or mobile communication device <b>144</b>.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> illustrates a tag <b>156</b> being brought within proximity of the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b>.

For instance, one function may be performed if the contact area <b>412</b> (e.g., the area in which the tag <b>156</b> is detected) is coincident with a first portion <b>404</b> whereas a different function may be performed if the contact area <b>412</b> is coincident with a second portion <b>404</b> that is different from the first portion.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref> illustrates that a player's hand <b>416</b> may also be used to provide a gesture <b>420</b> input to the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b>. In some embodiments, the gesture <b>420</b> input may be provided within the contact area <b>412</b>, meaning that the same sensors used to extract data from the encoded physical medium <b>408</b> are also used to detect motion of the player's hand <b>416</b> in connection with registering the gesture <b>420</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref>, the motion of the gesture <b>420</b> may vary, even if the tag <b>156</b> is positioned within the same contact area <b>412</b>. Different gestures <b>420</b> may be used to drive different outputs or behaviors of the gaming device <b>108</b> and/or mobile communication device <b>144</b>. Likewise, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>F</figref>, a different direction of the gesture <b>420</b> in combination with positioning the tag <b>156</b> at a different portion <b>404</b> of the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> may cause the gaming device <b>108</b> and/or mobile communication device <b>144</b> to perform different functions or read the encoded physical medium <b>408</b> in a different way.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In some embodiments and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>G</figref>, it may be possible to provide one or more gestures <b>420</b> outside the contact area <b>412</b> and such gestures, when registered in combination with the detection of the tag <b>156</b> in contact or proximity with the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b>, may cause the gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> to perform different actions. In some embodiments, the different actions may correspond to performing different game play functions, enabling different game features, enabling different bonus features, making different wagers, etc. As can be appreciated, if the gesture <b>420</b> is not provided directly within the contact area <b>412</b>, then it may be useful to push the tag <b>156</b> into contact with the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> while performing the additional gesture <b>420</b> outside the contact area <b>412</b>. This contact between the tag <b>156</b> and touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> may enable the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> to read data from the encoded physical medium <b>408</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>H</figref> illustrates a tag <b>156</b> having multiple encoded physical media <b>408</b> thereon, where each encoded physical medium <b>408</b> occupies a different area of the tag <b>156</b>. In some embodiments, a first gesture <b>420</b> may be registered relative to and overlapping with the first encoded physical medium <b>408</b> and then a second gesture <b>420</b> may be registered relative to and overlapping with the second encoded physical medium <b>408</b>. The way in which the first and/or second gesture <b>420</b> are registered may depend upon the type of touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> being used and/or the way in which the physical medium <b>408</b> is provided on the tag <b>156</b>. For instance, if the encoded physical medium <b>408</b> is printed on the tag <b>156</b> as conductive ink and the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> registers a touch-based gesture <b>420</b> with capacitive sensors, then the first and/or second gesture <b>420</b> may be registered when the user physically contacts or presses the tag <b>156</b> into the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> with enough force to cause the capacitive sensors of the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> to recognize where the encoded physical medium <b>408</b> is printed on the tag <b>156</b> (and where the encoded physical medium <b>408</b> is not printed on the tag <b>156</b>). As discussed above, the first and/or second gesture <b>420</b> may correspond to any type of known gesture such as a touch, tap, swipe, swirl, multi-finger touch, multi-finger tap, multi-finger swipe, palm press, or combination thereof. The first and/or second gesture <b>420</b> does not necessarily need to include any motion simultaneous with contacting the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b>; rather, the first and/or second gesture <b>420</b> may include any user motion that is recognizable by the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> based on the sensors provided in the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b>. Providing a tag <b>156</b> with this type of configuration may enable different game play features to be performed depending upon which encoded physical medium <b>408</b> has the gesture <b>420</b> overlapping therewith and/or depending upon a direction of the gesture <b>420</b> itself. In some embodiments, the different encoded physical media <b>408</b> may have the same data encoded thereon or may have different data encoded thereon and the different data may be used to cause the gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> to perform different functions.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>I</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of a touch-capable user interface <b>256</b>, a tag <b>156</b>, and a player's <b>156</b> hand <b>416</b> relative to both the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> and tag <b>156</b>. In some embodiments, the tag <b>156</b> may be provided with a first surface <b>424</b> and an opposing second surface <b>428</b>. The first surface <b>424</b> may correspond to a surface that interacts with the player's hand <b>416</b> whereas the second surface <b>428</b> may correspond to a surface that interact with the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b>. In some embodiments, registration of a user gesture <b>420</b> and reading of data from the tag <b>156</b> at substantially the same time may require that the second surface <b>428</b> of the tag <b>156</b> be placed into close proximity or physical contact with the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> and the player's hand <b>416</b> be placed into physical contact with the first surface <b>424</b>. Thereafter, motion of the player's hand <b>416</b> may cause the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> to simultaneously recognize the gesture <b>420</b> and read data from the encoded physical medium <b>408</b>, which is positioned on the second surface <b>428</b> of the tag <b>156</b>.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Although the player's hand <b>416</b> is depicted and described as a hand, it should be appreciated that any object (whether handheld, a finger, etc.) can be used to perform the same function as described in connection with the player hand <b>416</b>.

It should also be appreciated that a gesture <b>420</b> may correspond to motion of the tag <b>156</b> relative to the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b>. For instance, touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> may recognize a gesture <b>420</b> as an action in which the player's hand <b>416</b> moves the tag <b>156</b> relative to the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b>. Other gestures <b>420</b> may include multi-touch gestures or multiple motions recognized by the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> over an extended period of time (e.g., an amount of time greater than 2 seconds).</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>J</figref> illustrates an example gaming user interface where a contact area <b>412</b> is provided in a particular display portion <b>404</b>.

It should be appreciated that the disclosed methods may be performed by one, some, or all of the devices depicted and described herein. Said another way, any device within the gaming system <b>100</b> may be used to perform some or all of a method depicted and described herein. Moreover, although certain steps are depicted as being performed in a certain order or in connection with a particular method, it should be appreciated that any method step depicted and described herein may be performed in combination with any other method step depicted and described herein.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a first method of enabling user interactions with a gaming device <b>108</b> (or mobile communication device <b>144</b>) will be described in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. The method begins by detecting a user gesture <b>420</b> at a touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> (step <b>504</b>). The method continues by detecting a tag <b>156</b> at the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> (step <b>508</b>). In some embodiments, the gesture <b>420</b> and tag <b>156</b> may be detected at substantially the same time or within a predetermined minimum amount of time. In some embodiments, the gesture <b>420</b> and tag <b>156</b> may be detected within the same contact area <b>412</b> of the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b>; however, it may be possible that the gesture <b>420</b> and tag <b>156</b> are detected in different portions <b>404</b> of the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b>.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The method may then continue by determining whether the tag <b>156</b> has data encoded thereon with an encoded physical medium <b>408</b> (step <b>512</b>). This may occur naturally, as a result of detecting the tag <b>156</b> or it may occur as a result of the gesture <b>420</b> being provided in combination with placing the tag <b>156</b> in close physical proximity or physical contact with the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b>. If no encoded physical medium <b>408</b> is detected on the tag <b>156</b>, then the method may continue with the gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> operating and producing an output solely based on the gesture <b>420</b> (step <b>536</b>).</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">If, however, the query of step <b>512</b> is answered positively, then the method may continue by determining whether or not the gesture <b>420</b> indicates a desire to read data from the tag <b>156</b> (step <b>516</b>). This determination may depend upon a location of the gesture <b>420</b> (e.g., whether or not the gesture <b>420</b> overlaps the contact area <b>412</b> of the tag <b>156</b>) and/or depending upon a direction of the gesture <b>420</b>. If it is determined that data is to be read from the tag <b>156</b>, then the method continues with the tag interaction instruction set <b>236</b> reading the data from the tag <b>156</b> via the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> (step <b>520</b>). The reading of data from the tag <b>156</b> may be performed via capacitive sensing, optical sensing, or a combination thereof, depending upon the capabilities of the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b>.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">The method then continues by determining an output to perform with the gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b>, based at least in part on the extracted data (step <b>524</b>). In some embodiments, as will be discussed in further detail herein, the device output may depend upon whether the tag <b>156</b> is already activated within the gaming system <b>100</b> or whether the tag <b>156</b> has yet to be activated within the gaming system <b>100</b>. Optionally, the gesture <b>420</b> may also be considered in connection with determining the action to perform at the gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> (step <b>528</b>). The method will then continue by enabling the gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> to perform the determined action (e.g., provide the determined output) based on the extracted tag data and, optionally, the gesture <b>420</b> (step <b>532</b>).</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a second method of enabling user interactions with a gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> will be described in accordance with at least some embodiments of the present disclosure. The method begins by determining that data extracted from a tag <b>156</b> via a touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> includes a tag ID (step <b>604</b>). The tag ID may be provided in any suitable format (e.g., number, alphanumeric string, hexadecimal code, etc.). The identification of the data as including a tag ID may be made by the tag interaction instruction set <b>236</b> and may depend upon detecting the data in a particular and expected format (e.g., a format consistent with known tag IDs).</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Upon determining that the tag data includes a tag ID, the method continues with the tag interaction instruction set <b>236</b> providing the tag ID to the game instruction set <b>220</b>, where it is determined whether or not the tag ID requires validation to enable further functions at the gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> that are provided by the tag <b>156</b> (step <b>608</b>). If the tag ID does not require validation, then the gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device may be enabled to perform an action based on the tag ID and/or the user gesture <b>420</b> received in combination with reading the tag ID (step <b>612</b>). In some embodiments, validation of the tag ID may not be required if the tag ID has previously been validated and the tag <b>156</b> is now identified as activated, if the action to be performed does not require validation of the tag ID, and/or the gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> has already validated the tag ID within a predetermined amount of time (e.g., during a current gaming session).</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">If the query of step <b>608</b> indicates a need to validate the tag ID (e.g., to activate the tag <b>156</b>), then the method continues with the gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> determining a network address for the server <b>116</b> that will be used to perform the code validation (step <b>616</b>). This may be automatically determined if there is a single/central server <b>116</b> used for validation purposes. Alternatively, the gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> may perform a network discovery routine and query known servers as to which server should be used for tag ID validation purposes.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">The method will then continue with the gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> transmitting the tag ID to the determined address (step <b>620</b>). The gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> will then wait for a response from the server <b>116</b>. Once the server <b>116</b> provides the response to the tag ID validation request (step <b>624</b>), the method may then continue with the gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device conditioning its output or actions based on the response received from the server <b>116</b>. In some embodiments, the output or actions performed by the gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> may also depend upon the tag ID itself and whether the tag ID was previously activated and had predetermined functions/features already earned in connection with the tag ID and stored in the tag database <b>152</b> (e.g., which game play features are already associated with the tag ID within the tag database <b>152</b>).</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, a third method of enabling user interactions with a gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> will be described in accordance with at least some embodiments of the present disclosure. The method begins by detecting the placement of a tag <b>156</b> into contact with a touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> (step <b>704</b>). The method then continues with the processor <b>204</b>, <b>304</b> executing the tag interaction instruction set <b>236</b> (step <b>708</b>). When executing the tag interaction instruction set <b>236</b>, processor <b>204</b>, <b>304</b> determines an orientation of the tag <b>156</b> on the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> (step <b>712</b>). As part of determining the orientation of the tag <b>156</b>, processor <b>204</b>, <b>304</b> may determine a position of the tag <b>156</b> relative to certain portions <b>404</b> of the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b>, a rotational position of the tag <b>156</b> (e.g., whether horizontally-oriented, vertically-oriented, diagonally-oriented, etc.), or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">As the processor <b>204</b>, <b>304</b> is registering an orientation of the tag <b>156</b>, the processor <b>204</b>, <b>304</b> may also execute the gesture interaction instruction set <b>232</b> to determine a direction of a user gesture <b>420</b> relative to the orientation of the tag <b>156</b> (step <b>716</b>). In particular, the processor <b>204</b>, <b>304</b> may exchange information between the gesture interaction instruction set <b>232</b> and the tag interaction instruction set <b>236</b> to determine if the gesture <b>420</b> overlaps the tag <b>156</b>, what direction the gesture <b>420</b> was provided relative to the tag <b>156</b>, and the like. This step may also include detecting an encoded physical medium <b>408</b> in combination with detecting the gesture <b>420</b>. If the encoded physical medium <b>408</b> is detected in combination with the gesture <b>420</b>, then the method continues with the tag interaction instruction set <b>236</b> extracting data from the encoded physical medium <b>408</b> of the tag <b>156</b> (step <b>720</b>).</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">The method then continues by comparing a direction of the gesture <b>420</b> (and possibly relationship of the direction with the tag <b>156</b>) with preprogrammed user gestures that are maintained by the gesture recognition instruction set <b>232</b> (step <b>724</b>). In this step, the method may also include referencing data extracted from the tag <b>156</b> (or determining a validity of the tag ID) to determine if the user gesture can be used as a user input and drive a user command. The method may then continue by determining that the direction of the user gesture corresponds to a particular user command from the programmed user gestures (step <b>728</b>). The command, when executed by the gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> may cause the device to perform an action consistent with the user command (step <b>732</b>). In some embodiments, performance of the user command may depend upon whether or not the tag has been successfully activated with the server <b>116</b> and/or whether the gesture successfully mapped to a recognized/programmed user gesture.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, another method of enabling user interactions with a gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> will be described in accordance with at least some embodiments of the present disclosure. The method begins by extracting data that has been encoded on the tag <b>156</b> with an encoded physical medium <b>408</b> (step <b>804</b>). In particular, the data is received at the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> and then extracted by processor <b>204</b>, <b>204</b> when executing the tag interaction instruction set <b>236</b>.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">The method then continues by determining that the extracted data includes or is associated with player preference information (step <b>808</b>). This determination may be made locally at the gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> (e.g., with assistance of game instructions <b>220</b>). Alternatively or additionally, the gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> may provide the extracted data to the server <b>116</b> where it is determined (e.g., with reference to the tag database <b>152</b> and player profile database <b>148</b>) that the extracted data is associated with player preference information. Alternatively or additionally, the extracted data may itself include the player preference information.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Based on the extracted data, the method continues with the processor <b>204</b>, <b>304</b> executing the game instruction set <b>220</b> and determining the player preferences for the game and, possibly, for enabling or disabling features of the gaming machine <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> during game play (step <b>812</b>). The processor <b>204</b>, <b>304</b> will then apply the player preferences to the game (step <b>816</b>) and cause game play actions to be performed in accordance with the player preferences (step <b>820</b>). It should be appreciated that player preferences may define wager preferences, bonus spin/play preferences, cash out preferences, device behavior preferences (e.g., lighting preferences, sound preferences, etc.), UI skin preferences, and the like. Any preferences capable of being accommodated by the current gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> may be provided whereas any preference that cannot be accommodated (e.g., because the device does not have appropriate hardware or software) will not be provided.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, yet another method of enabling user interactions with a gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> will be described in accordance with at least some embodiments of the present disclosure.

In some embodiments, the determination that extracted data from a tag <b>156</b> is associated with a player account can be performed at the server <b>116</b> by referencing the information from the tag database <b>152</b> with information at the player profile database <b>148</b>. In some embodiments, the tag ID may be extracted from the tag <b>156</b> and the tag ID may be stored in association with a player profile maintained at the player profile database <b>148</b>. In some embodiments, a field in the tag database <b>152</b> having the tag ID maintained therein may have a pointer or data reference to the player profile maintained in the player profile database <b>148</b>.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">When it is determined that the extracted data is associated with a player account, the method may continue with the server <b>116</b> providing the gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> with player credit information that is determined based on the information contained in the player profile database <b>148</b> (step <b>912</b>). In some embodiments, the tag ID may be used to determine that the player has a player account and the player account may indicate an amount of available wager credit that can be used at the gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> during game play. Upon receiving player credit information from the server <b>116</b>, the gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> may update the credit meter <b>224</b> to make the credits available to the player <b>112</b> during gameplay (step <b>916</b>). Furthermore, the amount of available credit may be displayed to the player <b>112</b> via the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> that was used to read that tag <b>156</b> and extract the data from the tag <b>156</b> (step <b>920</b>).</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, another method of enabling user interactions with a gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> will be described in accordance with at least some embodiments of the present disclosure.

The method then continues by determining that the player <b>112</b> desires to reserve a remotely-located gaming device <b>108</b> (step <b>1008</b>). In some embodiments, the determination of step <b>1008</b> is based on the gesture received in step <b>1008</b>. Alternatively or additionally, data contained on a tag <b>156</b> read at touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> used in combination with the gesture may provide the indication that the player <b>112</b> desires to reserve a remotely-located gaming device <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">In some embodiments, the reservation of a remotely-located gaming device <b>108</b> may be dependent upon the player <b>112</b> carrying an activated tag <b>156</b> and may further depend upon the tag <b>156</b> enabling a reservation feature when data is read from the tag <b>156</b>. If such a condition is required to reserve a gaming device <b>108</b> and the player <b>112</b> does not have a tag <b>156</b> that enables such a feature, then the player <b>112</b> may not be allowed to reserve a gaming device <b>108</b>; however, if the player <b>112</b> is carrying such a tag <b>156</b>, then the player <b>112</b> may be allowed to continue with the reservation.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">The method will then continue with the gaming device <b>108</b> at which the player <b>112</b> is currently located sending a reservation request to the remotely-located gaming device (step <b>1012</b>). In some embodiments, the reservation request may include data extracted from a tag <b>156</b> at the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> (e.g., a tag ID of the tag <b>156</b>). The method will then continue with the player <b>112</b> waiting for a receipt acknowledgement response (step <b>1016</b>). Upon receiving the acknowledgement that the remotely-located gaming device <b>108</b> is reserved, then the player <b>112</b> is allowed to walk to the remotely-located gaming device <b>108</b> and begin gameplay at the remotely-located gaming device <b>108</b> by presenting the same tag <b>156</b> used at the previous gaming device <b>108</b> and by providing an appropriate gesture in combination with presenting the tag <b>156</b> to the gaming device <b>108</b>.

The method begins by determining that a tag <b>156</b> has been read by a gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> (step <b>1504</b>). The determination may be made at the server <b>116</b> via one or more of the instruction sets stored in memory <b>124</b> or at a local instruction set being executed at the gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b>.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">The method continues by determining a context associated with the tag <b>156</b> being read by the gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> (step <b>1508</b>). In some embodiments, a context of the tag <b>156</b> read event may include a time of day at which the tag <b>156</b> was read, a device identified that was used to read the tag <b>156</b>, a location of the tag <b>156</b> and/or device used to read the tag <b>156</b>, a player loyalty account that is associated with the tag <b>156</b>, whether the tag is being used anonymously by the player <b>112</b>, whether the tag <b>156</b> is being used in connection with a gaming tournament, a game currently being played when the tag <b>156</b> was read by the device, or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">Other non-limiting examples of a context may include activation based on orientation, game experience, remaining credits, wager settings, timing, and/or swiping speed. A game situation-based context may be where activating the tag <b>156</b> in a base game might trigger another action in the base game or other game still in session. A game experience-based context may be where the tag <b>156</b> triggers different actions based on activation history of the tag <b>156</b>. A remaining credit-based context may be where the tag <b>156</b> will detect there are little or no credits and will offer Free Spins. Another example of a credit-based context is where the tag <b>156</b> receives above a credit threshold and offers in-game bonuses or other rewards. A timing-based context may be where some tags <b>156</b> may be activated prior to a reel spin to modify the potential outcome after the reels have stopped. Another example of a timing-based context is where some tags <b>156</b> might be activated when the reels already stand still to change the outcome even afterward. A swiping speed-based context may be where the outcome of the game might depend on a player's <b>112</b> swiping speed, whether the player <b>112</b> swipes quickly or slowly. Furthermore, any combination of these non-limiting contexts can be used to determine outcomes, give rewards, or vary odds.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">Based on the determined context, the method may then continue by identifying the candidate game features that are available to the player <b>112</b> (step <b>1512</b>).

It should be appreciated that the monitoring may occur across multiple gaming devices <b>108</b> or mobile communication devices <b>144</b> or the activation rules may require the activation to occur at a particular device, in which case the monitoring may occur with respect to the particular device and not other devices. In some embodiments, it may be an activation requirement that the player <b>112</b> activate the game feature at a different device from the device at which the opportunity was earned. In other words, the player <b>112</b> may be required to move to a different type of device to activate a particular game feature that was earned at an initial device.

During the presentation of the tag <b>156</b> and during receipt of the gesture, the method may continue by determining an area on the tag <b>156</b> over which the gesture is provided (step <b>1708</b>). The area over which the gesture is provided may be used to select a particular game feature from among a plurality of game features for activation (step <b>1712</b>). For instance, a gesture provided over one area of a tag <b>156</b> may result in activation of a first game feature whereas a gesture provided over a different area of a tag <b>156</b> may result in activation of a second, different, game feature. This may occur because the position of the gesture relative to the tag <b>156</b> is different and registered with the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> and/or because a gesture over one area of the tag <b>156</b> causes one set of data to be read at the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> whereas a gesture over a different area of the tag <b>156</b> causes a different set of data to be read at the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b>.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">The method then continues by enabling the gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> to provide the selected game feature to the player <b>112</b> (step <b>1716</b>). The method may also include updating an electronic record to reflect that the selected game feature was activated (step <b>1720</b>). In some embodiments, the electronic record may also be updated with information describing the area of the tag <b>156</b> over which the gesture was provided and/or the data read from the tag <b>156</b> as a result of the gesture being provided over the particular area of the tag <b>156</b>.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, still another method of enabling user interactions with a gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> will be described in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure.

In some embodiments, gaming graphics may be augmented to be displayed around or to enhance a presentation of the tag <b>156</b> while pressed against the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b>. In some embodiments, gaming graphics may be augmented to move from behind the position of the tag <b>156</b>, thereby making the gaming graphics visible while the tag <b>156</b> is pressed against the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b>. In some embodiments, the tag <b>156</b> may be provided with one or more view windows or openings and the gaming graphics may be augmented to present at least some graphics through the view window or opening of the tag <b>156</b>. Other augmentations of the gaming graphics are also possible without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">The method may then continue by enabling the gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> to provide the player <b>112</b> with the selected game feature (step <b>1824</b>). The method may further include updating an associated electronic record to indicate the activation of the game feature (step <b>1828</b>). In some embodiments, the electronic record may also be updated to include information describing how the gaming graphics were augmented in response to activation of the tag <b>156</b>.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, another method of enabling user interactions with a gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> will be described in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. The method begins by determining that a tag <b>156</b> has been read by a touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> and determining a time at which the tag <b>156</b> was read by the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> (step <b>1904</b>). This determination may be made locally (e.g., at the device having the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b>) and/or at the server <b>116</b> that receives a timestamp associated with the tag <b>156</b> read event.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">The method then continues by determining a set of game features that are eligible for activation (step <b>1908</b>). In some embodiments, the eligible game features may be determined based on the time at which the tag <b>156</b> was read. The determination of eligible game features may be made by the server <b>116</b> with reference to the tag database <b>152</b> (e.g., by referencing the activation rule(s) field <b>184</b> or by querying for information from the data structure <b>164</b>).</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">The method further continues by presenting the player <b>112</b> with the set of eligible game features for selection (step <b>1912</b>). In some embodiments, the presentation of the eligible game features may be provided via the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> that was used to read the tag <b>156</b>. The player <b>112</b> may then respond or select a particular game feature from the set of eligible game features (step <b>1916</b>). The player's <b>112</b> selection is then used to activate the selected game feature and enabling the gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> to provide the selected game feature (step <b>1920</b>). The method may further include updating the electronic record to indicate the activation of the game feature (step <b>1924</b>).</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">It should be appreciated that there are a large number of gaming use cases that can be enabled with a tag <b>156</b> having data encoded thereon that is readable by a touch-capable user interface <b>256</b>. There are anonymous-related use cases (e.g., where the tag <b>156</b> enables anonymous gameplay), personalization-related use cases (e.g., where the tag ID of the tag <b>156</b> is linked or associated with a player account and player information), and cash transfer-related use cases.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Additional Examples</heading><p id="p-0161" num="0160">Regarding anonymous-related use cases, anonymous players <b>112</b> may be allowed to collect and store bonus points on the card which are redeemable in the casino's loyalty program. It may also be possible to have game progress saved to a tag and continue playing at some other time (e.g., at a next casino visit). A player <b>112</b> may also be allowed to skip game instructions/tutorials at games they have already played with that tag <b>156</b>. Also, based on gambling experience, lock functionalities may be maintained in games until the anonymous player <b>112</b> has gained the required experience and proved that experience via presentation of the tag <b>156</b>. Once an achievement is collected, it is associated to the player's tag. It may also be possible to save personal game settings to the tag <b>156</b> and have those settings be restored (e.g., skins, language, volume, bet, denomination, speed, etc.). The tag <b>156</b> can also be considered akin to having cash saved to tag. It may also be possible to consider multiple tag types with different value&#x2014;players might pay for a &#x201c;premium tag.&#x201d; A premium tag might enable additional settings, game options, features, etc. that might not be available for players <b>112</b> without any tag at all, or for players without the &#x201c;premium tag.&#x201d; It may also be possible to enable an anonymous player <b>112</b> to collect bonus points and automatically upgrade to a premium experience once a spending threshold is reached. In some embodiments, the player <b>112</b> may be allowed to review game statistics of the current and/or previous game sessions (e.g., &#x201c;account&#x201d; statistics, sensitive cash statistics, etc.). As yet another example, when the casino calls out for casino tournament, the anonymous player <b>112</b> might register using the tag <b>156</b> activated at the gaming device <b>108</b> they are currently playing. Thus, the player <b>112</b> can finish their gaming session at the gaming device <b>108</b> and register for the tournament without the need to leave the gaming device <b>108</b> for the reservation. The reserved gaming device <b>108</b> at the tournament is locked until the tag ID of the tag <b>156</b> used by the player <b>112</b> is scanned.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">Regarding personalization-related use cases, players <b>112</b> may be enabled to: have loyalty points saved in association with their tag <b>156</b>; have game progress saved in association with the tag <b>156</b> and continue playing there at some other time (e.g. next casino visit); skip game instructions/tutorials at games they've already played; have personal game settings saved to tag <b>156</b> and restored (e.g., skins, language, volume, bet, denomination, speed, . . . ). The tag <b>156</b> can be used in the same way as having cash saved to card, (e.g., use as alternative to ticket-in, ticket-out). It may also be possible to consider multiple tag types with different value based on player's loyalty status (e.g. Standard user vs. VIP). The tag <b>156</b> could be encoded with data that contains or unlocks &#x201c;standard functions&#x201d; vs. &#x201c;VIP functions&#x201d;, could collect loyalty points and auto upgrade once a spending threshold is reached. A &#x201c;high roller&#x201d; tag <b>156</b> could be used by a player <b>112</b> allowing their own mathematics activated by tag (e.g., to enable a gaming device <b>108</b> to provide better odds for premium customers). The tag <b>156</b> may also provide security/privacy functions available directly by pressing/sliding the tag <b>156</b> over specific areas on the tag <b>156</b> (e.g., causing different encoded physical media <b>408</b> to be read by the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b>).</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">The tag <b>156</b> could also be used to implement a code terminal (e.g. digits 0-9, symbols to be pressed in a given order, dot-pattern like on mobile devices, etc.) directly on the tag and &#x201c;unlock&#x201d; tracking card where without the code, no other players can play features provided by the tag <b>156</b>. Continuing the code example, the code could be used to activate/deactivate specific in-game functions (e.g., High Roller Mode). The tag <b>156</b> could also be used to personalize cash-out tickets related to the player tag&#x2014;can only be redeemed with card/code. Such a code could enable &#x201c;Digital Signature&#x201d; for critical decisions, warnings, etc. The code may also be used to lock a gaming device <b>108</b> for a certain time by entering an unlock code. As discussed above, the tag <b>156</b> could also be used by the player <b>112</b> to register for and reserve a gaming device during a casino tournament.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">Regarding cash transfer related use-cases, a tag <b>156</b> could be linked to player tracking cards or loyalty cards (e.g., to collect loyalty points, etc.). The tag <b>156</b> could also be the same as a player tracking card (e.g., one card for all). The tag <b>156</b> may also be used as a cash alternative to pay at the bar, the casino venue, the casino hotel, car park, etc. In a very specific but non-limiting example, the tag <b>156</b> may enable Cash-In, Cash-Out Gestures to be provided in combination with the tag <b>156</b>. For instance, a left-to-right swipe may cause funds to be transferred from an account associated with the tag <b>156</b> to a gaming device <b>108</b> whereas a right-to-left swipe may cause funds to be transferred from the gaming device <b>108</b> to an account associated with the tag <b>156</b>. As another example, in the context of purchasing food or drinks directly from a gaming device <b>108</b>, the tag <b>156</b> could enable the player <b>112</b> to choose what they want, immediately pay by swiping, and then the casino knows from which gaming device <b>108</b> the order came, thereby facilitating a quick and efficient delivery of the drink to the appropriate gaming device <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">The present disclosure contemplates a variety of different gaming systems and environments each having one or more of a plurality of different features, attributes, or characteristics.

In one such embodiment in which the gaming system includes an EGM (or gaming device) and a central server, central controller, or remote host, computerized instructions for controlling any primary or base games displayed by the EGM (or gaming device) are communicated from the central server, central controller, or remote host to the EGM (or gaming device) in a thick client configuration, and computerized instructions for controlling any secondary or bonus games or other functions displayed by the EGM (or gaming device) are executed by the central server, central controller, or remote host in a thin client configuration.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">In certain embodiments in which the gaming system includes: (a) an EGM (or gaming device) configured to communicate with a central server, central controller, or remote host through a data network; and/or (b) a plurality of EGMs (or gaming devices) configured to communicate with one another through a communication network, the communication network may include a local area network (LAN) in which the EGMs (or gaming devices) are located substantially proximate to one another and/or the central server, central controller, or remote host. In one example, the EGMs (or gaming devices) and the central server, central controller, or remote host are located in a gaming establishment or a portion of a gaming establishment.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">In other embodiments in which the gaming system includes: (a) an EGM (or gaming device) configured to communicate with a central server, central controller, or remote host through a data network; and/or (b) a plurality of EGMs (or gaming devices) configured to communicate with one another through a communication network, the communication network may include a wide area network (WAN) in which one or more of the EGMs (or gaming devices) are not necessarily located substantially proximate to another one of the EGMs (or gaming devices) and/or the central server, central controller, or remote host. For example, one or more of the EGMs (or gaming devices) are located: (a) in an area of a gaming establishment different from an area of the gaming establishment in which the central server, central controller, or remote host is located; or (b) in a gaming establishment different from the gaming establishment in which the central server, central controller, or remote host is located. In another example, the central server, central controller, or remote host is not located within a gaming establishment in which the EGMs (or gaming devices) are located. In certain embodiments in which the communication network includes a WAN, the gaming system includes a central server, central controller, or remote host and an EGM (or gaming device) each located in a different gaming establishment in a same geographic area, such as a same city or a same state. Gaming systems in which the communication network includes a WAN are substantially identical to gaming systems in which the communication network includes a LAN, though the quantity of EGMs (or gaming devices) in such gaming systems may vary relative to one another.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">In further embodiments in which the gaming system includes: (a) an EGM (or gaming device) configured to communicate with a central server, central controller, or remote host through a data network; and/or (b) a plurality of EGMs (or gaming devices) configured to communicate with one another through a communication network, the communication network may include an internet (such as the Internet) or an intranet. In certain such embodiments, an Internet browser of the EGM (or gaming device) is usable to access an Internet game page from any location where an Internet connection is available. In one such embodiment, after the EGM (or gaming device) accesses the Internet game page, the central server, central controller, or remote host identifies a player before enabling that player to place any wagers on any plays of any wagering games. In one example, the central server, central controller, or remote host identifies the player by requiring a player account of the player to be logged into via an input of a unique player name and password combination assigned to the player. The central server, central controller, or remote host may, however, identify the player in any other suitable manner, such as by validating a player tracking identification number associated with the player; by reading a player tracking card or other smart card inserted into a card reader; by validating a unique player identification number associated with the player by the central server, central controller, or remote host; or by identifying the EGM (or gaming device), such as by identifying the MAC address or the IP address of the Internet facilitator. In various embodiments, once the central server, central controller, or remote host identifies the player, the central server, central controller, or remote host enables placement of one or more wagers on one or more plays of one or more primary or base games and/or one or more secondary or bonus games, and displays those plays via the Internet browser of the EGM (or gaming device). Examples of implementations of Internet-based gaming are further described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,764,566, entitled &#x201c;Internet Remote Game Server,&#x201d; and U.S. Pat. No. 8,147,334, entitled &#x201c;Universal Game Server.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">The central server, central controller, or remote host and the EGM (or gaming device) are configured to connect to the data network or remote communications link in any suitable manner. In various embodiments, such a connection is accomplished via: a conventional phone line or other data transmission line, a digital subscriber line (DSL), a T-1 line, a coaxial cable, a fiber optic cable, a wireless or wired routing device, a mobile communications network connection (such as a cellular network or mobile Internet network), or any other suitable medium. The expansion in the quantity of computing devices and the quantity and speed of Internet connections in recent years increases opportunities for players to use a variety of EGMs (or gaming devices) to play games from an ever-increasing quantity of remote sites. Additionally, the enhanced bandwidth of digital wireless communications may render such technology suitable for some or all communications, particularly if such communications are encrypted. Higher data transmission speeds may be useful for enhancing the sophistication and response of the display and interaction with players.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">It should also be appreciated that different types of game features may be provided by the system <b>100</b> without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. Some game features may be provided in response to a tag <b>156</b> being read at a touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> whereas other game features may be provided in the absence of a tag <b>156</b> being presented to a gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b>. As a non-limiting example, one possible game feature includes a &#x201c;One tag for multiple, selective activation options&#x201d; where one tag <b>156</b> is made available to trigger different actions (e.g., activating option 1 triggers event A, option 2 triggers B, option 3 triggers C, etc.). In this scenario, it could be possible to have multiple activation paths to swipe along, or multiple touch points to be touched only or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, not all activation options might be available at the same time. For instance, tag <b>156</b> could have a separate activation counter for each option (e.g. option 1: 5 activations left; option 2: 3 activations left; option 3: no activations left). As another example, it could be possible to limit some of the available activation options on the tag <b>156</b>, based on current game situation (some only available in base game, some only available in bonus feature, etc.).</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">As another game feature scenario that is contemplated by the present disclosure, it may be possible to provide a feature where multiple tags <b>156</b> are provided for multiple, pre-defined activation options. In this scenario, there might be a game situation in which the player <b>112</b> might want to decide which tag <b>156</b> to activate. Tag A might trigger option 1, whereas tag B might trigger option 2&#x2014;the player <b>112</b> chooses which tag <b>112</b> &#x26; option they prefer in the current game situation. It may also be possible to consider using these tags <b>156</b> in a sequence (e.g., using tag A first and tag B second might lead to another game situation than using tag B first and tag A second).</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">Yet another game feature may correspond to an extra pick in feature. In this example, by using a tag <b>156</b> a player <b>112</b> may be allowed to extend the number of available in-game pick options in a pick feature (e.g., Pick feature with 3 options, by having a tag activated, a 4th option becomes available).</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">Yet another game feature may correspond to a swipe to undo function. In this example, a player <b>112</b> can activate a particular undo action with a tag <b>156</b> or gesture. For instance, a previously made decision or pick might be unmade, and a new selection might be made instead (the tag <b>156</b> may contain a given number of times the undo action is made available). Alternatively, a tag <b>156</b> may be configured collect activations in game. In this scenario, during a gaming session, the player <b>112</b> might be able to collect or earn additional activations of the tag <b>156</b>.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">Still another game feature that can be made available with a tag <b>156</b> is a player competition with multiple tags. In a tournament-like game setting, players <b>112</b> might use multiple of their activation tags <b>156</b> in certain game situations through which they gain advantages over the other players. The players might be able to use one tag <b>156</b> during the whole competition, in a situation they prefer; or multiple times, based on the number of activations left on the tag <b>156</b>; or after every X minutes; etc.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">Another game feature that may be enabled with a tag <b>156</b> includes a feature of augmenting digital information based on physical information provided by the tag. It is contemplated to enable augmentations of gaming graphics based on a number of factors such as: the type of the tag <b>156</b>; the shape of the tag <b>156</b>; tag data; etc. so that the digital augmentation looks like an &#x201c;extension&#x201d; of the tag <b>156</b>. As another example, it may be possible have remarkable shapes of the tag <b>156</b> which augment the tag <b>156</b> well so that it is recognizable that the tag <b>156</b> and the game content are synched with each other. As another example, the tag <b>156</b> may have notches or holes cut into the tag <b>156</b> to augment themed information in the hole (e.g., counter of remaining activations). As another example, it may be possible to use tags constructed of different materials, such as non-transparent, semi-transparent or transparent materials and combine them to increase the variety of design elements (e.g., a tag <b>156</b> including paper combined with acrylic glass, whereas ink is printed on the paper and the glass is transparent to show digitally augmented content underneath). Still another possible augmentation is an augmentation where graphics are visualized during a gesture. In this visualize during a swipe game feature, as a player <b>112</b> swipes over the tag <b>156</b> or touches certain touch points on the tag <b>156</b>, visualizations appear indicating the swipe gesture. The visualization might be synchronous to the swiping finger's current position in real time. It may also be possible to add sounds or other acoustical effects as the player <b>112</b> is swiping.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">Possible use cases made possible by activation of a tag <b>156</b> are contemplated to include a multi-option selection where multiple areas on the tag <b>156</b> are used to make different selections, such as printed &#x201c;buttons&#x201d;, symbols, swipe gestures whereas each triggers a certain action. For instance, a gamble feature may have all 4 card colors on the tag <b>156</b>&#x2014;while gambling, place tag <b>156</b> on display, and choose one color directly on the tag <b>156</b>. If guessed correctly using the tag <b>156</b>, player <b>112</b> gains extra credits. Alternatively or additionally, several different objects on tag <b>156</b> (circle, triangle, square) could provide different triggers depending on which object is selected. As another example, the tag <b>156</b> may enable a double-up feature where the tag <b>156</b> is provided with 2-way selection and the player <b>112</b> decides whether to swipe &#x201c;top to bottom&#x201d; or &#x201c;bottom to top&#x201d;, different winnings depending on what player has chosen. It may also be possible to have a tag <b>156</b> enable a game feature such as a restricted function (e.g., a high roller mode of operation). Additionally, several different objects on tag <b>156</b> could be replaced, changed, and/or modify game content/rules on screen based on tag activation (e.g. in a video poker game). For instance, a player <b>112</b> may carry a physical &#x201c;Ace&#x201d; tag <b>156</b> that is configured to activate a card change event in a game if the player swipes their &#x201c;Ace&#x201d; tag <b>156</b> during game play. More specifically, a player <b>112</b> may be playing a video poker game and receive a set of cards during a card draw event. After the player <b>112</b> has been presented with their cards, the player <b>112</b> may present the &#x201c;Ace&#x201d; tag <b>156</b> to the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> and provide a gesture in combination therewith. Upon providing the gesture, the &#x201c;Ace&#x201d; tag <b>156</b> may be read by the gaming device <b>108</b> and the player <b>112</b> may be allowed to change one of their cards with an &#x201c;Ace&#x201d; card. The activation of this content modification or game rule change may correspond to a one-time use or multiple uses, depending upon limitations placed on the &#x201c;Ace&#x201d; tag <b>156</b>.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">In some embodiments, a player <b>112</b> may be allowed to utilize the tag <b>156</b> as a carry-along bonus tag through the venue. In this situation, the tag <b>156</b> operates as a promotional card in casino or VLT venue. The player <b>112</b> can swipe on touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> or the tag <b>156</b> and get their bonus, pick a prize, have options to use the tag at various times during a game, etc.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">As yet another example, the gaming device <b>108</b> and/or mobile communication device <b>144</b> may track swipe time and direction to enable more functionality. For instance, swipe time can be tracked and a skill game can be played based on the speed of the swipe (e.g., throw a ball into a basket (the faster the farther thrown)). Alternatively or additionally, settings may be adjusted based on swipe speed (e.g., adjust settings (the faster the greater the adjustments). There may also be multiple &#x201c;paths&#x201d; on the tag <b>156</b> to swipe along&#x2014;based on which path is taken, different actions happen (e.g., Pseudo-skill or Skill feature: like Pok&#xe9;mon Go&#x2014;&#x201c;How do I throw the Pokeball?&#x2014;analog paths printed on the card, ball is thrown differently based on path swiped along, etc.).</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">In some embodiments, the tag <b>156</b> may be used to invoke a game volatility feature. In this situation, activation of the tag <b>156</b> can increase/decrease game volatility (e.g., press arrow up or arrow down), and function is only available if the player <b>112</b> activates the volatility tag <b>156</b>. Likewise, individual game mathematics may be activated by the tag <b>156</b> (e.g., &#x201c;better math for premium customers&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0186" num="0185">Another illustrative game feature that can be activated with a tag <b>156</b> is an expanded pick feature. Without an appropriate tag <b>156</b>, player <b>112</b> can select 1 out of 3 options, but with the appropriate tag: 4 options (e.g., more risky selection, selection with special effects, etc.) can be revealed to the player <b>112</b>. In this scenario, the tag <b>156</b> may be used to present extra bonus options to the player <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0186">Still another game feature is a swipe to rewind function. In a pick feature, with the tag <b>156</b> activated, the player <b>112</b> can pick one selection, see the outcome&#x2014;and might be able to rewind their decision if they do not like the outcome. Then, the player <b>112</b> can select another option. This game feature could be like a bonus pick, saved on the tag <b>156</b>. If the tag <b>156</b> has no bonus picks left, then the function is unavailable.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0187">The tag <b>156</b> may also be presented to invoke a number of base game features. Examples of such features include, without limitation: Position a map on the middle roller and unlock/select additional pay lines; Conditional Wild to be placed on reel matrix&#x2014;Position stays Wild for X games (based on Wilds collected, player could decide how long Wild shall stay); Position a Wild Stack on the game with tag <b>156</b> before Reel Spin (or after Reel Spin); and/or Position a personal multiplier at a certain position in the matrix&#x2014;if there is a win, it's multiplied.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">The tag <b>156</b> may further be used to activate themed-card bonuses. For instance, if the player <b>112</b> collects multiple different tags <b>156</b>, then different tags <b>156</b> can be used to trigger something different within the game from a theme perspective. As an example, the player <b>112</b> may purchase a tag <b>156</b> with a &#xd7;2 cherry&#x2014;activation of such a tag <b>156</b> can redeem it in a game with cherry&#x2014;it counts double in case of win. As another example, tags <b>156</b> can be added as an ID so the gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b> would know what tags the player <b>112</b> possesses. The tags <b>156</b> could be used as a wild card or to invoke a bonus game to activate special functionality or features for a game. Many different tags <b>156</b> could be collected (&#x201c;collect them all&#x201d;) and let players play against each other&#x2014;avatar of player A fights avatar of player B. It may also be possible to enable players <b>112</b> to interact with bonus using a specific card and swiping. Each tag <b>156</b> would give a specific functionality at the gaming device <b>108</b> or mobile communication device <b>144</b>. As still another example, a player <b>112</b> may purchase multiple tags <b>156</b> and 1 or more activated tags <b>156</b> may give the player <b>112</b> a prize when swiped. This could be a separate game like a card game with multiple different characters fighting based on which tags <b>156</b> have been activated during the game.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0189">The tags <b>156</b> may also be used to enable game customization. For example, a player <b>112</b> can design their own game&#x2014;&#x201c;Transfer some symbol into the game&#x201d; (based on tag's <b>156</b> theme).</p><p id="p-0191" num="0190">Again, a position of the tag <b>156</b> relative to the touch-capable user interface <b>256</b> may also enable different game play experiences as a game feature. For instance, the tag <b>156</b> being presented in a landscape orientation may result in playing a 4&#xd7;5 Reel matrix whereas a presentation in the portrait orientation may result in playing a 5&#xd7;4 Reel matrix.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0191">As still another example, the tags <b>156</b> may enable loyalty features. For instance, after registration in the casino, the player <b>112</b> may get a free Welcome Bonus tag <b>156</b> (e.g. with 20 Free Spins (which can be used at any time by activating the tag <b>156</b>)). The tag could be used multiple times based on rules (e.g., tag <b>156</b> can be used 5&#xd7; until the tag <b>156</b> becomes invalid, tag <b>156</b> can be used once per hour/day etc. to incentivize the player <b>112</b> to keep the tag <b>156</b> and bring it back to casino next time.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0192">The tag <b>156</b> could also be used by a player <b>156</b> to collect game-internal points and auto upgrade a game once threshold number of activations is reached.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0193">The tag <b>156</b> can also be used to enable a reverse trading card game. A tag <b>156</b> that contains multiple items can be activated to implement certain items at appropriate times, as determined by the player.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0194">In some embodiments, the casino could utilize the tags <b>156</b> to implement its own lottery system. In such a scenario, the casino could have its own lottery and sell tags <b>156</b> that might have a wild symbol. The wild symbol could be used in a game of any type, including a lottery game, a slot game, etc.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0195">The tag <b>156</b> could also be used in connection with voucher promotions. It may be possible to utilize a tag <b>156</b> as a voucher within a casino magazine via a promotion campaign &#x201c;Try the new game on the casino floor&#x2014;redeem to get an extra award.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0197" num="0196">The tag <b>156</b> may also be distributed as part of a comeback bonus. If a player <b>112</b> loses a game, they may be provided with a tag <b>156</b> that, when later activated during a later visit, gives the player <b>112</b> an additional game incentive or feature.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197">As should be appreciated by one skilled in the art, aspects of the present disclosure have been illustrated and described herein in any of a number of patentable classes or context including any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof.
