These systems may be capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing the available system resources (such as time, frequency, and power). A wireless multiple-access communications system may include a number of base stations (BSs), each simultaneously supporting communications for multiple communication devices, which may be otherwise known as user equipment (UE).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To meet the growing demands for expanded mobile broadband connectivity, wireless communication technologies are advancing from the 3<sup>rd </sup>generation (3G) and 4<sup>th </sup>generation (4G, including long term evolution (LTE)) technologies to a next generation new radio (NR) technology, which may be referred to as 5<sup>th </sup>Generation (5G) or 5G NR. For example, NR is designed to provide a lower latency, a higher bandwidth or a higher throughput, and a higher reliability than 3G or LTE. NR is designed to operate over a wide array of spectrum bands, for example, from low-frequency bands below about 1 gigahertz (GHz) and mid-frequency bands from about 1 GHz to about 6 GHz, to high-frequency bands such as millimeter wave (mmWave (mmW)) bands. NR is also designed to operate across different spectrum types, from licensed spectrum to unlicensed and shared spectrum. Spectrum sharing enables operators to opportunistically aggregate spectrums to dynamically support high-bandwidth services. Spectrum sharing can extend the benefit of NR technologies to operating entities that may not have access to a licensed spectrum.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Wireless communication networks may support some combination of 2G, 3G, LTE, and 5G NR technologies. A UE may communicate with the wireless communication network using one or more of the 2G, 3G, LTE, and 5G NR technologies. For example, the UE may use 5G NR for some applications, such as data transmissions, and may use LTE for other applications, such as voice transmissions. A UE also may have access to wireless local area networks (WLANs) in the wireless communication network.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The systems, methods, and devices of this disclosure each have several innovative aspects, no single one of which is solely responsible for the desirable attributes disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure can be implemented in a method for wireless communication performed by a first node.

However, a person having ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that the teachings herein can be applied in a multitude of different ways. The examples in this disclosure are based on wireless network communications in wide area networks (WANs). However, the described implementations may be implemented in any device, system or network that is capable of transmitting and receiving radio frequency signals according to any of the wireless communication standards, including any of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 standards, the Bluetooth&#xae; standard, code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), orthogonal FDMA (OFDMA), single-carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA), Global System for Mobile communications (GSM), GSM/General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Enhanced Data GSM Environment (EDGE), Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA), Wideband-CDMA (W-CDMA), Evolution Data Optimized (EV-DO), 1&#xd7;EV-DO, EV-DO Rev A, EV-DO Rev B, High Speed Packet Access (HSPA), High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), High Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA), Evolved High Speed Packet Access (HSPA+), Long Term Evolution (LTE), 5<sup>th </sup>Generation (5G) or new radio (NR), Advanced Mobile Phone Service (AMPS), or other known signals that are used to communicate within a wireless, cellular or internet of things (IoT) network, such as a system utilizing 3G, 4G or 5G, or further implementations thereof, technology.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A wireless communication network (which also may be referred to as a wireless WAN or WWAN) may include base stations (BSs) that implement a 5G NR radio access technology (RAT) of a 5G NR network and BSs that implement an LTE RAT of an LTE network. The RATs of a WWAN also may be referred to as WWAN RATs. A user equipment (UE) of the wireless communication network may use the 5G NR RAT or the LTE RAT depending on which wireless coverage is available to the UE and which wireless coverage provides the best quality service.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The 5G NR BSs and UEs may have full duplex (FD) capabilities to perform FD transmissions. FD transmissions may include a downlink (DL) transmission from a BS to a UE that at least partially overlaps in time with an uplink (UL) transmission from the UE to the BS during a time period. FD transmissions may be performed when the BS and UE are operating in a FD mode that enables the BS and the UE to both transmit and receive. FD transmissions may be conditional on various factors, such as having sufficient beam separation and minimal clutter echo. For example, to reduce the self-interference from the UL transmission beam to its DL reception beam, the beams used for the UL and DL transmissions and receptions may be separated in order to have sufficient beam separation.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some aspects, a BS may transmit a first downlink control information (DCI) message to a UE to schedule an UL transmission and may transmit a second DCI message to the UE to schedule the DL transmission. The UE may receive the first and second DCI messages and identify the scheduled DL and UL transmissions. The UE also may determine whether the UL and UL transmissions are FD transmissions. In some aspects, after the UE receives the first DCI message, the UE may monitor for additional DCI messages, such as the second DCI message, to ascertain whether the UL transmission will be a full-duplex transmission or whether a DL transmission will be scheduled for FD operation.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some implementations, the BS may transmit a DCI message to the UE that indicates which FD UL and DL traffic scheduling combination is being scheduled by the BS. The DCI message may include an indication of the scheduled FD UL and DL traffic scheduling combination to differentiate between the various FD UL and DL traffic scheduling combinations. Each of the various FD UL and DL traffic scheduling combinations may include at least one UL transmission and at least one DL transmission. For example, the various FD UL and DL traffic scheduling combinations may include a first FD UL and DL traffic scheduling combination that includes physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) DL traffic and physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) UL traffic, a second FD UL and DL traffic scheduling combination that includes semi-persistent scheduling (SPS) DL traffic and PUSCH UL traffic, a third FD UL and DL traffic scheduling combination that includes PDSCH DL traffic and configured grant (CG) UL traffic, and a fourth FD UL and DL traffic scheduling combination that includes SPS DL traffic and CG UL traffic. The UE may receive the DCI message and may identify which FD UL and DL traffic scheduling combination is being scheduled by the BS based on the indication in the DCI message. The UL transmission and the DL transmission associated with the scheduled FD UL and DL traffic scheduling combination may at least partially overlap during a time period.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some implementations, the DCI message that includes the indication of the scheduled FD UL and DL traffic scheduling combination may have an existing DCI message format. In some implementations, the BS may generate the DCI message that includes the indication of the scheduled FD UL and DL traffic scheduling combination by compressing one or more fields of the DCI message, reusing one or more fields of the DCI message, or using one or more reserved bits of the DCI message to indicate the scheduled FD UL and DL traffic scheduling combination. In some implementations, the BS may use one or more dedicated bits or one or more special field bits of the DCI message for the indication of the scheduled FD UL and DL traffic scheduling combination. In some implementations, the indication of the scheduled FD UL and DL traffic scheduling combination may be a new identifier that indicates which one of the various FD UL and DL traffic scheduling combinations is being scheduled by the BS. The new identifier may be any number of bits, such as a 2-bit identifier or a 3-bit identifier. In some implementations, the BS may use a Radio Network Temporary Identity (RNTI) to indicate a DL transmission of the scheduled FD UL and DL traffic scheduling combination and may use one or more bits of the DCI message to indicate a UL transmission of the scheduled FD UL and DL traffic scheduling combination.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some implementations, the DCI message that includes the indication of the scheduled FD UL and DL traffic scheduling combination may have a new DCI message format. In some implementations, the new DCI message format may have a larger payload than the existing DCI message formats. The new DCI message format may include one or more dedicated fields or one or more dedicated bits in the payload that may be used for the indication of the scheduled FD UL and DL traffic scheduling combination.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some implementations, the BS may use an RNTI to indicate which one of the various FD UL and DL traffic scheduling combinations is being scheduled by the BS. For example, a first RNTI may indicate a first FD UL and DL traffic scheduling combination, a second RNTI may indicate a second FD UL and DL traffic scheduling combination, a third RNTI may indicate a third FD UL and DL traffic scheduling combination, and a fourth RNTI may indicate a fourth FD UL and DL traffic scheduling combination. The BS may use the selected RNTI for a DCI message having the existing DCI message format or the new DCI message format having the larger payload.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some implementations, when the BS uses two separate DCI messages to specify the allocations for the DL and UL transmissions, the BS may include an indication in the first DCI message that indicates whether there is a DL transmission scheduled during a first time period that may at least partially overlap in time with a UL transmission. The UE may initiate a power save mode that ceases monitoring for a DL transmission during the first time period if the indication indicates that a DL transmission is not scheduled during the first time period. The UE may continue monitoring for the DL transmission during the first time period if the indication indicates that the DL transmission is scheduled during the first time period and thus the scheduled DL transmission at least partially overlaps in time with the scheduled UL transmission.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Particular implementations of the subject matter described in this disclosure can be implemented to realize one or more of the following potential advantages. A DCI message including an indication of which FD UL and DL traffic scheduling combination is being scheduled by the BS may allow the UE to differentiate between the various FD UL and DL traffic scheduling combinations that are available during a FD mode. The BS scheduling FD transmissions using the DCI message may reduce latency, improve spectrum efficiency, and may result in the efficient use of communication resources. A DCI message including an indication that indicates when a DL transmission is not being scheduled at the same time period as a UL transmission may allow the UE to save power by ceasing monitoring for a DL transmission during the time period. Saving power at the UE may increase the battery life of the UE and thus may improve the overall performance of the UE and the user experience.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a system diagram of an example wireless communication network <b>100</b>. The wireless communication network <b>100</b> may be an LTE network or a 5G NR network, or a combination thereof. The wireless communication network <b>100</b> also may be referred to as a wide area network (WAN) or a wireless wide area network (WWAN). The wireless communication network <b>100</b> includes a number of base stations (BSs) <b>110</b> (individually labeled as <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B, <b>110</b>C, <b>110</b>D, <b>110</b>E, and <b>110</b>F) and other network entities. A BS <b>110</b> may be a station that communicates with UEs <b>120</b> and also may be referred to as an evolved node B (eNB), a next generation eNB (gNB), an access point, and the like. In some implementations, a BS <b>110</b> may represent an eNB of an LTE network or a gNB of a 5G NR network, or a combination thereof. Each BS <b>110</b> may provide communication coverage for a particular geographic area. In 3GPP, the term &#x201c;cell&#x201d; can refer to this particular geographic coverage area of a BS <b>110</b> or a BS subsystem serving the coverage area, depending on the context in which the term is used.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">ABS <b>110</b> may provide communication coverage for a macro cell or a small cell, such as a pico cell or a femto cell, or other types of cells. A macro cell generally covers a relatively large geographic area (such as several kilometers in radius) and may allow unrestricted access by UEs with service subscriptions with the network provider. A pico cell generally covers a relatively smaller geographic area and may allow unrestricted access by UEs with service subscriptions with the network provider. A femto cell generally covers a relatively small geographic area (such as a home) and, in addition to unrestricted access, also may provide restricted access by UEs having an association with the femto cell (such as UEs in a closed subscriber group (CSG), UEs for users in the home, and the like). A BS for a macro cell may be referred to as a macro BS. A BS for a small cell may be referred to as a small cell BS, a pico BS, a femto BS or a home BS. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the BSs <b>110</b>D and <b>110</b>E may be regular macro BSs, while the BSs <b>110</b>A-<b>110</b>C may be macro BSs enabled with three dimensions (3D), full dimensions (FD), or massive MIMO. The BSs <b>110</b>A-<b>110</b>C may take advantage of their higher dimension MIMO capabilities to exploit 3D beamforming in both elevation and azimuth beamforming to increase coverage and capacity. The BS <b>110</b>F may be a small cell BS which may be a home node or portable access point. A BS <b>110</b> may support one or multiple (such as two, three, four, and the like) cells.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The wireless communication network <b>100</b> may support synchronous or asynchronous operation. For synchronous operation, the BSs may have similar frame timing, and transmissions from different BSs may be approximately aligned in time. For asynchronous operation, the BSs may have different frame timing, and transmissions from different BSs may not be aligned in time.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The UEs <b>120</b> are dispersed throughout the wireless communication network <b>100</b>, and each UE <b>120</b> may be stationary or mobile. A UE <b>120</b> also may be referred to as a terminal, a mobile station, a wireless device, a subscriber unit, a station, or the like. A UE <b>120</b> may be a mobile phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a wireless modem, a wireless communication device, a handheld device, a wearable device, a tablet computer, a laptop computer, a cordless phone, a wireless local loop (WLL) station, a smart appliance, a drone, a video camera, a sensor, or the like. In one aspect, a UE <b>120</b> may be a device that includes a Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC). In another aspect, a UE may be a device that does not include a UICC. In some aspects, the UEs <b>120</b> that do not include UICCs also may be referred to as IoT devices or internet of everything (IoE) devices. The UEs <b>120</b>A-<b>120</b>D are examples of mobile smart phone-type devices that may access the wireless communication network <b>100</b>. A UE <b>120</b> also may be a machine specifically configured for connected communication, including machine type communication (MTC), enhanced MTC (eMTC), narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), and the like. The UEs <b>120</b>E-<b>120</b>L are examples of various machines configured for communication that access the wireless communication network <b>100</b>. A UE <b>120</b> may be able to communicate with any type of the BSs, whether macro BS, small cell, or the like. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a lightning bolt is representative of a communication link that indicates wireless transmissions between a UE <b>120</b> and a serving BS <b>110</b>, which is a BS designated to serve the UE <b>120</b> on the downlink and uplink, or desired transmission between BSs, and backhaul transmissions between BSs.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In operation, the BSs <b>110</b>A-<b>110</b>C may serve the UEs <b>120</b>A and <b>120</b>B using 3D beamforming and coordinated spatial techniques, such as coordinated multipoint (CoMP) or multi-connectivity. The macro BS <b>110</b>D may perform backhaul communications with the BSs <b>110</b>A-<b>110</b>C, as well as the BS <b>110</b>F (which may be a small cell BS). The macro BS <b>110</b>D also may transmit multicast services which are subscribed to and received by the UEs <b>120</b>C and <b>120</b>D. Such multicast services may include mobile television or stream video, or may include other services for providing community information, such as weather emergencies or alerts, such as Amber alerts or gray alerts.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The BSs <b>110</b> also may communicate with a core network. The core network may provide user authentication, access authorization, tracking, Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity, and other access, routing, or mobility functions. At least some of the BSs <b>110</b> (such as a gNB or an access node controller (ANC)) may interface with the core network through backhaul links (such as NG-C and NG-U) and may perform radio configuration and scheduling for communication with the UEs <b>120</b>. In various examples, the BSs <b>110</b> may communicate, either directly or indirectly (such as through core network), with each other over backhaul links, which may be wired or wireless communication links.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The wireless communication network <b>100</b> also may support mission critical communications with ultra-reliable and redundant links for mission critical devices, such as the UE <b>120</b>E, which may be a drone. Redundant communication links with the UE <b>120</b>E may include links from the macro BSs <b>110</b>D and <b>110</b>E, as well as links from the small cell BS <b>110</b>F. Other machine type devices, such as the UE <b>120</b>F and UE <b>120</b>G (such as video cameras or smart lighting), the UE <b>120</b>H (such as a smart meter), and UE <b>120</b>I (such as a wearable device) may communicate through the wireless communication network <b>100</b> either directly with the BSs, such as the small cell BS <b>110</b>F, and the macro BS <b>110</b>E, or in multi-hop configurations by communicating with another user device which relays its information to the wireless communication network <b>100</b>. For example, the UE <b>120</b>H may communicate smart meter information to the UE <b>120</b>I (such as a wearable device or mobile phone), which may report to the wireless communication network <b>100</b> through the small cell BS <b>110</b>F. The wireless communication network <b>100</b> also may provide additional network efficiency through dynamic, low-latency TDD/FDD communications, such as in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, as shown by UEs <b>120</b>J-<b>120</b>L. Furthermore, the wireless communication network <b>100</b> may include one or more access points (APs) <b>107</b> that are part of one or more wireless local area networks (WLANs). The APs <b>107</b> (which also may be referred to as WLAN APs) may provide short-range wireless connectivity to the UEs <b>120</b> of the wireless communication network <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some implementations, the wireless communication network <b>100</b> may utilize OFDM-based waveforms for communications. An OFDM-based system may partition the system BW into multiple (K) orthogonal subcarriers, which are also commonly referred to as subcarriers, tones, bins, or the like. Each subcarrier may be modulated with data. In some instances, the subcarrier spacing between adjacent subcarriers may be fixed, and the total number of subcarriers (K) may be dependent on the system BW. The system BW also may be partitioned into subbands. In other instances, the subcarrier spacing and/or the duration of TTIs may be scalable.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The BSs <b>110</b> may assign or schedule transmission resources (such as in the form of time-frequency resource blocks (RB)) for downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) transmissions in the wireless communication network <b>100</b>. DL refers to the transmission direction from a BS <b>110</b> to a UE <b>120</b>, whereas UL refers to the transmission direction from a UE <b>120</b> to a BS <b>110</b>. The communication can be in the form of radio frames. A radio frame may be divided into a plurality of subframes or slots. Each slot may be further divided into mini-slots. In a FDD mode, simultaneous UL and DL transmissions may occur in different frequency bands. For example, each subframe includes a UL subframe in a UL frequency band and a DL subframe in a DL frequency band. In a TDD mode, UL and DL transmissions occur at different time periods using the same frequency band. For example, a subset of the subframes (such as the DL subframes) in a radio frame may be used for DL transmissions, and another subset of the subframes (such as the UL subframes) in the radio frame may be used for UL transmissions.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The DL subframes and the UL subframes can be further divided into several regions. For example, each DL or UL subframe may have pre-defined regions for transmissions of reference signals, control information, and data. Reference signals are predetermined signals that facilitate the communications between the BSs <b>110</b> and the UEs <b>120</b>. For example, a reference signal can have a particular pilot pattern or structure, where pilot tones may span across an operational BW or frequency band, each positioned at a pre-defined time and a pre-defined frequency. For example, a BS <b>110</b> may transmit cell-specific reference signals (CRSs) or channel state information reference signals (CSI-RSs) to enable a UE <b>120</b> to estimate a DL channel. Similarly, a UE <b>120</b> may transmit sounding reference signals (SRSs) to enable a BS <b>110</b> to estimate a UL channel. Control information may include resource assignments and protocol controls. Data may include protocol data and operational data. In some aspects, the BSs <b>110</b> and the UEs <b>120</b> may communicate using self-contained subframes. A self-contained subframe may include a portion for DL communication and a portion for UL communication. A self-contained subframe can be DL-centric or UL-centric. A DL-centric subframe may include a longer duration for DL communication than for UL communication. A UL-centric subframe may include a longer duration for UL communication than for UL communication.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some aspects, the wireless communication network <b>100</b> may be an NR network deployed over a licensed spectrum or an NR network deployed over an unlicensed spectrum (such as NR-U and NR-U lite networks). The BSs <b>110</b> can transmit synchronization signals, including a primary synchronization signal (PSS) and a secondary synchronization signal (SSS), in the wireless communication network <b>100</b> to facilitate synchronization. The BSs <b>110</b> can broadcast system information associated with the wireless communication network <b>100</b> (such as a master information block (MIB), remaining system information (RMSI), and other system information (OSI)) to facilitate initial network access. In some instances, the BSs <b>110</b> may broadcast one or more of the PSS, the SSS, and the MIB in the form of synchronization signal block (SSBs) over a physical broadcast channel (PBCH) and may broadcast one or more of the RMSI and the OSI over a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some aspects, a UE <b>120</b> attempting to access the wireless communication network <b>100</b> may perform an initial cell search by detecting a PSS included in an SSB from a BS <b>110</b>. The PSS may enable synchronization of period timing and may indicate a physical layer identity value. The UE <b>120</b> may receive an SSS included in an SSB from the BS <b>110</b>. The SSS may enable radio frame synchronization, and may provide a cell identity value, which may be combined with the physical layer identity value to identify the cell. The PSS and the SSS may be located in a central portion of a carrier or any suitable frequencies within the carrier.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">After receiving the PSS and SSS, the UE <b>120</b> may receive an MIB. The MIB may include system information for initial network access and scheduling information for at least one of an RMSI and OSI. After decoding the MIB, the UE <b>120</b> may receive at least one of an RMSI and OSI. The RMSI and OSI may include radio resource control (RRC) information related to random access channel (RACH) procedures, paging, control resource set (CORESET) for physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) monitoring, physical uplink control channel (PUCCH), physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH), power control, and SRS.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">After obtaining one or more of the MIB, the RMSI and the OSI, the UE <b>120</b> can perform a random access procedure to establish a connection with the BS <b>110</b>. In some examples, the random access procedure may be a four-step random access procedure. For example, the UE <b>120</b> may transmit a physical random access channel (PRACH), such as a PRACH preamble, and the BS <b>110</b> may respond with a random access response (RAR). The RAR may include one or more of a detected random access preamble identifier (ID) corresponding to the PRACH preamble, timing advance (TA) information, a UL grant, a temporary cell-radio network temporary identifier (C-RNTI), and a backoff indicator. Upon receiving the RAR, the UE <b>120</b> may transmit a connection request to the BS <b>110</b> and the BS <b>110</b> may respond with a connection response. The connection response may indicate a contention resolution. In some examples, the PRACH, the RAR, the connection request, and the connection response can be referred to as message 1 (MSG1), message 2 (MSG2), message 3 (MSG3), and message 4 (MSG4), respectively. In some examples, the random access procedure may be a two-step random access procedure, where the UE <b>120</b> may transmit a PRACH (including a PRACH preamble) and a connection request in a single transmission and the BS <b>110</b> may respond by transmitting a RAR and a connection response in a single transmission.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">After establishing a connection, the UE <b>120</b> and the BS <b>110</b> can enter a normal operation stage, where operational data may be exchanged. For example, the BS <b>110</b> may schedule the UE <b>120</b> for UL and DL communications. The BS <b>110</b> may transmit UL and DL scheduling grants to the UE <b>120</b> via a PDCCH. The BS <b>110</b> may transmit a DL communication signal to the UE <b>120</b> via a PDSCH according to a DL scheduling grant. The UE <b>120</b> may transmit a UL communication signal to the BS <b>110</b> via a PUSCH or PUCCH according to a UL scheduling grant.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some aspects, the wireless communication network <b>100</b> may operate over a system BW or a component carrier BW. The wireless communication network <b>100</b> may partition the system BW into multiple bandwidth parts (BWPs). A BWP may be a certain portion of the system BW. For example, if the system BW is 100 MHz, the BWPs may each be 20 MHz or less. A BS <b>110</b> may dynamically assign a UE <b>120</b> to operate over a certain BWP. The assigned BWP may be referred to as the active BWP. The UE <b>120</b> may monitor the active BWP for signaling information from the BS <b>110</b>. The BS <b>110</b> may schedule the UE <b>120</b> for UL or DL communications in the active BWP. In some implementations, the BS <b>110</b> may configure UEs <b>120</b> with narrowband operation capabilities (such as with transmission and reception limited to a BW of 20 MHz or less) to perform BWP hopping for channel monitoring and communications.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some aspects, a BS <b>110</b> may assign a pair of BWPs within the component carrier to a UE <b>120</b> for UL and DL communications. For example, the BWP pair may include one BWP for UL communications and one BWP for DL communications. The BS <b>110</b> may additionally configure the UE <b>120</b> with one or more CORESETs in a BWP. A CORESET may include a set of frequency resources spanning a number of symbols in time. The BS <b>110</b> may configure the UE <b>120</b> with one or more search spaces for PDCCH monitoring based on the CORESETS. The UE <b>120</b> may perform blind decoding in the search spaces to search for DL control information (such as UL or DL scheduling grants) from the BS <b>110</b>. For example, the BS <b>110</b> may configure the UE <b>120</b> with one or more of the BWPs, the CORESETS, and the PDCCH search spaces via RRC configurations.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some aspects, the wireless communication network <b>100</b> may operate over a shared frequency band or an unlicensed frequency band, for example, at about 3.5 gigahertz (GHz), sub-6 GHz or higher frequencies in the mmWave band. The wireless communication network <b>100</b> may partition a frequency band into multiple channels, for example, each occupying about 20 MHz. The BSs <b>110</b> and the UEs <b>120</b> may be operated by multiple network operating entities sharing resources in the shared communication medium and may employ a LBT procedure to acquire channel occupancy time (COT) in the share medium for communications. A COT may be non-continuous in time and may refer to an amount of time a wireless node can send frames when it has won contention for the wireless medium. Each COT may include a plurality of transmission slots. A COT also may be referred to as a transmission opportunity (TXOP). The BS <b>110</b> or the UE <b>120</b> may perform an LBT in the frequency band prior to transmitting in the frequency band. The LBT can be based on energy detection or signal detection. For energy detection, the BS <b>110</b> or the UE <b>120</b> may determine that the channel is busy or occupied when a signal energy measured from the channel is greater than a certain signal energy threshold. For signal detection, the BS <b>110</b> or the UE <b>120</b> may determine that the channel is busy or occupied when a certain reservation signal (such as a preamble signal sequence) is detected in the channel.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram conceptually illustrating an example <b>200</b> of a BS <b>110</b> in communication with a UE <b>120</b>.

The transmit processor <b>220</b> also may process system information (for example, for semi-static resource partitioning information (SRPI), etc.) and control information (for example, CQI requests, grants, upper layer signaling, etc.) and provide overhead symbols and control symbols. The transmit processor <b>220</b> also may generate reference symbols for reference signals (for example, the cell-specific reference signal (CRS)) and synchronization signals (for example, the primary synchronization signal (PSS) and secondary synchronization signal (SSS)). A transmit (TX) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processor <b>230</b> may perform spatial processing (for example, precoding) on the data symbols, the control symbols, the overhead symbols, or the reference symbols, if applicable, and may provide T output symbol streams to T modulators-demodulators (MODs-DEMODs) <b>232</b>A through <b>232</b>T (which also may be referred to as mods/demods or modems).

For example, if the DCI message uses a first RNTI, this may indicate the BS <b>110</b> has scheduled a first FD UL and DL traffic scheduling combination (such as PDSCH DL traffic and PUSCH UL traffic). If the DCI message uses a second RNTI, this may indicate the BS <b>110</b> has scheduled a second FD UL and DL traffic scheduling combination (such as SPS DL traffic and PUSCH UL traffic). If the DCI message uses a third RNTI, this may indicate the BS <b>110</b> has scheduled a third FD UL and DL traffic scheduling combination (such as PDSCH DL traffic and CG UL traffic).

For example, at a time slot n-m, the BS <b>110</b> may schedule an UL transmission (such as a PUSCH transmission) that will be transmitted in the time slot n (which may be referred to as a first time slot) using a first DCI message. If the BS <b>110</b> schedules a DL transmission (such as a PDSCH transmission) that at least partially overlaps the UL transmission during the time slot n, the BS <b>110</b> may use the one or more bits of the first DCI message associated with the UL transmission to indicate the BS <b>110</b> has scheduled an overlapping (at least partially) DL transmission. During the time duration that the DL transmission overlaps with the UL transmission, the BS <b>110</b> and the UE <b>120</b> may be operating in an FD mode. For example, if the indication is one bit of the first DCI message, a binary &#x2018;1&#x2019; may be used to indicate an overlapping DL transmission. During the time duration that the DL transmission does not overlap with the UL transmission, the BS <b>110</b> and the UE <b>120</b> may be operating in an HD mode. The UE <b>120</b> may receive and decode the first DCI message, and identify the indication (such as the one or more bits) that indicates that the BS <b>110</b> has scheduled a DL transmission that at least partially overlaps the UL transmission. Since the BS <b>110</b> has scheduled an overlapping DL transmission during the time slot n, the UE <b>120</b> may continue monitoring for DL transmissions without entering a power save mode. For example, the UE <b>120</b> may continue monitoring for a PDCCH transmission including a second DCI message associated with the scheduled DL transmission. If the BS <b>110</b> does not schedule a DL transmission (such as a PDSCH transmission) during the time slot n, the BS <b>110</b> may use the one or more bits of the first DCI message associated with the UL transmission to indicate the BS <b>110</b> has not scheduled an overlapping DL transmission during the time slot n. For example, if the indication is one bit of the first DCI message, a binary &#x2018;0&#x2019; may be used to indicate the BS <b>110</b> has not scheduled an overlapping DL transmission. The UE <b>120</b> may receive and decode the first DCI message, and identify the indication that indicates that the BS <b>110</b> has not scheduled an overlapping DL transmission. The UE <b>120</b> may initiate a power save mode that ceases monitoring for a DL transmission during the time slot n, since the BS <b>110</b> has not scheduled an overlapping DL transmission during the time slot n.

The DL TCI state may be used for monitoring the DL transmission, such as the PDCCH, at the same time as the UL transmission, such as the PUSCH. For example, the DL TCI state may provide an indication of the beam that may be used by the BS <b>110</b> for transmitting the PDCCH.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some implementations, the BS <b>110</b> may use a slot format in a DCI message as the indication of whether the BS <b>110</b> has scheduled a DL transmission during a time period that at least partially overlaps in time with a scheduled UL transmission. For example, the BS <b>110</b> may use an FD slot format in a first DCI message that schedules an UL transmission during the time period, or the BS <b>110</b> may use an FD slot format in a second DCI message that schedules a DL transmission during the time period. In some implementations, the FD slot format in one or more of the DCI messages may indicate to the UE <b>120</b> that the BS <b>110</b> has scheduled a DL transmission that at least partially overlaps with an UL transmission during a time period. When a scheduled DL transmission does not overlap with a scheduled UL transmission, the BS <b>110</b> may use an HD slot format in a first DCI message that schedules the UL transmission and in a second DCI message that schedules the DL transmission. The HD slot format in one or more DCI messages may indicate to the UE <b>120</b> that the BS <b>110</b> has scheduled a HD transmission (either a UL or DL transmission) that does not overlap with another scheduled transmission.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some implementations, the BS <b>110</b> may use a UL beam indication in a DCI message that schedules an UL transmission to indicate a UL beam that will be used to transmit the UL transmission to the UE <b>120</b>. For example, the BS <b>110</b> may use a UL beam indication in the DCI message that schedules an UL transmission (such as a PUSCH) during a time period (such as a time slot n, which also may be referred to as a first time slot) to indicate the UL beam that will be used to transmit the UL transmission to the UE <b>120</b>. The UL beam indication may be an UL TCI state or spatial relation information in the DCI message. In some implementations, the UE <b>120</b> may receive the DCI message having the UL beam indication and determine whether the indicated UL beam can be paired with a default DL beam the UE <b>120</b> may use to receive a DL transmission (such as a PDSCH) from the BS <b>110</b> that at least partially overlaps with the scheduled UL transmission for FD operation. For example, the UE <b>120</b> may determine if there is sufficient beam separation between the UL beam and the default DL beam to avoid too much interference between the two beams during FD transmission. If there is too much interference between the two beams, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) may be too low for successful transmissions. In some implementations, if the default DL beam of the UE <b>120</b> cannot be paired with the UL beam indicated by the DCI message, the UE <b>120</b> may assume the BS <b>110</b> will not schedule a DL transmission during the time slot n (and thus assume HD transmission) and may initiate a power save mode that ceases monitoring for a DL transmission during the time slot n. In some implementations, if the default DL beam of the UE <b>120</b> can be paired with the UL beam indicated by the DCI message, the UE <b>120</b> may assume the BS <b>110</b> will schedule a DL transmission during the time slot n (and thus assume FD transmission) and may continue monitoring for a DL transmission during the time slot n (and may not enter the power save mode). Thus, the UL beam indication in the DCI message and the default DL beam may be used as indications of whether the BS <b>110</b> has scheduled a DL transmission during a time period (such as time slot n) that at least partially overlaps with a scheduled UL transmission.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some implementations, the UE <b>120</b> may initiate a power save mode that ceases monitoring for a DCI message associated with a DL transmission during the duration of a scheduled UL transmission, such as a PUSCH. The UE <b>120</b> may assume that both an UL transmission and a DL transmission have been scheduled at the same time (such as during a first time slot or time slot n) and thus may assume the transmissions are FD transmission while operating in a FD mode. For example, the UE <b>120</b> may assume that both a PUSCH and a PDSCH have been scheduled at the same time during a time slot n and therefore the UE <b>120</b> may not monitor for a DCI message associated with the PDSCH during the time slot n. In some implementations, the BS <b>110</b> may be configured with a rule that if the BS <b>110</b> schedules an UL transmission (such as a PUSCH during a time slot n, the BS <b>110</b> may only schedule a DL transmission if it can be completed within the time slot n. Otherwise, the BS <b>110</b> may schedule the DL transmission outside of the time slot n.
