Therefore, improving the cooling and heat dissipation capacity of the motor can significantly improve the power density of the motor.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">At present, the cooling methods of on-board motors mainly include water cooling and oil cooling. The water-cooling method is to design a water channel on the motor shell, and the heat inside the motor is transferred to the water channel through layers of media, and then the heat is taken away by the cooling liquid. The advantage of the water-cooling method is that the cost is low, and it can basically meet the heat dissipation requirements of the motor. The disadvantage is that the indirect cooling method has poor heat dissipation efficiency. The oil cooling method, due to the non-conductive and non-magnetic properties of the oil, can directly cool the stator and winding of the motor, which can meet the cooling requirements of high-performance motors. However, the oil cooling method currently used is spray oil cooling, which increases the cost of the motor.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure aims to provide a motor cooling structure, a drive assembly and a vehicle, the motor cooling structure realizes immersion cooling and has a good cooling effect.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure, a motor cooling structure is provided.
