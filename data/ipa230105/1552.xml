Vehicle transmissions have many complex parts including various springs with various purposes. The transmission rebuilding process may involve a rebuilder who must install one or more springs in a location on the transmission, which requires the spring to be compressed prior to installation. The shape and nature of the installation can vary widely for each spring installation. There are many different brands and types of transmissions as well as many different spring types and locations.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Compressing springs prior to installation can be challenging at times given the pressure exerted by the spring when under the compression required to be installed in the location wherein the spring must be installed. A rebuilder using crude tools, such as a screwdriver or pliers, or the installer's fingers, may struggle with the installation. Further, the rebuilder could potentially be injured or cause damage if the spring is improperly released from a state of compression. The use of mechanical tools can simplify the installation process, but the availability and applicability of existing tools does not always fit the shape and nature of the required installation. For example, a spring compressor that works on one type of spring will not work on another. Further, a tool to install a spring at one location on the transmission might not work for the same type of spring at another location.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Given the sheer number of types of springs on the market and the sheer number of installation locations, spring compressors must uniquely be designed such that they are not excessively complicated and therefore prohibitively expensive. Transmission rebuilders are further under requirements to timely and efficiently complete transmission rebuilds. Any tools used in the rebuilding process must be able to timely and efficiently be utilized.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This disclosure is directed toward a unique transmission spring compressor tool which allows for a rebuilder to install transmission springs into a transmission. Specifically, the disclosed invention's best mode is to be used for installation of an oil pump slide spring in several models of General Motors automotive transmissions. The oil pump slide spring is located in the transmission oil pump assembly. The slide spring is installed by compressing the slide spring and laterally placing the slide spring into a slide slot. Transmission rebuilders typically use a screwdriver or pliers to force the slide spring into the slide slot. This is often times dangerous as the spring can pop out unexpectedly such that it injures the rebuilder.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The disclosed invention describes a slide spring tool device which compresses the slide spring and allows the slide spring to be transferred into the slide slot. The tool comprises (1) a body with a receiver configured to accept a plunger, (2) a plunger which is configured with a spring gap such that a properly compressed slide spring will fit in the spring gap and the plunger can slide through the receiver, and (3) a plunger plate attached to the plunger configured such to allow for the slot spring to be compressed between the bottom face of the body and the plunger plate.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The disclosed invention allows for the rebuilder to place a slide spring in the slide spring tool between the plunger plate and the bottom face of the body. The rebuilder may then apply manual pressure to compress the slide spring. When the slide spring has been compressed, the slide spring may be pushed into the slide gap. The plunger may be then removed from the body with a compressed spring in the slide gap. The rebuilder may then place the plunger with the compressed slide spring positioned over the slide slot such that the rebuilder may push the slide spring out of the slide gap into the slide slot on the oil pump assembly.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">These and other features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with accompanying drawings, wherein:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a 3D image of an exemplary slide spring tool;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a set of drawings showing the 2D perspective of an exemplary slide spring tool plunger and a plunger plate;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a set of drawings showing the 2D perspective of an exemplary slide spring tool body.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">General</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention will now be described with occasional reference to the specific embodiments of the invention.

The slide spring tool <b>101</b> comprises of two independent pieces; the body <b>102</b> and the plunger assembly <b>103</b>. The slide spring tool <b>101</b> is adapted to compress a slide spring, receive the slide spring in the spring gap <b>104</b>, and place the slide spring into a slide slot on an oil pump assembly. A slide spring may be for an oil pump in certain automotive transmissions.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">To use the slide spring tool <b>101</b> a slide spring which is at rest and is not compressed, is placed between the plunger plate <b>105</b> and the body <b>102</b>. When the slide spring is first placed, the slide spring tool <b>101</b> is in the extended position. One end of the slide spring is placed against a plunger plate face <b>106</b> located on the face of the plunger plate <b>105</b> which is facing the body <b>102</b>, and the other end of the slide spring is placed against a bottom face <b>107</b> located on the face of the body <b>102</b> which is facing the plunger plate <b>105</b>.

The plunger <b>109</b> is configured such that it can slide through a receiver <b>108</b> which is configured on the body <b>102</b>. The plunger <b>109</b> is configured to be slightly smaller than the receiver <b>108</b> so that the plunger does not stick as the plunger <b>109</b> is slid through the receiver <b>108</b>. The plunger assembly <b>103</b> along with the plunger <b>109</b> may be entirely removed from the receiver <b>108</b> resulting in two independent pieces. When a rebuilder uses the slide spring tool <b>101</b> to compress a slide spring, the rebuilder applies manual pressure to the plunger plate <b>105</b> such that the plunger assembly <b>103</b> is moved relative to the body <b>102</b>. The plunger <b>109</b> slides in the receiver <b>108</b> and the plunger plate face <b>106</b> and the bottom face <b>107</b> of the body <b>102</b> move closer together. Once the slide spring is compressed to the desired length, the slide spring may be pushed from the location between the bottom face <b>107</b> and the plunger plate face <b>106</b> to the spring gap <b>104</b>. The plunger plate <b>105</b> having a face that is a plunger plate face <b>106</b>.

Attached to the plunger <b>109</b> is the plunger plate <b>105</b>. The plunger plate face <b>106</b> is located evenly with the gap bottom <b>203</b>. The gap bottom <b>203</b> and the plunger plate face <b>106</b> are located such that the slide spring may be smoothly slid on the plunger plate face <b>106</b> so that the slide spring is axially centered within the plunger <b>109</b> and the two ends of the slide spring are compressed against the gap bottom <b>203</b> and the gap top <b>204</b>.
