Mobile electronic devices are being developed to improve the mobility and a user's convenience. Each of various electronic devices may include a display as a user interface, and a touch-sensitive display is widely used recently.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, in order to ensure the portability, demand for an electronic device including a foldable display has been increased. An electronic device including a foldable display can be used as a smartphone in the folded state and as a large screen tablet PC in the unfolded state, and thus can increase a user's convenience and the usability.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A flexible display may include a substrate and a window which are made of a ductile material such as polyimide (PI). A flexible display may be used in an unfolded state if a large screen is needed, and may be used in a folded state if the display is carried or simply and conveniently used. A display includes a plurality of layers, and thus forces in different directions or different sizes may be applied to a display layer disposed outside and a display layer disposed inside in a folded state of the display. If compressive forces or tensile forces in various sizes are applied to layers of a display, respectively, the layers may slip.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">If a structure (e.g. bezel) for protecting a display of a flexible electronic device sags and comes into contact with the display, the surface of the display may be damaged, and the slipping of the display may cause damage. In addition, moisture or foreign materials may be introduced through the gap between a protective structure and a display for protection of the surface of the display.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A method for preventing and/or reducing damage to the surface of a flexible display and preventing and/or reducing introduction of moisture and foreign materials through the gap between the display and a protective structure is required.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The above information is presented as background information only to assist with an understanding of the disclosure.

In an embodiment, the electronic device <b>10</b> may have the flat state or the unfolded state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the folded state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and an intermediate state between the flat state and the folded state. As used herein, the term &#x201c;folded state&#x201d; refers to a &#x201c;fully folded state&#x201d; unless specifically stated otherwise, and an illustration of the intermediate state in which the electronic device <b>10</b> is folded with a certain angle will be separately described.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, in an embodiment, the electronic device <b>10</b> may include a foldable housing <b>500</b>, a hinge cover <b>530</b> that covers a foldable portion of the foldable housing <b>500</b>, and a flexible or foldable display <b>100</b> (hereinafter, abbreviated to the &#x201c;display <b>100</b>&#x201d;) that is disposed in a space formed by the foldable housing <b>500</b>. In this disclosure, a surface on which the display <b>100</b> is disposed is defined as a first surface or a front surface of the electronic device <b>10</b>. A surface opposite to the front surface is defined as a second surface or a rear surface of the electronic device <b>10</b>. A surface that surrounds a space between the front surface and the rear surface is defined as a third surface or a side surface of the electronic device <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an embodiment, the foldable housing <b>500</b> may include a first housing structure <b>510</b>, a second housing structure <b>520</b> including a sensor area <b>524</b>, a first back cover <b>580</b>, and a second back cover <b>590</b>. The foldable housing <b>500</b> of the electronic device <b>10</b> is not limited to the form and the coupling illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> and may be implemented by a combination and/or a coupling of other shapes or parts. For example, in another embodiment, the first housing structure <b>510</b> and the first back cover <b>580</b> may be integrally formed with each other, and the second housing structure <b>520</b> and the second back cover <b>590</b> may be integrally formed with each other.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the illustrated embodiment, the first housing structure <b>510</b> and the second housing structure <b>520</b> may be disposed on opposite sides of a folding axis (an axis A) and may have substantially symmetrical shapes with respect to the folding axis A. As will be described below, the angle or distance between the first housing structure <b>510</b> and the second housing structure <b>520</b> may vary depending on whether the electronic device <b>10</b> is in a flat, folded, or intermediate state. In the illustrated embodiment, unlike the first housing structure <b>510</b>, the second housing structure <b>520</b> may additionally include the sensor area <b>524</b> in which various sensors are arranged, but may have a symmetrical shape in the other area.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In an embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the first housing structure <b>510</b> and the second housing structure <b>520</b> may form a recess together in which the display <b>100</b> is received. In the illustrated embodiment, due to the sensor area <b>524</b>, the recess may have two or more different widths in a direction perpendicular to the folding axis A.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">For example, the recess may have a first width w<b>1</b> between a first portion <b>510</b><i>a </i>of the first housing structure <b>510</b> that is parallel to the folding axis A and a first portion <b>520</b><i>a </i>of the second housing structure <b>520</b> that is formed on the periphery of the sensor area <b>524</b> and a second width w<b>2</b> formed by a second portion <b>510</b><i>b </i>of the first housing structure <b>510</b> and a second portion <b>520</b><i>b </i>of the second housing structure <b>520</b> that does not correspond to the sensor area <b>524</b> and that is parallel to the folding axis A. In this case, the second width w<b>2</b> may be formed to be longer than the first width w<b>1</b>.

Since the organic material layer, the anode, or the cathode included in the light emitting layer <b>732</b> may react with oxygen or moisture and thus the light emitting layer may lose the light emission properties, the encapsulation part <b>733</b> may prevent and/or reduce invasion of oxygen or moisture into the light emitting layer <b>732</b>, as a seal preventing and/or reducing exposure of the light emitting layer <b>732</b>.

If unpolarized light such as solar light is incident into the panel <b>730</b>, the unpolarized light passes through the polarizing layer and is then changed into linearly polarized light, and the linearly polarized light passes through the phase retardation layer and may then changed into circularly polarized light depending on the properties of the retardation layer. For example, if unpolarized light passes through a 90-degree polarizing layer, the light is changed into 90-degree linearly polarized light, and if the 90-degree linearly polarized light passes through a 45-degree phase retardation layer (e.g., quarter wave plate), the light is changed into 135-degree circularly polarized light. The 135-degree circularly polarized light has a value between 90&#xb0; and 180&#xb0; that are linear polarization axes, and may vibrate while having both X axis and Y axis, that is, the phase of 90&#xb0; and the phase of 180&#xb0;. The circularly polarized light does not lie on a particular axis, and may change the axis while vibrating at a uniform amplitude. According to an embodiment, the phase retardation layer may have the properties of a quarter wave retarder (<b>214</b> retarder).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">According to an embodiment, if solar light is incident into the panel <b>730</b>, at least a part of the light may be reflected by an electrode, etc. included in the panel <b>730</b>, and the reflection may cause difficulty for screen recognition. The polarizing layer and the phase retardation layer of the optical layer <b>734</b> may prevent and/or reduce light having entered from the outside, from exiting through reflection, so as to increase outdoor visibility. For example, 135-degree circularly polarized light obtained through a change by the phase retardation layer may be reflected by the TFT <b>731</b>, etc., the reflected 135-degree circularly polarized light is changed into 180-degree linearly polarized light through the phase retardation layer, and the 180-degree linearly polarized light is unable to pass through the 90-degree polarizing layer and then be emitted to the outside.
