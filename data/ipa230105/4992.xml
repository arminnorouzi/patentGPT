Indeed, these inventions may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. The term &#x201c;or&#x201d; is used herein in both the alternative and conjunctive sense, unless otherwise indicated. The terms &#x201c;illustrative&#x201d; and &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; are used to be examples with no indication of quality level. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Overview</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Various embodiments of the invention generally relate to system resource prediction based on a machine learning model.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one example, a resource management system may supply a data set to a learning machine or algorithm. The learning machine or algorithm may then determine which features or attributes associated with a device rendered object of a transaction correlate to a high likelihood that a subsequent termination transaction will occur in a given network period and which features or attributes correlate to a low likelihood. Accordingly, the learning machine may select a subset of features or attributes for training. Once the learning machine or algorithm is trained, live data associated with a new transaction may be input and the learning machine or algorithm may then classify the transaction as having a high likelihood of resulting in a termination transaction in a given network period or not. As such, the system may allocate necessary resources for a future network period, the resources required for correcting termination transactions.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Definitions</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;data,&#x201d; &#x201c;content,&#x201d; &#x201c;information,&#x201d; and similar terms may be used interchangeably to refer to data capable of being transmitted, received, and/or stored in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. Thus, use of any such terms should not be taken to limit the spirit and scope of embodiments of the present invention. Further, where a computing device is described herein to receive data from another computing device, it will be appreciated that the data may be received directly from another computing device or may be received indirectly via one or more intermediary computing devices, such as, for example, one or more servers, relays, routers, network access points, base stations, hosts, and/or the like, sometimes referred to herein as a &#x201c;network.&#x201d; Similarly, where a computing device is described herein to send data to another computing device, it will be appreciated that the data may be sent directly to another computing device or may be sent indirectly via one or more intermediary computing devices, such as, for example, one or more servers, relays, routers, network access points, base stations, hosts, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As used herein, the term &#x201c;resource management system&#x201d; may include a system that is accessible via one or more computing devices and that is operable to transmit data comprising executable instructions that, when executed on a computing device, can render a device rendered object for display by the device. A device rendered object can, for example, be an electronic representation of a digital promotion or marketing service provided by one or more providers that are offering one or more instruments that are redeemable for goods, services, experiences and/or the like. In some examples, the system may take the form of a server enabling transactions related to redemption of promotions associated with device rendered objects, processing of financial transactions associated with device rendered objects, and/or the like. As such, the system is, in some example embodiments, configured to present one or more device rendered objects that display promotions via one or more impressions, accept payments for promotions from consumers, issue instruments upon acceptance of an offer or a promotion, participate in redemption, generate rewards, provide a point of sale device or service, issue payments to providers and/or otherwise participate in the exchange of goods, services or experiences for currency, value and/or the like. The system is also, in some example embodiments, configured to enable object parameter analysis, whereby parameters associated with device rendered objects can be optimally selected, including parameter analytics and the like.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As used herein, the term &#x201c;network asset provider&#x201d; may be used to refer to a network actor capable of providing a network asset to another computing device. A network asset may be a set of instructions that, when executed by a computing device, renders an instrument redeemable for a network asset. An example of a network asset provider may be a provider or a merchant.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As used herein, the term &#x201c;network asset requester&#x201d; may be used to refer to a requester for network assets that may be purchased, consumed, or redeemed by the network asset requester. Examples of a network asset requester may include a consumer.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;provider&#x201d; and &#x201c;merchant&#x201d; may be used interchangeably and may include, but are not limited to, a business owner, consigner, shopkeeper, tradesperson, vendor, operator, entrepreneur, agent, dealer, organization or the like that is in the business of providing a good, service or experience to a consumer, facilitating the provision of a good service or experience to a consumer and/or otherwise operating in the stream of commerce. The &#x201c;provider&#x201d; or &#x201c;merchant&#x201d; need not actually market a product or service via the promotion and marketing service, as some merchants or providers may utilize the promotion and marketing service only for the purpose of gathering marketing information, demographic information, or the like.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As used herein, the term &#x201c;consumer&#x201d; should be understood to refer to a recipient of goods, services, promotions, media, or the like provided by the promotion and marketing service and/or a merchant. Consumers may include, without limitation, individuals, groups of individuals, corporations, other merchants, and the like.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;network asset&#x201d; and &#x201c;device rendered object&#x201d; may be used interchangeably to mean an electronic representation of or an instrument redeemable for a digital promotion or marketing service provided by one or more providers that are offering one or more instruments that are redeemable for goods, services, experiences and/or the like. In some examples, the system may take the form of a server enabling transactions related to redemption of promotions associated with device rendered objects, processing of financial transactions associated with device rendered objects, and/or the like. As such, the system is, in some example embodiments, configured to present one or more device rendered objects that display promotions via one or more impressions, accept payments for promotions from consumers, issue instruments upon acceptance of an offer or a promotion, participate in redemption, generate rewards, provide a point of sale device or service, issue payments to providers and/or otherwise participate in the exchange of goods, services or experiences for currency, value and/or the like. The system is also, in some example embodiments, configured to enabling object parameter analysis, whereby parameters associated with device rendered objects can be optimally selected, including parameter analytics, and the like. Examples of device rendered objects or network assets may include promotions or deals.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As used herein, the term &#x201c;promotion&#x201d; may include, but is not limited to, any type of offered, presented or otherwise indicated reward, discount, coupon, credit, deal, incentive, discount, media or the like that is indicative of a promotional value or the like that upon purchase or acceptance results in the issuance of an instrument that may be used toward at least a portion of the purchase of particular goods, services and/or experiences defined by the promotion. Promotions may have different values in different contexts. For example, a promotion may have a first value associated with the cost paid by a consumer, known as an &#x201c;accepted value.&#x201d; When redeemed, the promotion may be used to purchase a &#x201c;promotional value&#x201d; representing the retail price of the goods. The promotion may also have a &#x201c;residual value,&#x201d; reflecting the remaining value of the promotion after expiration. Although consumers may be primarily focused on the accepted and promotional value of the promotion, a promotion may also have additional associated values. For example, a &#x201c;cost value&#x201d; may represent the cost to the merchant to offer the promotion via the promotion and marketing service, where the promotion and marketing service receives the cost value for each promotion sold to a consumer. The promotion may also include a &#x201c;return on investment&#x201d; value, representing a quantified expected return on investment to the merchant for each promotion sold.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">For example, consider a device rendered object that includes instructions to cause the rendering at a computing device of a promotion offered by the system for a digital instrument redeemable for a $50 meal promotion for a transaction value of $25 at a particular restaurant. In this example, $25 would be the transaction value and an associated digital amount is debited from a data store associated with a device initiating the transaction. A consumer associated with the device initiating the transaction would then be able to redeem the promotion at the restaurant for $50 applied toward their meal check. This $50 would be the promotional value of the promotion. If the consumer did not use the promotion before expiration, the consumer might be able to obtain a refund of $22.50, representing a 10% fee to recoup transaction costs for the merchant and/or promotion and marketing service. This $22.50 would be the residual value of the promotion. If the promotion and marketing service charged the merchant $3.00 to offer the promotion, the $3.00 fee would be the &#x201c;cost value.&#x201d; The &#x201c;return on investment&#x201d; value of the promotion might be dynamically calculated by the promotion and marketing service based on the expected repeat business generated by the marketing of the promotion, the particular location, the demographics of the consumer, and the like. For example, the return on investment value might be $10.00, reflecting the long term additional profit expected by the merchant as a result of bringing in a new customer through use of a promotion.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Promotions may be provided to consumers and redeemed via the use of an &#x201c;instrument.&#x201d; Instruments may represent and embody the terms of the promotion from which the instrument resulted. For example, instruments may include, but are not limited to, any type of physical token (e.g., magnetic strip cards or printed barcodes), virtual account balance (e.g., a promotion being associated with a particular user account on a merchant website), secret code (e.g., a character string that can be entered on a merchant website or point-of-sale), tender, electronic certificate, medium of exchange, voucher, or the like, which may be used in a transaction for at least a portion of the purchase, acquisition, procurement, consumption or the like of goods, services and/or experiences as defined by the terms of the promotion.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some examples, the instrument may take the form of tender that has a given value that is exchangeable for goods, services and/or experiences and/or a reduction in a purchase price of a particular good, service or experience. In some examples, the instrument may have multiple values, such as accepted value, a promotional value and/or a residual value. For example, using the aforementioned restaurant as the example provider, an electronic indication in a mobile application that shows $50 of value to be used as payment for a meal check at the restaurant. In some examples, the accepted value of the instrument is defined by the value exchanged for the instrument. In some examples, the promotional value is defined by the promotion from which the instrument resulted and is the value of the instrument beyond the accepted value. In some examples, the residual value is the value after redemption, the value after the expiry or other violation of a redemption parameter, the return or exchange value of the instrument and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As used herein, the term &#x201c;redemption&#x201d; refers to the use, exchange or other presentation of an instrument for at least a portion of a good, service or experience as defined by the instrument and its related promotion. In some examples, redemption includes the verification of validity of the instrument. In other example embodiments, redemption may include an indication that a particular instrument has been redeemed and thus no longer retains an actual, promotional and/or residual value (e.g., full redemption). In other example embodiments, redemption may include the redemption of at least a portion of its actual, promotional and/or residual value (e.g., partial redemption). An example of redemption, using the aforementioned restaurant as the example provider, is the exchange of the $50 instrument and $50 to settle a $100 meal check.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As used herein, the term &#x201c;impression&#x201d; refers to a metric for measuring how frequently consumers are provided with marketing information related to a particular good, service, or promotion. Impressions may be measured in various different manners, including, but not limited to, measuring the frequency with which content is served to a consumer (e.g., the number of times images, websites, or the like are requested by consumers), measuring the frequency with which electronic marketing communications including particular content are sent to consumers (e.g., a number of e-mails sent to consumers or number of e-mails including particular promotion content), measuring the frequency with which electronic marketing communications are received by consumers (e.g., a number of times a particular e-mail is read), or the like. Impressions may be provided through various forms of media, including but not limited to communications, displays, or other perceived indications, such as e-mails, text messages, application alerts, mobile applications, other type of electronic interface or distribution channel and/or the like, of one or more promotions.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As used herein, the term &#x201c;electronic marketing information&#x201d; refers to various electronic data and signals that may be interpreted by a promotion and marketing service to provide improved electronic marketing communications. Electronic marketing information may include, without limitation, clickstream data (defined below), transaction data (defined below), location data (defined below), communication channel data (defined below), discretionary data (defined below), or any other data stored by or received by the promotion and marketing service for use in providing electronic communications to consumers.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As used herein, the term &#x201c;clickstream data&#x201d; refers to electronic information indicating content viewed, accessed, edited, or retrieved by consumers. This information may be electronically processed and analyzed by a promotion and marketing service to improve the quality of electronic marketing and commerce transactions offered by, through, and in conjunction with the promotion and marketing service. It should be understood that the term &#x201c;clickstream&#x201d; is not intended to be limited to mouse clicks. For example, the clickstream data may include various other consumer interactions, including without limitation, mouse-over events and durations, the amount of time spent by the consumer viewing particular content, the rate at which impressions of particular content result in sales associated with that content, demographic information associated with each particular consumer, data indicating other content accessed by the consumer (e.g., browser cookie data), the time or date on which content was accessed, the frequency of impressions for particular content, associations between particular consumers or consumer demographics and particular impressions, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As used herein, the term &#x201c;transaction data&#x201d; refers to electronic information indicating that a transaction is occurring or has occurred via the system. Transaction data may also include information relating to the transaction. For example, transaction data may include a timestamp, consumer payment or billing information, consumer shipping information, items purchased by the consumer, a merchant rewards account number associated with the consumer, the type of shipping selected by the consumer for fulfillment of the transaction, or the like.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As used herein, the term &#x201c;location data&#x201d; refers to electronic information indicating a particular location. Location data may be associated with a network asset requester (e.g., consumer), a network asset provider (e.g., merchant), or any other entity capable of interaction with the promotion and marketing service. For example, in some embodiments location data is provided by a location services module of a network asset requester device. In some embodiments, location data may be provided by a network asset provider indicating the location of network asset requesters within their retail location. In some embodiments, location data may be provided by network asset providers to indicate the current location of the network asset provider (e.g., a food truck or delivery service). It should be appreciated that location data may be provided by various systems capable of determining location information, including, but not limited to, global positioning service receivers, indoor navigation systems, cellular tower triangulation techniques, video surveillance systems, or radio frequency identification (RFID) location systems. Throughout this specification, the terms &#x201c;user device,&#x201d; &#x201c;network asset requester device,&#x201d; and &#x201c;consumer device&#x201d; may be used interchangeably.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As used herein, the term &#x201c;communication channel data&#x201d; refers to electronic information relating to the particular device or communication channel upon which a merchant or consumer communicates with the promotion and marketing service. In this regard, communication channel data may include the type of device used by the consumer or merchant (e.g., smart phone, desktop computer, laptop, netbook, tablet computer), the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the device, the available bandwidth of a connection, login credentials used to access the channel (e.g., a user account and/or password for accessing the promotion and marketing service), or any other data pertaining to the communication channel between the promotion and marketing service and an entity external to the promotion and marketing service.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As used herein, the term &#x201c;discretionary data&#x201d; refers to electronic information provided by a merchant or consumer explicitly to the promotion and marketing service in support of improved interaction with the promotion and marketing service. Upon registering with the promotion and marketing service or at any time thereafter, the consumer or merchant may be invited to provide information that aids the promotion and marketing service in providing services that are targeted to the particular needs of the consumer or merchant. For example, a consumer may indicate interests, hobbies, their age, gender, or location when creating a new account. A merchant may indicate the type of goods or services provided, their retail storefront location, contact information, hours of operation, or the like.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">It should be appreciated that the term &#x201c;discretionary data&#x201d; is intended to refer to information voluntarily and explicitly provided to the promotion and marketing service, such as by completing a form or survey on a website or application hosted by the promotion and marketing service. However, it should be appreciated that the examples of discretionary data provided above may also be determined implicitly or through review or analysis of other electronic marketing information provided to the promotion and marketing service. It should also be appreciated that the promotion and marketing service may also grant access to certain features or tools based on whether certain discretionary data has been provided. For example, the consumer may be required to provide information relating to their interests or location during a registration process.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As used herein, the term &#x201c;offering parameters&#x201d; refers to terms and conditions under which the promotion is offered by a promotion and marketing service to consumers. These offering parameters may include parameters, bounds, considerations and/or the like that outline or otherwise define the terms, timing, constraints, limitations, rules or the like under which the promotion is sold, offered, marketed, or otherwise provided to consumers. Example offering parameters include, using the aforementioned restaurant as the example provider, limited to one instrument per person, total of 100 instruments to be issued, a run duration of when the promotion will be marketed via the promotion and marketing service, and parameters for identifying consumers to be offered the promotion (e.g., factors influencing how consumer locations are used to offer a promotion).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As used herein, the term &#x201c;redemption parameters&#x201d; refers to terms and conditions for redeeming or otherwise obtaining the benefit of promotions obtained from a promotion and marketing service. The redemption parameters may include parameters, bounds, considerations and/or the like that outline the term, timing, constraints, limitations, rules or the like for how and/or when an instrument may be redeemed. For example, the redemption parameters may include an indication that the instrument must be redeemed prior to a specified deadline, for a specific good, service or experience and/or the like. For example, using the aforementioned restaurant as the example provider, the redemption parameters may specify a limit of one instrument per visit, that the promotion must be used in-store only, or that the promotion must be used by a certain date.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As used herein, the term &#x201c;promotion content&#x201d; refers to display factors or features that influence how the promotion is displayed to consumers. For example, promotion content may include an image associated with the promotion, a narrative description of the promotion or the merchant, a display template for association with the promotion, or the like. For example, merchant self-service indicators (defined below) may be used to identify promotion offers that were generated by merchants with similar characteristics to the merchant self-service indicators. Various other factors may be used to generate the promotion offer, such as the success of the promotion offers generated by the merchants with similar characteristics, the product availability of the merchant, and the like.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As used herein, the term &#x201c;promotion component&#x201d; is used to refer to elements of a particular promotion that may be selected during a promotion generation process. Promotion components may include any aspect of a promotion, including, but not necessarily limited to, offering parameters, redemption parameters, and promotion content. For example, promotion components may include, but are not limited to, promotion titles, promotion ledes (e.g., a short text phrase displayed under a promotion title), promotion images, promotion prices, promotion discount levels, promotion style sheets, promotion fonts, promotion e-mail subjects, promotion quantities, promotion fine print options, promotion fees assessed to the merchant by the promotion and marketing service, or the like. Promotion components may also include various flags and settings associated with registration and verification functions for a merchant offering the promotion, such as whether the identity of the merchant has been verified, whether the merchant is registered with the promotion and marketing service, or the like.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As used herein, the term &#x201c;electronic marketing communication&#x201d; refers to any electronically generated information content provided by the promotion and marketing service to a consumer for the purpose of marketing a promotion, good, or service to the consumer. Electronic marketing communications may include any email, short message service (SMS) message, web page, application interface, or the like, electronically generated for the purpose of attempting to sell or raise awareness of a product, service, promotion, or merchant to the consumer.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">It should be appreciated that the term &#x201c;electronic marketing communication&#x201d; implies and requires some portion of the content of the communication to be generated via an electronic process. For example, a telephone call made from an employee of the promotion and marketing service to a consumer for the purpose of selling a product or service would not qualify as an electronic marketing communication, even if the identity of the call recipient was selected by an electronic process and the call was dialed electronically, as the content of the telephone call is not generated in an electronic manner. However, a so-called &#x201c;robo-call&#x201d; with content programmatically selected, generated, or recorded via an electronic process and initiated by an electronic system to notify a consumer of a particular product, service, or promotion would qualify as an electronic marketing communication. Similarly, a manually drafted e-mail sent from an employee of the promotion and marketing service to a consumer for the purpose of marketing a product would not qualify as an electronic marketing communication. However, a programmatically generated email including marketing materials programmatically selected based on electronic marketing information associated with the recipient would qualify as an electronic marketing communication.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As used herein, the term &#x201c;business analytic data&#x201d; refers to data generated by the promotion and marketing service based on electronic marketing information to assist with the operation of the promotion and marketing service and/or one or more merchants. The various streams of electronic marketing information provided to and by the promotion and marketing service allow for the use of sophisticated data analysis techniques that may be employed to identify correlations, relationships, and other associations among elements of electronic marketing information. These associations may be processed and formatted by the promotion and marketing service to provide reports, recommendations, and services both internal to the promotion and marketing service and to merchants in order to improve the process by which merchants and promotion and marketing service engage with consumers. For example, the promotion and marketing service may analyze the electronic marketing information to identify an increased demand for a particular product or service, and provide an electronic report to a merchant suggesting the merchant offer the particular product or service. Alternatively, the promotion and marketing service may identify that a particular product or service is not selling well or that sales of the product or service result in the merchant losing money, customers, or market share (e.g., after consumers order a particular menu item, they never come back to the merchant), and suggest that the merchant should discontinue offering that product or service.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">It should be appreciated that the term &#x201c;business analytic data&#x201d; is intended to refer to electronically and programmatically generated data. For example, a printed report or letter manually drafted by an employee of the promotion and marketing service would not be said to include business analytic data, even if said data was used by the employee during the drafting process, while a data disk or downloaded file containing analytics generated by the promotion and marketing service would be considered business analytic data.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;merchant self-service indicator&#x201d; and &#x201c;promotion context&#x201d; relate to data associated with the merchant that may be used to classify the merchant or suggest promotion components to the merchant. A promotion context may include a plurality of merchant self-service indicators. For example, a promotion context may include multiple merchant self-service indicators that describe various features or characteristics of the merchant, such as a the type of industry of the merchant, the type of products or services sold by the merchant, the size of the merchant, the location of the merchant, the sales volume of the merchant, reviews and ratings for the merchant, or the like.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, the merchant self-service indicators are a result of analytics that allow for generation of promotions that are ideal for the particular merchant's circumstances. For example, the merchant self-service indicators may be used to identify optimal promotions for the particular merchant based on their exact location (e.g., the particular city street of the merchant as opposed to a wider range, such as a zip code), the merchant's exact products and services offered (e.g., pizzerias that only serve deep dish pizza, restaurants that become nightclubs after 11:00 pm), the merchant's price point (e.g., barbershops that charge more than $20 for a haircut), or the date or season of the year (e.g., offering ski equipment during the winter, or holiday themed promotions during the holiday season), or the like. These merchant self-service indicators may be used in a self-service process to identify promotion components that were used by other merchants that share one or more same or similar merchant self-service indicators. For example, after initial registration and verification, the promotion and marketing service may identify the merchant self-service indicators associated with the newly registered merchant, such as by looking up the merchant in a merchant database or by receiving the merchant self-service indicators directly from the merchant (e.g., by a Tillable form). The merchant self-service indicators and promotion contexts may be used for refund prediction. For example, such attributes may be used to identify weather a promotion for a specific merchant is likely to satisfy consumers (e.g., the promotion has 70% chance to satisfy consumers and therefore has 30% chance of resulting in refund requests). It should be appreciated that the term &#x201c;programmatically expected&#x201d; indicates machine prediction of occurrence of certain events. For example, a &#x201c;programmatically expected&#x201d; number of refund requests is a number determined by machine prediction specifying the expected number of promotion purchases that will result in refund requests.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As used herein, the term &#x201c;likelihood&#x201d; refers to a measure of probability for occurrence of a particular event. For example, the likelihood that a customer is satisfied with a promotion may be a value associated with a specific scale. In some implementations, the machine predictions discussed above are based, at least in part, on the &#x201c;likelihood&#x201d; that an event will occur. Similarly, in some implementations, machine predictions are based on attributes associated with a merchant and an associated merchant promotion.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">It should be appreciated that the terms &#x201c;refund,&#x201d; &#x201c;return,&#x201d; and &#x201c;transaction termination&#x201d; and &#x201c;termination transaction&#x201d; imply canceling/reversal of a transaction associated with a device rendered object. For example, a device terminating, returning, and/or requesting a refund for a transaction may be described by the act of returning goods or services received while requesting return of a purchase price for the transaction.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The term &#x201c;transaction data&#x201d; refers to electronic information indicating that a transaction is occurring or has occurred via the system. Transaction data may also include information relating to the transaction. For example, transaction data may include a timestamp, consumer payment or billing information, consumer shipping information, items purchased by the consumer, a merchant rewards account number associated with the consumer, the type of shipping selected by the consumer for fulfillment of the transaction, or the like. In embodiments, a transaction may be completed by a network asset requesting device and the system when the network asset requesting device interacts with a device rendered object in such a way that a purchase transaction is completed. In embodiments, a transaction may be completed by a network asset requesting device and the system when the network asset requesting device interacts with a device rendered object in such a way that a termination transaction is completed.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The term &#x201c;timestamp&#x201d; refers to a sequence of characters or encoded information identifying when a certain event occurred according to network time, usually giving date and time of day, sometimes accurate to a small fraction of a second.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The term &#x201c;system transaction data&#x201d; refers to a system wide aggregation of transaction data related to all transactions occurring between network asset requester devices, network asset provider devices, and device rendered objects. The term &#x201c;system transaction count&#x201d; refers to a number of transactions that have occurred system wide according to the system transaction data. In some embodiments, the system transaction data comprises a volume of currency associated with transactions indicating purchases of device rendered objects (e.g., promotions).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The term &#x201c;network time interval&#x201d; refers to a duration of network time defined by a starting timestamp and an ending timestamp, where the ending timestamp occurs subsequent to the starting timestamp. A network time interval may be from a past duration of time, a current duration of time, or a future duration of time. Examples of network time intervals may include one hour, one day, one week, one month, one year, and the like.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The term &#x201c;system resource allocation&#x201d; refers to an aggregation of network assets that is allocated to be available for fulfillment of network asset requests.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The term &#x201c;system resource allocation threshold&#x201d; refers to a required amount of system resources that need to be available in order to fulfill network asset requests.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The term &#x201c;prediction value&#x201d; refers to a programmatically generated likelihood of an event occurring. In embodiments, the prediction value is generated using machine learning.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The term &#x201c;historical data&#x201d; refers to any data associated with timestamps occurring prior to a defined timestamp or within a particular network time period.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">It will be appreciated that network assets, device rendered objects, network asset providers, network asset requesters, and the like, as described herein, may have associated therewith one or more attributes.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">It should be understood that each of the attributes discussed in this application, may be in some embodiments, may be a primary or a secondary attribute. A list of exemplary attributes is provided below.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some implementations, one attribute may represent category data, specifically beauty, wellness and healthcare. To determine a normalized value of the one attribute, an algorithm may be executed on associated raw data related to a transaction. For example, if the category data associated with a promotion transaction is &#x201c;beauty, wellness and healthcare,&#x201d; the value of the one attribute is 1. If the category data associated with a transaction is not &#x201c;beauty, wellness and healthcare,&#x201d; the value of the one attribute is 0.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments, a number of example attributes relate to category data and sub-category data. There is also a number of attributes related to location data. It should be understood that attribute data related to location and hyper location data may be generated in a similar fashion. For example, if the location data associated with a transaction is &#x201c;Chicago,&#x201d; the value of a corresponding attribute may be 1. If the category data associated with a transaction is not &#x201c;Chicago,&#x201d; the value of the corresponding attribute may be 0.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">It should also be understood that transactions may have associated data indicating one or more categories, sub-categories, location, hyper-locations, prices or the like. For example, a transaction may be associated with a gym, and the gym may be associated with category data such as &#x201c;beauty, wellness, and healthcare,&#x201d; &#x201c;Food and drink,&#x201d; &#x201c;Leisure Offers and Activities&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;Services.&#x201d; A gym may also have more than one location, and may be able to provide promotions in a variety of price ranges and time frames.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Example attribute data can also be associated with review websites such as Yelp&#xae;, Google&#xae;, Yahoo&#xae;, City Search&#xae;, Trip Advisor&#xae;. It should be understood that any review website could have associated attribute data, such as for example Zagat&#xae;, Bing&#xae; or the like. It should also be understood that attribute data associated with reviews related to one or more categories may be generated. For example, a website may provide reviews related to a provider's food, service, decor, price or the like. Attribute data may be generated related to each of one or more categories, such as a provider's food, service, decor, price, or the like.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">It should also be understood that a location, hyper-location, category or sub-category may affect data available for the provider of a transaction. For example, promotion transactions purchased from providers from different locations (e.g., different countries, states, neighborhoods or the like) may be associated with different attribute data. For example, different countries have different credit reporting rules and agencies. Thus, a system may utilize a first combination of attributes for a transaction from a provider in a first location, hyper-location, category or sub-category and a second combination of attributes for a transaction from provider in a second location, hyper-location, category or sub-category.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In one implementation, other attribute data may be used. For example, attribute &#x201c;bad month&#x201d; may relate to identifying transactions having attributes associated with network time intervals (e.g., booking months) where prior transactions have involved products, services, and/or other offerings in one or more categories categorized as having high termination transaction rates based on prior performance data. The feature may be normalized such that if the sub-category of the promotion transaction is associated with high return rates, the attribute is 1, else the attribute is 0. Other example attributes are &#x201c;bad market,&#x201d; which may be normalized such that if the transaction has an attribute associated with GPS coordinates that indicate a significant distance requiring travel to a location and/or hyper local region associated with high return rates, the attribute is 1, else the attribute is 0. Another example feature is &#x201c;average price for sub-category.&#x201d; In some embodiments, GPS coordinates are used as an attribute to associate a merchant with a merchant division, which is similar to a neighborhood or city.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Similar attributes may be clustered, grouped, or aggregated. For example, attributes associated with locations or location based attributes may be grouped under header attribute &#x201c;location.&#x201d; For example, a division attributes specifying a division where the promotion is offered and an attribute specifying a distance from a center of a city where a promotion is offered may be clustered under the location header attribute. Similarly, attributes associated with &#x201c;past performance,&#x201d; &#x201c;category &#x26; service,&#x201d; &#x201c;completion,&#x201d; &#x201c;maximum capacity,&#x201d; &#x201c;hero score,&#x201d; &#x201c;review data&#x201d; may each also be clustered and/or grouped under header attributes. For example, with respect to promotion transaction associated with a merchant providing a service, attributes specifying past performance data can be for (1) the same merchant and the same service, (2) only the same merchant, (3) only the same service may be clustered under attribute header &#x201c;past performance.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Table A shows example attributes.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="70pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="133pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" rowsep="1">TABLE A</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Type</entry><entry>Features</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Location</entry><entry>division, distance to city, etc.</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>past performance</entry><entry>same merchant &#x26; service, same service, </entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>same merchant, etc.</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>category &#x26; service</entry><entry>service header, primary deal service, etc.</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>booking month</entry><entry>holiday, pre-holiday, etc.</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>maximum capacity</entry><entry>units_avail, etc.</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>hero score</entry><entry>predicted 30 day bookings, predicted 60 </entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>day bookings, etc.</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>review data</entry><entry>yelp_n_review, yelp_rating, </entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>yelp_avil, google_n_review,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>facebook_fans, etc.</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0070" num="0068">The clustered or the non-clustered attributes may be used to train a machine learning model. It should be understood that the selection of attributes or clusters of attributes for training machine learning models or for promotion termination prediction processes can greatly affect the respective performance. In some implementations, attributes and/or clusters of attributes are selected based on statistical analysis. In some implementations, selection of the most significant attributes is based on one or more different attribute selection approaches. These approaches may be (1) forward selection, which is starting with the most significant attributes and incrementally adding a next significant attribute until the model is stable; (2) backward elimination, which starts with all the attributes and exclude the non-significant attributes one by one until the model is stable; (3) a combination of forward selection and backward elimination; and (4) checking the significance of the attribute by statistical model (regression). In one embodiment, each attribute selection approach may give a subset of significant attributes. The attributes that are not shown to be significant by one or more of the attribute selection approaches may be excluded from the model.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069">In some implementations, the processes disclosed herein are performed according to a random forest model. The model may operate by constructing multiple decision trees at training. Each decision tree may be based on different attributes. In some implementations, the random forest model output is the mode of classes or the most occurring class among all the trees of the random forest. In some implementations, the random forest model is trained with historical data associated with various attributes. In some implementations, different trained models may be utilized for different locations and/or types of promotion transactions.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Technical Underpinnings and Implementation of Exemplary Embodiments</heading><p id="p-0072" num="0070">Merchants, including manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers, have spent a tremendous amount of time, money, manpower, and other resources to determine the best way to market their products to consumers. Whether a given marketing effort is successful is often determined based on the return-on-investment offered to the merchant from increased awareness, sales, and the like, of the merchant's goods and services in exchange for the resources spent on the marketing effort. In other words, optimal marketing techniques generally maximize the benefit to the merchant's bottom line while minimizing the cost spent on marketing. To this end, a merchant's marketing budget may be spent in a variety of different manners including advertising, offering of discounts, conducting market research, and various other known marketing techniques. The end goal of these activities is to ensure that products are presented to consumers in a manner that maximizes the likelihood that the consumers will purchase the product from the merchant that performed the marketing activities while minimizing the expense of the marketing effort.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">The advent of electronic commerce has revolutionized the marketing process. While merchants would typically have to perform costly market research such as focus groups, surveys, and the like to obtain detailed information on consumer preferences and demographics, the digital age has provided a wealth of new consumer information that may be used to optimize the marketing and sales process. As a result, new technologies have been developed to gather, aggregate, analyze, and report information from a variety of electronic sources.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0072">So-called &#x201c;clickstream data&#x201d; provides a robust set of information describing the various interactions consumers have with electronic marketing information provided to them by merchants and others. Promotion and marketing services have been developed with sophisticated technology to receive and process this data for the benefit of both merchants and consumers. These services assist merchants with marketing their products to interested consumers, while reducing the chance that a consumer will be presented with marketing information in which the consumer has no interest. Some promotion and marketing services further leverage their access to the trove of electronic marketing information to assist merchants and consumers with other tasks, such as offering improved merchant point-of-sale systems, improved inventory and supply chain management, improved methods for delivering products and services, and the like.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073">Unlike conventional marketing techniques related to the use of paper or other physical media (e.g., coupons clipped from a weekly newspaper), promotion and marketing services offer a wealth of additional electronic solutions to improve the experience for consumers and merchants. The ability to closely monitor user impressions provides the ability for the promotion and marketing service to gather data related to the time, place, and manner in which the consumer engaged with the impression (e.g., viewed, clicked, moused-over) and obtained and redeemed the promotion. The promotion and marketing service may use this information to determine which products and services are most relevant to the consumer's interest, and to provide marketing materials related to said products and services to the consumer, thus improving the quality of the electronic marketing communications received by the consumer. Merchants may be provided with the ability to dynamically monitor and adjust the parameters of promotions offered by the promotion and marketing service, ensuring that the merchant receives a positive return on their investment. For example, the merchant can closely monitor the type, discount level, and quantity sold of a particular promotion on the fly, while with traditional printed coupons the merchant would not be able to make any changes to the promotion after the coupon has gone to print. Each of these advancements in digital market and promotion distribution involve problems unique to the digital environment not before seen in traditional print or television broadcast marketing.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">However, these promotion and marketing services are not without problems. Although the clickstream data provides a wealth of information, the inventors have determined that existing techniques may not always leverage this information in an efficient or accurate manner. Technology continues to rapidly advance in the field of analytics and the processing of this information, offering improved data gathering and analysis techniques, resulting in more relevant and accurate results provided in a more efficient manner. Electronic marketing services continue to evolve and provide improved methods for engaging consumers and spreading awareness of products offered by promotion and marketing services.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">In many cases, the inventors have determined that these services are constrained by technological obstacles unique to the electronic nature of the services provided, such as constraints on data storage, accuracy of data available, machine communication and processor resources. The inventors have identified that the wealth of electronic data available to these services and the robust nature of electronic marketing communications techniques present new challenges never contemplated in the world of paper coupons and physical marketing techniques. The inventors have further determined that even technological methods that leverage computers for statistical analysis and consumer behavior modeling (e.g., television rating systems) fail to address problems associated with providing relevant, high quality electronic marketing communications (e.g., impressions) to consumers in a manner that maximizes accuracy, minimizes error, is user friendly and provides for efficient allocation of resources. Embodiments of the present invention as described herein serve to correct these errors and offer improved resource utilization, thus providing improvements to electronic marketing services that address problems arising out of the electronic nature of those services.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">System Architecture and Example Apparatus</heading><p id="p-0078" num="0076">Methods, apparatuses, and computer program products of the present invention may be embodied by any of a variety of devices.

Moreover, the resource management system <b>102</b> may comprise a server <b>104</b> in communication with a database <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">The server <b>104</b> may be embodied as a computer or computers as known in the art.

For example, the server <b>104</b> may be operable to receive and process clickstream data provided by the network asset requester devices <b>108</b> and/or the network asset provider devices <b>110</b>. The server <b>104</b> may also facilitate e-commerce transactions based on transaction information provided by the network asset requester devices <b>108</b> and/or the network asset provider devices <b>110</b>.

The database <b>106</b> includes information accessed and stored by the server <b>104</b> to facilitate the operations of the resource management system <b>102</b>. For example, the database <b>106</b> may include, without limitation, user account credentials for system administrators, network asset providers (e.g., merchants), and network asset requesters (e.g., consumers), data indicating the device rendered objects transmittable by the resource management system, clickstream data, analytic results, reports, financial data, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0080">The network asset requester devices <b>108</b>A-<b>108</b>N may be any computing device as known in the art and operated by a network asset requester (e.g., consumer). Electronic data received by the server <b>104</b> from the network asset requester devices <b>108</b>A-<b>108</b>N may be provided in various forms and via various methods. For example, the network asset requester devices <b>108</b>A-<b>108</b>N may include desktop computers, laptop computers, smartphones, netbooks, tablet computers, wearables, and the like. The information may be provided through various sources on these consumer devices.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0081">In embodiments where a network asset requester device <b>108</b> is a mobile device, such as a smart phone or tablet, the network asset requester device <b>108</b> may execute an &#x201c;app&#x201d; to interact with the resource management system <b>102</b>. Such apps are typically designed to execute on mobile devices, such as tablets or smartphones. For example, an app may be provided that executes on mobile device operating systems such as Apple Inc.'s iOS&#xae;, Google Inc.'s Android&#xae;, or Microsoft Inc.'s Windows 8&#xae;. These platforms typically provide frameworks that allow apps to communicate with one another and with particular hardware and software components of mobile devices. For example, the mobile operating systems named above each provide frameworks for interacting with location services circuitry, wired and wireless network interfaces, user contacts, and other applications in a manner that allows for improved interactions between apps while also preserving the privacy and security of consumers. In some embodiments, a mobile operating system may also provide for improved communication interfaces for interacting with external devices (e.g., home automation systems, indoor navigation systems, and the like). Communication with hardware and software modules executing outside of the app is typically provided via application programming interfaces (APIs) provided by the mobile device operating system.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0082">The resource management system <b>102</b> may leverage the application framework offered by the mobile operating system to allow network asset requesters (e.g., consumers) to designate which information is provided to the app and which may then be provided to the resource management system <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, network asset requesters may &#x201c;opt in&#x201d; to provide particular data to the resource management system <b>102</b> in exchange for a benefit, such as improved relevancy of communications transmitted to the network asset requester device. In some embodiments, the network asset requester device may be provided with privacy information and other terms and conditions related to the information provided to the resource management system <b>102</b> during installation or use of the app. Once the network asset requester provides access to a particular feature of the mobile device, information derived from that feature may be provided to the resource management system <b>102</b> to improve the quality of the network asset requester's interactions with the resource management system <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0083">For example, the network asset requester may indicate that they wish to provide location information to the app from location services circuitry included in their mobile device. Providing this information to the resource management system <b>102</b> may enable the resource management system <b>102</b> to transmit instructs for rendering device rendered objects that display promotions to the network asset requester device that are relevant to the particular location, e.g., GPS coordinates, of the network asset requester device (e.g., by providing device rendered objects for displaying promotions for network asset providers proximate to the network asset requester device's current location). It should be appreciated that the various mobile device operating systems may provide the ability to regulate the information provided to the app associated with the resource management system <b>102</b>. For example, the network asset requester may decide at a later point to disable the ability of the app to access the location services circuitry, thus limiting the access of the network asset requester device's location information to the resource management system <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0084">Additionally or alternatively, the network asset requester device <b>108</b> may interact through the resource management system <b>102</b> via a web browser.

Electronic data received by the resource management system <b>102</b> from the network asset provider devices <b>110</b>A-<b>110</b>N may also be provided in various forms and via various methods. For example, the network asset provider devices <b>110</b>A-<b>110</b>N may provide real-time transaction and/or inventory information as transactions occur with the network asset provider. In other embodiments, the network asset provider devices <b>110</b>A-<b>110</b>N may be employed to provide information to the resource management system <b>102</b> to enable the resource management system <b>102</b> to generate instructions for device rendered objects renderable to display information (e.g., promotions or other marketing information) to be transmitted to network asset requester devices.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0086">An example of a data flow for exchanging electronic information among one or more network asset provider devices, network asset provider devices, and the resource management system is described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example Apparatus For Implementing Embodiments of the Present Invention</heading><p id="p-0089" num="0087">The server <b>104</b> may be embodied by one or more computing systems, such as apparatus <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

In some implementations, the received data may be a normalized score indicative of a probability that a transaction will result in a termination transaction. For example, a termination transaction may be a request for return of merchandise accompanied by a request for a refund.

This electronic marketing information may include, but is not limited to, location data, clickstream data, transaction data, communication channel data, historical data, review data and/or discretionary data.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0101">As a result of transactions performed between the one or more network asset requester devices <b>304</b> and the server <b>302</b>, the server <b>302</b> may provide fulfillment data to the network asset requester devices. The fulfillment data may include information indicating whether the transaction was successful, the location and time the product will be provided to the network asset requester, instruments for redeeming promotions purchased by the network asset requester, or the like.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0102">In addition to the e-commerce interactions with the one or more network asset requester devices <b>304</b> offered by the server <b>302</b>, the server <b>302</b> may leverage information provided by the network asset requester devices to improve the relevancy of electronic communications to individual network asset requester or groups of network asset requester. In this manner, the server <b>302</b> may determine device rendered objects, promotions, goods, and services that are more likely to be of interest to a particular network asset requester or group of network asset requesters based on clickstream data, location data, and other information provided by and/or relating to particular network asset requesters. For example, the server <b>302</b> may detect the location of a network asset requester based on location data provided by the network asset requester device, and offer promotions based on the proximity of the network asset requester to the network asset provider associated with those promotions.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0103">Alternatively, the server <b>302</b> may note that the network asset requester has an interest in a particular hobby (e.g., skiing) based on electronic marketing information associated with the network asset requester (e.g., a browser cookie that indicates they frequently visit websites that provide snowfall forecasts for particular ski resorts), and offer promotions associated with that hobby (e.g., a promotion offering discounted ski equipment rentals or lift tickets). It should be appreciated that a variety of different types of electronic marketing information could be provided to the server <b>302</b> for the purpose of improving the relevancy of marketing communications. It should also be appreciated that this electronic marketing information may be received from a variety of electronic sources, including various network asset requester devices, network asset provider devices, and other sources both internal and external to a promotion and marketing service. For example, other data sources may include imported contact databases maintained by merchants, electronic survey questions answered by consumers, and/or various other forms of electronic data.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0104">It should also be appreciated that the server <b>302</b> may also control other factors of the electronic marketing communications sent to the consumer other than the particular promotions included in the electronic marketing communication. For example, the server <b>302</b> may determine the form, structure, frequency, and type of the electronic marketing communication. As with the content of the electronic marketing communication, these factors may be programmatically determined according to various methods, factors, and processes based on electronic data received by the server <b>302</b> for the purpose of maximizing the likelihood that the communication will be relevant to the recipient consumer.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0105">The server <b>302</b> interactions with the one or more network asset provider devices <b>306</b> may be related to enabling the merchant to market their products using a promotion and marketing service. For example, the one or more network asset provider devices <b>306</b> may provide promotion data defining one or more promotions to be offered by the promotion and marketing service on behalf of the merchant. The server <b>302</b> may receive this information and generate information for providing such promotions via an e-commerce interface, making the promotions available for purchase by consumers. The server <b>302</b> may also receive information about products from the one or more network asset provider devices <b>306</b>. For example, a merchant may provide electronic marketing information indicating particular products, product prices, inventory levels, and the like to be marketed via a promotion and marketing service. The server <b>302</b> may receive this information and generate listing information to offer the indicating products to consumers via a promotion and marketing service.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0106">The one or more network asset provider devices <b>306</b> may also receive information from the server <b>302</b>. For example, in some embodiments a merchant may obtain access to certain business analytic data aggregated, generated, or maintained by the server <b>302</b>. As a particular example, a merchant might offer to pay for consumer demographic data related to products or services offered by the merchant. It should be appreciated, however, that a merchant may not need to list any products or services via the promotion and marketing service in order to obtain such data. For example, the promotion and marketing service may enable merchants to access electronic marketing data offered via the promotion and marketing service based on a subscription model. The one or more network asset provider devices <b>306</b> may also receive electronic compensation data from the server <b>302</b>. For example, when a promotion or product is sold by the promotion and marketing service on behalf of the merchant, a portion of the received funds may be transmitted to the merchant. The compensation data may include information sufficient to notify the merchant that such funds are being or have been transmitted. In some embodiments, the compensation data may take the form of an electronic wire transfer directly to a merchant account. In some other embodiments, the compensation data may indicate that a promotion or product has been purchased, but the actual transfer of funds may occur at a later time. For example, in some embodiments, compensation data indicating the sale of a promotion may be provided immediately, but funds may not be transferred to the merchant until the promotion is redeemed by the consumer.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0107">Embodiments advantageously provide for improvements to the server by allowing prediction of system resource volumes more efficiently and accurately. In turn, this reduces the server stress. For example, by eliminating unnecessary reuse of global variables throughout iterations, the server reduces the processing associated with predicting required system resource volumes in a given future network period. In turn, the processing power requirement of the server is significantly reduced.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Example Processes For System Resource Calculation</heading><p id="p-0110" num="0108">As described, a system may utilize network communications to deliver remote computing devices with device rendered objects representing available promotions related to products, services or experiences offered by providers that may be of interest.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0109">In order to maintain accurate data stores associated with provider accounts, the system must have an available volume system resources.

The process <b>400</b> begins with receiving first transaction data and second transaction data, where the first transaction data comprises a first timestamp and the second transaction data comprises a second timestamp (<b>402</b>). In some implementations, the first and second transaction data are associated with a device rendered object of a plurality of device rendered objects. In some implementations, the second timestamp is subsequent the first timestamp. In some embodiments, the second transaction is a termination transaction. In some embodiments, the device rendered object is a set of instructions that, when executed by a consumer computing device, enables an electronic display interface that represents a promotion. In some implementations, the promotion may be for any goods offered by a department store. In some implementations, the promotion may be for a specific type of goods offered by the department store (e.g., camping equipment). In some implementations, the promotion may be for a specific item, such as, a bike. Similarly, the promotion may be for services offered by a service store, where the service store may request transmittal of promotion for services provided by the store (e.g., haircut, hair coloring, oil change). In some implementations, stores may offer a combination of services and goods.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0112">The process <b>400</b> continues with receiving system transaction data (<b>404</b>). In some embodiments, system transaction data comprises a network time interval and a system transaction count occurring during the network time interval.

The model includes features such as distance, the popularity of a category of service or product, whether the promotion relates to a service, whether the merchant has offered a promotion before, whether the type of promotion has a high history of refunds, and whether the product is available online.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0123">The exemplary random forest <b>600</b> is composed of N trees, where N is a number. The prediction of the random forest is the average of the predictions from the N trees. The prediction from a tree is determined by a root node decision (e.g., attribute associated with booking month) and then traversing a logic path through the tree to a terminal leaf node based on the decision outcome determined at each successive node along the path. For example, in a model comprised of N trees where N is 5, the random forest prediction is the average of all of the trees. Based on a certain threshold, for example 0.5, the prediction is that a promotion transaction from a prior network time period will (&#x201c;1&#x201d;) or will not (&#x201c;0&#x201d;) result in a termination transaction in a future network time period. By way of further example, if a promotion transaction occurred in a month that was not associated with a holiday and is associated with a popular category, the promotion transaction may receive a score of &#x201c;0.&#x201d; As another example, if the promotion occurred in a month that is associated with being pre-holiday (e.g., November), and is a service (i.e., requires the customer to travel to the site), the transaction may receive a score of &#x201c;1.&#x201d; The exemplary random forest <b>1300</b> prediction is the average of the respective predictions from trees <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>5</b>.

Assuming an exemplary threshold for a transaction is 0.5, (e.g., if the score is greater than or equal to 0.5, the transaction is considered likely to result in a termination transaction in the future network period), the transaction in this example is considered not likely to result in a termination transaction in the future network period.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">Additional Implementation Details</heading><p id="p-0126" num="0124">Although an example processing system has been described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, implementations of the subject matter and the functional operations described herein can be implemented in other types of digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0125">Embodiments of the subject matter and the operations described herein can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.
