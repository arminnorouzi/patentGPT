Such a hybrid combination of III-V devices and group-IV photonic integrated circuit allows the realization of an ultra-compact integrated optical device that can be used for many applications, such as biosensing (glucose, lactate, ethanol, etc.), LIDAR applications, gas sensing, etc.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Compact hybrid optical sensors that can be used to non-invasively measure blood metabolites, such as glucose, lactate, ethanol, urea, etc., have a huge potential for consumer applications, because such integrated sensors have extremely small footprints and are compatible with electronics used in wearable and other smart devices. See, e.g., WO2019/149815 to Vizbaras et al., and WO2018/215388 to Vizbaras, et al. (also U.S. Ser. No. 16/609,355), incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Entry into the consumer market is facilitated by a sufficiently low cost of goods (COGS).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, sensors may include a plurality of III-V light emitters and detectors hybridly integrated into a group-IV photonic integrated circuit to form the sensors. Integration is an expensive step, both in terms of time and money, because it is difficult to avoid serial one-by-one integration of each component. Moreover, such III-V devices are typically made from different epitaxial layer stacks; thus, they are also realized separately.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments of the invention enable a significant reduction of the number of discrete components that need to be integrated to form a sensor, thus saving manufacturing time and costs. For example, a conventional sensor may include four light emitters (gain chips), four control detectors, and one signal detector, i.e., nine discrete III-V components that need to be integrated one by one in a serial manufacturing process. Moreover, their respective epitaxial layer stacks are typically grown in separate runs. Embodiments of the current invention, however, may include realizing one of the light sources on the same substrate as all four control detectors, with all of them being hybridly integrated in a single step. Thus the number of epitaxial growth steps for a single sensor are reduced by 20% and the number of components that need to be integrated is reduced by 45.5% (from nine to five), thereby allowing significant reduction of manufacturing costs and increase of overall manufacturing speed.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Compact hybrid optical sensors that can be used to non-invasively measure blood metabolites, such as glucose, lactate, ethanol, urea, etc., are useful for consumer applications, because such integrated sensors have extremely small footprints and are compatible with electronics.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an aspect, embodiments of the invention relate to a solid-state device including a semiconductor substrate; a solid-state light emitter disposed over the semiconductor substrate, the solid-state light emitter configured to emit light with a beam propagation direction; a light routing medium in optical communication with the solid-state light emitter; and a solid-state light detector disposed over the semiconductor substrate in optical communication with the light routing medium and configured to detect light emitted by the solid-state light emitter.

Such applications include non-invasive sensing through skin, gas sensing, stand-off detection, etc. See, e.g., WO 2019/149815. Devices that are semiconductor technology compatible are especially desirable, as they can be made very compact and are mass-market scalable. In such a case, complementary light emitter and detector layer stacks can be epitaxially grown using well-known techniques such as molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) or metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) from III-V semiconductor material, including group-III chemical elements, such as Al, Ga, In, group-V elements, As, Sb, Bi, P, N and/or alloy combinations thereof. Integrated photonic circuits, such as group-IV-based circuits, can be used as ultra-compact light routing media.

The light emitting device and light detecting device can be made from III-V semiconductor material, in the form of epitaxially grown layer stacks, each layer stack including a different plurality of layers of a single layer stack grown on the same III-V semiconductor substrate. The sequence in which the stacks are grown on the substrate can vary and depends on the final application (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>). Light is emitted from the emitter layer stack and detected in the detector layer stack in an-out of plane arrangement. The epitaxial layer stacks may be grown by standard existing semiconductor device fabrication techniques, well known to people skilled in the art of III-V semiconductor devices. The exact layer stacks, device type, geometry and functional elements depend on the desired application and performance related variables; regardless of the application, embodiments of the invention enable light emission from a light emitter and light detection by the detector medium to take place in an-out-of-plane arrangement.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a semiconductor substrate <b>101</b> may be a III-V wafer, e.g., a GaAs wafer.

A detector <b>104</b> may be formed from a detector epitaxial layer stack in including a plurality of layers different from those of the emitter layer stack. The detector and emitter epitaxial layer stacks are each formed, as discussed below, from a single epitaxial layer stack grown on the semiconductor substrate. The detector layer stack is fabricated to collect light out-of-plane with respect to the epitaxial layer plane and light emitter emission direction. Light routing medium <b>103</b> enables light communication between the emitter <b>102</b> and the detector <b>104</b>.

In the illustrated embodiment, the active layers of the detector layer stack are grown first, followed by the active layers of the light emitter layer stack, which serves as a light emitter.

For example, light routing media may be realized using a semiconductor on insulator (SOI) platform (e.g., buried oxide technology). Accordingly, the functional routing blocks, such as spot-size converters, interferometers, filters, splitters, mirrors, rings, etc., are typically made at a certain depth from the surface (e.g., few micrometers). These functional blocks may require a complementary light emitter-detector pair have an additional thickness matching layer (<b>403</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) to enable efficient light coupling into the routing medium.

The layer can be highly Te doped (3&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>), and serve as an n-contact for the light emitter. The thickness of the thickness matching layer <b>910</b> depends on the integrated circuit geometry. For example, to couple light efficiently into a silicon waveguide, one must match precisely, i.e., with sub-micrometer precision, the optical mode of the III-V light emitter and the waveguide coupler (e.g., spot-size converter). The depth of the waveguides and other functional silicon blocks depends on the manufacturing platform used (such as a silicon fab process). For example, a fabrication process may result in a buried oxide depth of 2 micrometers from the surface, silicon waveguide thickness of 220 nm and the depth of silicon waveguides of 6.6 micrometers from the surface. The thickness matching layer has to be adjusted in such a manner, that the light emitter active region is matched with a silicon waveguide within several hundreds of nanometers (effectively has to be at 6.6 microns from the surface of silicon integrated circuit). In other fabrication facilities, the thicknesses and depth from surface can be very different, and, therefore, the thickness matching layer <b>910</b> needs to be adjusted accordingly.</li>        <li id="ul0005-0007" num="0076">Graded layer <b>911</b>: The thickness matching layer <b>910</b> is followed by a nominally highly n-type Te doped (3&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>) graded layer, which is 60 nm thick and includes quaternary Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>As<sub>y</sub>Sb<sub>1-y </sub>alloy, with linearly graded Al composition from 0.1 to 0.35.
