As a result, deterioration of high-temperature storage characteristics of the non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery is suppressed. On the other hand, since the non-aqueous electrolyte solution containing a Li imide salt has a higher viscosity than that of the non-aqueous electrolyte solution containing no Li imide salt, the permeation of the non-aqueous electrolyte solution to the negative electrode active material layer tends to be deteriorated in a low-temperature environment. However, as in the present disclosure, the graphite particles A having an internal porosity of 5% or less are contained more in a half region on the outer surface side of the negative electrode active material layer than in a half region on the negative electrode current collector side of the negative electrode active material layer, whereby a gap serving as a flow path of the non-aqueous electrolyte solution is secured from the outer surface to the inside of the negative electrode active material layer. As a result, deterioration of the permeation of the non-aqueous electrolyte solution to the negative electrode active material layer is suppressed even in a low-temperature environment, and deterioration of low-temperature discharge characteristics of the non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery is suppressed.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0015">Hereinafter, au example of an embodiment will be described in detail with reference to the drawings. The non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery of the present disclosure is not limited to the embodiments described below.

A non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes a wound electrode assembly <b>14</b> formed by winding a positive electrode <b>11</b> and a negative electrode <b>12</b> with a separator <b>13</b> interposed therebetween, a non-aqueous electrolyte solution, insulating plates <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> respectively disposed above and below the electrode assembly <b>14</b>, and a battery case <b>15</b> housing the above-described members. The battery case <b>15</b> includes a bottomed cylindrical case body <b>16</b> and a sealing assembly <b>17</b> that closes an opening of the case body <b>16</b>. Instead of the wound electrode assembly <b>14</b>, another form of electrode assembly such as a stacked electrode assembly in which a positive electrode and a negative electrode are alternately stacked with a separator interposed therebetween may be applied. Examples of the battery case <b>15</b> include metal exterior cans having a cylindrical shape, a rectangular shape, a coin shape, a button shape, or the like, and a pouch exterior body formed by laminating a resin sheet and a metal sheet.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0017">The case body <b>16</b> is, for example, a bottomed cylindrical metal exterior can.

The case body <b>16</b> has, for example, a protruding portion <b>22</b> which supports the sealing assembly <b>17</b> and in which a part of a side surface portion extends inward.

The lower valve member <b>24</b> and the upper valve member <b>26</b> are connected to each other at each of the central portions thereof, and the insulating member <b>25</b> is interposed between the peripheral portions of these valve bodies.

As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a graphite particle <b>30</b> has a closed void <b>34</b> (hereinafter, internal void <b>34</b>) that is not connected from the inside of the particle to the surface of the particle and a void <b>36</b> (hereinafter, external void <b>36</b>) that is connected from the inside of the particle to the surface of the particle in the cross-sectional view of the graphite particle <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0026">The graphite particle <b>30</b> in the present embodiment includes a graphite particle A having an internal porosity of 5% or less and a graphite particle B having an internal porosity of 8% to 20%. The internal porosity of the graphite particles A may be 5% or less, but is preferably 1% to 5%, and more preferably 3% to 5%, from the viewpoint of suppressing deterioration of low-temperature discharge characteristics, and the like. The internal porosity of the graphite particles B may be 8% to 20%, and is preferably 10% to 18%, and more preferably 12% to 16%, from the viewpoint of suppressing deterioration of low-temperature discharge characteristics, and the like. Here, the internal porosity of the graphite particle is a two-dimensional value obtained from the ratio of the area of the internal void <b>34</b> of the graphite particle to the cross-sectional area of the graphite particle. The internal porosity of the graphite particle is determined by the following procedure.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0027">&#x3c;Method for Measuring Internal Porosity&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0028">(1) The cross section of the negative electrode active material layer is exposed. Examples of the method for exposing the cross section include a method in which a part of the negative electrode is cut out and processed by an ion milling apparatus (for example, IM 4000 PLUS, manufactured by Hitachi High-Tech Corporation) to expose the cross section of the negative electrode active material layer.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0029">(2) A reflected electron image of the cross section of the exposed negative electrode active material layer is taken using a scanning electron microscope. The magnification at the time of taking the reflected electron image is 3,000 times to 5,000 times.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0030">(3) The cross-sectional image obtained as described above is taken into a computer, and binarized using image analysis software (for example, ImageJ, manufactured by National Institutes of Health, USA.) to obtain a binarized image in which the particle cross section in the cross-sectional image is converted into black and voids present in the particle cross section are converted into white.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0031">(4) Graphite particles A and B having a particle size of 5 &#x3bc;m to 50 &#x3bc;m are selected from the binarized image, and the area of the cross section of the graphite particle and the area of internal voids present in the cross section of the graphite particle are calculated. Here, the area of the cross section of the graphite particle refers to the area of a region surrounded by the outer periphery of the graphite particle, that is, the area of the entire cross section portion of the graphite particle. In addition, for voids having a width of 3 &#x3bc;m or less among voids present in the cross section of the graphite particle, it may be difficult to determine whether the voids are internal voids or external voids in image analysis, and thus voids having a width of 3 &#x3bc;m or less may be considered to be internal voids. Then, the internal porosity of the graphite particle (the area of the internal voids of the cross section of the graphite particle&#xd7;100/the area of the cross section of the graphite particle) is calculated from the calculated area of the cross section of the graphite particle and area of the internal voids of the cross section of the graphite particle. The internal porosities of the graphite particles A and B are an average value of 10 graphite particles A and graphite particles B.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0032">The graphite particles A and B are produced, for example, as follows.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0033">&#x3c;Graphite Particles A Having Internal Porosity of 5% or Less&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0034">For example, coke (precursor) as a main raw material is pulverized into a predetermined size, the pulverized coke is aggregated with a binder, and then the coke is fired at a temperature of 2,600&#xb0; C. or higher to be graphitized and sieved to obtain graphite particles A having a desired size. Here, the internal porosity can be adjusted to 5% or less depending on the particle size of the precursor after pulverization, the particle size of the precursor in an aggregated state, and the like. The average particle size (volume-based median diameter D50) of the precursor after pulverization is preferably in the range of 12 inn to 20 &#x3bc;m, for example. When the internal porosity is reduced to 5% or less, it is preferable to increase the particle size of the precursor after pulverization.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0035">&#x3c;Graphite Particles B Having Internal Porosity of 8% to 20%&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0036" num="0036">For example, coke (precursor) as a main raw material is pulverized into a predetermined size, the pulverized coke is aggregated with a binder, and then the coke is further pressure-formed into a block shape and then fired at a temperature of 2,600&#xb0; C. or higher to be graphitized. The block-shaped formed body after graphitization is pulverized and sieved to obtain graphite particles B having a desired size.
