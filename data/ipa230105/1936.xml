The appended drawings are incorporated herein and constitute a part of the detailed description. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a more thorough understanding of the subject technology. However, it will be clear and apparent that the subject technology is not limited to the specific details set forth herein and may be practiced without these details. In some instances, structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the subject technology.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As described herein, one aspect of the present technology is the gathering and use of data available from various sources to improve quality and experience. The present disclosure contemplates that in some instances, this gathered data may include personal information. The present disclosure contemplates that the entities involved with such personal information respect and value privacy policies and practices.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In autonomous vehicle (AV) deployments, sensor-data is collected (by the AV) using a variety of sensors, including rotating/scanning sensors such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and/or radar sensors. In such deployments, sensor-data acquisition is performed by scanning or rotating sensor components through a field of view <b>207</b>, e.g., typically in a direction pointing outward from the AV's perspective. In some implementations, sensor movement/scanning is controlled by a motor controller that controls the rotation of the sensor via a sensor assembly and motor setup.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some instances, sensor operation is degraded or inhibited due to a malfunction of the sensor assembly, such as when the assembly can no longer be rotated, or cannot be rotated in the correct orientation, and/or cannot be rotated at a desired speed. Such sensor assembly malfunctions can have a variety of root causes, including degradation or wear on bearings or other mechanical components in the assembly. Additionally, sensor assembly malfunctions may result from improper assembly mounting or installation.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Aspects of the disclosed technology provide solutions for validating AV sensor functionality by testing the operability of corresponding sensor assemblies. In some aspects, assembly tests can be performed based on information or data collected (e.g., motor controller measurements) from a motor controller that is configured to control sensor assembly rotation. As discussed in further detail below, determinations of sensor assembly operation or health can be performed locally, i.e., by compute nodes of the AV, or remotely, i.e., by a management system.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">By providing systems and processes for facilitating the automated validation of AV sensor functionality, the disclosed invention greatly improves AV workflows relying on sensor checks to ensure safe and efficient AV operations.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> conceptually illustrates an example of a system <b>100</b> that can be used to detect faulty sensor assemblies, e.g., on one or more autonomous vehicles (AVs). System <b>100</b> includes management system <b>102</b> that is configured to receive and process data transmitted by various autonomous vehicles <b>106</b>. In some aspects, management system <b>102</b> is configured to receive data that is collected from one or more motor controllers (not illustrated) that control operations of various sensor/s on AVs <b>106</b>A-<b>106</b>N. The received data can include motor controller measurements <b>104</b> that include various measurements (e.g., current measurements, voltage measurements, torque measurements, and/or position measurements) associated with the control/actuation of various sensor assemblies (not illustrated) on the respective AVs <b>106</b>A-<b>106</b>N.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In operation, the motor controller measurements can be used for validating the operation of a corresponding sensor assembly. For example, the motor controller measurements can be collected to perform an assembly test based on current draw characteristics associated with a motor affixed to the controller assembly. In some examples, the assembly test may be performed locally, e.g., using one or more compute nodes resident on the corresponding AV <b>106</b>. In other aspects, assembly tests can be performed by one or more remote systems (e.g., management system <b>102</b>), using motor controller measurements <b>104</b>A-N, associated with a respective AV <b>106</b>A-N.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a conceptual diagram of a sensor assembly and motor controller setup <b>200</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, motor controller <b>202</b> is communicatively coupled to a motor <b>204</b> that is coupled to a sensor assembly <b>205</b>. In a typical implementation, motor <b>204</b> can be configured to rotate/scan sensor assembly <b>205</b> through a field of view <b>207</b>, for example beginning and point A <b>206</b>, and scanning to point B <b>208</b>. In some aspects, the motor controller <b>202</b> may be configured to control the movement/rotation of sensor assembly <b>205</b> such that specific speed and/or acceleration characteristics are achieved. By way of example, motor controller <b>202</b> can be configured to cause motor <b>204</b> to actuate sensor assembly <b>205</b>, in such a manner that scanning for the associated sensors (LiDAR/radar sensors) is accomplished at a specific frequency.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some implementations, motor controller <b>202</b> can be configured to monitor various motor controller measurements (e.g., position, time, voltage and/or current characteristics) corresponding with motor <b>204</b>. By way of example, motor controller <b>202</b> can be configured to measure and record (store) voltage and/or current draw measurements for the motor <b>204</b> as sweeping of the sensor assembly <b>205</b> is performed through field of view <b>207</b>. That is, motor controller measurements can be correlated with various motor positions along the field of view <b>207</b>, e.g., between point A <b>206</b>, and point B <b>208</b>. Motor controller measurements can also be correlated with a sweep count (e.g., a fourth sweep from sensor initialization), and/or a sensor operation duration.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some implementations, the motor controller measurements can be used to identify operation anomalies associated with the sensor assembly <b>205</b>. For example, because current draw measurements associated with the rotation of sensor assembly <b>205</b> can be modeled to correspond with the rotational characteristics (speed, acceleration, friction) of the sensor assembly <b>205</b>, such measurements can be used to identify/determine and/or predict operational decline and/or malfunction. By way of example, collected motor controller measurements can be used to detect trends in sensor assembly degradation. As such, the motor controller measurements can be used to predict future testing failures in the sensor assembly. For example, the motor controller measurements can be used to predict that peak and/or average current draws by the motor assembly are likely to exceed a pre-determined threshold, e.g., by identifying upward trends in current draw characteristics, such as average and/or peak current drawn by the motor assembly. A process for using motor controller measurements to validate sensor assembly <b>205</b> operations is discussed in further detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, below.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram <b>300</b> of a process for performing a sensor assembly test, according to some aspects of the disclosed technology. Process <b>300</b> begins with step <b>302</b> in which motor controller measurements are collected from a motor controller, such as motor controller <b>202</b>, discussed above. The motor controller measurements can include different types of data that are collected in conjunction with the operation (scanning) of a sensor assembly, e.g., to perform AV sensor-data acquisition using a scanning sensor, such as one or more: LiDAR/s, camera/s, directional microphone/s, radar/s and/or ultrasonic sensor/s, or the like. In some approaches, the motor controller measurements can include position, time, voltage and/or current characteristics, or the like.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some implementations, the motor controller measurements include current draw characteristics that indicate an amount of current that is required to actuate the sensor assembly, e.g., at a given speed, torque, or rotational velocity. Depending on the desired implementation, the motor controller measurements may also include data describing voltage, impedance, and/or torque characteristics associated with the sensor assembly actuation. In some aspects, torque characteristics may be determined using current measurements. For example, torque characteristics may be determined (or calculated) using a known mathematical relationship between torque and current, and/or a look-up table.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In step <b>304</b>, process <b>300</b> includes calculating an average current required to actuate the sensor assembly, e.g., an average current that is drawn by a motor of the sensor assembly. Depending on the desired implementation, the average current calculation may be performed locally, e.g., on a compute node that is physically proximate to the sensor assembly, such as using a computer on the corresponding AV. Alternatively, the average current calculation may be performed remotely, e.g., using one or more remote computing systems configured to receive various current measurements associated with the sensor assembly.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In step <b>306</b>, process <b>300</b> includes calculating a peak current that is required during the actuation of the sensor assembly, e.g., the greatest current that is drawn by the motor of the sensor assembly during its operation. Depending on the desired implementation, the peak current calculation may also be performed locally. Alternatively, the peak current calculation may be performed remotely, e.g., by one or more remote computing system that is configured to receive various current measurements associated with the sensor assembly, and to identify peak current draw events.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In step <b>308</b>, the process <b>300</b> includes determining if the sensor assembly passes the sensor assembly test, for example, based on the average current draw and/or the peak current draw. In some implementations, pre-determined (current) thresholds may be used to evaluate a pass/fail status with respect to the sensor assembly test. For example, if the average current drawn exceeds a pre-determined average current threshold, then the sensor assembly test may be indicated as a &#x2018;fail;&#x2019; whereas if the average current drawn is below the pre-determined average current threshold, then the sensor assembly test may be indicated as a &#x2018;pass.&#x2019; By way of further example, if the peak current drawn exceeds a pre-determined maximum (peak) current threshold, then the sensor assembly test may be indicated as a &#x2018;fail;&#x2019; whereas if the peak current drawn is below the pre-determined maximum current threshold, then the sensor assembly test may be indicated as a &#x2018;pass.&#x2019;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some aspects, a &#x2018;pass&#x2019; must be determined for current characteristic in order for the sensor assembly test to be indicated as a &#x2018;pass.&#x2019; In other aspects, a &#x2018;pass&#x2019; condition for at least one current characteristic may be required. Depending on the desired implementation, the pre-determined thresholds (e.g., the pre-determined average current threshold and/or the pre-determined maximum current threshold) may be stored locally, e.g., on a memory device associated with the sensor assembly/AV (e.g., on a look-up table), or remotely, e.g., on a memory device that is associated with one or more remote systems (servers).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some implementations, the controller measurements collected at step <b>302</b> can be used to predict future states of sensor assembly performance. For example, the controller measurements may be used to identify (e.g., by a management system, such as management system <b>102</b>) performance degradation trends for a given sensor assembly, or for a group of sensor assemblies. In some approaches, the identified trends can be used to predict when a given sensor assembly is likely to fail the sensor assembly test, as discussed above with respect to step <b>308</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As understood by those in the art, the pre-determined current thresholds may be set based on a user configurable parameter, or may be set based on various characteristics of the motor, sensor assembly, and/or motor controller, etc. By way of example, such characteristics can be specified based on the motor type and/or configuration (e.g., by a manufacturer rating). Alternatively, the current thresholds may be determined on a sensor-by-sensor basis, AV-by-AV basis, or based on various motor controller measurements (e.g., for multiple AVs), e.g., that are received/aggregated by one or more remote systems, such as management system <b>102</b>, discussed above. In some implementations, pre-determined current thresholds may be determined algorithmically, for example, based on motor and/or motor controller characteristics. By way of example, a pre-determined current threshold may be calculated based on a maximum current setting specified by the motor controller, such as 80% of the motor controller threshold. By way of further example, the pre-determined current threshold may be based on torque characteristics, such as a measured torque and a known value of a current/torque coefficient.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an example of an AV management system <b>500</b>.

Safety system <b>436</b> can include lights and signal indicators, a parking brake, airbags, and so forth. The cabin system <b>438</b> can include cabin temperature control systems, in-cabin entertainment systems, and so forth. In some embodiments, the AV <b>402</b> may not include human driver actuators (e.g., steering wheel, handbrake, foot brake pedal, foot accelerator pedal, turn signal lever, window wipers, etc.) for controlling the AV <b>402</b>. Instead, the cabin system <b>438</b> can include one or more client interfaces (e.g., Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), Voice User Interfaces (VUIs), etc.) for controlling certain aspects of the mechanical systems <b>430</b>-<b>438</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">AV <b>402</b> can additionally include a local computing device <b>410</b> that is in communication with the sensor systems <b>404</b>-<b>408</b>, the mechanical systems <b>430</b>-<b>438</b>, the data center <b>450</b>, and the client computing device <b>470</b>, among other systems. The local computing device <b>410</b> can include one or more processors and memory, including instructions that can be executed by the one or more processors. The instructions can make up one or more software stacks or components responsible for controlling the AV <b>402</b>; communicating with the data center <b>450</b>, the client computing device <b>470</b>, and other systems; receiving inputs from riders, passengers, and other entities within the AV's environment; logging metrics collected by the sensor systems <b>404</b>-<b>408</b>; and so forth. In this example, the local computing device <b>410</b> includes a perception stack <b>412</b>, a mapping and localization stack <b>414</b>, a planning stack <b>416</b>, a control stack <b>418</b>, a communications stack <b>420</b>, an HD geospatial database <b>422</b>, and an AV operational database <b>424</b>, among other stacks and systems.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Perception stack <b>412</b> can enable the AV <b>402</b> to &#x201c;see&#x201d; (e.g., via cameras, LIDAR sensors, infrared sensors, etc.), &#x201c;hear&#x201d; (e.g., via microphones, ultrasonic sensors, RADAR, etc.), and &#x201c;feel&#x201d; (e.g., pressure sensors, force sensors, impact sensors, etc.) its environment using information from the sensor systems <b>404</b>-<b>408</b>, the mapping and localization stack <b>414</b>, the HD geospatial database <b>422</b>, other components of the AV, and other data sources (e.g., the data center <b>450</b>, the client computing device <b>470</b>, third-party data sources, etc.). The perception stack <b>412</b> can detect and classify objects and determine their current and predicted locations, speeds, directions, and the like. In addition, the perception stack <b>412</b> can determine the free space around the AV <b>402</b> (e.g., to maintain a safe distance from other objects, change lanes, park the AV, etc.). The perception stack <b>412</b> can also identify environmental uncertainties, such as where to look for moving objects, flag areas that may be obscured or blocked from view, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Mapping and localization stack <b>414</b> can determine the AV's position and orientation (pose) using different methods from multiple systems (e.g., GPS, IMUs, cameras, LIDAR, RADAR, ultrasonic sensors, the HD geospatial database <b>422</b>, etc.). For example, in some embodiments, the AV <b>402</b> can compare sensor data captured in real-time by the sensor systems <b>404</b>-<b>408</b> to data in the HD geospatial database <b>422</b> to determine its precise (e.g., accurate to the order of a few centimeters or less) position and orientation. The AV <b>402</b> can focus its search based on sensor data from one or more first sensor systems (e.g., GPS) by matching sensor data from one or more second sensor systems (e.g., LIDAR). If the mapping and localization information from one system is unavailable, the AV <b>402</b> can use mapping and localization information from a redundant system and/or from remote data sources.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The planning stack <b>416</b> can determine how to maneuver or operate the AV <b>402</b> safely and efficiently in its environment. For example, the planning stack <b>416</b> can include an AV routing system that is configured to identify and select navigation routes. By way of example, the planning stack <b>416</b> can receive the location, speed, and direction of the AV <b>402</b>, geospatial data, data regarding objects sharing the road with the AV <b>402</b> (e.g., pedestrians, bicycles, vehicles, ambulances, buses, cable cars, trains, traffic lights, lanes, road markings, etc.) or certain events occurring during a trip (e.g., emergency vehicle blaring a siren, intersections, occluded areas, street closures for construction or street repairs, double-parked cars, etc.), traffic rules and other safety standards or practices for the road, user input, and other relevant data for directing the AV <b>402</b> from one point to another. The planning stack <b>416</b> can determine multiple sets of one or more mechanical operations that the AV <b>402</b> can perform (e.g., go straight at a specified rate of acceleration, including maintaining the same speed or decelerating; turn on the left blinker, decelerate if the AV is above a threshold range for turning, and turn left; turn on the right blinker, accelerate if the AV is stopped or below the threshold range for turning, and turn right; decelerate until completely stopped and reverse; etc.), and select the best one to meet changing road conditions and events. If something unexpected happens, the planning stack <b>416</b> can select from multiple backup plans to carry out. For example, while preparing to change lanes to turn right at an intersection, another vehicle may aggressively cut into the destination lane, making the lane change unsafe. The planning stack <b>416</b> could have already determined an alternative plan for such an event, and upon its occurrence, help to direct the AV <b>402</b> to go around the block instead of blocking a current lane while waiting for an opening to change lanes.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The control stack <b>418</b> can manage the operation of the vehicle propulsion system <b>430</b>, the braking system <b>432</b>, the steering system <b>434</b>, the safety system <b>436</b>, and the cabin system <b>438</b>. The control stack <b>418</b> can receive sensor signals from the sensor systems <b>404</b>-<b>408</b> as well as communicate with other stacks or components of the local computing device <b>410</b> or a remote system (e.g., the data center <b>450</b>) to effectuate operation of the AV <b>402</b>. For example, the control stack <b>418</b> can implement the final path or actions from the multiple paths or actions provided by the planning stack <b>416</b>. This can involve turning the routes and decisions from the planning stack <b>416</b> into commands for the actuators that control the AV's steering, throttle, brake, and drive unit.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The communication stack <b>420</b> can transmit and receive signals between the various stacks and other components of the AV <b>402</b> and between the AV <b>402</b>, the data center <b>450</b>, the client computing device <b>470</b>, and other remote systems. The communication stack <b>420</b> can enable the local computing device <b>410</b> to exchange information remotely over a network, such as through an antenna array or interface that can provide a metropolitan WIFI network connection, a mobile or cellular network connection (e.g., Third Generation (3G), Fourth Generation (4G), Long-Term Evolution (LTE), 5th Generation (5G), etc.), and/or other wireless network connection (e.g., License Assisted Access (LAA), Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS), MULTEFIRE, etc.). The communication stack <b>420</b> can also facilitate local exchange of information, such as through a wired connection (e.g., a user's mobile computing device docked in an in-car docking station or connected via Universal Serial Bus (USB), etc.) or a local wireless connection (e.g., Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), Bluetooth&#xae;, infrared, etc.).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The HD geospatial database <b>422</b> can store HD maps and related data of the streets upon which the AV <b>402</b> travels. In some embodiments, the HD maps and related data can comprise multiple layers, such as an areas layer, a lanes and boundaries layer, an intersections layer, a traffic controls layer, and so forth. The areas layer can include geospatial information indicating geographic areas that are drivable (e.g., roads, parking areas, shoulders, etc.) or not drivable (e.g., medians, sidewalks, buildings, etc.), drivable areas that constitute links or connections (e.g., drivable areas that form the same road) versus intersections (e.g., drivable areas where two or more roads intersect), and so on. The lanes and boundaries layer can include geospatial information of road lanes (e.g., lane centerline, lane boundaries, type of lane boundaries, etc.) and related attributes (e.g., direction of travel, speed limit, lane type, etc.). The lanes and boundaries layer can also include 3D attributes related to lanes (e.g., slope, elevation, curvature, etc.). The intersections layer can include geospatial information of intersections (e.g., crosswalks, stop lines, turning lane centerlines and/or boundaries, etc.) and related attributes (e.g., permissive, protected/permissive, or protected only left turn lanes; legal or illegal U-turn lanes; permissive or protected only right turn lanes; etc.). The traffic controls lane can include geospatial information of traffic signal lights, traffic signs, and other road objects and related attributes.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The AV operational database <b>424</b> can store raw AV data generated by the sensor systems <b>404</b>-<b>408</b> and other components of the AV <b>402</b> and/or data received by the AV <b>402</b> from remote systems (e.g., the data center <b>450</b>, the client computing device <b>470</b>, etc.).
