In particular, there are provided silicone-based compositions comprising oxidized carbon black particles.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Elastomers comprising solid particles providing a variety of desired properties to such elastomers are known in numerous industrial fields. By way of example, the particles may contribute to esthetical aspects of the elastomers, pigments for instance provide a desired color or tinting, they may modify mechanical properties, such as hardness, abrasion resistance, wear resistance, tensile and tear strengths and the like, or impart or modulate any other physical property of the matrix comprising them, including thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, or radiation absorption.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Depending on the end-use of the elastomer, the desired particles may have a variety of suitable regular or irregular shapes, in a wide range of sizes from a few nanometers to tens of micrometers. While not necessarily essential, many industrial applications prefer the particles to be homogeneously dispersed across the elastomer matrix. An adequate dispersion of particles within an elastomer generally requires &#x201c;compatibility&#x201d; between the two types of components. For instance, the particles may interact with the polymer matrix via hydrophobic:hydrophobic interactions, or via charge interactions and like mechanisms well known in the art of elastomers comprising particles. While these two components may inherently have properties rendering them compatible one with the other, it is also possible to rely on materials modified to increase such compatibility, which under favorable conditions may even result in superior dispersibility of the particles within the elastomeric matrix. For instance, there have been reports that functionalized polymers are more suitable than their non-functionalized counterparts to disperse certain particles. Alternatively, or additionally, the particles could be modified to better interact with the polymer matrix. Additional agents, such as surfactants or dispersants, can also be incorporated in elastomeric compositions comprising particles to enable or facilitate the desirable dispersion. Elastomeric compositions having a higher complexity (e.g., more constituents, more demanding characteristics, improved dispersion homogeneity, etc.) can be more challenging to prepare.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Elastomers that may benefit from the proper dispersion of particles within their matrix include natural and synthetic materials, silicone rubbers being of particular interest for innovative applications like electronic devices, medical applications or low and high temperature uses (e.g., remaining flexible and/or resilient between &#x2212;125&#xb0; C. and +250&#xb0; C.). Among the various types of particles that may advantageously be dispersed in elastomeric matrix such as prepared from silicone polymers, are carbon-based particles, such as graphene, graphite and carbon black (CB). CB, which has various sub-types, is of extensive interest. Among other functions, CB can be used as a pigment, as a reinforcement filler, as a thermal conductor, as an electrical conductor or as a radiation-absorber.</p><heading id="h-0004"

Moreover, this cured composition may contain any of the structural features of the cured composition as described herein, as well as any of the structural features of the cured composition that are inherent in a cured composition produced according to any of the production methods provided herein.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In some embodiments, the cured composition contains at least a trace or detectable quantity of at least one addition-cure catalyst, such as platinum and tin.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In some embodiments, the cured composition contains amino-silicone.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In some embodiments, the cured composition contains at least a trace or detectable quantity of platinum or tin, and further contains amino-silicone.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Without wishing to be bound by theory, the inventors believe that in using hydrophilic carbon black particles as the CB raw material for contacting with the siloxane-containing or silicone-based (silicone-compatible) dispersant in the size reduction process, carbon-black-affinic (amino, acrylate, and epoxy) functional groups or moieties may bond or otherwise associate with various oxygen-containing moieties disposed on a surface of the hydrophilic carbon black particles. The association may be sufficiently strong so as to anchor at least one of these large dispersant molecules to each one of the carbon black particles, to form a structure in which the carbon black particles become core particles that are at least partially enveloped by the dispersant molecule. Thus, from hydrophilic carbon black particles, treated carbon black particles exhibiting hydrophobic&#x2014;or even highly hydrophobic&#x2014;behavior, are surprisingly produced.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The above-referenced carbon-black-affinic moieties are preferably disposed in molecular positions having low steric hindrance. Thus, these moieties may be disposed on branches or branch units that extend away from the backbone of the dispersant molecule.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Each branching unit has a branch spine attached to said backbone, the spine typically having at least B atoms, wherein B is at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, or at least 8. The functional group (e.g., an amine moiety) may preferably be disposed at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, or at least 6 atoms from the dispersant backbone, so as to be sufficiently sterically unhindered so as to attach to the oxygen-bearing surface of the carbon black particle and thus anchor the dispersant so as to at least partially envelop the surface of the carbon black particle. Typically, the end or terminus moiety of the branch of the dispersant molecule is a functional group.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In addition, the inventors were motivated to incorporate these treated carbon black particles within a silicone matrix, which may be highly hydrophobic. The inventors found that these treated carbon black particles must be sufficiently hydrophobic and silicone-affinic to be miscible in the curable, hydrophobic silicone pre-polymer. Thus, the dispersant molecules must both exhibit a hydrophilic affinity so as to attach to the hydrophilic/polar oxygen-bearing surface of the carbon black particles, while exhibiting sufficient hydrophobic behavior to be suitably miscible in the hydrophobic and essentially non-polar silicone matrix. While being sufficiently hydrophilic to achieve the aforesaid purpose, the dispersant is essentially water-immiscible, as miscibility in water would render it incompatible with the silicone matrix.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The inventors have observed that a high siloxane content in the backbone of the molecule, in the branches extending from the backbone, or both, strongly promotes the miscibility of the dispersant molecule.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">While at high concentrations of sterically available functional groups in the dispersant molecule, the attachment to the oxygen-bearing surface of the carbon black particle may be appreciably enhanced, the inventors have further found that such high concentrations may reduce the miscibility of the dispersant molecule in the hydrophobic silicone pre-polymer. Thus, for amino-silicones, by way of example, the amine number (defined herein) may be at most 150, at most 130, at most 100, and more typically, at most 80, or yet lower. In order for the dispersant molecule to be sufficiently active with respect to the oxygen-bearing surface of the carbon black particle, the amine number may be at least 3, at least 4, or at least 5, and typically more than 5.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">With regard to the length of the dispersant backbone, the inventors have found that this length may be tailored to the desired carbon black particle size. This length, expressed as the number of atoms making up the backbone, may be within a wide range, e.g., 55 to 3000 atoms. However, for smaller carbon black (secondary) particle sizes, e.g., for a Dv50 of 100 nm, the number of atoms making up the backbone may be 55 to 1000 atoms, 65 to 900 atoms, or 75 to 800 atoms.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Some embodiments of the invention are described herein with reference to the accompanying drawings.

These curable and cured compositions can have a wide range of applications in a variety of industrial fields (e.g., in fields where CB can serve for its mechanical properties, for its heat conductive properties, for its electrical conductive properties, and other properties of this material). This disclosure is particularly concerned with compositions wherein the elastomer is a silicone polymer and wherein the CB particles are in the low micron (e.g., between about 1 &#x3bc;m and 10 &#x3bc;m) to sub-micron range, as further detailed herein-below.

Pre-polymers can be, by way of example, monomers, oligomers or polymers having cross-linkable moieties allowing them to form, under specific conditions, more complex networks, often referred to as polymer matrices. While certain pre-polymers may have cross-linkable moieties that can readily interact with moieties of additional pre-polymers upon mixing therewith, other may require the addition of cross-linkers.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0129">In some cases, the cross-linking of the pre-polymers can be facilitated by chemical agents known as curing facilitators or promoters, which include, by way of example, curing catalysts and curing accelerators. While curing catalysts are not consumed during the curing process, the accelerators may become part of the polymer matrix or be otherwise modified during the curing process, so as to be &#x201c;consumed&#x201d; as cross-linking progresses. Additional curing promoters include three-dimensional network formers, such as hydrophobic fumed silica. Conversely, the curing process can be delayed by retarding agents.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0130">Cured compositions generally refer to compositions wherein at least a portion of the cross-linkable moieties of the constituents of a curable composition have reacted or otherwise interacted with one another. Typically, curing of pre-polymers of a curable composition towards a cured composition can be monitored over time by a change in the mechanical properties of the composition (e.g., an increase in viscosity, hardness, stretchability, and the like) and/or in its physico-chemical properties (e.g., melting temperature, glass transition temperature, and the like). In early stages of the process, the compositions are considered at least partially cured. A composition is considered fully cured once all cross-linkable moieties able to react/interact with one another are actually engaged in such interactions, which understandingly does not necessarily apply to all theoretically available moieties, some being in practice possibly hindered or superfluous. Generally, a fully cured composition displays stable physico-chemical and/or mechanical properties over time (unless failure due to aging or fatigue of the cured composition). As used herein, unless otherwise stated or clear from context, the cured compositions refer to at least partially cured compositions and to fully cured compositions.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0131">In accordance with one aspect of the invention, there is herein disclosed a curable composition comprising:</p><p id="p-0134" num="0132">a) at least one reactive curable silicone pre-polymer capable of forming a silicone elastomer upon curing thereof; and</p><p id="p-0135" num="0133">b) a plurality of hydrophilic carbon black particles, non-covalently dispersed within said reactive curable silicone pre-polymer;</p><p id="p-0136" num="0134">wherein a concentration of the hydrophilic carbon black particles within the composition is at least 0.01%, by weight;</p><p id="p-0137" num="0135">the carbon black particles optionally having at least one of the following structural properties:</p><p id="p-0138" num="0136">I) a volatile matter content of at least 1.5%, by weight of the carbon black particles, and optionally of at most 50.0 wt. %;</p><p id="p-0139" num="0137">II) as measured in a 4 wt. % dispersion of the hydrophilic carbon black particles in aqueous methanol, a pH of at most 5.0, and optionally of at least 1.5;</p><p id="p-0140" num="0138">III) an oxygen content of at least 1.0% by weight of the carbon black particles, and optionally of at most 40.0 wt. %;</p><p id="p-0141" num="0139">IV) an acid value of the carbon black particles, in mmol/g, of at least 0.05, and optionally of at most 0.50;</p><p id="p-0142" num="0140">V) a surface zeta potential (at a pH of 12, and a concentration of 2 wt. % or less in distilled water) of at most &#x2212;15 mV, and optionally of at least &#x2212;70 mV;</p><p id="p-0143" num="0141">VI) containing at least one type of functional group selected from the group consisting of epoxy, hydroxy and carboxylic moieties, as detected by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy;</p><p id="p-0144" num="0142">VII) an I<sub>D</sub>/I<sub>G </sub>ratio of at least 0.8, wherein I<sub>D </sub>and I<sub>G </sub>represent the peak intensity maxima of D-band and G-band, respectively, of undeconvoluted spectra as determined by Raman spectroscopy; and</p><p id="p-0145" num="0143">VII) an AUC<sub>D</sub>/AUC<sub>G </sub>ratio of at least 1.2 wherein AUC<sub>D </sub>and AUC<sub>G </sub>represent the area under the curve of D-band and G-band, respectively, of deconvoluted spectra as determined by Raman spectroscopy.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0144">In some embodiments, at least one of the silicone pre-polymers of the curable composition contains functional groups that can react with the CB particles or molecular groups thereon.

In a particular embodiment, the functional groups of the silicone pre-polymer include carbon-black-affinic moieties (e.g., amino groups), at least one silicone pre-polymer having the affinic moieties as side chains or part of its backbone.

Under such conditions, which are conventionally measured with a goniometer or a drop shape analyser, the water droplet tends to bead and does not wet the surface.

It is believed that the dispersant can facilitate the dispersion of the carbon black particles within the curable silicone pre-polymers.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0159">A compatible dispersant (e.g., miscible in the silicone matrix) may have a branched chemical structure and at least one carbon-black-affinic moiety having affinity to a hydrophilic surface of the hydrophilic carbon black particles. The CB-affinic moiety is selected from an amino moiety, an acrylate moiety and an epoxy moiety. The hydrophilic surface of CB generally results from oxygen-based functional groups, such as epoxy, hydroxy or carboxylic groups. A branched silicone dispersant consists of a backbone and at least one branching unit, wherein at least one of said backbone and said one or more branching units is siloxane-based, or contains at least one siloxane unit. If the branching units are only positioned at terminal ends of the backbone of the dispersant, the molecule might be considered linear. However, the term &#x201c;branched molecule&#x201d; is used herein to also encompass such type of substitution. Similarly, the at least one CB-affinic moiety can be disposed within the backbone or within the branching unit(s). While generally, the siloxane-based chain and the CB-affinic moieties are each disposed on separate &#x201c;mono-type&#x201d; components of the branched molecule (e.g., the dispersant having a siloxane-based backbone and CB-affinic moieties on branching units, or vice versa: CB-affinic moieties disposed within the backbone and siloxane-containing branching units) this &#x201c;segregation&#x201d; is not necessary. Suitable silicone dispersants may for example have disposed within their backbone both siloxane units and CB-affinic moieties, forming a &#x201c;poly-type&#x201d; backbone, the branching units stemming from any of the foregoing mono-type or poly-type backbone being also possibly a combination of siloxane-containing branching units and CB affinic branching units.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0160">In some embodiments, the dispersant, when disposed in a synthetic isoparaffinic hydrocarbon solvent, (e.g., Isopar&#x2122; L), is a micelle-forming dispersant.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0161">Typically, micelles formed by the micelle-forming dispersant in the synthetic isoparaffinic hydrocarbon solvent such as are inverse micelles. It is to be noted that the suitability of an amino-silicone dispersant to disperse CB particles in a silicone matrix is unexpected, in particular when the CB material is relatively hydrophilic. As a rule, dispersions of carbon black sub-micron or nanoparticles in silicones are difficult to achieve even when the particles and the silicone media have similar hydrophobicity. Such particles tend to agglomerate with one another, rather than remain homogeneously dispersed in their primary particle size or any relatively small secondary particle size that would have been achieved by a dispersing step.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0162">Despite this, in the present invention, the dispersion of the CB particles was achieved by addition-curing of the silicones using amino-silicones as dispersants. The obtained polymeric environment, which is relatively hydrophobic/non-polar, was expected to be &#x201c;adverse&#x201d; to dispersions of nano or sub-micron CB particles as they are more difficult to disperse than their larger counterparts. It should be additionally noted that the use of amino-silicone dispersants is deemed counterintuitive because their amine moieties, when unbound and thus free to interact, are known to prevent or otherwise deleteriously affect addition-curing of the silicone matrix. Hence, the inventors have found a delicate balance concerning the amount of amino-silicone dispersant present during the preparation of a CB-loaded silicone matrix. On the one hand, the amount should be enough to at least partially envelop the CB particles and prevent, reduce or delay their agglomeration/aggregation; on the other hand, an excess amount should be avoided to prevent, reduce or delay any deleterious effect on addition-curing that such superfluous unbound amino-silicones may have. A suitable concentration of amino-silicone dispersant in the composition may depend, among other factors, on the type of CB particles and silicone media, as well as on the relative concentration of the carbon black in the ACS and the size of the particles Smaller particles have a relatively higher specific surface area than larger particles and may therefore require a relatively greater amount of amino-silicone dispersant to achieve desired dispersion. This concentration may be determined by routine experimentation.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0163">Without wishing to be bound to any particular theory, the attachment of the dispersant to the carbon black particles is believed to be non-covalent. In any event, even if the dispersant were to covalently bind to the carbon black particles to some extent, the dispersant-laden particles of carbon black dispersed in a matrix as herein disclosed are not covalently bound to the silicone polymers or pre-polymers. In other words, dispersant-laden carbon black particles prepared and/or dispersed according to the present teachings may be non-covalently physically entrapped within the network of the cured silicone matrix. A person skilled in the preparation of elastomers may readily appreciate that the lack of covalent binding between particles and the surrounding polymer matrix may appreciably reduce the mechanical resistance of such elastomers as compared to a polymeric network comprising the same amount of particles covalently bound to polymers which may directly or indirectly (e.g., via coupling agents) covalently attach the particles.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0164">The skilled artisan will further appreciate that as the amount of carbon black is increased, the relative mechanical weakness, in absence of covalent bonds between CB particles and the silicone pre-polymers or polymers, worsens. The inventors unexpectedly found that despite the mechanical weakness induced by the presence of the non-covalently bound carbon black particles, the mechanical integrity of a cured elastomeric composition according to the present teachings may be sufficiently high, even at high concentrations of carbon black particles. Concentrations of up to 45 wt. %, up to 40 wt. %, up to 35 wt. %, or up to 30 wt. % may exhibit a mechanical integrity that is sufficient for various applications.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0165">Amino-silicones having a relatively low number of amine moieties (correlating with a low amine number) may be advantageous in achieving this balance between an amount of dispersant sufficient for the desired particle dispersion but low enough to avoid impairing curing of the matrix. Mono-amine silicones may be preferred, in particular, when the amine moiety is terminally positioned. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that once attached to carbon black (e.g., via molecular groups thereon, such as polar&#x2014;COOH), a terminal mono-amine is engaged in acid:base interaction, and thus unavailable to negatively affect curing of ACS. In some embodiments, the amino-silicone dispersant includes a mono-amine terminated amino-silicone.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0166">In some embodiments, the amino-silicone dispersant has an amine number within a range of 3 and 75, 3 and 65, 3 and 55, 4 and 75, 4 and 65, 4 and 55, 4.5 and 50, 5 and 75, 5 and 65, 5 and 55, 6 and 75, 6 and 65, 6 and 55, 6.5 and 50 or 8 and 40.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0167">In some embodiments, the amine number of the amino-silicone dispersant is at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at least 7, at least 8, at least 10, at least 12, at least 15, at least 20, or at least 25.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0168">In some embodiments, the amine number of the amino-silicone dispersant is at most 150, at most 140, at most 130, at most 120, at most 110, at most 100, at most 90, at most 80, at most 70, at most 60, at most 50, at most 45, at most 40, at most 37, at most 35, at most 32, at most 30, at most 25, or at most 20.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0169">While the amine number of amino-silicones is generally provided by the manufacturer of such materials, it can also be determined by routine analysis using standard methods.

Hydrophilic CB, which can be prepared by treatment (e.g., chemical) of the naturally occurring counterpart, is not expected to stably disperse in such hydrophobic environments, as the hydrophilic particles preferring aggregating to one another may form agglomerates which would precipitate, flocculate or otherwise separate from the matrix before it could be sufficiently cured to &#x201c;freeze&#x201d; a hypothetical temporarily stable dispersion.

This technique allows determining the D-band and G-band peaks of the compound under study for predetermined excitation laser wavelengths (e.g., in the range of 488 nm to 647 nm), laser powers (e.g., 40 mW) and integration times (e.g., of 10 s to 120 s). Temperature can be controlled to reduce black noise (e.g., by cooling the detector). The Raman peak intensity maxima (I) or the area under the curve (AUC) can be obtained, with or without deconvolution of the spectrum by an integrated software further allowing baseline correction, if needed. It is then possible to compute the Raman peak intensity ratio of the D-band and G-band, respectively I<sub>D </sub>and I<sub>G</sub>. The maximal intensity of each peak is typically measured on the undeconvoluted spectra. The spectral behavior and resulting band ratio (I<sub>D</sub>/I<sub>G</sub>) can be empirically correlated with the level of oxidation of the elemental carbon materials. A relatively low D-band to G-band ratio indicates that the CB is less oxidized than a CB having a relatively higher D-Band to G-Band ratio, all other structural properties of the CB being similar. By way of example, an I<sub>D</sub>/I<sub>G </sub>ratio of 0.8 or more, 1.0 or more, 1.2 or more, indicates that the CB material is relatively oxidized as desired in some embodiments of the invention. Such Raman spectra can be unaffected in the bands of interest by some elastomer matrices (notably PDMS), so that the method advantageously provides a non-destructive technique to assess CB characteristics within a cured composition. The level of oxidation of carbon black particles can also be assessed by the integrated area intensity derivable from the AUC of the D-band and G-band and the ratio between the two, which can be mathematically presented by AUC<sub>D</sub>/AUC<sub>G</sub>. AUC ratios of at least 1.2, or at least 1.4, or at least 1.6 suggest a more oxidized CB.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0206">Another way of characterizing the carbon black is by its surface zeta potential, which is the measure of the magnitude of the electrostatic or charge repulsion/attraction between particles.

Such dimensions are preferred not only with respect to primary particle size (PPS), but also for secondary particle size (SPS), which may result from agglomeration or cluster formation of such primary particles. Particles, both primary and secondary, wherein a predominant portion of the population (by volume, D<sub>V</sub>90) has a particle size in the submicron range are believed to have improved size stability and dispersibility. Taking for example the case wherein CB particles are dispersed in an elastomeric composition on account of their radiation absorbing properties, and taking as illustration a situation wherein scattering should be avoided for improved behavior of the resulting article, then particles having a predominant particle size of less than half the wavelength of the emitted beam are further preferred, as scattering is accordingly reduced. Hence, in some embodiments, CB particles having a predominant particle size of less than 500 nanometers are favored.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0220">In some embodiments, the predominant particle size (D<sub>V</sub>90) is within the range of 100 nm to 10 &#x3bc;m, 100 nm to 1.3 &#x3bc;m, 120 nm to 1.3 &#x3bc;m, 150 nm to 1.3 &#x3bc;m, 200 nm to 1.3 &#x3bc;m, 250 nm to 1.3 &#x3bc;m, 300 nm to 1.3 &#x3bc;m, 200 nm to 1.0 &#x3bc;m, 250 nm to 1.0 &#x3bc;m, 300 nm to 1.0 &#x3bc;m, 350 nm to 1.0 &#x3bc;m, 400 nm to 1.0 &#x3bc;m, or 500 nm to 1.5 &#x3bc;m.

As explained, primary particles may aggregate to form secondary particles and a measured population may include both types of particles, their relative proportion in the population depending upon the type of the dispersion. Hence, the predominant particle size may reflect at least one of PPS and SPS.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0221">CB particles having a predominant particle size, typically a primary particle size (PPS), of 100 nm or less are deemed in the nano-range, primary particles having an average particle size (APPS) of 80 nm or less, 60 nm or less, 40 nm or less, or 30 nm or less, being particularly preferred for close particle packing. Generally, the CB primary particles have an average PPS (D<sub>V</sub>50) of 5 nm or more, or 10 nm or more, or 15 nm or more, and typically in the range of 8 to 80 nm, 8 to 65 nm, 8 to 55 nm, 10 to 80 nm, 10 to 65 nm, or 10 to 55 nm. The size of the particles, predominantly of the primary particles, may affect their ability to closely pack within the elastomer, relatively small particles being capable of higher packing density than their relatively larger counterparts. Advantageously, a lower amount of relatively small particles may achieve a similar CB density as a higher amount of relatively large particles. Depending on their size, and additionally among other things on the viscosity of the elastomer, the conditions and duration of curing, the thickness of the elastomer layer being cured and such manufacturing factors known to the skilled person, the particles may segregate and form a gradient-like distribution across the layer thickness. Larger CB secondary particles may tend to more rapidly settle and accumulate towards the bottom of the layer, while relatively smaller particles may follow such a trend, if at all, at a slower pace, hence remaining in relatively higher concentration in the upper section of the layer. In this context, &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; and &#x201c;top&#x201d; sections of the layer relate to their orientation during curing, and not necessarily when installed and in operation of the article of relevance (e.g., as a cyclically moving ITM in a printing system). Such a segregation of the particles forming inner strata of particle distribution along the depth of the elastomeric article, (e.g., across the imaging surface of an ITM) may be advantageous if a sufficient thickness of the upper section becomes substantially devoid of CB particles. In the exemplary case of an intermediate transfer member, this &#x201c;top stratum&#x201d; can serve as a release surface, the absence of particles increasing its smoothness and therefore believed to improve the quality of the ink image that may be transferred therefrom.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0222">Manufacturers generally provide the average primary particle size of the CB material, as assessed for instance according to ASTM D 3849. Particle size distribution, whether assessed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) or microscopic techniques, may provide information on the primary particle size (PPS) of the material and on its secondary particle size (SPS), i.e. the size of assembly of primary particles forming for instance agglomerates or clusters. The PPS value typically remains constant during the preparation of the compositions, the steps believed to rarely break down primary particles to sub-primary size. However, the SPS values change according to the particular methods used for the preparation of the curable composition and for the preparation of the cured ones.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0223">As CB can be provided as close-pack or loose-pack clusters, loose-pack types can be preferred to facilitate dispersion.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0224">In DLS techniques, the particles are approximated to spheres of equivalent behavior and the size can be provided in terms of hydrodynamic diameter. DLS facilitates assessing the size distribution of a population.

When the particles are approximately spherical, a size of 1 &#x3bc;m or less, is to be understood as an average diameter equal to or smaller than 1 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0225">Though not essential, the CB particles may preferably be uniformly shaped and/or within a symmetrical distribution relative to a median value of the population and/or within a relatively narrow size distribution.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0226">A particle size distribution (PSD) is said to be relatively narrow if at least one of the two following conditions applies:</p><p id="p-0229" num="0227">A) the difference between the hydrodynamic diameter of 90% of the particles and the hydrodynamic diameter of 10% of the particles is equal to or less than 150 nm, or equal to or less than 100 nm, or equal to or less than 50 nm, which can be mathematically expressed by: (D90&#x2212;D10)&#x2264;150 nm and so on; and/or</p><p id="p-0230" num="0228">B) the ratio between a) the difference between the hydrodynamic diameter of 90% of the particles and the hydrodynamic diameter of 10% of the particles; and b) the hydrodynamic diameter of 50% of the particles, is no more than 2.0, or no more than 1.5, or no more than 1.0, which can be mathematically expressed by: (D90&#x2212;D10)/D50&#x2264;2.0 and so on.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0229">D10, D50 and D90 can be assessed by number of particles in the population, in which case they may be provided as D<sub>N</sub>10, D<sub>N</sub>50 and D<sub>N</sub>90, or by volume of particles, in which case they may be provided as D<sub>V</sub>10, D<sub>V</sub>50 and D<sub>V</sub>90. The foregoing measurements can be obtained by DLS techniques when the samples to be studied are suitably fluid or by microscopy when the particles under study are in dry form or embedded in a cured composition.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0230">As used herein, D50, which can also be termed the &#x201c;average measured particle size&#x201d; or simply the &#x201c;average particle size&#x201d; may refer, depending on the measuring method most suited to the particles being considered and their media, either to D<sub>V</sub>50 (by DLS and the like) or to the volume average size of 50% of the particles found in a field of view of a microscope adapted to analyze in the scale of the particles. Similarly, D90, which can also be termed the &#x201c;predominant particle size&#x201d;, may refer either to D<sub>V</sub>90 or to the volume average size of 90% of the particles found in a microscope field of view.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0231">The CB particles may have any suitable aspect ratio, i.e., a dimensionless ratio between the smallest dimension of the particle and the longest dimension in the largest plane orthogonal to the smallest dimension. In some embodiments, the carbon black primary particles are approximately spherical and can have an aspect ratio in the range of 0.2:1 to 1:5, or 0.5:1 to 1:2. Secondary particles of CB which may agglomerate therefrom are not necessarily spherical, still their aspect ratio can be in the range of 0.1:1 to 1:10, 0.2:1 to 1:5, or 0.5:1 to 1:2.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0232">Though not essential, the carbon black primary particles may preferably be uniformly shaped and/or within a symmetrical distribution relative to a median value of the population. In some embodiments, the carbon black secondary particles are within a relatively narrow particle size distribution, such narrow PSD being advantageously maintained in the cured silicone elastomer.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0233">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the CB particles and silicone-based materials (e.g., the curable pre-polymers, the amino-silicone, silicone-acrylate or epoxy-silicone dispersants) are compatible. As appreciated by a person skilled in the art of elastomer formulation, a &#x201c;compatible&#x201d; set of materials for any particular composition or formulation means that the presence of any such compatible compound does not negatively affect the efficacy of any other compound for any step of preparation or in the final composition. Compatibility can be chemical, physical or both. For instance, a dispersant suitable to disperse carbon black into a curable silicone fluid would be compatible both with the carbon black material and with the silicone polymers to be cured (as well as with any other agent required to perfect such curing; all collectively generally termed the &#x201c;silicone media&#x201d;). For instance, the dispersant would not be compatible if, among other things, preventing, reducing or retarding the curing of the silicone pre-polymers, not being miscible with the pre-polymers or being deleterious to the carbon black, and any like undesired effects. In some embodiments, compatibility may additionally mean that the materials deemed compatible share a common property, such as a common silicon-based chemistry or a similar physical parameter. For instance, materials having a similar refractive index (RI; within &#xb1;10% from one another) are believed to yield clearer cured films, as compared to materials having relatively dissimilar RI that may appear more turbid.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0234">In some embodiments, the cured composition can be characterized by any one of the following parameters. One such parameter is the presence and/or quantity of products resulting from the carbon-black-affinic moieties of the dispersant or of some particular CCS polymers. For example, amine and/or amide in the final product may suggest the use of an amino-silicone dispersant in the manufacturing process. Amides can form in the curing process, hinting to their origin from amino-silicones. Acrylate-moieties and epoxy-moieties can be similarly detected to suggest the use of corresponding dispersants. This can be done by conventional means such as FTIR. While peaks indicative of particular chemical groups do not necessarily mean that a corresponding dispersant was used, such results can be highly suggestive, in particular in combination with other characteristics of a cured product prepared according to the present teachings.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0235">Additionally, traces of a platinum catalyst, added to enhance the addition-curing, or tin catalyst added to enhance the condensation-curing, can indicate which curing mechanism was used to obtain the final product. Such platinum or tin traces can be detected by trace analysis of platinum or tin by known analytical methods, e.g., by Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectroscopy (ICP), Gas Chromatography&#x2014;Mass Spectrometry (GCMS), Elemental Analysis and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). In the case of addition-curing, such traces of the platinum catalyst can also originate from the additional amount of the catalyst added to counteract with the excess amines that may result from the use of an amino-silicone dispersant.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Preparation of Elastomeric Compositions Comprising Carbon Black in Silicone Media</heading><p id="p-0238" num="0236">While in the description provided below, several processing methods are disclosed to disperse CB particles into the silicone media, these are not meant to be limiting.

Such solvents, when compatible with the intended silicone fluid, may facilitate some stages of the layer preparation or application to recipient layers or supports, as well as prevent destabilization or flocculation. A relatively high volatility being advantageous in reducing or eliminating the presence of these solvents in a final article.

Suitably, the volatile organic solvent is xylene, a synthetic isoparaffinic hydrocarbon solvent commercially known as Isopar&#x2122; L, M or G, an organosilicone solvent such as hexamethyldisiloxane and hydrocarbon solvents such as hexane. In some embodiments, the volatile organic solvent is xylene. Typically, the CB dispersed silicone is diluted with the volatile organic solvent at a weight per weight ratio of at least 1:4, or 1:9.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0252">In some embodiments, curing (e.g., addition-curing) is carried out using a catalyst, a retardant and a cross-linker such as the ones previously described.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0253">While partial curing of the silicone matrix may proceed at 120&#xb0; C.

The reaction is completed once a steady state is reached, and no more swelling is observed. Other ways of confirming reaction completion are by analyzing the mechanical properties of the cured elastomer such as by measuring the Tg (e.g., by DSC) as well as tensile strength and surface hardness throughout the progression of the curing.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0255">The methods for preparing the compositions according to the present teachings are schematically depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, which shows a simplified diagram of the different steps that may be employed for preparing a curable composition and for preparing a cured composition according to various embodiments of the invention. As detailed below, some steps can be combined, skipped, and/or be effected in an order different than in the illustration.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0256">In a first step S<b>101</b>, a stock of hydrophilic CB particles having PPS and SPS as provided by the supplier (i.e., stock baseline values PPS<sub>1 </sub>and SPS<sub>1</sub>) is dispersed, so as to reduce the size of the secondary particles that may be present in the stock from SPS<sub>1 </sub>to first dispersion value of SPS<sub>2</sub>, wherein SPS<sub>2</sub>&#x3c;SPS<sub>1</sub>. Preferably, following such dispersion, SPS<sub>2 </sub>can be in the sub-micron range, but this need not necessarily be the case, as additional steps of the method or operative conditions of any single step may further reduce the size of the secondary particles to SPS<sub>3</sub>, SPS<sub>4</sub>, and so on. The preliminary dispersion of the stock CB lumps into smaller clusters of particles can be performed in dry form (e.g., on particles as supplied), or in wet form (e.g., on particles found in a liquid medium). If dry CB is desired, it may be dried in an oven until the water content is reduced below 5%. The changes in water content can monitored by TGA measurements during the drying procedure.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0257">In some embodiments, such a first step S<b>101</b> is performed in presence of a dispersant (in which case the size of the secondary particles of CB upon completion of the step shall be defined as SPS<sub>3</sub>). It is believed that all other parameters (e.g., dispersing conditions and duration) being similar, SPS<sub>3</sub>&#x2264;SPS<sub>2</sub>&#x3c;SPS<sub>1</sub>. When dispersants are in liquid form, the CB particles are typically gradually added thereto, the mixing conditions being optionally modified and adapted according to the relative amounts of CB and dispersant. The mixing of the two can be done by any suitable method, known to the skilled persons, under conditions preserving the functionality of the constituents. For instance, if the silicone dispersant or the carbon black are compatible with one another by means of chemical moieties attached thereto (e.g., carbon-black-affinic moieties and oxygen-based moieties), then the mixing conditions should not significantly affect such moieties. By way of example, if a dispersant is adapted to disperse a CB stock by way of amine moieties that may be heat sensitive, then the mixing should preferably be performed at a temperature maintaining the functionality of such groups (e.g., at less than 70&#xb0; C., preferably at no more than 50&#xb0; C.). As a rule, such processes are performed at least at room temperature (circa 23&#xb0; C.), in particular when considering addition-curing, a process that may be hampered by water condensation in the vessels being used.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0258">Upon completion of S<b>101</b>, the CB particles having reached any desirable SPS<sub>2 </sub>or SPS<sub>3 </sub>dimension, the silicone pre-polymer.

The materials are mixed to homogeneity by any suitable method. The size of the secondary particles of CB upon completion of this step shall be defined as SPS<sub>4</sub>, which can be smaller than SPS<sub>2 </sub>or SPS<sub>3</sub>. The agents that may control the curing timeline can then be added in a subsequent step S<b>103</b>. In some embodiments, the curing agent(s) of step S<b>103</b> further comprises additional constituents of the curable composition, for instance a dispersant, or a silicone pre-polymer. In one embodiment, the silicone media is a two-component silicone, the mixing of which providing a curable composition. In such a case, the CB particles can be mixed in a first part of the two-component silicone, the curing agent(s) of step S<b>103</b> being supplied by a second part of the two-component elastomeric matrix.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0259">If necessary, the products of step S<b>102</b> or step S<b>103</b> can be diluted ahead of curing to facilitate their casting. If a dilution step S<b>104</b> is employed for the preparation of a curable composition, the curing agents of step S<b>103</b> can alternatively be added after the dilution of the product of step S<b>102</b>. The dilution can be done with any suitable volatile solvent by any appropriate method. In any event, following the addition of curing agents and mixing therewith of the product comprising the CB particles, the resulting mixture constitutes a curable composition.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0260">The curable composition prepared according to any of the embodiments as herein described can then be extruded, deposited onto a casting surface or into a casting mold during a casting step S<b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0261">While extrusion of a curable composition can be performed under conditions that may concomitantly cure the composition, the curing step S<b>106</b> is typically considered distinct.

herein disclosed provided comparable absorbing properties per micrometer thickness of layer, such normalized absorbance generally decreasing as the wavelengths increased. In the above, the methods of preparation and resulting layers were exemplified with three types of silicone polymers, two types of curing method and two types of amino-silicone dispersants, as specified below:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0323">Items 1-3 for addition curing of ACS PDMS (prepared according to Example 1)</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0324">Items 4-9 for addition curing of ACS LSR (prepared according to Example 3)</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0325">Items 10-11 for condensation curing of CCS PDMS (prepared according to Example 5) These examples also represent different types of interactions between the silicone dispersants and the CB particles Amino-silicone dispersants are expected to form acid-base relationship or amine-epoxy interactions.

Based on the present set of results peak or plateau of absorbance for each particular formulation are expected at carbon loading of at least 10 wt. %, at least 15 wt. % or possibly at carbon loading of more than 20 wt. %. Such CB concentration dependent patterns can readily be established by the skilled person, whom can elect desired CB loading as per peak of optimal activity and/or intended use. For all practical purposes, it is believed that carbon black presence in curable or cured silicone compositions needs not to exceed 30 wt. %, being often of no more than 25 wt. %.</p><p id="p-0324" num="0328">In a control experiment, see item 13, a comparative layer was prepared in which the same carbon black material was milled and incorporated in a PDMS matrix similarly to items 1-3, the method however lacking any amino-silicone dispersant. In the resulting layer, the CB particles were therefore of a more conventional size, in the range of 0.5-1.5 &#x3bc;m. This conventional CB (CCB) material was embedded in the PDMS matrix at a relatively high concentration of 10 wt. %. Despite such high load, the CCB control provided a poorer absorption relatively to lower concentrations of CB particles prepared according to some embodiments of the invention. In this experiment, the 10 wt. % CCB in PDMS (item 13) was found comparable to the 2.5 wt. % CB in PDMS (item 1). Therefore, the present methods and formulations are approximately 4-fold superior, with respect to the amount of CB particles providing similar absorbance, due to the effect of the dispersant.</p><heading id="h-0032" level="1">Example 9: Analysis of CB Oxidation Level by Ranam Spectroscopy</heading><p id="p-0325" num="0329">A comparative analysis of CB particles having different levels of oxidation was performed using Raman spectroscopy (LabRAM HR Evolution, Horiba-Jobin Yvon Technology).
