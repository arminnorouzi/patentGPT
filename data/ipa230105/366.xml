More specifically, the present invention relates to systems and methods of using sensed peripheral arterial pulse waveform measurements to assess hemodynamic parameters, such as blood pressure, hypertensive/hypotensive state, cardiac output, vasodilation/vasocontraction state, and, also to quantify the mechanical anelastic properties of the blood vessels in vivo.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional methods of establishing the hypertensive state of a subject involves blood pressure measurements, and depending on the state of the subject's hypertension, medication may be prescribed to lower the subject's blood pressure. The effectiveness of such medication is monitored by blood pressure measurements. Provided the medication lowers the subject's blood pressure to acceptable levels, then it is presumed that the medication is considered effective in controlling the subject's hypertension. The impacts that the prescribed medication have on the subject in general, and in particular the subject's blood vessels are unknown.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In subjects experiencing angina pectoris, glyceryl trinitrate may be prescribed as a vasodilator to inhibit the onset of angina pectoris during exercise. The effectiveness of the medication on specific subjects is basically trial and error. During vasodilation, the blood vessels change their properties significantly, and without diagnostic measurements of these changes, the impact of the medication, and its potential impact on the subject's blood vessels is not known. Angina can also be due to narrowed or blocked arteries around the heart, ischemia, emotional stress, exposure to very hot or cold temperatures, heavy meals and smoking.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The changes to the arterial vascular vessels mechanical properties due to hypertension, aging, diabetes, mellitus, arteriosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia and ischemic heart disease are difficult to quantify using current measurement techniques such as simple pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurements, electrocardiogram (EKG) and blood pressure measurements. The anelastic in vivo properties of the peripheral arterial blood vessels and their hypertrophy can provide valuable insight into these processes on a subject's wellbeing, and the impact of medication to treat such disorders and their associated changes to the subject's arterial vascular vessel properties. The acute effect of vasoconstriction and vasodilation with resulting increase and decrease in blood pressure, have significant impact on the anelastic response of the body's peripheral arterial vascular vessels. In vivo quantification of these anelastic changes are essential in diagnosing the issues relating to aging and disease, and also as important, the impact of medication on changes to the peripheral arterial blood vessels' anelastic properties and their hypertrophy.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Arteries stiffen progressively with age and disease, even in the earliest stages of arteriosclerosis, prior to any clinical manifestation and anatomical evidence of the disease. In vivo quantification of minor changes in the peripheral artery blood vessels properties would provide an extremely useful clinical tool for the assessment of cardiovascular risk, from arterial vessel stiffening, plaque buildup, arteriosclerosis and/or elevated risk of aneurysm or dissection. PWV and augmentation index are associated with cardiovascular burden, but do not have the sensitivity necessary to detect minor changes in the hemodynamic parameters, such as cardiac output and the mechanical properties of the peripheral arterial blood vessels nor their hypertrophy. Alternative methods for such an assessment are urgently needed.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, it is an object of the invention to provide non-invasive systems and methods for the measurement of the hemodynamic parameters and mechanical anelastic properties of the arterial blood vessels in a subject.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is an in vivo non-invasive method and apparatus for the measurement of the hemodynamic parameters, such as blood pressure, cardiac output, hypertensive/hypotensive and vasodilation/vasocontraction state and aging status of a subject, and the mechanical anelastic in vivo properties of the arterial blood vessels. The method requires measuring the peripheral pulse volume waveform (PVW), using an infra-red emitter and sensor positioned over an artery, a force sensor positioned over the same artery measuring the peripheral pulse pressure waveform (PPW), and a velocity sensor positioned over the same artery measuring the peripheral pulse velocity waveform (PUW), with all sensors contained in a wristband, that applies a slight force and being of adequate compliance, for the force sensor to measure the arterial pulse pressure waveform (PPW) as a tonometer, and a pressure actuator contained over the force sensor to occlude the artery. The time phase shift between the PPW and PVW, and the plot of pulse pressure versus pulse volume, quantifies the anelastic properties of the peripheral arterial blood vessels in vivo, and the subject's hypertensive state including hypertrophy. Occlusion and release of the artery by the actuator allows the patient's systolic and diastolic blood pressures to be measured, and the full mechanical anelastic properties of the peripheral arterial blood vessels in vivo can be determined; such as the pulse shear strain at systolic, the secant shear modulus, the anelastic power law constants, and the hypertensive state of the patient, including hypertrophy.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">From the quantified subject's systolic and diastolic blood pressures, the full mechanical anelastic properties of the peripheral arterial blood vessels in vivo can be determined, such as the pulse shear strain at systolic, the shear modulus, and the anelastic power law constants, during both the systolic and diastolic phases experienced by the arterial blood vessels over a cardiac cycle. From the time location of the second forward pulse wave in the PVW, the form of the hypertension of the subject can be quantified.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The change in the peripheral arterial blood vessels anelastic and hemodynamic parameters, including blood pressure, stroke volume, cardiac output during vasodilation or vasocontraction, either from induced hypotension/hypertension, physical exercise, breathing exercises or induced by medication or illness, are quantified from the measured waveforms PPW, PVW and PUW. These changes in the arterial blood vessel hemodynamic and anelastic properties, quantify the extent of vasodilation, vasocontraction, loss of stroke volume, induced hypertension/hypotension and possible onset of cardiogenic shock. The determination of the anelastic blood vessel properties provides a direct measure of whether such vasodilation is sufficient in improving the tone of the subject's peripheral artery blood vessels, and thus reverse or slow the rate of change of the subject's hypertensive state. Historical recording of a subject's vasodilation/vasocontraction on arterial blood vessel anelastic properties, is able to determine with considerably greater accuracy than current procedures, the impact of any prescribed medication, diet or exercise program on the subject's hypertensive state.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon reviewing the following description of the preferred embodiments of the invention, when taken in conjunction with the drawings and the claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is an exemplary plot that can be obtained using processing device <b>3</b>.

measurement of hemodynamic parameters and mechanical anelastic in vivo properties of the arterial blood vessels in a subject. The current standard method of measuring a patient's blood pressure is by a cuff over the upper arm, and the entire arm is occluded, which can be distressing to many patients especially if their blood pressures are elevated. The apparatus and methods disclosed herein are a significant improvement over current practice, since it determines the patient's blood pressure and other hemodynamic properties by a simple occlusion and release of an artery over no more than a five (5) second period. From the measured systolic and diastolic blood pressures, the non-linear anelastic material properties of peripheral arterial blood vessels can be determined from pulse pressure and pulse volume waveform measurements, and from these waveforms, the hypertensive state, hypertrophy and mechanical anelastic in vivo properties of the peripheral arterial blood vessels can be quantified. Additional details of the apparatus and methods are described below.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Representatively illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a system <b>1</b> and associated method which embody exemplary components of the disclosed apparatus. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows the arm of the subject <b>2</b> with a processing device <b>3</b> held in place by a strap <b>4</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, device <b>3</b> contains a sensor suite <b>5</b> which can include any variation of the following sensors: a reflective pulse optical plethysmograph sensor, force sensors, velocity sensors and pressure actuators. The sensors and the pressure actuators can be connected to the device <b>3</b>, or can be contained within the device <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The device <b>3</b> can be designed to be positioned over an arterial vessel in a subject. In one embodiment, the arterial vessel can be the radial artery, brachial artery, axillary artery, carotid artery, femoral artery, or tibial artery. In a preferred embodiment, the device is designed as a wristband to be positioned over the radial artery.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Plethysmography is a method that is used to estimate the skin blood flow using infrared light. Traditionally, it is used to measure oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and cardiac output. Optical plethysmographs uses an infrared light sent into the tissue and the amount of the backscattered light corresponds with the variation of the blood volume. In one embodiment, the pulse optical plethysmograph sensor within the disclosed device is an infrared optical plethysmograph sensor, a visible light plethysmograph sensor, or a pulse oximetry sensor.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The force sensor could be of either a resistive, strain gage, piezoelectric, capacitance or mems type. The velocity sensor could be either a Hall sensor with an applied magnetic field either from a permanent magnet or an electrical activated electromagnet or an ultrasound Doppler sensor to measure the arterial pulse velocity waveform (PUW).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The disclosed processing device <b>3</b> can also contain a motion sensor in the sensor suite <b>5</b>. In such an embodiment, the motion sensor acts to ensure accurate results by only collecting and processing the waveforms PPW, PVW and PUW when the motion sensor is within certain threshold limits. The motion sensor can be either of the piezoelectric, accelerometer or mems type.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The disclosed processing device <b>3</b> can also contain a pressure actuator. The pressure actuator can be electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic, mechanical or manually actuated, and be of the piezoelectric, electromechanical, air bag, stepper motor, geared or spring type. In one embodiment, the applied pressure from the actuator is from about 10 mmHg to about 50 mmHg. The applied pressure from the actuator can be about 10 mmHg, 15 mmHg, 20 mmHg, 25 mmHg, 30 mmHg, 35 mmHg, 40 mmHg, 45 mmHg, or 50 mmHg. In one embodiment, the pressure actuator occludes the artery for 4 seconds or less. The pressure actuator can occlude the artery for about 4 seconds, 3.75 seconds, 3.5 seconds, 3.25 seconds, 3 seconds, 2.5 seconds, or 2 seconds</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Methods of using the disclosed processing device are disclosed herein. The current disclosure further improves upon previously disclosed methods by obtaining non-invasive measurements of peripheral pulse volume waveform (PVW) and peripheral pulse pressure waveform (PPW) and using the measurements to determine hemodynamic parameters and mechanistic anelastic properties of arterial blood vessels in a subject. The hemodynamic parameters and mechanistic anelastic properties can then be used to diagnose disease, determine the efficacy of drug treatments, monitor patients having pneumonia, cardiac disorders, sepsis, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, hypopnea, anesthesia, pain, or narcotic use, or other means in which close, real time monitoring of cardiac function are necessary.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one embodiment, the peripheral pulse volume waveform (PVW) measurement is obtained using an infra-red emitter and sensor positioned over an artery. The peripheral pulse pressure waveform (PPW) is obtained by a force sensor positioned over the same artery. The peripheral pulse velocity waveform (PUW) is obtained by a velocity sensor positioned over the same artery. All of the aforementioned sensors are contained in the disclosed wristband device that applies an appropriate amount of force such that the device act as a pressure actuator to occlude the artery. A force sensor is also included in the device to act as a tonometer and measure the arterial pulse pressure waveform (PPW).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The waveforms PPW, PVW and PUW can be transformed by either a Fast Fourier Transform FFT or the power spectral density method to determine the respiratory and heart rates and associated higher frequencies. The time phase shift between the PPW and PVW, and the plot of pulse pressure versus pulse volume, quantifies the anelastic properties of the peripheral arterial blood vessels in vivo. By occluding and releasing a patient's artery with the actuator, the patient's systolic and diastolic blood pressure are measured, and the full mechanical anelastic properties of the peripheral arterial blood vessels in vivo can be determined, such as the pulse shear strain at systolic, the secant shear modulus, the anelastic power law constants, the hypertensive/hypotensive and vasodilation/vasocontraction state of the patient, including hypertrophy. When placed over a subject's carotid artery, the device can be used to quantify the stroke volume, cardiac output, aortic valve conformance and compliance, and the aorta PWV and Quality factor.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">From known values of the subject's systolic and diastolic blood pressure, the full mechanical anelastic properties of the peripheral arterial blood vessels in vivo can be determined, such as the pulse shear strain at systolic, the shear modulus, and the anelastic power law constants, during both the pressurizing and depressurizing phases experienced by the arterial blood vessels. From the time location of the second forward pulse wave in the PVW, the form of the hypertension of the subject can be determined.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The change in the peripheral arterial blood pressures and blood vessels anelastic properties during vasodilation or vasocontraction, either from induced hypotension/hypertension, physical exercise, breathing exercises or induced by medication, are quantified from the measured waveforms. These changes in the arterial blood vessel anelastic properties, quantify the extent of vasodilation, vasocontraction or induced hypertension, and provide a direct measure of whether such vasodilation is sufficient in improving the tone of the subject's peripheral artery blood vessels, and thus reverse or slow the rate of change of the subject's hypertensive state. Historical recoding of a subject's vasodilation/vasocontraction on arterial blood vessel anelastic properties enable to determine with considerably greater accuracy than current procedures, the impact of any prescribed medication, diet or exercise program on the subject's hemodynamic parameters, such as hypertensive state, cardiac output and in vivo anelastic arterial vessel properties</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts the two measured waveforms, the PPW <b>6</b>, the PVW <b>7</b> and its first time derivative dPVW <b>8</b>, with the prime reflected forward wave shown as <b>9</b> on the waveform dPVW.

The applied pressure of the housing over the artery is greater than 10 mmHg and less than 50 mmHg.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts the peripheral arterial pulse optical plethysmograph waveform (PVW) <b>7</b> for the averaged normalized one heart cycle time history for forty (40) normotensive subjects, recorded from an optical plethysmograph sensor positioned over a finger. Also shown is the time history of the constructed first time derivative of the PVW being the dPVW, denoted as <b>8</b>, with the prime reflected forward wave shown as <b>9</b> on the waveform dPVW, and the averaged normalized time history of the peripheral arterial pulse pressure waveform (PPW) recorded over the radial artery by applanation tonometry by a piezo-resistive cantilever transducer. The PPW was time shifted to be in-phase with the PVW, as denoted by <b>6</b>. The measured waveforms, Millasseau et al., 2000, were normalized prior to being averaged for the forty (40) healthy normotensive subjects, aged from 24 to 80 years. All forty of the subjects had no previous history of hypertension or cardiovascular disease, and all were normotensive (office blood pressure&#x3c;140/90 mm Hg), prior to the time of the study. Blood pressure measurements during the study were (mean, &#xb1;standard deviation) 118, &#xb1;11/67, &#xb1;9 mm Hg. The zero ordinate of the constructed waveform dPVW is shown as <b>10</b>. The first pulse wave peak is denoted as <b>11</b>. The rise and fall time intervals of the first pulse wave are given by the difference in the time abscissa of points denoted as <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> and <b>14</b>.

The rise and fall times of the first and subsequent pulse waves are important and highly dependent on the peripheral arterial blood vessel mechanical anelastic properties. The pulse is a soliton and as such maintains its shape virtually unattenuated provided the energy lost by anelasticity is equivalent to the loss due to dispersion. When these losses are equal, the pulse wave travels as a soliton with no change in shape until it interacts with another forward or backward traveling pulse wave, and upon separation of the two interacting soliton waves, the waves have the same shape to that before the interaction, and there is only a time shift to distinguished that the two waves have undergone an interaction. The solution of the interaction of two solitons is not linear, and so requires a non-linear approach to differentiation between the various pulse waveform. If the energy lost by anelasticity of the peripheral blood vessels deviates from a Quality factor (defined later in equation (2)) of Q=3, then the shape (fall and rise times) of the first pulse wave will change, and it is this change that can be directly correlated to the peripheral arterial blood vessel anelastic properties. The second forward pulse wave is shown as <b>15</b> on the pulse volume waveform PVW, <b>7</b>, and is also shown as <b>16</b> on the measured pulse pressure waveform, <b>6</b>. The second forward pulse wave, which causes closure of the aortic valve, is shown as <b>17</b> on the waveform dPVW, and its peak arrival time position in the heat beat cycle is 0.37 seconds.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts the peripheral pulse optical plethysmograph waveform (PVW) <b>7</b> for the averaged normalized one heart cycle time history for twenty (20) hypertensive subjects, recorded from an optical plethysmograph sensor positioned over a finger. Also shown is the time history of the constructed first time derivative of the PVW being the dPVW, denoted as <b>8</b>, with the prime reflected forward wave shown as <b>9</b> on the waveform dPVW. The averaged normalized time history of the peripheral arterial pulse pressure waveform (PPW) denoted as <b>9</b> was recorded over the radial artery by applanation tonometry by a piezo-resistive cantilever transducer, and was time shifted to be in-phase with the PVW, as denoted by <b>6</b>. The measured waveforms, Millasseau et al., 2000, were normalized prior to being averaged for the twenty (20) hypertensive subjects, aged from 24 to 80 years. Hypertension was diagnosed on the basis of &#x2265;3 measurements of office blood pressure &#x3e;140/90 mm Hg, with each measurement separated by at least a week. None of the hypertensive subjects had clinical evidence of cardiovascular disease other than hypertension. Twelve (12) of the subjects were receiving antihypertensive therapy at the time of the study, (diuretics, 7 of 12; &#x3b2;-adrenoreceptor antagonists, 5 of 12; &#x3b1;-adrenoreceptor antagonists, 1 of 12; ACE inhibitors, 3 of 12; angiotensin II receptor antagonists, 2 of 12; and calcium channel blockers, 4 of 12).

Normalizing the fall to rise time ratio to the normotensive subjects, the normalized fall to rise time for the hypertensive subjects is 1.9, and by construction of a Hypertensive Index (HI) from the forty (40) normotensive subjects as a HI=0, and the twenty (20) hypertensive subjects having a HI=100. Determining the fall to rise time ratio from the constructed waveform dPVW for any subject, the Hypertensive Index (HI) of that subject can be determined and its value will be equal to 0 for healthy normotensive subjects, but generally range from 0 to 100 for most subjects, and in cases of extreme hypertension can be &#x3e;100. In some cases, the Hypertensive Index (HI) could be &#x3c;0, for healthy subjects under extreme conditions such as exposure to temperature, altitude, and dehydration. The Hypertensive Index (HI) of a subject can be correlated to age, and as such can determine whether elevated levels of the Hypertensive Index (HI) are related to the effects of aging, or being accelerated due to the impacts of disease, life style or medication on the respective subject.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The second forward pulse wave causes closure of the aortic valve. The second forward pulse wave is shown as <b>15</b> on the pulse volume waveform PVW, <b>7</b>, <b>16</b> on the measured pulse pressure waveform, <b>6</b>, and as <b>17</b> on the waveform dPVW. Its peak arrival time position in the heart beat cycle is 0.45 seconds. The peak time arrival of the second forward pulse wave was 0.37 seconds for the normotensive subjects, whilst the peak time arrival for the hypersensitive subjects was 0.45 seconds. The normalized time arrival of the second forward pulse wave from the normotensive subjects to the hypertensive subjects is attributed solely to being genetically positive to hypertension, and not considered to be age related hypertension.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Alternatively, a piezoelectric sensor placed over the artery can better detect both the time location of the second forward pulse wave, and by integrating the piezoelectric sensor in the vicinity of the second forward pulse wave time location, the pulse volume change can be better determined for aged subjects or subjects suffering from arteriosclerosis, hypertension or severe skin decolorization. The rate of pulse volume change in the vicinity of the second forward pulse wave can be determined over time and raise alerts if this time rate of change of pulse volume starts to accelerate.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts the normalized arterial pulse pressure versus normalized arterial pulse volume denoted as <b>18</b>, for the forty (40) normotensive subjects, constructed from the time shifted waveform PPW and the waveform PVW, denoted earlier as <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> respectively.

The arteries and veins differ significantly in their anelasticity, due to their significant different functions and applied loads. In the arteries, the collagen, elastin and smooth muscle have values of shear modulus in descending order of &#x2dc;107 to 106, and 105 and 104 Nm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>, respectively. The arterial elastic lamellae and smooth muscle cells are wrapped by a network of collagenous fibrils. Most of the collagen fibers are orientated circumferentially, but some are orientated obliquely and others longitudinally. Elastin and collagen fibers contribute to the artery's elasticity. In humans, the number of elastic lamella is related to the anatomic location of the artery. Muscular arteries have only one internal and external elastic lamina, while in the aorta there are some 60-90 elastic lamina. The number of elastic lamina decreases gradually towards the periphery of the arterial system. Arterial wall viscosity plays a major role in regulating the mechanical behavior of muscular arteries to their applied loads. The smooth muscle component of the artery wall is considered an important element of the artery that contributes to its viscosity. All components of the artery wall may contribute to its viscosity, but the smooth muscle is the only component to respond to physiological stimulus. Furthermore, these components are influenced both by physiological and pathological changes in the mucopolysaccharide, in which they are embedded. The model could be made more complex with differing layers in the blood vessel wall, anisotropic properties, and also include time dependent effects. However, with that complexity the unique quantification to define the model parameters from non-invasive in vivo measurements becomes unwieldy, so a simple model that contains the essential behavior of the blood vessels' anelastic compliance is sort. Therefore, the three component model described here is considered a suitable choice. However, the method is not limited to this model's simplicity nor limited to a three component anelastic model, as a fourth component can be added to account for quantifying the effects of arterial vessels' axial tethering in vivo.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts the normalized arterial pulse pressure (P) versus the normalized arterial pulse volume, being change in area over original area (&#x3b4;A/A) for the twenty (20) hypertensive subjects, denoted as <b>27</b>, constructed from the time shifted waveform PPW and the waveform PVW, denoted earlier as <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> respectively.

The anelastic model computed secant shear modulus (G<sub>R</sub>) values of 510 kPa and 410 kPa for the normotensive and hypertensive subjects respectively, and even though the shear modulus was less in the hypertensive group, the significant hypertrophy thus yielded the same circumferential strain at the inner artery wall at their respective systolic pressures for both groups; highlighting that hypertrophy growth is a means of combating loss of tone, i.e. decreasing values of &#x3b2;<sub>S </sub>of the hypertensive subjects compared to the normotensive subjects.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts the averaged normalized one heart cycle time history for a subset of twenty (20) of the forty (40) normotensive subjects following sublingual administration of 500 &#x3bc;g of glyceryl trinitrate (NTG). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows the peripheral pulse optical plethysmograph waveform (PVW), denoted as <b>7</b>, recorded from an optical plethysmograph sensor positioned over a finger, the time history of the constructed first time derivative of the waveform PVW being the dPVW, denoted as <b>8</b>, and the averaged normalized time history of the peripheral arterial pulse pressure waveform (PPW) recorded over the radial artery by applanation tonometry by a piezo-resistive cantilever transducer, denoted as <b>6</b>.

The &#x3b2;<sub>S </sub>value of &#x3e;1 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, leads to a blood vessel stiffening with pulse pressure, clearly resulting in a significant change in the anelastic response of the arterial vessels to pulse pressure, both loading and unloading, due to vasodilation. In this case of vasodilation, the pulse volume response leads the pulse pressure response up to near the peak pulse volume; whereas, in the normotensive and hypertensive subjects, the pulse pressure leads the pulse volume response with time, during the rise (pressurizing) portion of the arterial vessels. It is the significant changes in the arterial blood vessels anelastic behavior under vasodilation, that result in the observed large drops in normalized pulse volume and normalized pulse pressure during diastolic. The reflected waves are not removed by the vasodilation, but the forward waves including the first pulse wave require a significantly larger pulse volume to achieve the same pulse pressure, i.e. when pressurizing up the path <b>41</b>, compared to pressurizing up the path <b>19</b>, as is the case for the normotensive subjects. Thus, any forward waves result in much lower induced pulse pressure for the dilated arteries, and their reflected components are also reduced. In the depressurizing state, a small change in pulse volume results in a significant change in pulse pressure, i.e. following path <b>42</b> compared to <b>20</b>, and thus accounts for the large changes seen in the diastolic phase.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0064">Induced vasocontraction is analogous to a negative pressure applied to the inner wall of the arterial blood vessels, and thus unloads the vessels along the unloading path of the anelastic model. Thus, for a very small contraction pressure, a moderate contraction volume change is achieved, requiring a rise in internal pressure to overcome the vasocontraction. Further increase in pulse pressure follows the loading (pressurizing) path, similar to the hypertensive subjects as denoted by the anelastic model as <b>31</b>, and then on unloading (depressurizing) the path denoted as <b>32</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Significant vasocontraction results in a high Q value, thus giving rise to significant damping of the high frequency shear waves. The contracted arteries unload (depressurize) along the path denoted as <b>32</b>, but the arterial pressure remaining, as mentioned earlier to overcome the vasocontraction effect, will only dissipate by arterial windkessel flow, and can be &#x2dc;20% of the maximum pulse pressure. This impact results in the fall to rise time ratio of the first pulse wave to be &#x3c;1 for the case of vasocontraction, as the early rise in pulse pressure has no induced pulse volume change, and so the initial rise time of the first pulse wave will be longer than the fall time. Therefore, vasocontraction not only increases the diastolic arterial pressure quite significantly for a small applied contraction pressure, but also increases the pulse pressure, and combined, significantly raises the systolic arterial pressure.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> depicts the normalized arterial pulse volume plotted against the normalized arterial pulse pressure <b>46</b>, for the normotensive group, hypertensive group, and the normotensive subset group subjected to NTG for the pressurizing phase only, being denoted as <b>47</b>, <b>48</b> and <b>49</b> respectively.

Note the significant increase in amplitude in the waveform PVW after exercise, comparing <b>55</b> to <b>7</b>, and the reduction in the amplitude of the prime reflective wave, <b>9</b> versus <b>57</b>. Interestingly, the prime reflective wave arrival time, being a two way travel time, are virtually the same, <b>58</b> and <b>59</b>, being 0.23 seconds before exercise and 0.24 seconds after exercise. The pulse wave velocity measured from the subject's brachial artery at the elbow to the radial artery, yielded a pulse wave velocity of 6.9m/sec. The prime reflected wave is assessed to be reflected from the fingertips, back to the upper arm pit, where due to the numerous arteries (axillary, subclavian, etc.) the wave is reflected back down the brachial artery to the radial artery, for a two wave travel path for this subject of 1.6 m for a pulse wave velocity of 6.6 m/sec prior to exercise, and 6.3 m/sec after exercise. The pulse pressure experienced by the prime reflected wave, integrated over its travel path using the waveform PPW is 65% of the arterial maximum pulse pressure, and thus explains why there is little to no difference in the arrival time of the prime reflected wave in the before exercise and after exercise conditions, even though there are significant differences in pulse pressure, and the significant dependence of pulse wave velocity on arterial pulse pressure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0067">From waveforms PPW and PVW of the mildly hypertensive 69 year old male subject of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the systolic power law coefficient was determined as 0.67, being midway between the normotensive and hypertensive subjects given in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.

The conical wake of excited shear waves generated by the Stoneley wave in a slow medium was first observed in the early 1960s. In arterial biomechanics, it appears that the wake of pulse generated high frequency highly dispersive shear waves has been overlooked, even though they are clearly evident in the peripheral arteries, both small and large, in the aorta, and the veins. In optical coherence tomography, the physics is well known and utilized. By focusing the ultrasonic &#x201c;pushing&#x201d; beam at a speed greater than the tissue shear wave speed, a wake of excited intense shear waves are generated along a Mach cone creating a plane of intense shear waves propagating in opposite directions. The arterial and venous pulses excite a wake of high frequency shear waves with a Mach angle of 90&#xb0;, so the shear waves propagate along the vascular vessels as a guided wave. The pulse generated wake of high frequency shear waves gives rise to oscillatory pressure and suction waves acting on the vascular vessel, which have been consistently misinterpreted in the literature in the carotid, brachial and radial as reflected pressure waves. The wake of pulse generated high frequency shear waves also occur in the veins, but at much lower amplitudes than the arteries.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0069">The wake of intense excited shear waves, generated by the traveling pulse, have a particle motion perpendicular to the axial (longitudinal) arterial direction, thus setting up periodic oscillatory waves of pressure and suction, that are highly dispersive. Note that the excited shear wave intensity is much less after exercise compared to at rest. During exercise the vascular smooth muscle relaxes and the radial secant shear modulus (G<sub>R</sub>) drops significantly, resulting in the radial Bramwell-Hill wave speed being much lower during exercise compared to at rest. The amplitude of the excited shear waves is dependent on the ratio (CBH/CL), i.e. the radial Bramwell-Hill wave speed to the longitudinal shear wave speed, the greater the ratio the higher the induced shear wave amplitude. Since the contrast between the radial and longitudinal wave speeds during exercise compared to at rest is less, then the pulse excited wake of shear waves has a lower amplitude during exercise compared to at rest.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0070">The formulation of the PWV in the arteries, follows the same procedure as outlined in the geophysics literature, with the p-wave wave speed of the fluid in the geophysics case being substituted by the radial Bramwell-Hill wave speed. The artery longitudinal shear modulus, incorporating the arterial longitudinal wave shear modulus plus arterial embedment and tethering, is analogous to steel casing and the host rock formation as detailed earlier in the geophysics literature of the 1960s.

The prime reflective pressure wave in the left arm is reflected from the fingertips and back from under the armpit. From the subject's left arm length, and the two wave travel times for at rest and after exercise, C<sub>P </sub>at rest and after exercise can be found.

That is, the pulse wave is travelling in a &#x201c;slow&#x201d; medium, and the pulse generates and excites a wake of high frequency highly dissipative shear waves, that produce oscillatory pressure and suction waves on the vascular vessel, be it an artery or vein. These shear wave induced oscillatory pressure and suction waves have been misidentified in the past as reflective pressure waves, since wave intensity analysis can't discern and differentiate between the pulse exited wake of shear waves from other traveling waves. Relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle during exercise significantly reduced the radial secant modulus G<sub>BH </sub>by 18%, i.e. from 115 kPa to 95 kPa.

As shown here, from a reanalysis of historical data, the peripheral radial artery shows significant changes in its biomechanical properties due to hypertension. The systolic power law coefficient changes from 0.8 (NT) to 0.5 (HT), the radial secant shear modulus drops from NT to HT, hypertrophy is added in HT subjects, and the overall stiffness of the artery is increased in HT subjects.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> depicts the time histories <b>61</b> of waveforms PPW <b>6</b>, PVW <b>7</b>, and PUW <b>62</b> over a single cardiac cycle measured over the carotid artery by the disclosed processing device.

From the anelastic power law model of the aorta, early to mid-diastole, for normotensive and hypertensive subjects, the downward traveling wave has a tangential wave speed of twice the upward traveling wave's tangential wave speed, due to the differing pressures experienced by the respective upwards and downwards traveling waves. Knowing the distance from the suprasternal notch to the aortic bifurcation, 46 cm for this subject, enables the PWV to be determined for this path length. From the anelastic power law model, the aortic valve closure wave in the carotid travels at twice the wave speed of the reflected aortic valve closure wave in the carotid artery. The distance from the suprasternal notch to the carotid measuring point is 9 cm, and two measurement points in the carotid would yield the carotid PWV. The subject's aortic PWV is 6.7 m/s, which is equivalent to the secant aorta PWV for the applied pulse pressure (systole minus diastole). This path length entails the most important artery in the body, the aorta, and thus its PWV is of significant clinical interest, and a simple direct measurement of its PWV is extremely useful. If the integral of the change of the PUW waveform <b>62</b> of the reflected aortic closure wave <b>76</b> from a linear decline from systole to end of diastole is calculated over the time abscissa values 77 to 78 (0.069 secs), the reflected normalized aortic valve closure volume <b>79</b> is determined. If there are no earlier reflected waves from the aortic valve closure wave, then the normalized volume <b>79</b> will be the same as the normalized volume <b>72</b>. The Q (Quality factor) of this subject's aorta (from the descending aorta to the aorta bifurcation) is the inverse of 1.0 minus the ratio of the time abscissa values (69-71)/(77-78), i.e. 0.063/.069 for an aorta Quality factor of 11. Any abnormalities (stiffening, plaque buildup, arteriosclerosis, aneurysm or dissection) in the ascending aorta will be apparent from changes in the PPW and PUW during systole and aortic valve closure. Similarly, abnormalities in the descending, thoracic or abdominal aorta will give rise to additional earlier reflected waves before the arrival of the bifurcation reflected aortic valve closure wave, and changes in the PPW and PUW waveforms in the reflected aortic valve closure wave. Location of these abnormalities can be determined from the arrival times of such additional reflected waves.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> depicts the time histories <b>80</b> of the PPW waveform <b>6</b>, the PVW waveform <b>7</b>, measured over the radial artery by the disclosed processing device. These waveforms were collected on a mildly hypertensive male of 69 years of age. The subject was seated at a desk, with his left forearm resting on the desk. The subject's upper left arm brachial artery blood pressure was measured by an Omron M3 blood pressure monitor prior to the test with the wristband. The subject's blood pressure was measured by the Omron device as 148/80 mmHg at a heartrate of 75 bpm. The force sensor is shown on the second ordinate axis, with its force divided by the skin contact area of the housing positioned over the radial artery that occludes the artery, and is thus shown as a pressure in this case in mmHg. The pressure actuator occludes the radial artery beginning at the time location denotated by <b>81</b>, and releases the applied pressure beginning at the time location given by <b>82</b>. The pressure actuator could be electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic, mechanical or manually actuated, and could be of the piezoelectric, electromechanical, air bag, stepper motor, geared or spring type. The pressure actuator for the housing <b>5</b> having a skin contact area over the radial artery of 1.7 cm<sup>2</sup>, requires a total force of four (4) Newtons to occlude the radial artery. The total time period of the occlusion and release in this case is approximately six (6) seconds. The first beat recorded on the PVW following occlusion denoted as <b>83</b>, is the systolic PVW pick for the systolic blood pressure as denoted by <b>84</b>. The change in slope beat, shown as <b>85</b>, following release of the artery is the diastolic pick for the diastolic blood pressure as given by <b>86</b>. Due to the radial artery being occluded for greater than 3.5 seconds, and this subject has circulation from the ulnar artery to the radial artery, then PVW peaks <b>87</b> are detected approximately 3.5 seconds following occlusion of the artery, are due to this recirculation of arterial blood flow. This phenomenon doesn't impact the blood pressure measurement, but it isn't necessary to include an extended occlusion time of the radial artery and if it can be avoided, it simplifies the detection algorithm that automatically determines the PVW systolic and diastolic pick points <b>83</b> and <b>85</b>, to quantify the systolic <b>84</b> and diastolic <b>86</b> blood pressures. The blood pressures recorded by the wristband were systolic/diastolic (<b>84</b> and <b>86</b>) of 151/79mmHg and heartrate of 75 bpm are all in excellent agreement with the upper arm cuff brachial artery blood pressure measurements.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref> depicts the time histories <b>88</b> of the waveform PPW <b>6</b> and the waveform PVW <b>7</b>, measured over the radial artery by the disclosed processing device. These waveforms were collected on a mildly hypertensive male of 69 years of age. The subject was seated at a desk, with his left forearm resting on the desk. The subject's upper left arm brachial artery blood pressure was measured by an Omron M3 blood pressure monitor prior to the test with the wristband. The subject's blood pressure was measured by the Omron device as 143/88 mmHg at a heartrate of 70 bpm. The force sensor is shown on the second ordinate axis, with its force divided by the skin contact area of the housing positioned over the radial artery, that occludes the artery, and is thus shown as a pressure in this case in mmHg. The pressure actuator occludes the radial artery beginning at the time location denoted by <b>89</b>, and releases the applied pressure beginning at the time location given by <b>90</b>. The total time period of the occlusion and release in this case is approximately five (5) seconds, with the artery being occluded, i.e. the time the pressure actuator is above the systolic pressure, for approximately 4 seconds. The PVW systolic pick is the first beat recorded on the PVW following occlude denoted as <b>91</b>, is the systolic blood pressure as denoted by <b>92</b>. The last beat, shown as <b>93</b>, following release of the artery is the PVW diastolic pick for the diastolic blood pressure as given by <b>94</b>. Due to the radial artery being occluded for less than 3 seconds, then PVW peaks due to the recirculation of arterial blood flow from the ulnar artery are not present, and thus simplify the automatic detection algorithm to determine PVW systolic and diastolic picks denoted as points <b>91</b> and <b>93</b>, to quantify the systolic <b>92</b> and diastolic <b>94</b> blood pressures. The PVW systolic pick window <b>95</b> is shown enlarged (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>) to more clearly discern the PVW systolic pick point <b>91</b>. The PVW diastolic pick window <b>96</b> is shown enlarged (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>C</figref>) to more clearly discern the PVW diastolic pick point <b>93</b>. The blood pressures recorded by the wristband were systolic/diastolic (<b>92</b> and <b>94</b>) were 143/89 mmHg and a heart rate of 69 bpm are in excellent agreement with the upper arm brachial artery cuff blood pressure measurements. Subjects with edema, ischemia and/or vascular disease may not response to occlude release as rapidly as healthy subjects, and thus may require both the systolic and diastolic picks to be conducted from the PUW waveform, as the PUW waveform responds twice as fast as the PVW waveform. While the chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref> displays the waveform PVW for the systolic or diastolic picks, a chart showing the waveform PUW will lead to the same results. In certain persons with edema, ischemia or significant vascular disease, the waveform PUW, instead of the waveform PVW, for the picks may be desirable because the waveform PUW reacts twice as fast as the waveform PVW. In order to determine whether to use the waveform PVW or the waveform PUW a simple test, Post-Occlusive Reactive Hyperemia (PORH), can be used.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0083">The disclosed devices and methods can be used to determine the health status of a subject, more specifically the cardiovascular health status of an individual. In vivo quantification of anelastic changes in arterial blood vessels is essential in diagnosing the issues relating to aging and disease, and determining the impact of medication on changes to the peripheral arterial blood vessels' anelastic properties and their hypertrophy. Arterial hypertrophy refers to the abnormal enlargement or thickening of the walls of arterial blood vessels. This leads to a narrowing of the vascular lumen.
