Users can follow various accounts in order to receive notifications and posts from those accounts. Users may additionally change their following settings for accounts as their interests change. Current systems are limited in that they are binary&#x2014;a user either follows an account or does not follow an account. Systems are unable to distinguish between unfollowed accounts (e.g., accounts that a user previously followed and subsequently unfollowed) and accounts that were never followed by a user. This is a shortcoming of current systems, as unfollowed accounts can still be a valuable source of information. The fact that the user followed a certain account at one point typically indicates some relationship or interest between the two accounts. The unfollowed account is therefore more likely to have information relevant to the user than is an account with which the user has never interacted. The inability of current systems to distinguish between unfollowed and never-followed accounts and to utilize this additional source of information therefore deprives the user of valuable information. Thus, systems and methods are needed which allow for a user to receive relevant information from accounts that the user no longer follows.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Solutions to the problem described above include distinguishing between unfollowed accounts and never-followed accounts so that the system may track the activity of unfollowed accounts. To do this, the system may tag accounts that the user unfollows by adding an identifier. Additionally or alternatively, the system may store unfollowed accounts in a separate list. The system may use alternative methods for distinguishing unfollowed accounts from other accounts, as well. In some embodiments, an unfollowed account may include an account that the user has muted or blocked. In some embodiments, unfollowing may include unfriending, unsubscribing, or otherwise removing an account. The system may determine whether any activities of the unfollowed accounts match an interest of the user. In some embodiments, an interest is an upcoming event in the user's calendar. The system may determine that an activity of the unfollowed account matches the event by determining that the activity matches a location or a time of the event. In some embodiments, an interest is a reservation or a travel itinerary. The system may determine that an activity of the unfollowed account matches the reservation or itinerary by determining that the activity has the same location and time as the reservation or itinerary. In some embodiments, an interest is a user preference specified in the user's profile. The system may determine that an activity of the unfollowed account relates to the user preference through keyword matching or another analysis.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are several additional considerations that the system may use when searching for relevant content. For example, the system may set a relevance threshold which any activity from an unfollowed account must meet in order for the system to notify the user of the activity. The relevance threshold may be higher for activity from unfollowed accounts than for activity from accounts that the user has never followed, as the user has expressed disinterest by ceasing to follow the unfollowed account. The system may alter the relevance threshold for unfollowed accounts for a variety of reasons. In some embodiments, the system may set lower relevance thresholds for unfollowed accounts that have a familial tie with the user. In some embodiments, the system may set lower relevance thresholds for activity that is marked as important. For example, the system may mark an update about a crisis or natural disaster as important and thus may lower the relevance threshold for that activity. The system may additionally or alternatively apply a different relevance threshold based on whether or not the unfollowed account follows the user back.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are several techniques that can be used to carry out the search and notification processes of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, the system may pull data from the user's profile, emails, social media posts, events, reservations, and itineraries. The system may parse this data for keywords, metadata, and any other useful information. The system may then use this data to create search filters. For example, the system may create a filter to return any results that contain a certain keyword. In some embodiments, the system may create a filter to return any results that are similar to the user's data (e.g., through use of a knowledge graph). In some embodiments, the system may generate a filter for any results that match the time and location of an event, reservation, or itinerary from the user's data. The system may monitor unfollowed accounts and search through activities using the generated filters. If the system identifies a match, it may compare the relevance level between the user's data and the activity to the relevance threshold. If the relevance exceeds the relevance threshold, the system may notify the user of the activity. The system may additionally or alternatively recommend an action to the user (e.g., to change a reservation) based on the notification.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The above and other objects and advantages of the disclosure will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters refer to like parts throughout, and in which:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an illustrative example of a notification and display of a post from an unfollowed account that relates to a user's travel plans, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an illustrative display of settings for receiving notifications and updates about posts from unfollowed accounts, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram of an illustrative user equipment, in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram of an illustrative media system, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a block diagram of an illustrative search system for searching unfollowed accounts for activity relevant to a user, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flowchart of an illustrative process for notifying a user of relevant activity from unfollowed accounts, in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flowchart of an illustrative process for identifying an interest associated with an account based on an event, in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a flowchart of an illustrative process for identifying an interest associated with an account based on an itinerary, in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a flowchart of an illustrative process for identifying an interest associated with an account based on user preferences, in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a flowchart of an illustrative process for setting a higher relevance threshold for unfollowed accounts than accounts that were not previously followed, in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref> is a flowchart of an illustrative process for setting a lower relevance threshold when there is a familial relationship between two accounts, in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref> is a flowchart of an illustrative process for setting a lower relevance threshold when an activity of an unfollowed account has a high importance, in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Methods and systems are described herein for providing a user with relevant information from unfollowed accounts. The system may determine that an unfollowed account posted something that the user may wish to see, regardless of the unfollowed status. The system may base this determination upon user preferences, events, travel plans, social media activity, text and email data, or any other data source. Once the system identifies a relevant activity from the unfollowed account, the system may compare the activity to a relevance threshold. This threshold may be based upon importance of the activity, a relationship between the user's account and the unfollowed account, or any other factor. If the system determines that the activity meets or exceeds the relevance threshold, the system may then notify the user of the activity of the unfollowed account.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an illustrative example <b>100</b> of a notification and display of a post from an unfollowed account that relates to a user's travel plans, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure. In some embodiments, unfollowed accounts may be an account that the user previously followed but has since unfollowed. In some embodiments, an unfollowed account may include an account that the user has muted or blocked. In some embodiments, unfollowing may include unfriending, unsubscribing, or otherwise removing an account. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a user device <b>102</b> displays a notification <b>104</b> which alerts the user of an activity from an unfollowed account. In some embodiments, the system may offer the user an option to view or ignore the post. In some embodiments, the system may include a preview of the post or the entire post in notification <b>104</b>. Notification <b>104</b> includes an identifier of the unfollowed account (e.g., @DennisQCortese) as well as the user interest to which the activity is relevant. In this example, the activity is relevant to the user's upcoming travel plans, i.e., the activity is about a restaurant near the user's hotel in Paris. The system may access booking information (e.g., confirmation emails, calendar entries, social media events, etc.) to identify the user's hotel in Paris. The system may identify that the post by the unfollowed account is relevant to the user's hotel in Paris based on keyword analysis, such as the name of the restaurant, the word &#x201c;Paris,&#x201d; or the address of the restaurant in the post. The system may compare the location of the restaurant to the location of the user's hotel to determine that they are nearby.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, the user may tap on or swipe notification <b>104</b> in order to view the post. Additionally or alternatively, the system will alert the user of the activity within the platform (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.) on which the activity was posted. In some embodiments, the system may add the activity to the user's feed within the platform. In this example, if the user taps on the notification, the user is directed to page <b>106</b> within a social media platform. Page <b>106</b> displays the post from the unfollowed account. Page <b>106</b> may display an identifier of the unfollowed account (e.g., identifier <b>108</b>). The identifier may comprise a profile picture, a profile name, a social media handle, a link to the unfollowed account's home page, an option to re-follow the account (e.g., button <b>114</b>), and any other identifying information. Page <b>106</b> may additionally display the post of the unfollowed account along with any other relevant information. For example, if the post relates to a location, the post may include a map, address, or link for the location (e.g., location <b>112</b>). In some embodiments, if the post relates to an event, the post may include a description of or link to the event.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows the notification and display of a post from an unfollowed account, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an illustrative user device <b>200</b> having settings for receiving notifications and updates about posts from unfollowed accounts, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure. User device <b>200</b> includes a display <b>202</b> which displays a series of notification settings. These notification settings relate to notifications sent to the user within the platform. The first setting <b>204</b> controls whether the system sends the user push notifications (e.g., pop-up alerts) on the user device (e.g., notification <b>104</b> on device <b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The user may move the toggle (e.g., toggle <b>216</b>) in order to turn this setting on or off. Setting <b>206</b> controls whether the system includes posts from unfollowed accounts on the user's feed in the platform. In some embodiments, if this setting is enabled, the system may send the user push notifications about posts from unfollowed accounts which have a very high relevance rating and may add posts having a lower relevance rating to the user's feed.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Setting <b>208</b> controls whether the system searches for and displays posts from unfollowed accounts which match the user's calendar events. This setting enables the system to create search filters based on calendar events when searching through posts from unfollowed accounts for relevant information. The system may first analyze each calendar event and extract key words, locations, event titles, and times. The system may then compile this information into a filter. Any posts from unfollowed accounts which match the information from the calendar event and are determined to be relevant to the user are displayed to the user.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Setting <b>210</b> controls whether the system searches for and displays posts matching the user's preferences. The user's preferences may be specific to the platform. For example, the user may enter multiple interests, preferences, and settings when creating the user profile on the platform. The system may additionally or alternatively track content (e.g., posts, videos, advertisements, etc.) within the platform with which the user positively engages. For example, if the user follows an artist and likes or comments on a series of posts from the artist, the system may determine that the user is interested in the artist. In some embodiments, the system may determine interests of the user based on posts that the user makes on the platform. For example, if the user posts about a restaurant the system may identify the restaurant or cuisine as an interest of the user. If setting <b>210</b> is enabled, the system may alert the user of posts from unfollowed accounts which relate to the artist.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Setting <b>212</b> controls whether the system alerts the user of posts from unfollowed family members. The system may determine relationships between users by prompting the user to input their relationship to another user. In some embodiments, the system may determine that the unfollowed account is a family member by comparing user names, analyzing mutual connections, or other means. If setting <b>212</b> is enabled, the system may lower the relevance threshold for posts from unfollowed family members.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Setting <b>214</b> controls whether the system alerts the user of relevant posts from unfollowed groups. In some scenarios, a user may leave a group on a platform due to a dislike of the content that is posted by other group members. However, some content posted by group members may still be relevant to the user even after the user has unfollowed the group. Therefore, if setting <b>214</b> is enabled, the system may search unfollowed groups for posts that may be relevant to the user.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">It will be understood that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> are shown for illustrative purposes and that not all of the settings and details need to be included. For example, in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, instead of offering the user a series of settings, the system may display an option to view or ignore a post from an unfollowed each time the system alerts the user of the post.

The arrows connecting the respective device(s) and server(s) represent communication paths, which may include a satellite path, a fiber-optic path, a cable path, a path that supports Internet communications (e.g., IPTV), free-space connections (e.g., for broadcast or other wireless signals), or any other suitable wired or wireless communications path or combination of such paths. Further details of the present disclosure are discussed below in connection with the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and the flowcharts of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>11</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram of an illustrative search system <b>500</b> for searching unfollowed accounts for activity relevant to a user, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, system <b>500</b> comprises a search engine <b>502</b> which gathers data about the user from various sources (e.g., sources <b>504</b>). These sources may include user profiles for the user within the platform (e.g., user profile <b>506</b>), texts and emails from the user's accounts and devices (e.g., texts/emails <b>508</b>), social media posts and interests (e.g., social media <b>510</b>), and calendars belonging to the user comprising various events and schedules (e.g., calendar <b>512</b>). Search engine <b>502</b> may gather data from sources <b>504</b> including user preferences, plans, schedules, interests, settings, and other data.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Search engine <b>502</b> may identify triggers (e.g., triggers <b>514</b>) within the data. For example, the system may identify a calendar entry within calendar <b>512</b>. The search engine <b>502</b> may extract an event (e.g., event <b>516</b>) from the calendar. Event <b>502</b> may comprise a name, a description, a list of attendees, a link to additional information, a location, a time, and other information. In some embodiments, the event may include an activity by the user on the platform. The system may identify an event in a post made by the user on the social media platform. For example, the user may post on the platform asking for recommendations for a trip that the user is planning for Paris in the fall. The system may determine the event, location, and time frame from information included in the post. In some embodiments, search engine <b>502</b> may extract a reservation (e.g., reservation <b>518</b>) from the data. The reservation may be a restaurant reservation, a flight booking, a hotel booking, or another type of reservation. Search engine <b>502</b> may extract information associated with the reservation, such as location and time. The reservation may extend over various times and locations (e.g., for hotel and flight bookings). In these cases, the system may extract starting times and locations as well as ending times and locations of each segment of the reservation.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the system may compile some of the data gathered from sources <b>504</b> into an itinerary (e.g., itineraries <b>520</b>). The itinerary may comprise transportation information, schedules, events, reservations, and other information that comprises a trip. The system may use the data within the itinerary as triggers for creating search filters (e.g., filter <b>522</b>) or may use the entire itinerary as a trigger. For example, search engine <b>502</b> may search multiple unfollowed accounts (e.g., unfollowed accounts <b>524</b>) using a filter <b>522</b> comprising certain locations and/or corresponding time periods from the itinerary. The search filter allows system <b>500</b> to identify posts from unfollowed accounts <b>524</b> that are relevant and useful to the user. If any posts from unfollowed accounts match a location and/or corresponding time period, the system may notify the user of those posts (e.g., via user notification <b>526</b>). In some embodiments, user notification <b>526</b> may be a push notification on the user's device (e.g., media device <b>402</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). In some embodiments, user notification <b>526</b> may be an addition of the post to the user's feed within the platform. In some embodiments, the user notification <b>526</b> may include an option to view or ignore the post from the unfollowed account. The system may then recommend an action (e.g., via action recommendation <b>528</b>). For example, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the system may determine, based on flight and hotel bookings, that the user will be in Paris during the first week of July. The system may create filters (e.g., filter <b>522</b>) for relevant posts from unfollowed accounts that relate to Paris (e.g., based on the location or time period). The system may identify an unfollowed account containing a posts raving about a new restaurant in Paris. The system may notify the user of the post and additionally recommend an action. For example, the system may recommend that the user make a reservation at the restaurant during the user's trip to Paris and may redirect the user to the restaurant's reservation site or may provide the user with the restaurant's phone number and hours.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, the system may additionally search accounts that the user follows (e.g., followed accounts <b>530</b>) and accounts that the user has never followed (e.g., never-followed accounts <b>532</b>). The system may search the followed accounts <b>530</b> and never-followed accounts <b>532</b> using the same filters <b>522</b>. In some embodiments, the system may search these different types of accounts using different relevance thresholds, as will be discussed in detail in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">It will be understood that system <b>500</b> is merely illustrative and that various modification can be made in accordance with the present disclosure. System <b>500</b> may additionally build upon existing search functionalities of social media platforms.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>11</b></figref> show multiple processes that can be implemented, for example, using the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flowchart of an illustrative process <b>600</b> for notifying a user of relevant activity from unfollowed accounts, in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, process <b>600</b> determines an interest of a first account and searches for relevant information among posts from accounts that the first account has unfollowed. If the system (e.g., control circuitry <b>304</b>) identifies a match, the system notifies the first account of the relevant post. By performing a refined search of posts from unfollowed accounts, process <b>600</b> ensures that the user will receive relevant information without needing to view unfollowed accounts.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">At step <b>602</b>, the system (e.g., control circuitry <b>304</b>) tracks that a first account within a platform has unfollowed a second account within the platform. For example, the system <b>600</b> may track the accounts which the first account follows. If the first account removes a second account from the follow list, the system may store the second account in a list of unfollowed accounts. The list of unfollowed accounts may be stored so that the system may access the list at a later time (e.g., in storage <b>308</b> or in cloud-based storage) and may or may not be accessible to the user of the first account. The list may be separate from a list of accounts that the user does not follow and has not previously followed.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">At step <b>604</b>, the system identifies an interest associated with the first account. As described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the system may determine an interest by searching through data associated with the first account (e.g., user profile, texts/emails, social media, calendars, etc.). The interest may include a preference of the user (e.g., a favorite band, a city the user would like to visit, or a favorite type of food), an event the user will attend, an upcoming reservation, a travel itinerary, or another interest (e.g., based on a post to the social media platform). For example, the system may identify a post by the user to the platform asking for a recommendation for a seafood restaurant in Cape Cod this weekend. The system may identify this as an interest of the user. The system may extract metadata from the interest, such as a title, a location and corresponding time, a date range, or other identifying information. The system may use this metadata to create search filters.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">At step <b>606</b>, the system monitors activities of the unfollowed second account. For example, the system may await new activity from the second account such as a new post, a check-in to a new location, a new status, or another update. As another example, the system may access historical activity from the second account.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">At step <b>608</b>, the system compares the interest of the first account to the activities of the unfollowed second account. This comparison may comprise applying a search filter based on the interest of the first account to the activities of the unfollowed second account. The system may search the activities using several filters corresponding to several interests. For example, if the user has an upcoming trip to Paris, the system may search various locations and dates within the itinerary, as well as particular events or establishments that the user plans to attend.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">At step <b>610</b>, the system determines whether there is a match between the interest associated with the first account and the activities of the unfollowed second account. The system may identify that the interest and activity have a piece of metadata in common, such as the title of an event, the location and/or time, the same date range, a similar description, or another piece of data. If the system determines that there is a match, process <b>600</b> continues at step <b>612</b>. If the system determines that there is not a match, process <b>600</b> continues at step <b>614</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">At step <b>612</b>, the system notifies the first account of the activity of the unfollowed second account that matches the interest of the first account. In some embodiments, the user notification may be a push notification on the user's device (e.g., media device <b>402</b>). In some embodiments, the user notification may be an addition of the post to the user's feed within the platform. In some embodiments, the user notification may include an option to view or ignore the post from the unfollowed account. The system may additionally prompt the user to configure notification preferences, such as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">At step <b>614</b>, in the absence of a match, the system (e.g., control circuitry <b>304</b>) may not notify the first account of activities of the unfollowed second account. As such, the first account will not receive push notifications for updates to the unfollowed second account and will not see posts from the unfollowed second account in the feed on the platform.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">It will be understood that process <b>600</b> is merely illustrative and that various modification can be made in accordance with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a generalized process comprising embodiments illustrated in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>11</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flowchart of an illustrative process <b>700</b> for identifying an interest associated with an account based on an event, in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a method of performing step <b>604</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, process <b>700</b> extracts data from a calendar associated with the first account and uses the extracted data to identify matches between the interest of the first account and an activity of the unfollowed second account. This process allows the user to receive information relevant to upcoming events from unfollowed accounts.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">At step <b>702</b>, the system (e.g., control circuitry <b>304</b>) accesses a calendar associated with the first account. In some embodiments, the calendar may be a calendar within the platform, such as a calendar of events to which the user has RSVP-ed within the platform. In some embodiments, the calendar may exist on another platform that is tied to the first account. For example, the system may be able to retrieve calendar information from another social media platform or a communications platform belonging to the first account. In some embodiments, the calendar may be stored locally in a calendar application on the user's device (e.g., media device <b>402</b>).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">At step <b>704</b>, the system identifies an event in the calendar. The system may determine that there is an upcoming entry in the calendar that relates to a public event, a trip, a location, or another identifiable trait. The system may additionally set a time period within which the system will identify events. For example, the system may identify events within a calendar falling within the upcoming month. The system may additionally apply different time periods for different types of events. For example, the system may identify local events within the next month and travel-related events within the next three months. The system may additionally identify events requiring tickets or reservations within a larger window.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">At step <b>706</b>, the system extracts at least one of a location and a time period from the event in the calendar. In some embodiments, the location and time period may be recorded in the calendar entry. In some embodiments, the system may search for a location and time period within external databases based on metadata or identifying information from a calendar entry. For example, if the system identifies an event called &#x201c;Benefit at School,&#x201d; the system may identify that &#x201c;school&#x201d; relates to the school district in the user's area. The system may then search for upcoming events at the school that are related to &#x201c;benefit.&#x201d; The system may find a matching event on a calendar on the school's website. The system may thus extract a location and time period of the benefit from the calendar on the school's website.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments, the system identifies a match between the interest associated with the first account and the activity of an unfollowed second account based on determining that the activity is associated with the at least one of the location and the time period of the event identified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. For example, the system may search through the activities of unfollowed accounts for activities matching the location and time period extracted at step <b>706</b>. If the location and time period of the activity match the location and time period of the benefit, the system may determine that the activity and the benefit match. For example, the system may identify that an account that the user has unfollowed posted about attending the upcoming benefit. The user may be interested to learn that the person associated with the unfollowed account will be attending the event, as this may impact the user's own plans to attend the event. The system may therefore notify the user about the post from the unfollowed account.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">It will be understood that process <b>700</b> is merely illustrative and that various modification can be made in accordance with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a flowchart of an illustrative process <b>800</b> for identifying an interest associated with an account based on an itinerary, in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, process <b>800</b> compiles bookings (e.g., reservations, flights, tickets, etc.) into a travel itinerary. The system can then identify a match between an interest of a first account and an activity of an unfollowed account based on the information in the travel itinerary. This process allows the user to receive, for example, notifications about updates relating to upcoming travel plans from unfollowed accounts.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">At step <b>802</b>, the system (e.g., control circuitry <b>304</b>) accesses bookings associated with the first account. In some embodiments, the system may parse through text and email data for confirmation messages and emails related to bookings.

The itinerary may additionally include descriptions of the itinerary entries as well as contact information, advisories, and reminders. The travel itinerary may be accessible to the user or may be stored separately from the platform for the system to reference (e.g., in storage <b>308</b>). In some embodiments, the system may include implied locations and times when compiling the itinerary. For example, if the user's itinerary indicates that the user will be driving from Paris to Marseille on a certain day, the system may identify that the user will be driving through Orleans at a certain time. The system may therefore include travel routes, methods of transportation, and time periods in the travel itinerary.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, the system identifies a match between the interest and an activity of an unfollowed account by determining that the activity is associated with a location and/or a corresponding time period in the travel itinerary. For example, the system may identify a post from an unfollowed account that matches a location and/or time along the user's travel route in the itinerary. For instance, the system may identify that the post includes information about a festival in Orleans during the time that the user will be passing through the town. The user may be interested to learn this information, as the user may wish to leave extra time to attend the festival or may wish to take an alternate route to avoid extra traffic caused by the festival. In this example, the system may alert the user of the post based on the match between the post and the itinerary.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">It will be understood that process <b>800</b> is merely illustrative and that various modification can be made in accordance with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a flowchart of an illustrative process <b>900</b> for identifying an interest associated with an account based on user preferences, in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows another method of performing step <b>604</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, process <b>900</b> may identify a number of user preferences within a user profile and use these preferences to identify a relevant post by an unfollowed account. This process allows the system to alert the user of posts of interest even if the posts are made by an unfollowed account.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">At step <b>902</b>, the system (e.g., control circuitry <b>304</b>) accesses a profile associated with the first account. For example, the system may identify a profile including personal and information, settings, preferences, and other information. The profile may be the user's profile within the same platform as the first account or may exist on another platform. For example, the user may have multiple social media profiles across multiple platforms and the system may access one or multiple of these accounts.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">At step <b>904</b>, the system identifies a plurality of preferences in the profile. A preference may include something that the user has &#x201c;liked,&#x201d; an interest related to a page or account that the user follows, or an interest that the user has indicated in the user profile. For example, preferences may include a favorite band, a favorite type of food or restaurant, a city the user would like to visit, or another interest. In some embodiments, the system may determine a preference based on a post that he user has made to the social media platform. For example, if the user posts about a favorite book, the system may identify the book, author, and genre as interests of the user.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments, the system identifies a match between the interest and the activity of an unfollowed account by determining that the activity relates to a preference in the profile. The system may make this determination by matching keywords between the preferences and posts from unfollowed accounts. For example, if the user has indicated an interest in the band &#x201c;Florence and the Machine&#x201d; in the user profile, the system may search unfollowed accounts for posts containing the words &#x201c;Florence&#x201d; and &#x201c;Machine.&#x201d; If there is a post from an unfollowed account containing the keywords, the system may determine that the post is relevant to the user's preferences and therefore may identify the post as a match.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">It will be understood that process <b>900</b> is merely illustrative and that various modification can be made in accordance with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a flowchart of an illustrative process for setting a higher relevance threshold for unfollowed accounts than accounts that were not previously followed, in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, process <b>1000</b> determines a first relevance threshold for activities from unfollowed accounts and a second relevance threshold for activities from never-followed accounts. These relevance thresholds allow the system to provide the most relevant information from unfollowed and never-followed accounts.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">At step <b>1002</b>, the system (e.g., control circuitry <b>304</b>) determines a first relevance threshold for identifying a match between a user's interest and an activity of an unfollowed account. In some embodiments, the system may prompt the user for a relevance threshold, for example by prompting the user to indicate if they would like to see all relevant posts from unfollowed accounts or only very relevant posts from unfollowed accounts. In some embodiments, the system may preconfigure a first relevance threshold for unfollowed accounts in the settings. In some embodiments, the first relevance threshold may be different across different platforms.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">At step <b>1004</b>, the system identifies a second account within the platform that he user has not followed. For example, the system identifies a never-followed account. The system may use various methods to distinguish never-followed accounts from unfollowed accounts, such as tagging or keeping separate lists of accounts.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">At step <b>1006</b>, the system determines a second relevance threshold for identifying a match between the user's interest and an activity of the never-followed account. In some embodiments, the second relevance threshold may be preconfigured in the settings. In some embodiments, the first relevance threshold may be different across different platforms. For example, each social media platform may have an algorithm for displaying or recommending content to users from never-followed accounts. Process <b>1000</b> may build upon algorithms in existing platforms or may introduce a new algorithm for determining a relevance threshold for never-followed accounts.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some embodiments, the first relevance threshold may be lower than the second relevance threshold. For example, the system may set the first relevance threshold lower, as the &#x201c;unfollowed&#x201d; status indicates the user's previous interest in an account. The unfollowed account is therefore more likely to contain relevant information than a never-followed account. This ensures that the user is presented with the most relevant information.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some embodiments, the system may determine a third relevance threshold for accounts that the user follows. The relevance threshold may be significantly lower for followed accounts than for unfollowed accounts and never-followed accounts. In some embodiments, the third relevance threshold may be used to determine where a post appears in a feed and/or whether the user receives a notification about the post.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some embodiments, the system may determine a relevance score for a match between a user's interest and an activity of an unfollowed account based on how close the match is between the interest and the activity. For example, the system may match an activity of an unfollowed account to a preference of the user using keyword matching and may determine that the activity contains all of the keywords of the preference (e.g., &#x201c;Florence&#x201d; and &#x201c;Machine). The system may therefore determine that the activity has a high relevance level. In another scenario, the system may determine that the location tagged in a post from an unfollowed account is an exact match to a location of an event the user will attend. The system may determine that the post is therefore relevant and important for the user to see and may raise the relevance score.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">It will be understood that process <b>1000</b> is merely illustrative and that various modification can be made in accordance with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B</figref> are flowcharts of illustrative processes for applying higher or lower thresholds for unfollowed accounts.

This allows the user to receive important information about family regardless of whether the user has chosen to unfollow the account.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">At step <b>1102</b>, the system determines whether there is a familial relationship between the first account and the unfollowed account. In some embodiments, the system may identify a familial relationship based on a user indication within the platform that the account belongs to a family member. In some embodiments, the system may identify a familial relationship based on mutual friends or followers within the platform. For example, if the accounts share many of the same friends or followers and all of the accounts have a common feature (e.g., same last name) then the system may determine that the user and the unfollowed account likely share a familial relationship. If the system determines that there is a familial relationship, process <b>1000</b>A may continue to step <b>1104</b>. If the system determines that there is no familial relationship, process <b>1000</b>A may continue to step <b>1106</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">At step <b>1104</b>, the system applies a lower first relevance threshold.

The system may determine the importance based on the type of activity. For example, a birthday or holiday post may be marked as more important than a post not relating to a special event.

For example, if the words &#x201c;concert,&#x201d; &#x201c;meet-and-greet,&#x201d; or &#x201c;tour&#x201d; are included in a post about &#x201c;Florence and the Machine,&#x201d; the system may determine that the post is important for the user to view and my increase the importance.
