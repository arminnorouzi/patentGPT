For instance, such storage devices may be used as so-called persistent flags in transponders. Nowadays, radio frequency identification (RFID) transponders are widely used, in different areas of industry and commerce and for various purposes. RFID transponders may for example be embodied as so-called RFID tags or RFID cards. It is noted that, in the present disclosure, near field communication (NFC) transponders are regarded as a specific type of RFID transponders. Thus, the principles described herein may also be applied to NFC transponders.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Persistent flags are a feature related to the RFID technology. The persistent flags have the function to retain the inventory state information of a transponder for a predetermined or predefined time. This predetermined time is often referred to as the persistence time. The function and the time requirements of each persistent flag are specified in a protocol, which is an industry standard defining the communication between a reader and a transponder, and vice versa. Such a protocol is for example defined in the document EPC&#x2122; <i>Radio</i>-<i>Frequency Identity Protocols Generation</i>-2 <i>UHF RFID</i>, version 2.0.1, published in April 2015. It is noted that reference is made to a tag in the examples and embodiments described herein. However, the presently disclosed storage device may also be used in other types of transponders or other devices.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example of a storage device <b>100</b>. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a possible implementation of a persistent flag, such as described in U.S. 8,803,592 B2. The implementation is formed by a capacitor <b>110</b>, a pass device <b>120</b>, a charge/discharge circuit <b>130</b>, a control circuit <b>140</b> and an output circuit <b>150</b>. During the normal operation of a tag, in other words, when the tag is powered, the persistence flag can be set or reset. The set operation is performed by charging the capacitor <b>110</b> by enabling control through both the charge circuit <b>130</b> and the control circuit <b>140</b>. The resulting charged voltage across the capacitor <b>110</b> is defined by the voltage applied at the gate and drain terminals of the pass device <b>120</b> and the threshold voltage of the pass device <b>120</b>. The persistence time, which is associated with the charged voltage across the capacitor <b>110</b>, is counted from the time when the tag becomes unpowered to the time when the voltage across the capacitor <b>110</b> falls below the threshold of a comparison function of the output circuit <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example of a persistence time <b>200</b> associated with the storage device <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In particular, the time diagram shows that at t<b>0</b> the tag becomes unpowered <b>210</b> and that consequently the voltage across the previously charged capacitor starts to decrease <b>220</b>. At t<b>1</b>, the voltage across the capacitor falls below the threshold <b>230</b> of the comparison function of the output circuit. The persistence time is defined as the difference t<b>1</b>-t<b>0</b>. The parameters which influence the persistence time are the charge in the capacitor and the leakage current connected to the capacitor. In the circuit implementation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the dominant current leakage source is the channel leakage of the pass device, which is an NMOS pass device.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Storage devices of the kind set form may be sensitive to light. For instance, it has been reported in U.S. Pat. No. 9,218,519 B2 that persistent flags are sensitive to light. This means that the persistence time can be decreased significantly when the tag is exposed to the light. Once entering in the semiconductor material, energetic photons can create electron-hole pairs, which generate charge carriers. The photo generated charge carriers will diffuse through the semiconductor bulk and part of them will reach p-n junctions, resulting in a current flow (or photocurrent) which might perturb the operation of low power circuits. Another part of the of the photo-generated charge carriers may recombine with the semiconductor material before reaching the p-n junctions, in which case no photocurrent is generated.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows another example of a storage device <b>300</b>. In particular, a storage device <b>300</b> is shown whose persistence time is affected by light <b>390</b>. The storage device <b>300</b> is implemented as a persistent flag, having a p-n junction <b>370</b> associated with the source terminal of the pass device <b>320</b>. Since the tag is exposed to the light <b>390</b>, an additional current flow, here denoted as photocurrent <b>380</b>, is created through the p-n junction at the source terminal of the pass device <b>320</b>. Depending on the light intensity, the photocurrent could be the dominant one once compared with the leakage <b>360</b> of the pass device, and therefore, it would reduce the charge on the storage capacitor <b>310</b> rapidly, resulting in a decreased persistence time.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an example of a pass device <b>400</b> comprised in a storage device of the kind set forth. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the cross-sectional view of the pass device presented in schematic form in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. More specifically, it shown that in a situation in which the tag is unpowered, the gate voltage of the pass device is 0V and the storage voltage in the capacitor is 0.5V. Since the gate voltage of the pass device is 0V, a depletion region is formed under the gate. Once the tag is exposed to light, the depletion region contributes to increasing the electron collection area, causing an increased photocurrent and a decreased persistence time.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Now discussed are a storage device and a corresponding method of producing a storage device, which facilitate maintaining the persistence time at an acceptable level. In particular, the presently disclosed storage device and corresponding production method facilitate avoiding that a storage capacitor included in the storage device discharges too quickly when the storage device is exposed to light.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to a first aspect of the present disclosure, a storage device is provided. The storage device comprises a capacitor configured to be charged, a charge circuit configured to charge said capacitor, a pass device coupled between the charge circuit and the capacitor, and a control circuit configured to control said pass device. Furthermore, the storage device comprises a photosensitive diode coupled between the control circuit and the pass device, such that an input voltage provided by the control circuit to the pass device is reduced if the storage device is exposed to light. By including the photosensitive diode, it may be avoided that the capacitor discharges too quickly when the storage device is exposed to light. This, in turn, facilitates maintaining the persistence time at an acceptable level.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one or more embodiments, the pass device comprises a drain coupled to the charge circuit, a source coupled to the capacitor, and a gate coupled to the control circuit, and the input voltage is the gate voltage of the pass device. This results in a practical implementation of a storage device, whose persistence time less is affected by light. Furthermore, in one or more embodiments, reducing the input voltage causes a layer of holes to be created around the source. For instance, said layer may be an accumulation layer. This further facilitates avoiding that the capacitor discharges too quickly when the storage device is exposed to light. In a particularly efficient implementation, the photosensitive diode contains a cathode terminal which is implemented as an n-well region connected to the gate and an anode terminal implemented as a p-substrate. Furthermore, the p-substrate may be a p-substrate of a transponder in which the storage device is included, such that a p-substrate that is already available may be reused for the purpose of reducing the light sensitivity of the storage device.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one or more embodiments, the storage device comprises an output circuit coupled between the pass device and the capacitor, wherein the output circuit is configured to output a voltage present on the capacitor. In this way, the stored charge may easily be measurement and compared with the threshold, to output a value corresponding to, for example, a charged state or a discharged state. Accordingly, the charging state (i.e. charged or discharged) of the capacitor may represent information to be retained, in particular a bit. It is noted that the measurement function and comparison function of the output circuit may be implemented in a conventional manner.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an illustrative embodiment of a storage device <b>500</b>. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an example of an implementation of a storage device having a reduced sensitivity to light. The storage device <b>500</b> is implemented as a persistent flag, having a diode <b>591</b> placed at the gate of the pass device <b>520</b>. One possible, non-limiting way to implement the diode, is to connect the gate to an n-well region in such a way that the cathode terminal of the diode is the n-well region itself, while the anode terminal of the diode is the p-substrate of the tag. The n-well region of the diode can collect photo-generated electrons <b>593</b> and consequently a current flow <b>592</b> is created in order to pull the gate terminal of the pass device <b>520</b> negative.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an illustrative embodiment of a pass device <b>600</b> comprised in a storage device in accordance with the present disclosure. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of the pass device presented in schematic form in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. More specifically, it is shown that in a situation in which the tag is unpowered, the gate voltage of the pass device is -<b>0</b>.<b>7</b>V and the storage voltage in the capacitor is 0.5V. Since the gate voltage of the pass device is &#x2212;0.7V, the depletion region present in the situation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> disappears, and an accumulation layer of holes is created around the source terminal of the pass device. Once the tag is exposed to light, the accumulation layer contributes to increasing the recombination electron-holes around the source terminal of the pass device, causing a decreased photocurrent and an increased persistence time.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Thus, the presently disclosed storage device may have the following advantage. The magnitude of the photocurrent of the p-n junction associated with the source terminal of the pass device may be reduced, by decreasing the gate voltage of the pass device at light conditions, reducing therefore the light sensitivity of the persistence time. In a practical implementation, the insertion of a photosensitive diode at the gate of the pass device of a persistent flag decreases the gate voltage (i.e. pulls it below GND) of the pass device at light conditions, reducing in this way the light sensitivity of the persistence time.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">It is noted that the embodiments above have been described with reference to different subject-matters.
