Additionally, as noted above, one or more embodiments can involve execution of the application service on the UE <b>430</b>, whereas in one or more additional or alternative embodiments, app service <b>410</b> can be executed by a secondary network-connected resource (not pictured) that is either managed centrally or through distributed means. At <b>462</b>, provider <b>460</b> can review the proposed agreement and generate and communicate to app service <b>410</b>, a governing contract to control the access by UE app <b>420</b> to the resources of the network slice.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the one or more embodiments depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a location condition can be a part of the control of the network slice implemented by provider <b>460</b>. One way to implement a location condition is to set a location where the resources of the network slice can be utilized. For example, in <b>422</b> UE app <b>420</b> can request a location token from node <b>440</b>, and at <b>424</b>, node <b>440</b> can provide a location token that allows UE <b>430</b> to establish that it within a particular location boundary, e.g., within range of node <b>440</b>. In one or more alternative embodiments, UE <b>430</b> can use alternative approaches to determining a location of UE <b>430</b>, for later submission during validation processes discussed below. At <b>424</b>, the location token is received buy UE app <b>420</b> and, based on a request for slice membership <b>414</b> by app service <b>410</b>, service <b>410</b> is granted access to request permission to join the allocated slice.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In this example, at <b>416</b>, the app service <b>410</b> queries blockchain node <b>450</b> to confirm the location specified in the location token is valid for slice membership.

Based on this validation, at <b>466</b>, provider can relay a request for service to node <b>440</b>, requesting a promotion of UE <b>430</b> to membership in the allocated slice. Once UE <b>430</b> is promoted, UE app <b>420</b> can be allocated services required for the operation of app service <b>410</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In an example that illustrates different features described above, slice allocation can be beneficially performed for first responders in need of special privileges for emergency response. In an example, a proposed contract is provided by a UE identified as being used by a first responder. Example conditions requested can include, but are not limited to, allocated use of certain network ports for a secure connection to appropriate data sources (e.g., site and medical information), and high bandwidth <b>225</b>D for video streaming <b>220</b>D capability.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">After receipt of the conditions above (e.g., represented by proposed contract data <b>318</b> in request <b>317</b>), slice manager can evaluate request <b>317</b> and generate a governing contract for use by UE <b>430</b>. For example, when considering the requested service conditions, policy manager <b>375</b> can review basic conditions applicable to this type of requestor (e.g., a service level agreement (SLA) in place), past governing contracts to this type of customer (e.g., by a query of blockchain ledger <b>376</b>A), available network slice resources <b>380</b> for the location of user device <b>430</b> (e.g., a network location token can be submitted as a part of request <b>317</b>), and other similar factors.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In this example, based on the above factors, the requested exclusive use of ports is granted, but the high bandwidth <b>225</b>D for video streaming <b>220</b>D capability is not permitted by the governing contract, e.g., because a triage of available resources for the location determines that less allocated resources for UE <b>430</b> can provide more needed resources for other responding parties. Based on this governing contract, resources associated with a network slice are granted to UE <b>430</b>. This example is discussed further below in the context of anomalous activity that can violate the governing contract and, in some circumstances (e.g., not normally for first responder requirements), cause expulsion from the allocated slice.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In another example, when first responder UE <b>430</b> leaves geographic proximity to an emergency event, this change can be detected (e.g., by the location services of 5G connectivity), and blockchain <b>450</b> can be used to confirm the conditions of the governing contract are not violated by this new location. In an expulsion process described with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> below, because an anomalous condition (e.g., change of location) is detected, different processes for provider <b>460</b> can be triggered, including either adapting the governing conditions to encompass the anomalous conditions or triggering the expulsion process for UE <b>430</b> from the allocated network slice.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts a flow diagram <b>500</b> that illustrates connections and example of data exchanged between UE <b>530</b>, node <b>540</b>, blockchain node <b>550</b>, and provider <b>560</b>, that can facilitate the expulsion of UE app <b>520</b> from an allocated network slice, in accordance with one or more embodiments. For purposes of brevity, description of like elements and/or processes employed in other embodiments is omitted.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">One or more embodiments can use the above described features further for the definition and discovery of expulsion criteria for governing contract violations and anomalies in usage that can be indicative of violations. For example, in one or more embodiments, by monitoring slice activity across the network (e.g., by anomaly detector <b>126</b>), a provider can determine policy violations/anomalies for use in the expulsion from, or modification of, allocated network slices. It is important to note that, by utilizing blockchain ledgers <b>376</b>A-B, governing contracts, and the terms of expulsion from slices governed by these contracts, can be transparently published for external access, such that network slice membership can be verified with the application owner and justly terminated for violating policies, e.g., further to promote confidence in the operation of the system.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">For example, in an example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, at <b>512</b>, app service <b>510</b> of UE <b>530</b> can communicate a request <b>317</b> for slice creation, including proposed contract data <b>318</b> to provider <b>560</b> via node <b>540</b>. As described above, proposed contract data <b>318</b> can be reviewed, and selected terms can used to generate a governing contract for the requested connection, and at <b>552</b>, the governing contract can be appended in a ledger entry to blockchain <b>550</b>. At <b>554</b>, the entry can be validated (e.g., by blockchain node <b>330</b>), and at <b>555</b>, provider executes service requirements to request allocation of resources by node <b>540</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">At <b>532</b>, node <b>540</b> can promote UE <b>530</b> to membership in the generated network slice. It should be appreciated that, as used herein, UEs and applications can be described as being promoted to using resources allocated in a network slice, with promotion being used, by one or more embodiments to described upgrading the resources available to the applications as compared to non-allocated resources.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In one approach used by one or more embodiments to maintain service levels allocated to a network slice (e.g., low-latency, high-bandwidth), key performance indicators (KPIs) can be measured and reported at different points in the delivery of resources. For example, at <b>542</b>, a tower providing wireless connectivity to UE <b>530</b> (e.g., node <b>540</b>) can collect KPIs associated with allocated resources. Returning to the first responder allocations described above, for the network slice assigned to the first responder UE <b>530</b>, KPIs associated with port exclusivity, bandwidth and other measurements can be collected and relayed to provider <b>560</b>. In addition to providing data to facilitate the maintaining of the service levels of the network slice, the KPIs collected by different components can be used to detect anomalous behavior, e.g., activity by UE app <b>520</b> that potentially violates the terms of the governing contract.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">At <b>556</b>, one or more embodiments can assess the collected KPIs by reading conditions stored in blockchain <b>550</b>, and if activity outside of the activity authorized by the governing contact is detected, at <b>544</b> an app service penalty can be assessed on UE <b>530</b>. In addition, at <b>558</b>, the detected violation can be communicated to provider <b>560</b>, and an assessment of the violation can be made at provider <b>560</b>, along with potential remedies, e.g., expulsion from the network slice or, in an opposite approach, upgrading the terms of the governing contract to encompass the detected behavior. In the example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, at <b>559</b>, provider <b>560</b> expels UE <b>530</b> for violating the terms of the governing contract, but alternative approaches are described below.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Continuing with to the first responder example discussed above, in an example of aspects of the above-described expulsion analysis, UE <b>530</b> operated by first responders, attempts to turn on video feed for an on-site surgical operation, this being restricted by the example governing contract described above. Based on the execution of this video function by UE <b>530</b>, node <b>540</b> can detect the high-bandwidth requested for delivery of the requested video. In one or more embodiments, this KPI condition can be identified as an anomalous condition, and communicated to blockchain <b>550</b> for analysis and confirmation. Upon a determination that the request for video by UE <b>530</b> violates the terms of the governing contract, provider <b>560</b> can perform a range of functions, including reevaluating factors that led to the initial restriction (e.g., congestion from other priority devices), and after revaluation, determining to enable the video transfer, because the video bandwidth can be accommodated by the available resources. Alternatively, provider <b>560</b> can trigger an expulsion of UE <b>530</b> from the allocated slice as described in the previous example.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">To avoid the expulsion described above (e.g., especially for first responders), one approach that can be implemented allows UEs <b>530</b> operated by first responders (or other priority uses) that have been assigned a lower level of priority (e.g., the prohibition of video streaming described above) to request a priority uplift. This uplift can be reviewed and approved by provider <b>460</b>, as well as locally, by a first responder command post manager for the emergency. Once approved the resources available to an allocated slice can be upgraded. In additional embodiments, the ability to request priority uplift can be made available upon entering a proximity to an emergency (e.g., from 5-50 miles), thus enabling the allocation of resources to begin before arriving at an emergency location. In an alternative embodiment, in some circumstances priority uplift could be automated and not require command post manager approval (automation could be based on location, priority, etc.).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In another example of monitoring, analysis, and expulsion, in one or more embodiments, UAVs and other vehicles, as noted above, can require ultra-low latency for effective operation. In addition, these systems, also having operating systems, applications and media, can periodically require system updates. In one or more embodiments, as a part of a governing contract, terms can be included that recognize that the timing of update downloads can be significant for the operation of the vehicles, e.g., downloading large blocks while controlling a vehicle can interfere with the required low-latency operation of the vehicles.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In this example, the commencement of a system update download can be detected by KPIs in the system (e.g., at node <b>540</b>), and these conditions can be compared to the governing contract term stored in blockchain <b>550</b>, with further analysis performed to consider whether the vehicle is idle (e.g., an appropriate time) or whether the vehicle is operational and in need of low-latency connectivity. Upon determination of idleness, the download operation can be permitted, and a RAN priority downgrade can be requested to be performed, e.g., ultra-low latency connections can use a significant amount of system resources, and the connections are not required for system upgrades. Upon a determination that the vehicle is not idle, the download operation can be paused until a later time. In an additional embodiment, along with the pause, UE <b>530</b> can be expelled from the network slice, having to re-authenticate when the vehicle is idle and can resume the update.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an implementation of an example, non-limiting system <b>600</b> that can facilitate detecting anomalous uses of network slices by employing an artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) component <b>373</b> that can include for example, artificial neural network (ANN) (also termed &#x201c;neural network&#x201d; or &#x201c;network&#x201d; herein) <b>670</b>, in accordance with one or more embodiments described herein.
