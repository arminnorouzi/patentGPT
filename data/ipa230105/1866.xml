MaaS is a concept for seamlessly connecting a mobile service across a plurality of transportation such as a train, a bus, and an airplane when people transfer with the transportation and move. CASE represents &#x201c;connected (a vehicle connected to a net)&#x201d;, &#x201c;autonomous (automated driving)&#x201d;, &#x201c;shared &#x26; service (car sharing and new service)&#x201d;, and &#x201c;electric (conversion to an electric vehicle)&#x201d; in an automobile industry.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to cope with MaaS and CASE, it is expected that types and the number of functions mounted on the vehicle will increase significantly in the future. In addition, it is expected that the number of types of system components forming an in-vehicle function is very large depending on a grade of the vehicle and a specification difference of functions to be mounted.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, it is important for a component manufacturer that manufactures the system component for each vehicle to easily absorb an influence of the specification difference for each vehicle, to shorten a development period of each system component, and to reduce reworking of main components and an increase in the number of types. Therefore, it is necessary to develop techniques as disclosed in Patent Literature 1 and Patent Literature 2.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In recent vehicles, for the purpose of efficient use of power supply power, a plurality of power supplies may be mounted on the same vehicle, and a plurality of types of voltages such as 12 V and 48 V may be handled as power supply voltages at the same time. In addition, such a vehicle is often mounted with a DC/DC converter that steps down or steps up the power supply voltage. That is, by mounting the DC/DC converter, each device mounted on the vehicle as a load can simultaneously or selectively use a plurality of in-vehicle power supplies having different voltages.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition, since cost of the vehicle increases when a plurality of in-vehicle power supplies are mounted, there is a high possibility that a plurality of in-vehicle power supplies are mounted on a vehicle having a relatively high grade as described above and only a single in-vehicle power supply is mounted on a vehicle having a low grade. Therefore, in a case of manufacturing an ECU that supplies power supply power to each part of the vehicle, it is necessary to individually design and manufacture an electrical circuit that implements a function corresponding to a mixture of two types of power supply voltages and an electrical circuit that implements a function corresponding to only a single power supply voltage.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Therefore, also for a circuit board (printed board) on which an electronic component of the ECU is mounted, it is necessary to prepare a circuit board corresponding to a mixture of two types of power supply voltages and a circuit board corresponding to only the single power supply voltage as individual components. These components of the circuit boards have circuit patterns whose positions and shapes are different from each other because circuit configurations are different from each other. Further, these circuit boards are managed under different part numbers.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention has been made in view of the above circumstances, and an object of the present invention is to provide an electrical circuit board capable of sharing components of a circuit board for a plurality of types of electrical circuits having different types of power supply voltages.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The object of the present invention is achieved with the following configuration.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">An electrical circuit board on which an electronic component forming an electronic control unit disposed between an upstream power supply and a downstream power supply trunk line is mounted, the electrical circuit board including:</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">a first circuit pattern that forms an electrical circuit corresponding to a single power supply voltage of the upstream power supply;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">a second circuit pattern that forms an electrical circuit corresponding to a plurality of power supply voltages of the upstream power supply;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">a single power supply connection portion corresponding to connection with an external circuit that supplies the upstream power supply; and</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">an inter-board connection portion corresponding to inter-board connection with another circuit board that supplies the upstream power supply.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to the electrical circuit board of the present invention, components of the circuit board can be shared among a plurality of types of electrical circuits having different types of power supply voltages. Therefore, it is possible to reduce types and part numbers of the circuit board, and it is possible to reduce management cost. In addition, since a common circuit board can be used in a plurality of types of devices, it is possible to reduce a unit price of the circuit board by increasing a quantity. Further, it is possible to reduce development man-hours when a circuit change is required.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present invention has been briefly described above.
