As a result of the gas flow with the first mass flow rate, a partial pressure of one or several reactive gases sets in that lies below a threshold value at which a solid layer is deposited onto the substrate. The start of feeding in the process gas can be made dependent on reaching a temperature. For example, it can be provided that feeding in the first gas flow starts when the heating process has ended, and the surface of the substrate has reached the process temperature. However, the first gas flow of the process gas can start being fed in even beforehand. The mass flow rate of the process gas is set so low that no growth of the two-dimensional layer is observed on the substrate surface. According to the invention, in particular after reaching the process temperature, the mass flow rate of the process gas is then incrementally or continuously, linearly or nonlinearly, increased until a growth of the layer on the substrate is observed. The partial pressure of the one or several reactive gases in the process chamber increases until the threshold value has been reached, at a second mass flow rate of the gas flow. This second mass flow rate of the process gas is subsequently increased to a third mass flow rate by a prescribed value, which can also be 0. The deposition of the two-dimensional layer then takes place at this third mass flow rate. The partial pressure of the one or several reactive gases is here set to a value lying above the threshold value. The value is selected in such a way that a layer is deposited onto the substrate during the flow of the process gas at the third mass flow rate, i.e., that layer growth takes place. Insular growth is observed while depositing two-dimensional layers according to methods in prior art, which are disclosed in particular in the publications mentioned at the outset. Because growth begins there at numerous germination sites on numerous different areas on the substrate, a layer fabricated in this way has a low layer quality. Apart from a two-dimensional layer, for example a graphene layer, an amorphous carbon layer or multiple layers can form. This disadvantage is to be eliminated with the method according to the invention or the use of a CVD reactor according to the invention. The objective is to indicate an optimal growth method for depositing a two-dimensional layer with a high quality. The approach according to the invention relates to controlling the gas flow in the growth phase, such that a partial pressure of the process gas is set above the substrate that lies above a threshold by a prescribed value, wherein the threshold value is defined by the partial pressure at which the state changes between nongrowth and growth. A CVD reactor used according to the invention has a gastight housing, which can be evacuated. The housing incorporates a gas inlet element, which can be fed by means of a feed line with the process gas consisting of one or several reactive gases, or alternatively with an inert gas. The gas inlet element can have a gas distribution chamber. For example, it can assume the form of a showerhead. The process gas can flow into a process chamber from a gas outlet plate that comprises a flat gas outlet surface. To this end, the gas outlet plate forms a plurality of uniformly distributed gas outlet openings. The gas outlet openings can be formed by the ends of tubes, which cross a cooling chamber directly adjacent to the gas outlet plate. The tubes are used to fluidly connect one or more gas distribution chambers with the gas outlet surface. A support surface of a susceptor, which can include a coated or uncoated graphite body, is spaced apart from the gas outlet surface. The susceptor accommodates the substrate on its support surface. Arranged on the side of the susceptor lying opposite the support surface is a heating device, for example a resistance heater, an infrared heater, or an inductive RF heater, with which the susceptor or the substrate can be heated to a process temperature. While heating the susceptor, during which an inert gas can be fed into the process chamber, but during which a smaller first gas flow of the process gas can also be fed into the process chamber, the surface temperature of the substrate is measured with an optical device. The optical device is optically connected with the surface of the substrate via a beam path so as to observe the surface of the substrate. To this end, the gas inlet element can have a window, made out of a material transparent to a wavelength of radiation emitted by the optical device, through which the beam path passes. The beam path can further pass through one of the tubes. In this regard, reference is made to the statements in DE 10 2004 007 984 A1, the disclosure content of which is also incorporated into the disclosure of this application in its entirety. The optical device can be a pyrometer, and is preferably a two-wavelength pyrometer, in which a spectrum is recorded in two different wavelength ranges, for example 350 to 1050 nm and 1050 to 1750 nm. A third spectrum can be calculated from the two spectra, and used to determine the surface temperature of the substrate. The spectra are used to determine a value, from which the surface temperature is ascertained. The latter can be depicted as a measuring curve. Surprisingly, the time progression of the value can be used not just to determine the temperature, but also to determine when layer growth starts or determine when multilayer growth starts. In addition, the measuring curve can be used to end the deposition process. It was observed that the measured value used to determine the temperature corresponds to a measuring curve that runs along a straight line over time before the layer deposition starts. The measuring curve of the value recorded by the optical measuring device over time essentially runs with a constant, in particular negative, gradient. The progression of the measuring curve was observed to change with the start of layer deposition. In particular, it was found that the gradient of the measuring curve rises slightly at the start of layer growth, and thereafter drops off again, so that a local maximum or minimum arises in the measuring curve. It was further observed that the value of the measuring curve gradient again becomes larger or smaller over time after running through the peak. A complete layer has been deposited at this point in time, or a multilayer growth or deposition of an amorphous carbon layer can be expected as of this point in time. The method according to the invention is used to increase the mass flow rate of the gas flow from the first mass flow rate until a first characteristic change becomes evident in the progression of the measuring curve, in particular until the gradient of the measuring curve measured with the optical measuring device increases for the first time. The mass flow rate of the process gas fed into the process chamber at this point in time is referred to as the second mass flow rate. The mass flow rate is then increased from the second mass flow rate by a prescribed value to a third mass flow rate, at which the layer is deposited. The prescribed value can be greater than 0. It can be at least 5 percent of the second mass flow rate, at least 10 percent of the second mass flow rate, or at least 20 percent of the second mass flow rate. However, it can also be about 20 percent of the second mass flow rate. It can also be at most 20 percent or at most 25 percent of the second mass flow rate. The progression of the measuring curve is further observed until another characteristic change in the measuring curve arises. This characteristic change in the progression of the measuring curve can be a renewed rise in the gradient of the measuring curve. If this event is found, the flow of the process gas is turned off. The layers deposited with the method according to the invention or the use according to the invention can be transition metal dichalcogenides. In particular, it can be the material pairs mentioned in DE 10 2013 111 791 A1, wherein the process gases mentioned there can be used to deposit these materials. For this reason, the disclosure content of DE 10 2013 111 791 A1 is also incorporated into this application in its entirety. It is especially preferable that graphene, MoS<sub>2</sub>, MoSe<sub>2</sub>, WS<sub>2 </sub>or WSe<sub>2 </sub>or hBN be deposited. In order to deposit graphene, a hydrocarbon is used as the process gas, for example methane. W(CO)<sub>6 </sub>can be used for depositing tungsten compounds. A noble gas, for example argon, can be used as the carrier gas. However, it is also provided that borazine be used as the reactive gas while depositing hBN. In order to influence the growth rate, the process chamber height can be varied during deposition, i.e., the distance between the support surface of the susceptor and gas outlet surface. A sapphire substrate is preferably used as the substrate. However, silicon substrates or other substrates can also be used. According to the invention, it is possible to deposit two-dimensional layers, for example graphene, with only one reactive gas, for example borazine. However, it is also provided that the two-dimensional layers be deposited using two reactive gases, wherein one reactive gas contains the transition metal, and the other reactive gas contains a chalcogenide. In the case of sulfur, di-tert-butyl-sulfide is here preferably involved.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Exemplary embodiments of the invention will be described below based upon the attached drawings.
