Application Ser. No. 62/939,869, &#x201c;IRIDIUM-BASED AMORPHOUS ELECTROCATALYST FOR OXYGEN EVOLUTION REACTION AND SURFACTANT-ASSISTED ADAMS FUSION SYNTHESIS OF SAME,&#x201d; filed on Nov. 25, 2019, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Solid polymer electrolyte water electrolysis systems typically include a solid polymer electrolyte membrane that separates a cathode and an anode. Electrons are transported through an external circuit from the anode to the cathode. By controlling the applied potential, water can be electrochemically split to produce hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) via a hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>) via an oxygen evolution reaction.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In electrolysis systems, electrocatalysts are often used to expedite half-cell reactions. Compared with the hydrogen evolution reaction, the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction at the anode typically has been a major source of overpotential in the whole electrolyzer. Iridium has typically served as an active component for high-efficiency and robust oxygen evolution reaction. Nevertheless, there is a low abundance of iridium and the process of mining iridium is often arduous, such the price of iridium is quite high. For this reason, availability and cost of iridium is considered to be a major drawback for large scale applications of solid polymer electrolyte water electrolysis.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A large variety of synthesis methods have resulted in the presence of various iridium-based catalysts, ranging from homogeneous molecular catalysts to heterogeneous nanoparticles, films, or bulk catalysts. Catalytic activity of an iridium-based catalyst is strongly dependent on the structure of the iridium-containing compound, and the catalytic activity is, therefore, strongly dependent on the catalyst's synthesis procedure. Heterogeneous iridium-based catalysts comprise different types of amorphous, hydrous oxide materials as well as crystalline oxides such as perovskites, pyrochlores, or hollandites. Crystalline rutile iridium oxide (IrO<sub>2</sub>) has been widely used as an oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalyst. Rutile iridium oxide has exhibited high stability and a low dissolution rate, which is believed to be attributable to the formation of a dense and crystalline film with low electrolyte accessibility to the reaction interface. However, the compact crystalline layer leads to low overall mass activity since only the outer surface at the solid-liquid interface is available for the oxygen evolution reaction. Compared with rutile iridium oxide, few attempts have involved the use of amorphous iridium oxides even though amorphous iridium has been found to have higher oxygen evolution reaction activity because amorphous materials usually have severe stability issues due to enhanced dissolution rates of active metals during operation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Iridium-based oxides have been produced through a large variety of approaches. The Adams fusion method is a fast, convenient, and well-known way for large-scale production of uniform performance oxide powders. Unfortunately, oxides fabricated by the traditional Adams fusion method have not achieved satisfactory performance because the powders are known to undergo sintering and aggregation. Thermal decomposition is another well-known method of iridium oxide production, but it has typically resulted in poor control over the composition and microstructure, both of which are important for catalyst performance. Novel synthesis methods have been tried in an attempt to obtain better control over structure and to improve the properties of prepared iridium-based oxides. These newly developed methods have included solvothermal routes, soft/hard templates, magnetron sputtering, and liquid atomic layer deposition. Although many of these attempts have achieved good laboratory results, there has yet to be a satisfactory upscaling to large-scale industrial production, typically because of uncertainty and nonconformity of the formed particles.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure describes a process for fabricating an electrocatalyst, and in particular an iridium-based oxide particulate electrocatalyst with an amorphous structure that is suitable for high-efficiency and robust oxygen evolution reaction in both acidic and alkaline media. The electrocatalyst material described herein can be used on the anode side of a solid polymer electrolyte water electrolyzer, including in proton exchange membrane electrolysis systems and anion exchange membrane electrolysis systems. The process of the present disclosure allows for fine tuning of the final size, shape, and composition of the resulting iridium-based catalyst, which can improve iridium utilization and endurance with strong resistance to corrosion in both acid and alkaline conditions.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The procedure described herein is a modified version of the Adams fusion method. In an example, the Adams fusion method typically involves the formation of iridium-containing nitrates by reacting aqueous metallic precursors with alkaline-metal nitrate, and then calcination of the resulting reaction product in an oxygen/air environment at a temperature of from about 200&#xb0; C. to about 600&#xb0; C. In an example, the process includes adding a surfactant into the aqueous catalyst metal precursor prior to adding alkaline-metal nitrate. The surfactant molecules undergo microphase separation and can self-organize into aggregated micelles, which can serve as soft templates to control the formation of nanoparticles during synthesis.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings"

As will be appreciated by those having skill in the art, Adams fusion traditionally involves the formation of a metal-containing nitrate intermediate by reacting an aqueous metal precursor compound and an alkaline-metal nitrate. In the case of a process to form an iridium oxide, a typical Adams fusion process would react an aqueous iridium precursor with an alkaline metal nitrate to provide an Ir-containing nitrate. Next, the Adams fusion process typically comprises calcining the metal nitrate intermediate in an oxygen and air environment at a specified temperature to convert the metal nitrate intermediate to particulate metal oxide. While traditional Adams fusion has shown promising potential for the industrial production of fine metal oxide powder, oxides fabricated by the traditional method do not typically exhibit high catalytic performance because the particles usually experience serious sintering and particle aggregation during calcination.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0043">A primary difference between the process of the present disclosure compared to traditional Adams fusion is the addition of a surfactant compound into the aqueous metal precursor solution prior to its reaction with the alkaline metal nitrate to form the metal nitrate, e.g., the Ir nitrate intermediate in the case of the formation of Ir-based catalysts. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, the inventors believe that molecules of the surfactant compound undergo microphase separation within the aqueous precursor solution, which can, under certain conditions, self-organize into aggregated micelles. The self-organized micelles can then serve as soft templates to control the formation of the nitrate intermediate during reaction of the metal precursor with the alkaline nitrate and to control the formation of oxide particles during calcination.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flow diagram of an example process <b>100</b> of fabricating a metal-based catalyst material, and in particular an Ir-based catalyst material according to the present disclosure.

However, those having skill in the art will appreciate that a similar process can be used to form other metal oxide catalyst materials without varying from the scope of the present disclosure. For example, those having skill in the art will appreciate that a similar or identical process can be used to form other metal oxide particles (either doped or undoped), including, but not limited to, ruthenium (IV) oxide (RuO<sub>2</sub>), platinum oxide (PtO<sub>2</sub>), transition metal oxides (including, but not limited to, oxides of manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), gold (Au), silver (Ag), vanadium (V), molybdenum (Mo), rhodium (Rh), palladium (Pd), cadmium (Cd), tungsten (W), and rhenium (Re)), and combinations thereof.

The ratio of the Ir precursor compound relative to the 3d transition metal in the precursor solution can be selected to modulate the amount of the 3d transition metal present in the final catalyst particles, which in turn can modulate the chemisorption energy of oxygen onto or into the catalyst particle. As will be appreciated by those having skill in the art, the chemisorption energy of oxygen typically is a rate-limited parameter in OER catalysis. Therefore, doping the Ir-based catalyst with the 3d transition metal can enhance the effective utilization of the iridium, reduce the amount of iridium needed to achieve the same activity, and can tune the d-orbital distribution of iridium's 5d electrons to favor atomic oxygen adsorption (O<sub>ad</sub>), and possibly the adsorption of caboxyl oxygen (OOH<sub>ad</sub>), rather than the hydroxyl (OH<sub>ad</sub>) at the reaction interface.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0050">In an example, the doped Ir catalyst particles resulting from steps <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> have the general formula [2]:</p><p id="p-0060" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Ir<sub>X</sub>M<sub>1-x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>&#x2003;&#x2003;[2]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0061" num="0000">where x is a number more than 0 and less than 1, M includes at least one 3d transition metal (as defined above), and y is a number less than 2, depending on the specific 3d transition metal used and the metal oxidation state. In some examples, a value of x from about 0.1 to about 0.9, for example from about 0.4 to about 0.6, has been found to be particularly effective for the OER in SPEWEs.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0051">As described above, typically Ir-based catalysts have experienced stability problems during electrolysis due to the substantially continuous dissolution of Ir during operation. The doping of the 3d transition metal (M) into or onto the Ir-based particle can allow for some level of control over dissolution of the 3d transition metal over dissolution of the Ir active material during electrolysis, which in turn can allow the resulting catalyst particles to have a specified surface topography that more effectively exposes active Ir sites more efficiently and stably compared to comparable, non-doped Ir-based particles. The addition of the 3d transition metal has also been found to make it more likely that the final Ir-based material will be amorphous rather than crystalline or mixed crystal. Finally, the inventors also believe that the chemical reconstruction that takes place with the addition of the 3d transition metal dopant can lead to higher activity due to increased charge conductivity and improved adsorption of reaction <i>intermedia </i>during OER.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0052">In an example, the process <b>100</b> includes, at step <b>106</b>, adding a surfactant compound to the Ir precursor solution to provide an Ir precursor and surfactant mixture. In an example, the surfactant compound is added to the Ir precursor solution in an amount that is sufficient so that the surfactant undergoes microphase separation with the Ir precursor solution such that the surfactant self-organizes into aggregated micelles. In an example, the molar ratio of the surfactant compound relative to the combined concentration of the Ir and the 3d transition metal compound is from about 0.001 to about 0.5, for example about 0.01. However, the optimum ratio for a particular mixture can depend strongly on the specific surfactant compound used.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0053">The formation and aggregation of the micelles can be dispersed with, entrap, encapsulate, or attach to the nanoparticle matrix of the Ir-based compounds that are to form the catalyst particles, which can allow for the formation of Ir-based catalyst particles with well-defined shapes, size, physical state, and surface properties. As noted above, without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the inventors believe these aggregated micelles can serve as a soft template to control the formation of the iridium nitrate intermediate during the reaction step (step <b>110</b>, described below) and the formation of iridium oxide during the calcination step (step <b>114</b>, described below). It is also believed that the presence of surfactant can substantially alter the pathway of crystallization by the Ir oxide because the surfactant micelles lower barriers to nucleation due to a reduction in the interfacial free energy, which results in increased amounts of nucleation that efficiently prevents the formation of large-size crystallite and promotes the transition from crystalline to amorphous structure for the final Ir-based catalyst. The inventors have also found that the present of surfactant can suppress sintering and particle aggregation, even at calcination temperatures as high as 600&#xb0; C. Crystal growth by particle attachment is also well controlled, which prevents or minimizes bulk crystal formation. Instead, the resulting amorphous particles have higher electrocatalytic activity, ascribing to the structural flexibility and enhanced surface defects. It is also believed that the addition of surfactant aids surface control of the catalysts over structure and composition, which dominate the OER properties. Finally, the inventors have found that the presence of aggregated surfactant micelles result in a self-assembled organic layer that surrounds the Ir precursor during reaction to form the Ir nitrate, with the organic layer preventing or minimizing aggregation by the Ir precursor compound before reaction (step <b>110</b>, described below), aggregation by the Ir nitrate formed after reaction, or aggregation by the Ir oxide during calcination (step <b>114</b>, described below). The presence of the surfactant leads to the formation of catalyst particles with a smaller size and more controllable size range compared to particles formed without the use of the surfactant. In some examples, the micelles that are formed by the surfactant have a diameter of from about 10 nm to about 200 nm.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0054">In an example, the surfactant compound that is added to the Ir precursor solution in step <b>106</b> comprises an amphiphilic compound, i.e., a compound having both hydrophilic groups and hydrophobic groups. In an example, the amphiphilic surfactant comprises a compound with a hydrophilic end group (e.g., a hydrophilic head) and a hydrophobic body group (e.g., a hydrophobic tail). In a more specific example, the surfactant compound comprises a relatively long-chain molecule (e.g., a long-chain polymer) with hydrophilic groups at both ends and a hydrophobic middle group between the hydrophilic end groups. In an example, the surfactant molecules comprise a nonionic triblock copolymer (also referred to hereinafter as a &#x201c;TBP&#x201d;) comprising hydrophilic blocks at the ends of the polymer chain and a hydrophobic block between the hydrophilic end blocks, which can be described in a shorthand notation as &#x201c;a hydrophilic-hydrophobic-hydrophilic triblock polymer.&#x201d; or a &#x201c;hydrophilic-hydrophobic-hydrophilic TBP.&#x201d; In a specific example, the surfactant comprises a poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide) triblock polymer (also referred to hereinafter as a &#x201c;PEO-PPO-PEO TBP&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0055">The inventors have found that, surprisingly, the amount of the hydrophilic blocks (e.g., the PEO blocks in a PEO-PPO-PEO TBP) relative to the hydrophobic blocks (e.g., the PPO block in a PEO-PPO-PEO TBP) has a direct influence over the structure and stability of the resulting Ir-based catalyst particles. In particular, the inventors have found that as the ratio of the hydrophobic blocks relative to the hydrophilic blocks increases (e.g., when the relative amount of the PPO blocks in the surfactant molecules increases), it results in more well-defined and stable micelles during the aggregation portion of the process (described in more detail below). On the other hand, when the reverse occurs, i.e., when the ratio of the hydrophilic blocks relative to the hydrophobic blocks increases (e.g., when the relative amount of the PEO blocks in the surfactant molecules increases), it helps to achieve a greater number of surface cavities, e.g., a higher porosity in the Ir-based catalyst particles. Also, when the relative amount of the hydrophilic blocks is higher, water can be a good solvent for the surfactant compound at room temperature. In an example, the relative weight of the PEO blocks in a PEO-PPO-PEO TBP, is defined by Equation [3]:</p><p id="p-0067" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <msub>      <mi>W</mi>      <mi>PEO</mi>     </msub>     <mo>=</mo>     <mfrac>      <mrow>       <mi>wt</mi>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mtext>   </mtext>       <msub>        <mi>%</mi>        <mi>PEO</mi>       </msub>      </mrow>      <mrow>       <mrow>        <mi>wt</mi>        <mo>&#x2062;</mo>        <mtext>   </mtext>        <msub>         <mi>%</mi>         <mi>PEO</mi>        </msub>       </mrow>       <mo>+</mo>       <mrow>        <mi>wt</mi>        <mo>&#x2062;</mo>        <mtext>   </mtext>        <msub>         <mi>%</mi>         <mi>PPO</mi>        </msub>       </mrow>      </mrow>     </mfrac>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mo>[</mo>     <mn>3</mn>     <mo>]</mo>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0068" num="0000">where W<sub>PEO </sub>is defined as the relative weight of the PEO blocks in the PEO-PPO-PEO TBP, which is the target parameter, W %<sub>PEO </sub>is the percentage of the total weight of the TBP that is made up of the PEO blocks, and wt %<sub>PPO </sub>is the percentage of the total weight of the TBP that is made up of the PPO block.

In an example, the amphiphilic nature of the copolymer at a specified molecular concentration in the aqueous Ir precursor solution dominates the properties of the self-organized micelles, which in turn helps to control the structure of the Ir catalyst particles that will be synthesized by the process <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0058">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the surfactant is added after the 3d transition metal compound is added to the precursor solution (e.g., step <b>104</b> of adding the transition metal to the precursor solution is performed before step <b>106</b> where the surfactant is added to the same solution). However, those with skill in the art will appreciate that the order of adding the Ir precursor compound, the 3d transition metal precursor compound, and the surfactant is not important or limiting, and that these three components of the precursor solution can be added in any order that works best for the specific process being performed.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0059">In an example, the aggregation of the surfactant molecules can be at least partially controlled, e.g., at optional step <b>108</b>, by heating the metal precursor and surfactant mixture to an aggregation temperature between room temperature (e.g., from about 20&#xb0; C. to about 25&#xb0; C.) and the boiling point of water (e.g., 100&#xb0; C.), such as from about 40&#xb0; C. to about 99&#xb0; C., for example from about 50&#xb0; C. to about 98.5&#xb0; C., such as from about 60&#xb0; C. to about 95&#xb0; C. In an example, one or more of the specific surfactants used, the ratio of the surfactant relative to the Ir precursor, and the aggregation temperature are selected to achieve a specified size range for the iridium nitrate and iridium oxide particles that are subsequently formed in step <b>110</b> and step <b>114</b>, respectively (described below).
