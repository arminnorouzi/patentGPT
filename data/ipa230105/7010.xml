The technical parts are language-based keyword filtering and malware detection. Most companies that develop information security systems are trying to develop technologies to solve the corresponding security problems in a short time. Conventionally, a technology for detecting keywords and malware on the basis of a blacklist and the like is used in a way of analyzing, comparing, and blocking a technical method of an attack.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Since the blacklist technology requires a relatively short development period and brings about immediate effects, most mail security technologies are developed on the basis of a blacklist. However, the blacklist technology has a major drawback in that it is possible to neither detect nor block new methods and patterns.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Also, according to the technology for detecting and blocking keywords and malware, it is difficult to block new types of attacks because the attacks are not detected.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The number-one problem in recent email security is damage from mail impersonating government agencies or mail forged or altered as acquaintances. Mailing by impersonating, forging, or altering a mail sender makes a recipient receive or view the corresponding mail without doubt and thereby causes severe damage such as leakage of personal information or even financial damage.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, it is difficult for existing email security systems to detect and block phishing mail and forged or altered mail. This is because the content and attached files of recent phishing mail and forged or altered mail do not contain illegal content which is detectable by mail security systems in most cases. In this regard, the Korea Internet &#x26; Security Agency and information protection agencies merely recommend recipients to immediately delete phishing mail and forged or altered mail without viewing the content.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A more detailed description is as follows. All pieces of spam mail are sent by impersonated, forged, or altered senders. In the past, however, mail content and attached files were malicious and thus detected and blocked by mail security systems, which is not very problematic. For this reason, spammers continuously studied a new attack method and turned an email attack method to phishing mail, spear phishing, etc. When the phishing mail and the like is analyzed, there is no problematic content. However, when a recipient receives and clicks the mail, the recipient comes to achieve the purpose intended by the sender. To solve this problem, various mail security technologies for accurately checking email senders are being developed and applied internationally. Such mail security technologies include sender policy framework (SPF), domain keys identified mail (DKIM), domain-based message authentication (DMARC), etc. However, the currently developed technologies have a limitation that they work only when the same technology is applied to the sender and the recipient.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In other words, to apply the corresponding mail security technology, the corresponding mail security technology should be simultaneously applied to numerous mail systems all over the world, so messages can be smoothly delivered through mail. When the corresponding mail security technology is applied to only one side, mail cannot be received. Therefore, it is difficult to apply the corresponding technologies, and mail users are recommended not to receive unknown mail.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">For this reason, there is an increasing demand for the development of mail security technology for protecting well-intended mail users against phishing mail and forged or altered mail.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention is directed to providing phishing or forged or altered mail management method and system that use the psychology of a person who prevents people from finding himself or herself by disguising himself or herself by analyzing psychological characteristics of impersonated senders and forged or altered senders, that is, protect well-intended mail users against malicious senders by detecting and blocking impersonated senders and forged or altered senders using an error code which is developed to prevent outgoing mail of a mail system from being lost without being delivered.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">One aspect of the present invention provides a method of managing phishing or forged or altered mail, the method including, when mail is received in a mail account of a recipient mail server through a network, generating and transmitting, by a phishing or forged or altered mail management system interposed between the network and the recipient mail server, verification request information including content of the received mail and a sender mail address to the sender mail address of the received mail, when the verification request information is provided, checking, by a sender mail server of the sender mail address, whether the sender mail address included in the verification request information is valid and, when the sender mail address is invalid, returning an error code to the phishing or forged or altered mail management system, and when the error code is returned, blocking, by the phishing or forged or altered mail management system, the received mail.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Advantageous Effects</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention uses the psychology of a person who prevents people from finding himself or herself by disguising himself or herself by analyzing psychological characteristics of impersonated senders and forged or altered senders, that is, makes it possible to detect and block impersonated senders and forged or altered senders using an error code which is developed to prevent outgoing mail of a mail system from being lost.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In this way, according to the present invention, impersonated senders and forged or altered senders are determined, and outgoing mail of the senders is fundamentally blocked.

The receiving mail system is a mail system that can also send mail, and this is a generally-used common mail system. The sending mail system is a mail system that can only send mail and cannot receive mail. This mail system checks only a receiving side and transmits mail without checking a sender or a sending mail system. The sending mail system is used for sending a large amount of advertising mail or spam mail, forged or altered mail, phishing mail, etc.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Therefore, the present invention checks an error code indicating a situation in which it is impossible to receive outgoing mail to determine whether the mail is forged or altered and whether the mail is phishing mail.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In general mail systems, when it is impossible to receive outgoing mail, the following error code is returned to the sender.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">&#x3e;421 Server too busy; Receiving-side server response delay; A situation in which mail cannot be received due to traffic of the receiving server and the like.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">&#x3e;421 Microsoft ESMTP MAIL Service, Version: 5.0.2195.5600 ready at Service not available, closing transmission channel; A situation in which mail cannot be received due to a simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) server failure of Microsoft (MS).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">&#x3e;441 4.4.1 No answer from host; A message returned because there is no response from a receiving server.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">&#x3e;441 4.4.0 DNS resolving error; A message returned because the domain of a receiving server is not found.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">&#x3e;451 4.3.0 Other or undefined mail system status; A case in which a receiving-side mail system has a different protocol or is not a receiving SMTP server.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">&#x3e;451 4.3.0 Temporary system failure.

A phishing or forged or altered mail management system according to the present invention detects and blocks mail of which a sender is impersonated or forged or altered using the above error codes.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">More specifically, a sender who is impersonated or forged or altered cannot receive mail that is sent by the phishing or forged or altered mail management system and includes verification request information. This is because the sender impersonates, forges, or alters an originating mail address. Such impersonation, forgery, or alteration may be classified into some cases.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In a first case, all pieces of information including the mail account, mail server, etc. of a sender to be impersonated are falsely used. In a second case, only the sender is impersonated, and a send-only mail server, which is a private mail server, is used for a mail account and mail server. In a third case, a mail account and mail server are created to be similar to the mail account and mail server of an existing sender and used, that is, the mail account and mail server of a sender are forged or altered so that a recipient cannot accurately distinguish the sender.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Therefore, according to the present invention, every time mail for a recipient-side mail server is received, mail including verification request information is transmitted to a sender side, and when an error code or verification information is returned from the sender side, it is determined whether the mail is phishing or forged or altered mail according to the error code or verification information such that the mail is blocked.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In other words, in the first phishing case, mail including verification request information is not sent to an impersonating sender but to a user who is impersonated. Accordingly, the impersonated user is able to recognize that his or her mail account has been falsely used, and verification information indicating that the mail account has been falsely used is returned in response to the verification request information such that the corresponding mail is blocked according to the verification information.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In the second phishing case, an originating mail account is falsely used, and thus mail including verification request information cannot find the originating mail account. Accordingly, an error code is returned to the phishing mail management system. When the error code is received, the phishing or forged or altered mail management system blocks the corresponding mail.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the third forged or altered case, a sender uses a private mail server (a send-only mail server) and thus cannot receive a verification value.
