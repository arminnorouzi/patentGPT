Also, in reality, the thickness of the slab becomes thinner each time the slab passes through the rolling mill; however, the slabs are shown as having substantially the same thickness in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to eliminate complexity of illustration.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0021">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the rolling system <b>20</b> includes continuous casting equipment <b>21</b>, and rolling equipment connected to the continuous casting equipment <b>21</b>. In the example, the rolling equipment includes a rough rolling mill <b>22</b>, a finishing rolling mill <b>23</b>, and a coiler <b>24</b>. The example shows a configuration example of a hot rolling system; and the post processes of the finishing rolling include a runout table <b>28</b>. The runout table <b>28</b> cools the material after the finishing rolling.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0022">The rolling system <b>20</b> includes multiple cutters. Three cutters are used in the example. The multiple cutters are not limited to three; it is sufficient to provide two or more cutters. A first cutter is an upstream cutter <b>81</b>. The upstream cutter <b>81</b> is located between the continuous casting equipment <b>21</b> and the rough rolling mill <b>22</b>. A second cutter is an intermediate cutter <b>82</b>. The intermediate cutter <b>82</b> is located between the rough rolling mill <b>22</b> and the finishing rolling mill <b>23</b>. A third cutter is a downstream cutter <b>83</b>. The downstream cutter <b>83</b> is located between the finishing rolling mill <b>23</b> and the coiler <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0023">In the example, the upstream cutter <b>81</b> cuts a slab <b>1</b> dispatched from the continuous casting equipment <b>21</b> to a length corresponding to the length of the product. The cut slab <b>2</b> is transferred into the rough rolling mill <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0024">The intermediate cutter <b>82</b> performs crop cutting of the front end and the tail end of the rough-rolled slab <b>3</b>. The crop-cut slab <b>3</b> is transferred into the downstream cutter <b>83</b> after passing through the finishing rolling mill <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0025">The downstream cutter <b>83</b> further cuts the slab based on the difference between the length of the slab set according to the production schedule and the length of the slab cut by the upstream cutter <b>81</b>. The cut slab is taken up by the coiler <b>24</b>. The taken-up slab forms a coil. According to the length that is cut by the upstream cutter <b>81</b>, there are also cases where the downstream cutter <b>83</b> does not cut the slab. For example, the uncut slab is taken up as-is by the coiler <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0026">In the following description of the configuration and the operations, the cutting position control device determines whether or not to cause the downstream cutter <b>83</b> to further cut the slab <b>2</b> that is cut by the upstream cutter <b>81</b>, and sets the cutting position of the slab when cut by the downstream cutter <b>83</b>, which are described in detail. In the example, the intermediate cutter <b>82</b> is not directly related to the determination of the cutting position and/or the correction operation of the cutting position for the upstream cutter <b>81</b> and the downstream cutter <b>83</b> because the intermediate cutter <b>82</b> is used for the crop cutting of the front end and the tail end. A detailed description of the intermediate cutter <b>82</b> is therefore omitted. In such a case, the cutting control of the intermediate cutter <b>82</b> is easily realized by using well-known feed distance measurement technology of the field of rolling systems.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0027">Multiple sensors are provided in the rolling system <b>20</b> to detect the positions and feed distances of the slabs <b>1</b> to <b>3</b> that are fed. In the example, the multiple sensors are HMDs <b>84</b>, <b>85</b>, <b>87</b>, and <b>89</b> and PLGs <b>86</b>, <b>88</b>, and <b>90</b>. The HMDs <b>84</b>, <b>85</b>, <b>87</b>, and <b>89</b> are detectors (Hot Metal Detectors, HMDs) that detect heat rays. A camera for detecting visible light and/or infrared, etc., may be utilized instead of a heat ray detection-type detector.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0028">The PLGs <b>86</b>, <b>88</b>, and <b>90</b> are detectors that measure movement distances. The PLGs <b>86</b>, <b>88</b>, and <b>90</b> are, for example, pulse generator-type counters, etc. The PLGs <b>86</b> and <b>90</b> are located at table rolls, etc., and output pulses according to the rotational speeds of the table rolls; and the movement distance of the slab fed over the table rolls is calculated by counting the output pulses. The PLG <b>87</b> is located at a rolling mill roll of the mill of the final stage of the finishing rolling mill <b>23</b>. The movement distance of the rolled slab is calculated by the PLG <b>87</b> while the rolling mill roll of the final stage mill discharges the rolled slab <b>3</b>. Methods other than a pulse generator-type counter may be utilized as long as the movement distance of the slab can be measured.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0029">The HMD <b>84</b> detects heat rays of the slab <b>1</b> dispatched from the continuous casting equipment <b>21</b>. The HMD <b>84</b> is located frontward of the upstream cutter <b>81</b> at the dispatch side of the continuous casting equipment <b>21</b>. The HMD <b>84</b> detects the position of the front end of the slab <b>1</b> cast by the continuous casting equipment <b>21</b>. The HMD <b>84</b> generates and outputs a signal TP<b>1</b>. The HMD <b>84</b> transitions the output signal TP<b>1</b> to active when the HMD <b>84</b> detects the front end of the slab <b>1</b>. For example, setting the signal to active refers to the HMD <b>84</b> outputting the signal TP<b>1</b>=&#x201c;0&#x201d; before detecting the front end of the slab <b>1</b> and transitioning the signal TP<b>1</b> to &#x201c;1&#x201d; when the slab <b>1</b> is detected. The timing of transitioning the signal from &#x201c;0&#x201d; to &#x201c;1&#x201d; is the timing of detecting the front end of the slab <b>1</b>. Instead of the description recited above, the timing of transitioning the signal from &#x201c;1&#x201d; to &#x201c;0&#x201d; may be the timing of detecting the front end of the slab <b>1</b>; in such a case, the logic of the active signal is &#x201c;0&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0030">The HMD <b>85</b> detects the heat rays of the slab <b>2</b> cut by the upstream cutter <b>81</b>. The HMD <b>85</b> is located between the upstream cutter <b>81</b> and the rough rolling mill <b>22</b>. The HMD <b>85</b> outputs the signal TP<b>2</b>. When the HMD <b>85</b> detects the front end of the slab <b>2</b>, the HMD <b>85</b> transitions the signal TP<b>2</b> to active; when the HMD <b>85</b> detects the passage of the tail end of the slab <b>2</b>, the HMD <b>85</b> transitions the signal TP<b>2</b> to inactive.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0031">The PLG <b>86</b> is a pulse generator-type counter that measures the movement distance of the slab <b>2</b> cut by the upstream cutter <b>81</b>. The PLG <b>86</b> is located between the upstream cutter <b>81</b> and the rough rolling mill <b>22</b>. In the example, the PLG <b>86</b> is located at one of the table rolls located along the pass line. The table roll at which the PLG <b>86</b> is located is located between the upstream cutter <b>81</b> and the rough rolling mill <b>22</b>. The PLG <b>86</b> outputs the pulse signal PC<b>2</b> according to the rotational speed of the table roll. The pulse signal PC<b>2</b> that is output is transmitted to a process control device, summed, and counted; and the feed distance of the slab <b>2</b> is calculated. The feed distance of the slab <b>2</b> measured by the PLG <b>86</b> is used to determine the length of the slab <b>2</b>. Although the determination of the length of the slab <b>2</b> is elaborated below, the cutting position control device determines whether or not the cutting position of the slab <b>2</b> is according to the initial setting.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0032">The HMD <b>87</b> is located between the finishing rolling mill <b>23</b> and the downstream cutter <b>83</b>. In the example, the runout table <b>28</b> is located between the finishing rolling mill <b>23</b> and the downstream cutter <b>83</b>; therefore, the HMD <b>87</b> is located between the finishing rolling mill <b>23</b> and the runout table <b>28</b>. The HMD <b>87</b> detects the front end and the tail end of the slab <b>3</b> rolled by the finishing rolling mill <b>23</b> by detecting the heat rays of the slab <b>3</b>. When the HMD <b>87</b> detects the front end of the slab <b>3</b>, the HMD <b>87</b> transitions the signal TP<b>3</b> to active; and when the HMD <b>87</b> detects the passage of the tail end of the slab, the HMD <b>87</b> transitions the signal TP<b>3</b> to inactive.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0033">The PLG <b>88</b> measures the movement distance of the slab <b>3</b> rolled by the finishing rolling mill <b>23</b>. In the example, the PLG <b>88</b> is located at a rolling mill roll of the final stage mill of the finishing rolling mill <b>23</b>. The PLG <b>88</b> may be located at a table roll at the dispatch side of the finishing rolling mill <b>23</b>. The PLG <b>88</b> outputs the pulse signal PC<b>3</b> according to the rotation of the rolling mill roll. The pulse signal PC<b>3</b> is transmitted to the process control device, summed, and counted; and the feed distance of the slab <b>3</b> is calculated.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0034">The HMD <b>89</b> and the PLG <b>90</b> are located between the downstream cutter <b>83</b> and the coiler <b>24</b>. The HMD <b>89</b> detects the front end and the tail end of the slab <b>3</b> passing through the downstream cutter <b>83</b>.
