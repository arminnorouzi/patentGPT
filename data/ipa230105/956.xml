Specifically, the antidote may be factor Xa (fXa) derivatives having reduced or lacking intrinsic procoagulant activity but are also capable of binding and/or neutralizing fXa inhibitors thereby acting as antidotes to anticoagulants targeting fXa. The invention is also related to methods of using the particular dose of antidote.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Anticoagulants serve a need in the marketplace in treatment or prevention of undesired thrombosis in patients with a tendency to form blood clots, such as, for example, those patients having clotting disorders, confined to periods of immobility or undergoing medical surgeries. One of the major limitations of anticoagulant therapy, however, is the bleeding risk associated with the treatments, and limitations on the ability to rapidly reverse the anticoagulant activity in case of overdosing or if an urgent surgical procedure is required. Thus, specific and effective antidotes to all forms of anticoagulant therapy are highly desirable. For safety considerations, it is also advantageous to have an anticoagulant-antidote pair in the development of new anticoagulant drugs.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Currently available anticoagulant-antidote pairs for over-anticoagulation are heparin&#x2014;protamine and warfarin&#x2014;vitamin K. Fresh frozen plasma and recombinant factor VIIa (rfVIIa) have also been used as non-specific antidotes in patients under low molecular weight heparin treatment, suffering from major trauma or severe hemorrhage. (Lauritzen, B. et al., <i>Blood, </i>2005, 607A-608A.) Also reported are protamine fragments (U.S. Pat. No. 6,624,141) and small synthetic peptides (U.S. Pat. No. 6,200,955) as heparin or low molecular weight heparin antidotes; and thrombin muteins (U.S. Pat. No. 6,060,300) as antidotes for thrombin inhibitor. Prothrombin intermediates and derivatives have been reported as antidotes to hirudin and synthetic thrombin inhibitors (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,817,309 and 6,086,871).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One promising form of anticoagulant therapy targets factor Xa (fXa), and in fact, several direct fXa inhibitors are currently in different stages of clinical development for use in anticoagulant therapy. One direct fXa inhibitor Xarelto&#x2122; (rivaroxaban) has been approved for clinical use in the European Union and Canada for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in orthopedic surgery patients. Many of these are small molecules. While these new fXa inhibitors show promise for treatment, specific and effective antidotes are still needed. In case of over-anticoagulation or requirement for surgery in patients treated with these fXa inhibitors, an agent may be required to substantially neutralize the administered fXa inhibitor or inhibitors and restore normal hemostasis.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Currently available agents, such as recombinant factor VIIa (rfVIIa), are mechanistically limited and not specific for reversal of fXa inhibitors and thus improved options for the clinician are highly desirable. In human studies, rfVIIa has been used to reverse the effect of indirect antithrombin III dependent fXa inhibitors such as fondaparinux and idraparinux (Bijsterveld, N R et al., <i>Circulation, </i>2002, 106:2550-2554; Bijsterveld, N R et al., <i>British J. of Haematology, </i>2004(124): 653-658). The mechanism of action of factor VIIa (fVIIa) is to act with tissue factor to convert factor X (fX) present in blood circulation to fXa to restore normal hemostasis in patients. This mode of action necessarily dictates that the highest potential concentration of fXa that could be attained to neutralize active site directed fXa inhibitors is limited by the circulating plasma concentration of fX. Thus the potential of using rfVIIa to reverse the effect of direct fXa inhibitors is mechanistically limited. Since the circulating plasma concentration of fX is 150 nanomolar (&#x201c;nM&#x201d;), the maximal amount of fXa produced by this mode would be 150 nM. Reported therapeutic concentrations of small molecule fXa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban have been higher (approximately 600 nM, Kubitza D, et al., <i>Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol., </i>2005, 61:873-880) than the potential amount of fXa generated by rfVIIa. Use of rfVIIa for reversal of therapeutic or supratherapeutic levels of anticoagulation by fXa inhibitor would therefore provide inadequate levels of efficacy. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, using rfVIIa has limited effect in neutralizing the anticoagulant activity of a factor Xa inhibitor betrixaban (described below). Recombinant fVIIa showed a dose responsive antidote activity from 50 nM to 100 nM, but the effect leveled off between 100 nM to 200 nM, indicating that its antidote effect is limited by factors other than its concentration. In all of the rfVIIa concentrations tested, betrixaban still showed a dose responsive inhibition of fXa, up to about 75% inhibition at a concentration of 250 nM. This observation is consistent with fVIIa's proposed mechanism of action. This is also supported by studies showing that rfVIIa did not completely reverse the inhibitory effect of fondaparinux on the parameters of thrombin generation and prothrombin activation. (Gerotiafas, G T, et al., <i>Thrombosis </i>&#x26; <i>Haemostasis </i>2204(91):531-537).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Exogenous active fXa cannot be administered directly to a subject in a way similar to rfVIIa. Unlike rfVIIa, which has very low procoagulant activity in the absence of its cofactor tissue factor, native fXa is a potent enzyme and has a potential risk of causing thrombosis. Thus, the use of either rfVIIa or active fXa as an antidote to a fXa anticoagulant therapy has disadvantages.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Antidotes employed in the formulations and methods of the invention are described in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2009-0098119.

The modified derivatives of fXa proteins do not compete with fXa in assembling into the prothrombinase complex, but instead bind and/or substantially neutralize the anticoagulants, such as fXa inhibitors. The derivatives useful as antidotes are modified to reduce or remove intrinsic procoagulant and anticoagulant activities, while retaining the ability to bind to the inhibitors. It is contemplated that the derivatives of the invention may include modifying the active site, or changing or removing the entire Gla domain from fXa, or various combinations thereof. It is further contemplated that modification of the Gla domain reduces or removes the anticoagulant effect of the fXa derivative on normal hemostasis because an active site modified full length fXa is known to be an anticoagulant.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment, the invention is directed to a unit dose formulation comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a two chain polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 13 or a polypeptide having at least 80% homology to SEQ ID NO. 13, in an amount from about 10 milligrams to about 2 grams.

SEQ ID NO. 1 is the amino acid sequence of human fX coded by the nucleotide sequence of human fX (SEQ ID NO. 2) as shown in Table 14 known in the prior art. For example, the translated amino acid sequence is reported in Leytus et al., <i>Biochem., </i>1986, 25, 5098-5102 and can be found in GenBank, &#x201c;NM_000504&#x201d; at &#x3c;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/viewer.fcgi?db=nuccore&#x26;id=89142731&#x3e;. The amino acid numbering in this sequence is based on fX sequence. Human fX precursor (SEQ ID NO. 1) contains a prepro-leader sequence (amino acids 1 to 40 of SEQ ID NO. 1) followed by sequences corresponding to the fX light chain (LC) (amino acids 41 to 179 of SEQ ID NO. 1), the RKR (SEQ ID NO. 16) triplet (amino acids 180 to 182 of SEQ ID NO. 1) which is removed during fX secretion, and the fX heavy chain (amino acids 183 to 488 of SEQ ID NO. 1) containing the activation peptide (AP) (amino acids 183 to 234 of SEQ ID NO. 1) and the catalytic domain (amino acids 235 to 488 of SEQ ID NO. 1).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> (SEQ ID NO. 3) shows the amino acid sequence of mature human factor X. The amino acid numbering in this figure is based on mature fX sequence starting from the N-terminal of fX light chain. Factor X circulates in plasma as a two-chain molecule linked by a disulfide bond. The light chain (LC) has 139 amino acid (amino acids 41 through 179 of SEQ ID NO. 1) residues and contains the &#x3b3;-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)-rich domain (amino acids 1-45 of SEQ ID NO. 3), including a short aromatic stack (AS) (amino acids 40-45 of SEQ ID NO. 3), followed by two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains (EGF1: amino acids 46-84, EGF2: amino acids 85-128 of SEQ ID NO. 3).

Chymotrypic digestion of fXa results in a Gla-domainless fXa lacking the 1-44 amino acid residues (SEQ ID NO. 4).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the effect of varying concentrations of rfVIIa in the presence of tissue factor on the anticoagulant activity of a fXa inhibitor betrixaban (described below) in a thrombin generation (expressed as relative fluorescence units (RFU) assay (as described in Example 2)) using PPP prepared samples. The data show that a combination of rfVIIa and tissue factor was unable to completely neutralize the anticoagulant activity of a fXa inhibitor, betrixaban, in concentrations up to 250 nM.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows that anhydro-fXa (SEQ ID NO: 20) with its Gla-domain intact reverses fXa inhibition by betrixaban in a purified system containing active fXa and betrixaban (open circle), while anhydro-fXa (SEQ ID NO: 20) alone has negligible procoagulant activity (open triangle) compared with active fXa. FXa chromogenic activity was normalized to active fXa in the absence of any inhibitor (open square). This is more thoroughly described in Example 4.

Factor Xa is activated by either factor IXa with its cofactor, factor VIIIa, in a complex known as intrinsic Xase, or factor VIIa with its cofactor, tissue factor, in a complex known as extrinsic Xase. fXa forms a membrane-bound prothrombinase complex with factor Va and is the active component in the prothrombinase complex that catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin is the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, which ultimately leads to blood clot formation. Thus, the biological activity of fXa is sometimes referred to as &#x201c;procoagulant activity&#x201d; herein.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0081">The nucleotide sequence coding human factor X (&#x201c;fX&#x201d;) can be found in GenBank, &#x201c;NM_000504&#x201d; at &#x3c;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/viewer.fcgi?db=nuccore&#x26;id=89142731&#x3e;, and is listed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>and SEQ ID No. 2. The corresponding amino acid sequence and domain structure of fX are described in Leytus et al., <i>Biochemistry, </i>1986, 25:5098-5102. The domain structure of mature fX is also described in Venkateswarlu, D. et al., <i>Biophysical Journal, </i>2002, 82:1190-1206. Upon catalytic cleavage of the first 52 residues (amino acids 143 to 194 of SEQ ID NO. 3) of the heavy chain, fX is activated to fXa (SEQ ID NO. 6). FXa contains a light chain (SEQ ID NO. 8) and a heavy chain (SEQ ID NO. 9). The first 45 amino acid residues (residues 1-45 of SEQ ID NO. 6) of the light chain is called the Gla domain because it contains 11 post-translationally modified &#x3b3;-carboxyglutamic acid residues (Gla). It also contains a short (6 amino acid residues) aromatic stack sequence (residues 40-45 of SEQ ID NO. 6). Chymotrypsin digestion selectively removes the 1-44 residues resulting in Gla-domainless fXa (SEQ ID NO. 4). The serine protease catalytic domain of fXa locates at the C-terminal heavy chain. The heavy chain of fXa is highly homologous to other serine proteases such as thrombin, trypsin, and activated protein C.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0082">The domain structure of mature factor X may be found in Venkateswarlu D. et al., <i>Biophysical J., </i>2002, 82, 1190-1206, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The term includes naturally occurring polypeptides isolated from tissue samples as well as recombinantly produced fXa. &#x201c;Active fXa&#x201d; refers to fXa having the biological activity of activating prothrombin. &#x201c;Active fXa&#x201d; may be a native fXa or modified fXa that retains procoagulant activity.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0084">&#x201c;fXa Derivatives&#x201d; or &#x201c;modified fXa&#x201d; or &#x201c;derivatives of a factor Xa protein&#x201d; refers to fXa proteins that have been modified such that they bind, either directly or indirectly, to a factor Xa inhibitor and do not assemble into the prothrombinase complex. Structurally, the derivatives are modified to provide either no procoagulant activity or reduced procoagulant activity. &#x201c;Procoagulant activity&#x201d; is referred to herein as an agent's ability to cause blood coagulation or clot formation. Reduced procoagulant activity means that the procoagulant activity has been reduced by at least about 50%, or more than about 90%, or more than about 95% as compared to wild-type fXa during the same time period. For example, recombinant fX-S395A essentially has no procoagulant activity as measured by in vitro assays, such as fXa activity assays.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0085">The derivatives have either modified active sites or modified Gla domains or both. Additional modifications are also contemplated. It is contemplated that such modifications may be made in one or more of the following ways: deletion of one or more of the amino acid from the sequence, substitution of one or more amino acid residues with one or more different amino acid residues, and/or manipulation of one or more amino acid side chains or its &#x201c;C&#x201d; or &#x201c;N&#x201d; terminals.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0086">The term &#x201c;active site&#x201d; refers to the part of an enzyme or antibody where a chemical reaction occurs.

When a position in the compared sequence is occupied by the same base or amino acid, then the molecules are homologous at that position. A degree of homology between sequences is a function of the number of matching or homologous positions shared by the sequences.

Structurally, liposomes range in size and shape from long tubes to spheres, with dimensions from a few hundred Angstroms to fractions of a millimeter. Vesicle-forming lipids are selected to achieve a specified degree of fluidity or rigidity of the final complex providing the lipid composition of the outer layer. These are neutral (cholesterol) or bipolar and include phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and sphingomyelin (SM) and other types of bipolar lipids including but not limited to dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), with a hydrocarbon chain length in the range of 14-22, and saturated or with one or more double C&#x2550;C bonds. Examples of lipids capable of producing a stable liposome, alone, or in combination with other lipid components are phospholipids, such as hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholine (HSPC), lecithin, phosphatidylethanolamine, lysolecithin, lysophosphatidylethanol-amine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, sphingomyelin, cephalin, cardiolipin, phosphatidic acid, cerebrosides, distearoylphosphatidylethan-olamine (DSPE), dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (POPE) and dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine 4-(N-maleimido-methyl)cyclohexane-1-carb-oxylate (DOPE-mal).

Typically, liposomes can be divided into three categories based on their overall size and the nature of the lamellar structure. The three classifications, as developed by the New York Academy Sciences Meeting, &#x201c;Liposomes and Their Use in Biology and Medicine,&#x201d; December 1977, are multi-lamellar vesicles (MLVs), small uni-lamellar vesicles (SUVs) and large uni-lamellar vesicles (LUVs).</p><p id="p-0143" num="0139">A &#x201c;micelle&#x201d; is an aggregate of surfactant molecules dispersed in a liquid colloid. A typical micelle in aqueous solution forms an aggregate with the hydrophilic &#x201c;head&#x201d; regions in contact with surrounding solvent, sequestering the hydrophobic tail regions in the micelle center. This type of micelle is known as a normal phase micelle (oil-in-water micelle). Inverse micelles have the head groups at the center with the tails extending out (water-in-oil micelle). Micelles can be used to attach a polynucleotide, polypeptide, antibody or composition described herein to facilitate efficient delivery to the target cell or tissue.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0140">The phrase &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable polymer&#x201d; refers to the group of compounds which can be conjugated to one or more polypeptides described here.

Such methods include a variety of well-known techniques such as vector-mediated gene transfer (by, e.g., viral infection/transfection, or various other protein-based or lipid-based gene delivery complexes) as well as techniques facilitating the delivery of &#x201c;naked&#x201d; polynucleotides (such as electroporation, &#x201c;gene gun&#x201d; delivery and various other techniques used for the introduction of polynucleotides). The introduced polynucleotide may be stably or transiently maintained in the host cell. Stable maintenance typically requires that the introduced polynucleotide either contains an origin of replication compatible with the host cell or integrates into a replicon of the host cell such as an extrachromosomal replicon (e.g., a plasmid) or a nuclear or mitochondrial chromosome. A number of vectors are known to be capable of mediating transfer of genes to mammalian cells, as is known in the art and described herein.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0143">A &#x201c;viral vector&#x201d; is defined as a recombinantly produced virus or viral particle that comprises a polynucleotide to be delivered into a host cell, either in vivo, ex vivo or in vitro. Examples of viral vectors include retroviral vectors, adenovirus vectors, adeno-associated virus vectors, alphavirus vectors and the like. Alphavirus vectors, such as Semliki Forest virus-based vectors and Sindbis virus-based vectors, have also been developed for use in gene therapy and immunotherapy. See, Schlesinger and Dubensky (1999) Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 5:434-439 and Ying, et al. (1999) Nat. Med. 5(7):823-827. In aspects where gene transfer is mediated by a retroviral vector, a vector construct refers to the polynucleotide comprising the retroviral genome or part thereof, and a therapeutic gene. As used herein, &#x201c;retroviral mediated gene transfer&#x201d; or &#x201c;retroviral transduction&#x201d; carries the same meaning and refers to the process by which a gene or nucleic acid sequences are stably transferred into the host cell by virtue of the virus entering the cell and integrating its genome into the host cell genome. The virus can enter the host cell via its normal mechanism of infection or be modified such that it binds to a different host cell surface receptor or ligand to enter the cell. As used herein, retroviral vector refers to a viral particle capable of introducing exogenous nucleic acid into a cell through a viral or viral-like entry mechanism.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0144">Retroviruses carry their genetic information in the form of RNA; however, once the virus infects a cell, the RNA is reverse-transcribed into the DNA form which integrates into the genomic DNA of the infected cell.

Adenoviruses (Ads) are a relatively well characterized, homogenous group of viruses, including over 50 serotypes. See, e.g., International PCT Application No. WO 95/27071. Ads do not require integration into the host cell genome. Recombinant Ad derived vectors, particularly those that reduce the potential for recombination and generation of wild-type virus, have also been constructed. See, International PCT Application Nos.

Such vectors are capable of transcribing RNA in vitro or in vivo, and are commercially available from sources such as Stratagene (La Jolla, Calif.) and Promega Biotech (Madison, Wis.). In order to optimize expression and/or in vitro transcription, it may be necessary to remove, add or alter 5&#x2032; and/or 3&#x2032; untranslated portions of the clones to eliminate extra, potential inappropriate alternative translation initiation codons or other sequences that may interfere with or reduce expression, either at the level of transcription or translation.

In addition to the delivery of polynucleotides to a cell or cell population, direct introduction of the proteins described herein to the cell or cell population can be done by the non-limiting technique of protein transfection, alternatively culturing conditions that can enhance the expression and/or promote the activity of the proteins of this invention are other non-limiting techniques.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0148">The phrase &#x201c;solid support&#x201d; refers to non-aqueous surfaces such as &#x201c;culture plates&#x201d; &#x201c;gene chips&#x201d; or &#x201c;microarrays.&#x201d; Such gene chips or microarrays can be used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes by a number of techniques known to one of skill in the art.

They can be easily distinguished through a membrane-bound nucleus. Animals, plants, fungi, and protists are eukaryotes or organisms whose cells are organized into complex structures by internal membranes and a cytoskeleton. The most characteristic membrane-bound structure is the nucleus. A eukaryotic host, including, for example, yeast, higher plant, insect and mammalian cells, or alternatively from a prokaryotic cells as described above.

Additionally, instead of having chromosomal DNA, these cells' genetic information is in a circular loop called a plasmid. Bacterial cells are very small, roughly the size of an animal mitochondrion (about 1-2 &#x3bc;m in diameter and 10 &#x3bc;m long). Prokaryotic cells feature three major shapes: rod shaped, spherical, and spiral. Instead of going through elaborate replication processes like eukaryotes, bacterial cells divide by binary fission.

The human antibodies of the invention may include amino acid residues not encoded by human germline immunoglobulin sequences (e.g., mutations introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo). However, the term &#x201c;human antibody&#x201d; as used herein, is not intended to include antibodies in which CDR sequences derived from the germline of another mammalian species, such as a mouse, have been grafted onto human framework sequences. Thus, as used herein, the term &#x201c;human antibody&#x201d; refers to an antibody in which substantially every part of the protein (e.g., CDR, framework, C<sub>L</sub>, C<sub>H </sub>domains (e.g., C<sub>H1</sub>, C<sub>H2</sub>, C<sub>H3</sub>), hinge, (VL, VH)) is substantially non-immunogenic in humans, with only minor sequence changes or variations. Similarly, antibodies designated primate (monkey, baboon, chimpanzee, etc.), rodent (mouse, rat, rabbit, guinea pig, hamster, and the like) and other mammals designate such species, sub-genus, genus, sub-family, family specific antibodies. Further, chimeric antibodies include any combination of the above. Such changes or variations optionally and preferably retain or reduce the immunogenicity in humans or other species relative to non-modified antibodies. Thus, a human antibody is distinct from a chimeric or humanized antibody. It is pointed out that a human antibody can be produced by a non-human animal or prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell that is capable of expressing functionally rearranged human immunoglobulin (e.g., heavy chain and/or light chain) genes. Further, when a human antibody is a single chain antibody, it can comprise a linker peptide that is not found in native human antibodies. For example, an Fv can comprise a linker peptide, such as two to about eight glycine or other amino acid residues, which connects the variable region of the heavy chain and the variable region of the light chain. Such linker peptides are considered to be of human origin.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0155">As used herein, a human antibody is &#x201c;derived from&#x201d; a particular germline sequence if the antibody is obtained from a system using human immunoglobulin sequences, e.g., by immunizing a transgenic mouse carrying human immunoglobulin genes or by screening a human immunoglobulin gene library. A human antibody that is &#x201c;derived from&#x201d; a human germline immunoglobulin sequence can be identified as such by comparing the amino acid sequence of the human antibody to the amino acid sequence of human germline immunoglobulins. A selected human antibody typically is at least 90% identical in amino acids sequence to an amino acid sequence encoded by a human germline immunoglobulin gene and contains amino acid residues that identify the human antibody as being human when compared to the germline immunoglobulin amino acid sequences of other species (e.g., murine germline sequences). In certain cases, a human antibody may be at least 95%, or even at least 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical in amino acid sequence to the amino acid sequence encoded by the germline immunoglobulin gene. Typically, a human antibody derived from a particular human germline sequence will display no more than 10 amino acid differences from the amino acid sequence encoded by the human germline immunoglobulin gene. In certain cases, the human antibody may display no more than 5, or even no more than 4, 3, 2, or 1 amino acid difference from the amino acid sequence encoded by the germline immunoglobulin gene.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0156">A &#x201c;human monoclonal antibody&#x201d; refers to antibodies displaying a single binding specificity which have variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences.

Such recombinant human antibodies have variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. In certain embodiments, however, such recombinant human antibodies can be subjected to in vitro mutagenesis (or, when an animal transgenic for human Ig sequences is used, in vivo somatic mutagenesis) and thus the amino acid sequences of the VH and VL regions of the recombinant antibodies are sequences that, while derived from and related to human germline VH and VL sequences, may not naturally exist within the human antibody germline repertoire in vivo. Methods to making these antibodies are described herein.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0158">As used herein, &#x201c;isotype&#x201d; refers to the antibody class (e.g., IgM or IgG1) that is encoded by heavy chain constant region genes.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0159">The terms &#x201c;polyclonal antibody&#x201d; or &#x201c;polyclonal antibody composition&#x201d; as used herein refer to a preparation of antibodies that are derived from different B-cell lines.

The term also includes sequences conjugated to the polynucleotide that will provide a signal upon expression of the inserted sequences, such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the like. The label may be detectable by itself (e.g. radioisotope labels or fluorescent labels) or, in the case of an enzymatic label, may catalyze chemical alteration of a substrate compound or composition which is detectable. The labels can be suitable for small scale detection or more suitable for high-throughput screening. As such, suitable labels include, but are not limited to radioisotopes, fluorochromes, chemiluminescent compounds, dyes, and proteins, including enzymes. The label may be simply detected or it may be quantified. A response that is simply detected generally comprises a response whose existence merely is confirmed, whereas a response that is quantified generally comprises a response having a quantifiable (e.g., numerically reportable) value such as an intensity, polarization, and/or other property. In luminescence or fluorescence assays, the detectable response may be generated directly using a luminophore or fluorophore associated with an assay component actually involved in binding, or indirectly using a luminophore or fluorophore associated with another (e.g., reporter or indicator) component.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0162">Examples of luminescent labels that produce signals include, but are not limited to bioluminescence and chemiluminescence.

It is contemplated that the antidotes of the present invention will be useful in reversing the anticoagulant effect of a fXa inhibitor, especially an active site-directed small molecule inhibitor.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0186">It is contemplated that an antidote to a fXa inhibitor has reduced or no procoagulant activity but is capable of binding with a fXa inhibitor. It is contemplated that such limited activity permits dosing of the antidote at a level greater than the circulating wild-type fXa. Certain fXa derivatives, such as des-Gla fXa and Gla-deficient fXa, are suitable antidotes of this invention. Besides having reduced or diminished procoagulant activity, antidotes of the present invention should also be substantially non-immunogenic to the subject. An antidote may contain a combination of two or more of the above mutations and/or modifications. In addition, any of the above fXa derivatives may be administered alone or in combination with one another.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0187">Factor Xa is a serine protease in the blood coagulation pathway responsible for converting prothrombin to thrombin. It is produced from the inactive factor X upon activation by either the intrinsic Xase (complex formed by factor IXa with its cofactor, factor VIIIa) or the extrinsic Xase (complex formed by factor VIIa with its cofactor, tissue factor). Activated fX (fXa) may undergo further autocatalytic cleavage at the C-terminal of its heavy chain, converting fXa&#x3b1; to the subform fXa&#x3b2; (Jesty, J et al. <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>1975, 250(12):4497-4504). Both fXa&#x3b1; and fXa&#x3b2; are suitable materials for the present invention. fXa itself converts prothrombin at a slow rate that is not sufficient for supporting coagulation. Only when it forms a prothrombinase complex with cofactors Ca<sup>2+</sup>, phospholipid, and factor Va, fXa can activate prothrombin at a rate rapid enough to support coagulation (Skogen, W. F., et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>1984, 259(4):2306-10). The complex requires binding between the negatively charged phospholipid and &#x3b3;-carboxyglutamic acid residues in the Gla domain of fXa via Ca<sup>2+</sup> bridging.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0188">Therefore, although the Gla domain does not contain the active site of fXa, it enables fXa to form the prothrombinase complex through the &#x3b3;-carboxyglutamic acid residues. This is demonstrated by selective removal of fXa Gla-domain by chymotrypsin digestion (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> and Example 1). Clotting assays were performed on fXa during the time course of cleavage of the Gla domain by chymotrypsin digestion. It has been reported (Skogen et al. J. Biol. Chem. 1984, 259(4):2306-10) that a reconstituted prothrombinase complex comprising of Gla-domainless fXa, fVa, phospholipids and calcium ions produces thrombin at a significantly reduced rate (0.5% product generated compared to control complex containing native fXa). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, fXa's activity in clot formation was partially reduced after the fXa was digested by chymotrypsin for 15 minutes and the activity was completely lost after 30 minutes of digestion. Undercarboxylated or decarboxylated fXa, which lack the appropriate gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues required for calcium ion dependent membrane binding, have thus been found to be incapable of membrane dependent coagulation complex assembly and not support blood clotting (Mann, K G et al., <i>Blood, </i>1990, 76: 1-16).</p><p id="p-0194" num="0189">It has also been established that Gla-domain deficient fXa is capable of binding active site-directed inhibitors of fXa. (Brandstetter, H et al, <i>J. Bio. Chem., </i>1996, 271:29988-29992). There have been reports of crystallography of small molecule fXa inhibitor bound to des-Gla human fXa, which have provided structural description of the active site cleft (Brandstetter, <i>J. Bio. Chem., </i>1996, 271:29988-29992 and Roehrig, <i>J. Med. Chem. </i>2005, 48(19):5900-8). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows that a des-Gla anhydro-fXa (SEQ ID NO:10) exhibited a binding affinity of 0.319 nM with a fXa inhibitor betrixaban, comparable to that of native fXa.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0190">It has now been discovered that des-Gla fXa, and other fXa derivatives that have reduced procoagulant activity but are capable of fXa inhibitor binding, can be used as an antidote to a fXa inhibitor. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the des-Gla anhydro-fXa (SEQ ID NO:10) exhibited complete reversion of betrixaban's anticoagulant activity at a concentration of 680 nM. As detailed in Example 2, the thrombin generation was initiated by adding TF-containing reagent (Innovin) and, thus, indicative of coagulation factors function in the extrinsic coagulation pathway. It has also been demonstrated in Examples 9-13, that the recombinant antidote is useful to reverse a wide variety of anticoagulants.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0191">Clotting prolongation assays with the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) reagent (Actin FS) that determine the function of the coagulation factor in the intrinsic coagulation pathway also indicate that the des-Gla anhydro-fXa (SEQ ID NO:10) possess antidote activity. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows the dose responsive antidote effect of des-Gla anhydro-fXa (SEQ ID NO:10) against 250 nM of betrixaban, with complete reversion at 600 nM. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows that des-Gla anhydro-fXa (SEQ ID NO:10) was also capable of reversing the anticoagulant activity of another fXa inhibitor, enoxaparin. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows that des-Gla anhydro-fXa (SEQ ID NO:10) did not exhibit significant antidote activity against a direct thrombin inhibitor argatroban. Thus, the des-Gla anhydro-fXa (SEQ ID NO:10) is a selective antidote for fXa inhibitors and is capable of restoring fXa procoagulant activity initiated either by the extrinsic or the intrinsic pathway.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0192">Further, the antidote activity of des-Gla anhydro-fXa (SEQ ID NO:10) was demonstrated by the aPTT prolongation assays measured with a traditional coagulation timer. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, des-Gla anhydro-fXa (SEQ ID NO:10) itself has no effect on aPTT of control plasma at the highest concentrations tested (2576 nM). 400 nM of betrixaban extended aPTT more than two folds. This anti-coagulant effect of betrixaban is reversed by des-Gla anhydro-fXa (SEQ ID NO:10) in a dose-responsive manner, with return of aPTT to near normal level of control plasma at antidote concentrations higher than 1610 nM.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0193">It is contemplated that further truncations at the fXa light chain, for example, additional deletion of the EGF1 domain, EGF1 plus EGF2 domains, or fragments thereof, and inactive fXa with only the heavy chain may be useful antidotes of this invention.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0194">Gla-domain deficient fXa does not support normal coagulation under physiologically relevant concentration. However, the protein has the ability of cleaving many substrates and causing clotting at higher concentrations. For example, Skogen et al. (Skogen, W. F., et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>1984, 259(4):2306-10) showed that bovine des-Gla fXa has about 0.5-1.0% prothrombinase complex activity relative to the wild type fXa. Thus, modifications that further reduce or completely eliminate a fXa derivative's procoagulant activity is contemplated by methods of the invention. Such modification may be, for example, in a fXa's catalytic domain.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0195">Several ways of modifying the catalytic domain in the fXa heavy chain to reduce its procoagulant activity are contemplated. The active site residue 5379 of fXa (as shown in SEQ ID No. 7), for example, can be selectively replaced by dehydro-alanine (see Example 1) or alanine (see Example 6) to reduce or eliminate the procoagulant activity. It is also known that complex formation between fXa and a reagent targeting fXa's exosite may block the macromolecular binding ability of fXa, thus reducing its procoagulant activity while retaining small molecule binding ability in the active site. This exosite targeting reagent includes, without limitation, monoclonal antibodies targeting a region removed from the active site (Wilkens, M and Krishnaswamy, S, <i>J. Bio. Chem., </i>2002, 277 (11), 9366-9374), or &#x3b1;-2-macroglobulin. It has been known that the &#x3b1;-2-macroglobulin-serine protease complex, such as with trypsin, thrombin or fXa, is capable of binding small molecule substrates (Kurolwa, K. et al., <i>Clin. Chem. </i>1989, 35(11), 2169-2172).</p><p id="p-0201" num="0196">It is also known that an inactive fXa with modifications solely in the heavy chain while keeping its light chain unchanged would act as an inhibitor of prothrombinase (Hollenbach, S. et al., Thromb. Haemost., 1994, 71(3), 357-62) because it interferes with procoagulant activity of normal fXa as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. Therefore, in one embodiment, the fXa derivative has modifications both in the light chain and heavy chain. It has been discovered that these modifications reduce or eliminate both procoagulant and anticoagulant activities while retaining the inhibitors binding ability of the fXa derivative.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0197">Several methods can be used to produce Gla-domain deficient fXa derivatives or other fXa derivatives described herein. For example, the Gla-domain may be completely removed via chymotryptic cleavage, producing Gla-domainless fXa. Alternatively, a Gla-domainless fX may be produced by chymotryptic cleavage of native fX. The Gla-domainless fX may then be converted to Gla-domainless fXa by a fX activator. fX may be isolated from plasma of the same or a different species as the subject to be treated. Bovine fX, for example, has been shown to be functional in human plasma assays. Examples of a fX activator include, without limitation, a snake venom, such as Russell's viper venom, and complexes of fVIIa/tissue factor or fIXa/fVIIIa. Such means is known to a person of skill in the art. For example, Rudolph A. E. et al. has reported a recombinant fXa produced from a recombinant factor X (fX) with a single substitution of Arg347 by Glutamine (fXR347N) (<i>Biochem. </i>2000, 39 (11): 2861-2867). In one embodiment, the fXa derivatives produced from non-human sources are non-immunogenic or substantially non-immunogenic. Example 7 also provides a method of producing a recombinant antidote having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 12.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0198">The fXa derivatives may also be purified from human plasma, or may be produced by recombinant DNA method where an appropriate gene for the fXa derivative is expressed in a suitable host organism. Expression and purification of recombinant fXa has been reported by several groups, see, e.g., Larson, P. J., et al., <i>Biochem., </i>1998, 37:5029-5038, and Camire, R. M., et al., <i>Biochem., </i>2000, 39, 14322-14329 for producing recombinant fX; Wolf, D. L. et al., <i>J. Bio. Chem., </i>1991, 266(21):13726-13730 for producing recombinant fXa. Modified fXa may be prepared according to these procedures using a genetically modified cDNA having a nucleotide sequence encoding the desired fXa mutant. Example 6 gives more details for direct expression of a Gla-domainless fXa-S379 mutant with functional activity as an antidote.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0199">It is contemplated that active-site mutated or modified fXa with deficient Gla-domain, such as under-carboxylated fXa, may also be useful as fXa inhibitor antidote. Under-carboxylated fXa may be prepared by recombinant means by withholding vitamin K derivatives during protein expression (vitamin K derivatives are needed for post translational modification to form the Gla residues) or by adding vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin during tissue culture. Decarboxylated fXa can be prepared by heating (Bajaj P., <i>J. Biol. Chem., </i>1982, 257(7):3726-3731) or by proteolytic digestion by chymotrypsin (Morita T., et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem., </i>1986, 261(9):4015-4023). The antidote may also be generated in prokaryotic systems followed by in vitro refolding or constitution of the fXa inhibitor binding site.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0200">The Gla residues can also be chemically modified to remove the carboxyl group responsible for calcium ion dependent membrane binding. For example, the carboxyl groups on the Gla residues may be selectively removed under decarboxylation conditions or may be capped, for example, by esterification or amination. It is desirable that such esterification or amination be resistant to in vivo hydrolysis so that the modified fXa is not readily converted to active fXa, which may cause thrombosis.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0201">Other mutants or derivatives of fXa may also be useful antidotes of this invention. In one embodiment, this invention encompasses use of mutants described in Peter J. Larson et al., <i>Biochem., </i>1998, 37:5029-5038 as fXa inhibitor antidotes.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0202">In another embodiment, this invention encompasses use of catalytically inactive fXa mutants to prepare fXa inhibitor antidotes. For example, mutants described in Sinha, U., et al., <i>Protein Expression and Purif., </i>1992, 3:518-524 rXai, mutants with chemical modifications, such as dehydro-alanine (anhydro fXa), as described in Nogami, et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>1999, 274(43):31000-7. FXa with active site serine (Ser379 in fX numbering as shown in SEQ ID NO. 7, and Ser195 in chymotrypsin numbering) replaced with alanine (fXa-5379A in fX numbering, or aa-S195A in chymotrypsin numbering), where the procoagulant activity was eliminated, may also be used as fXa inhibitor antidotes. The invention also envisions fXa derivatives with the active site serine residue irreversibly acylated which is still capable of binding small molecule inhibitors. FXa with the active site serine reversibly acylated has been reported by Wolf, et al., <i>Blood, </i>1995, 86(11):4153-7. Such reversible acylation, however, is capable of time dependent production of active fXa and may lead to an excess of active fXa over a time period. The deacylation rate may be reduced by strategies similar to those described in Lin P. H. et al., <i>Thrombosis Res., </i>1997, 88(4), 365-372. For example, fXa molecules with Ser379 (Ser195 in chymotrypsin numbering) acylated by 4-methoxybenzyl and 3-bromo-4-methoxybenzyl groups recover less than 50% of their original activity when incubated in a buffer having pH 7.5 at 37&#xb0; C. for 4 hours.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0203">One embodiment is directed to the use of fXa derivatives with mutations at fXa residues known to be important for fXa interaction with cofactor fV/fVa. Such residues include, without limitation, Arg306, Glu310, Arg347, Lys351, or Lys414 (SEQ ID NOS. 3 and 7, these amino acids correspond to Arg125, Glu129, Arg165, Lys169, Lys230 in the chymotrypsin numbering). Examples of such mutants are reported in Rudolph, A. E. et al., <i>J. Bio. Chem., </i>2001, 276:5123-5128. In addition, mutations at fXa residues known to be important for fVIII/fVIIIa interaction, such as Arg424 in SEQ ID NOS. 3 and 7 (Arg240 in chymotrypsin numbering), may also be used as fXa inhibitor antidotes. Examples of such mutants are described in Nogami, K. et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem., </i>2004, 279(32):33104-33113.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0204">Other modification of active site residues of fXa or residues known to be important for serine protease interactions may also lead to useful antidotes of this invention, for example, replacement of Glu216, Glu218, and Arg332 in SEQ ID NOS. 3 and 7 (Glu37, Glu39, and Arg150 in chymotrypsin numbering, respectively) with other amino acid residues.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0205">In one embodiment, the residual procoagulant activity of an antidote, as assessed by amidolytic substrate cleavage assay, be &#x3c;1%, preferably &#x3c;0.1%, more preferably &#x3c;0.05% of human plasma derived native fXa. For example, there is no measurable procoagulant activity for recombinant fXa-S379A when the active site Ser379 (S195 in chymotrypsin numbering) is replaced by an alanine residue as measured by clotting assays.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0206">The invention further relates to nucleic acid sequences, in particular DNA sequences, which code for the fXa derivatives described above. These can easily be determined by translating the polypeptide sequence back into the corresponding DNA sequence in accordance with the genetic code. Codons preferably used are those which lead to good expression in the required host organism. The nucleic acid sequences can be prepared either by site-specific mutagenesis starting from the natural fXa gene sequence or else by complete DNA synthesis.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Polypeptides of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0212" num="0207">In certain aspects, the invention is related to an isolated polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 13 or 15.

This can be accomplished by methods of recombinant DNA technology known to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, this invention also provides methods for recombinantly producing the polypeptides of this invention in a eukaryotic or prokaryotic host cells. The proteins and polypeptides of this invention also can be obtained by chemical synthesis using a commercially available automated peptide synthesizer such as those manufactured by Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems, Inc., Model 430A or 431A, Foster City, Calif., USA. The synthesized protein or polypeptide can be precipitated and further purified, for example by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Accordingly, this invention also provides a process for chemically synthesizing the proteins of this invention by providing the sequence of the protein and reagents, such as amino acids and enzymes and linking together the amino acids in the proper orientation and linear sequence.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0209">It is known to those skilled in the art that modifications can be made to any peptide to provide it with altered properties. Polypeptides of the invention can be modified to include unnatural amino acids. Thus, the peptides may comprise D-amino acids, a combination of D- and L-amino acids, and various &#x201c;designer&#x201d; amino acids (e.g., &#x3b2;-methyl amino acids, C-&#x3b1;-methyl amino acids, and N-&#x3b1;-methyl amino acids, etc.) to convey special properties to peptides. Additionally, by assigning specific amino acids at specific coupling steps, peptides with &#x3b1;-helices, &#x3b2; turns, &#x3b2; sheets, &#x3b1;-turns, and cyclic peptides can be generated. Generally, it is believed that &#x3b1;-helical secondary structure or random secondary structure is preferred.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0210">In a further embodiment, subunits of polypeptides that confer useful chemical and structural properties will be chosen. For example, peptides comprising D-amino acids may be resistant to L-amino acid-specific proteases in vivo. Modified compounds with D-amino acids may be synthesized with the amino acids aligned in reverse order to produce the peptides of the invention as retro-inverso peptides. In addition, the present invention envisions preparing peptides that have better defined structural properties, and the use of peptidomimetics, and peptidomimetic bonds, such as ester bonds, to prepare peptides with novel properties. In another embodiment, a peptide may be generated that incorporates a reduced peptide bond, i.e., R<sub>1</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>NH&#x2014;R<sub>2</sub>, where R<sub>1</sub>, and R<sub>2 </sub>are amino acid residues or sequences. A reduced peptide bond may be introduced as a dipeptide subunit. Such a molecule would be resistant to peptide bond hydrolysis, e.g., protease activity. Such molecules would provide ligands with unique function and activity, such as extended half-lives in vivo due to resistance to metabolic breakdown, or protease activity. Furthermore, it is well known that in certain systems constrained peptides show enhanced functional activity (Hruby (1982) Life Sciences 31:189-199 and Hruby et al.

These biotin-binding proteins contain four binding sites that can interact with biotin in solution or be covalently attached to another molecule. (See Wilchek (1988) Anal. Biochem. 171:1-32). Peptides can be modified to possess biotin groups using common biotinylation reagents such as the N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester of D-biotin (NHS-biotin) which reacts with available amine groups on the protein. Biotinylated peptides then can be incubated with avidin or streptavidin to create large complexes.

An siRNA can be 100% identical to the target sequence. However, homology of the siRNA sequence to the target sequence can be less than 100% as long as the siRNA can hybridize to the target sequence. Thus, for example, the siRNA molecule can be at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% identical to the target sequence or the complement of the target sequence. Therefore, siRNA molecules with insertions, deletions or single point mutations relative to a target may also be used. The generation of several different siRNA sequences per target mRNA is recommended to allow screening for the optimal target sequence. A homology search, such as a BLAST search, should be performed to ensure that the siRNA sequence does not contain homology to any known mammalian gene.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0232">In general, it is preferable that the target sequence be located at least 100-200 nucleotides from the AUG initiation codon and at least 50-100 nucleotides away from the termination codon of the target mRNA (Duxbury (2004) J.

As a general guide, siRNAs that include one or more of the following conditions are particularly useful in gene silencing in mammalian cells: GC ratio of between 45-55%, no runs of more than 9 G/C residues, G/C at the 5&#x2032; end of the sense strand; A/U at the 5&#x2032; end of the antisense strand; and at least 5 A/U residues in the first 7 bases of the 5&#x2032; terminal of the antisense strand.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0234">siRNA are, in general, from about 10 to about 30 nucleotides in length.

When an siRNA contains two strands of different lengths, the longer of the strands designates the length of the siRNA.

As used herein, the term &#x201c;operatively linked&#x201d; means positioned in such a manner that the promoter will direct transcription of RNA off the DNA molecule. Examples of such promoters are SP6, T4 and T7. In certain embodiments, cell-specific promoters are used for cell-specific expression of the inserted polynucleotide. Vectors which contain a promoter or a promoter/enhancer, with termination codons and selectable marker sequences, as well as a cloning site into which an inserted piece of DNA can be operatively linked to that promoter are well known in the art and commercially available.

It is implied that these expression vectors must be replicable in the host organisms either as episomes or as an integral part of the chromosomal DNA. Suitable expression vectors include plasmids, viral vectors, including adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses, retroviruses, cosmids, etc. Adenoviral vectors are particularly useful for introducing genes into tissues in vivo because of their high levels of expression and efficient transformation of cells both in vitro and in vivo. When a nucleic acid is inserted into a suitable host cell, e.g., a prokaryotic or a eukaryotic cell and the host cell replicates, the protein can be recombinantly produced. Suitable host cells will depend on the vector and can include mammalian cells, animal cells, human cells, simian cells, insect cells, yeast cells, and bacterial cells as described above and constructed using well known methods. See Sambrook and Russell (2001), supra. In addition to the use of viral vector for insertion of exogenous nucleic acid into cells, the nucleic acid can be inserted into the host cell by methods well known in the art such as transformation for bacterial cells; transfection using calcium phosphate precipitation for mammalian cells; DEAE-dextran; electroporation; or microinjection.

Several methodologies exist for production of polyclonal antibodies. For example, polyclonal antibodies are typically produced by immunization of a suitable mammal such as, but not limited to, chickens, goats, guinea pigs, hamsters, horses, mice, rats, and rabbits. An antigen is injected into the mammal, which induces the B-lymphocytes to produce IgG immunoglobulins specific for the antigen. This IgG is purified from the mammals serum. Variations of this methodology include modification of adjuvants, routes and site of administration, injection volumes per site and the number of sites per animal for optimal production and humane treatment of the animal. For example, adjuvants typically are used to improve or enhance an immune response to antigens. Most adjuvants provide for an injection site antigen depot, which allows for a slow release of antigen into draining lymph nodes. Other adjuvants include surfactants which promote concentration of protein antigen molecules over a large surface area and immunostimulatory molecules. Non-limiting examples of adjuvants for polyclonal antibody generation include Freund's adjuvants, Ribi adjuvant system, and Titermax.

The MAP system utilizes a peptidyl core of three or seven radially branched lysine residues, on to which the antigen peptides of interest can be built using standard solid-phase chemistry. The lysine core yields the MAP bearing about 4 to 8 copies of the peptide epitope depending on the inner core that generally accounts for less than 10% of total molecular weight. The MAP system does not require a carrier protein for conjugation. The high molar ratio and dense packing of multiple copies of the antigenic epitope in a MAP has been shown to produce strong immunogenic response. This method is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,229,490 and is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0256">Other suitable methods of producing or isolating antibodies of the requisite specificity can be used, including, but not limited to, methods that select recombinant antibody from a peptide or protein library (e.g., but not limited to, a bacteriophage, ribosome, oligonucleotide, RNA, cDNA, or the like, display library; e.g., as available from various commercial vendors such as Cambridge Antibody Technologies (Cambridgeshire, UK), MorphoSys (Martinsreid/Planegg, Del.), Biovation (Aberdeen, Scotland, UK) Biolnvent (Lund, Sweden), using methods known in the art.

For example, Cramer et al. (1999) Curr. Top. Microbol. Immunol. 240:95-118 and references cited therein, describe the production of transgenic tobacco leaves expressing large amounts of recombinant proteins, e.g., using an inducible promoter. Transgenic maize have been used to express mammalian proteins at commercial production levels, with biological activities equivalent to those produced in other recombinant systems or purified from natural sources.

Chimeric antibodies are those in which the various domains of the antibodies' heavy and light chains are coded for by DNA from more than one species. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0264">Alternatively, the antibodies of this invention can also be modified to create veneered antibodies. Veneered antibodies are those in which the exterior amino acid residues of the antibody of one species are judiciously replaced or &#x201c;veneered&#x201d; with those of a second species so that the antibodies of the first species will not be immunogenic in the second species thereby reducing the immunogenicity of the antibody. Since the antigenicity of a protein is primarily dependent on the nature of its surface, the immunogenicity of an antibody could be reduced by replacing the exposed residues which differ from those usually found in another mammalian species antibodies. This judicious replacement of exterior residues should have little, or no, effect on the interior domains, or on the interdomain contacts. Thus, ligand binding properties should be unaffected as a consequence of alterations which are limited to the variable region framework residues. The process is referred to as &#x201c;veneering&#x201d; since only the outer surface or skin of the antibody is altered, the supporting residues remain undisturbed.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0265">The procedure for &#x201c;veneering&#x201d; makes use of the available sequence data for human antibody variable domains compiled by Kabat et al. (1987) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 4th ed., Bethesda, Md., National Institutes of Health, updates to this database, and other accessible U.S. and foreign databases (both nucleic acid and protein). Non-limiting examples of the methods used to generate veneered antibodies include EP 519596; U.S. Pat. No. 6,797,492; and described in Padlan et al. (1991) Mol.

(See for example, EP 404,097; WO 93/11161; and Hollinger et al., (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-6448.) By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. (See also, U.S. Pat. No. 6,632,926 to Chen et al. which discloses antibody variants that have one or more amino acids inserted into a hypervariable region of the parent antibody and a binding affinity for a target antigen which is at least about two fold stronger than the binding affinity of the parent antibody for the antigen.)</p><p id="p-0272" num="0267">The term &#x201c;antibody derivative&#x201d; further includes &#x201c;linear antibodies&#x201d;. The procedure for making linear antibodies is known in the art and described in Zapata et al. (1995) Protein Eng. 8(10):1057-1062.

It also is possible to determine without undue experimentation, whether an antibody has the same specificity as the monoclonal antibody of this invention by determining whether the antibody being tested prevents a monoclonal antibody of this invention from binding the protein or polypeptide with which the monoclonal antibody is normally reactive. If the antibody being tested competes with the monoclonal antibody of the invention as shown by a decrease in binding by the monoclonal antibody of this invention, then it is likely that the two antibodies bind to the same or a closely related epitope. Alternatively, one can pre-incubate the monoclonal antibody of this invention with a protein with which it is normally reactive, and determine if the monoclonal antibody being tested is inhibited in its ability to bind the antigen. If the monoclonal antibody being tested is inhibited then, in all likelihood, it has the same, or a closely related, epitopic specificity as the monoclonal antibody of this invention.</p><p id="p-0276" num="0271">The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; also is intended to include antibodies of all isotypes.

Herlyn, et al. (1986) Science 232:100. An anti-idiotypic antibody is an antibody which recognizes unique determinants present on the monoclonal antibody produced by the hybridoma of interest.</p><p id="p-0278" num="0273">Idiotypic identity between monoclonal antibodies of two hybridomas demonstrates that the two monoclonal antibodies are the same with respect to their recognition of the same epitopic determinant. Thus, by using antibodies to the epitopic determinants on a monoclonal antibody it is possible to identify other hybridomas expressing monoclonal antibodies of the same epitopic specificity.</p><p id="p-0279" num="0274">It is also possible to use the anti-idiotype technology to produce monoclonal antibodies which mimic an epitope. For example, an anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody made to a first monoclonal antibody will have a binding domain in the hypervariable region which is the mirror image of the epitope bound by the first monoclonal antibody. Thus, in this instance, the anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody could be used for immunization for production of these antibodies.</p><p id="p-0280" num="0275">In some aspects of this invention, it will be useful to detectably or therapeutically label the antibody.

In this aspect, the derivative comprises at least amino acid residues 40 to 448, 45 to 448, or 46 to 448 of SEQ ID NO. 3 or equivalents thereof. In another aspect, the derivative comprises at least amino acid residues 45 to 139 and 195 to 448 or 46 to 139 and 195-448 of SEQ ID NO. 3 or equivalents thereof.</p><p id="p-0289" num="0284">In another aspect of the invention, the fXa derivative retains the three dimensional structure of the active site of the fXa protein. Information regarding the three-dimensional structure of the des-Gla fXa may be found in Brandstetter, H et al. J. Bio. Chem., 1996, 271:29988-29992.</p><p id="p-0290" num="0285">In another aspect of the invention, the fXa derivatives may lack the Gla domain as well as either one of the two EGF domains. In another aspect of the invention, the fXa derivatives are completely lacking the light chain. Other modifications of the heavy chain may comprise the catalytic domain of related serine proteases which are capable of binding inhibitors. The related serine proteases have catalytic domains which possess sufficient structural similarity to fXa catalytic domain and are therefore capable of binding small molecule fXa inhibitors. Examples of related serine proteases include, but are not limited to, mammalian proteases such as plasma kallikrein, thrombin and trypsin or the bacterial protease subtilisin. These derivatives further include modifications at the amino acids residues equivalent to the active site serine (SER379) or aspartic acid (ASP282) residues described herein.</p><p id="p-0291" num="0286">In some embodiments, the factor Xa protein with reduced procoagulant activity comprises a modified light chain, wherein the modification is substitution, addition or deletion of the Gla-domain to reduce the phospholipid membrane binding of fXa. In some embodiments, the prime amino acid sequence of fXa is not changed, but the side chain of certain amino acids has been changed. Examples of the modified Gla-domain that reduces the phospholipid membrane binding of fXa comprises polypeptides or proteins having the primary amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 3 or an equivalent thereof, with at least one amino acid substitution, addition, or deletion as compared to the Gla-domain of a wild type human factor Xa protein. In some embodiments, at least one amino acid being substituted or deleted is a &#x3b3;-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla). Gla residues are shown in SEQ ID NO. 3 at amino acid positions 6, 7, 14, 16, 19, 20, 25, 26, 29, 32, and 39. In some embodiments, the antidote's primary amino acid sequence is identical to SEQ ID NO. 3 or equivalent thereof, but is an uncarboxylated, undercarboxylated or decarboxylated factor Xa protein. In some embodiments, the antidote is a des-Gla anhydro-fXa (SEQ ID NO:10) or des-Gla fX-5379A. In some embodiments, the factor Xa protein with reduced phospholipid membrane binding further comprises modification or deletion of the EGF1 and/or EGF2 (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> as amino acids 46 to 84 and 85 to 128, respectively) or a part, i.e. fragment of the EGF1 and/or EGF2 domains. In some embodiments, the entire light chain or substantially the entire light chain is modified or removed. For example, the modified fXa protein with reduced phospholipid membrane binding may contain only the heavy chain or the modified fXa may contain the heavy chain and a fragment of the light chain that contains Cys132, the amino acid residue that forms the single disulfide bond with Cys302 of the heavy chain in SEQ ID NO. 3. In some embodiments, the derivative comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 10 or SEQ ID NO. 11. In some embodiments, the derivative is the two chain polypeptide comprising SEQ ID NO. 13. In other embodiments, the derivative is the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO. 15.</p><p id="p-0292" num="0287">In some embodiments, the factor Xa protein derivative comprises a modified heavy chain that contains the catalytic domain of said factor Xa protein. In some embodiments, at least one amino acid substitution is present at one or more amino acid position of fXa selected from the group consisting of Glu216, Glu218, Arg332, Arg347, Lys351, and Ser379 in SEQ ID NOS. 3 and 7 (Glu37, Glu39, Arg150, Arg165, Lys169, and Ser195 in chymotrypsin numbering, respectively). In some embodiments, the antidote is a factor Xa protein with active site serine (Ser379 in SEQ ID NOS. 3 and 7, Ser195 in chymotrypsin numbering) residue modified to dehydro-alanine or alanine. Such modifications may be made to wild type fXa protein or to any of the modified fXa proteins or fragments described above. For example, the des-Gla anhydro-fXa (SEQ ID NO:10) with active site serine residues replaced by dehydro-alanine described in Example 1 has shown antidote activity.</p><p id="p-0293" num="0288">In other embodiments, the derivative has reduced interaction with ATIII, cofactors fV/fVa and fVIII/fVIIIa as compared to wild-type or naturally occurring factor Xa. In some embodiments, at least one amino acid substitution is present at amino acid position Arg306, Glu310, Arg347, Lys351, Lys414 or Arg424 in SEQ ID NOS. 3 and 7 (Arg125, Glu129, Arg165, Lys169, Lys230 or Arg240 in chymotrypsin numbering, respectively). Such modifications may be made to wild type fXa protein or to any of the modified fXa proteins or fragments described above.</p><p id="p-0294" num="0289">In other embodiments, the antidote is a protein comprising the amino acid sequence of a serine protease catalytic domain which can mimic the inhibitor binding capability of the fXa heavy chain. Such proteins may include mammalian proteases such as plasma kallikrein, thrombin, trypsin (or its bacterial homolog subtilisin) which have been recombinantly modified to lack serine protease activity capable of cleaving protein substrates but still possess the structural characteristics of the active site cleft.</p><p id="p-0295" num="0290">Also provided by this invention are pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more of the modified factor Xa derivatives and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compositions are administered to a subject in need thereof in an amount that will provide the desired benefit, a reduction or stopping of bleeding. The compositions can be co-administered with any suitable agent or therapy that complements or enhances the activity of the factor Xa derivative. An example of such is a second agent capable of extending the plasma half-life of the antidote. Examples of suitable second agents include but are not limited to an anti-fXa antibody recognizing the exosite of fXa heavy chain or an alpha-2-macroglobulin bound fXa derivative. Formation of the complex between fXa derivative and a second agent (exo site antibody or alpha-2-macroglobulin) would block macromolecular interactions but retains the ability of active site dependent inhibitor bindings. Examples of anti-fXa antibodies suitable for co-administration include but are not limited to those described in Yang Y. H., et al., <i>J. Immunol. </i>2006, 1; 177(11):8219-25, Wilkens, M and Krishnaswamy, S., <i>J. Bio. Chem., </i>2002, 277 (11), 9366-9374, and Church W R, et al., <i>Blood, </i>1988, 72(6), 1911-1921.</p><p id="p-0296" num="0291">In some embodiments, a factor Xa protein is modified by chemical, enzymatic or recombinant means. For example, the active site Ser379 may be chemically modified to dehydroalanine, and the Gla domain may be enzymatically removed by chymotrypsin digestion as described in Example 1. A modified fXa described herein may also be produced by recombinant means by modifying the sequence of the cDNA encoding wild-type fX (SEQ ID NO. 2) described in more details in Example 7 for direct expression of recombinant antidote (r-Antidote) or alternatively, a fX protein with the desired modification may be produced by recombinant means followed by activation to the modified fXa by an activator, such as a snake venom, e.g. Russell's viper venom, and complexes of fVIIa/tissue factor or fIXa/fVIIIa.</p><p id="p-0297" num="0292">Subjects that will benefit from the administration of the compositions described herein and the accompanying methods include those that are experiencing, or predisposed to a clinical major bleeding event or a clinically significant non-major bleeding event. Examples of clinical major bleeding events are selected from the group consisting of hemorrhage, bleeding into vital organs, bleeding requiring re-operation or a new therapeutic procedure, and a bleeding index of &#x3e;2.0 with an associated overt bleed. (Turpie A G G, et al., <i>NEJM, </i>2001, 344: 619-625.) Additionally, the subject may be experiencing or predisposed to a non-major bleeding event selected from the group consisting of epistaxis that is persistent or recurrent and in substantial amount or will not stop without intervention, rectal or urinary tract bleeding that does not rise to a level requiring a therapeutic procedure, substantial hematomas at injection sites or elsewhere that are spontaneous or occur with trivial trauma, substantial blood loss more than usually associated with a surgical procedure that does not require drainage, and bleeding requiring unplanned transfusion.</p><p id="p-0298" num="0293">In some embodiments, the antidote is administered after the administration of an overdose of a fXa inhibitor or prior to a scheduled elective surgery, which may expose subjects to the risk of hemorrhage.</p><p id="p-0299" num="0294">In any of the methods described herein, it should be understood, even if not always explicitly stated, that an effective amount of the derivative is administered to the subject. The amount can be empirically determined by the treating physician and will vary with the age, gender, weight and health of the subject. Additional factors to be considered by the treating physician include but are not limited to the identity and/or amount of factor Xa inhibitor, which may have been administered, the method or mode that the antidote will be administered to the subject, the formulation of the antidote, and the therapeutic end point for the patient. With these variables in mind, one of skill will administer a therapeutically effective amount to the subject to be treated. In still another aspect, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for reversing or neutralizing the anticoagulant activity of a factor Xa inhibitor administered to a subject, comprising administering an effective amount of an antidote to the factor Xa inhibitor and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, with the proviso that the antidote is not plasma derived factor VIIa, recombinant factor VIIa, fresh frozen plasma, prothrombin complex concentrates and whole blood.</p><p id="p-0300" num="0295">In some embodiments, the antidote is any one of the antidotes as described above. In some embodiments, the antidote is conjugated with a moiety capable of extending the circulating half-life of the antidote. In some embodiments, the moiety is selected from the group consisting of polyethylene glycol, an acyl group, a liposome, a carrier protein, an artificial phospholipid membrane, and a nanoparticle. For example, a non-active site lysine or cysteine residue of a fXa derivative described herein may be chemically modified to attach to a polyethylene glycol molecule. Other methods provided in Werle, M. &#x26; Bernkop-Schn&#xfc;rch, A. Strategies to Improve Plasma Half Life Time of Peptide and Protein Drugs, <i>Amino Acids </i>2006, 30(4):351-367 may be used to extend the plasma half life of the antidotes of this invention.</p><p id="p-0301" num="0296">In other embodiments of the invention, the half-life of the fXa derivative is improved by coupling the antidote to Fc carrier domains. In one embodiment, the antidote is coupled to an Fc fragment, such as an immunoglobulin peptide portion or an IgG1 fragment. In one embodiment, a chimeric protein is contemplated which comprises the fXa derivative and the immunoglobulin peptide portion. In yet another embodiment, the fXa derivative and the immunoglobulin peptide is coupled by a chemical reaction, such as a disulfide bond with the human IgG heavy chain and kappa light chain constant regions.</p><p id="p-0302" num="0297">In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition further comprises an agent capable of extending the plasma half-life of the antidote. In another aspect, the pharmaceutical composition has been co-formulated with an agent capable of extending the plasma half-life of the antidote. In some embodiments, the co-administered or co-formulated agent is an anti-fXa antibody recognizing the exosite of fXa or an alpha-2-macroglobulin bound fXa derivative.</p><heading id="h-0019" level="1">VI. Therapies</heading><p id="p-0303" num="0298">The present invention relates to a therapeutic method of preventing or reducing bleeding in a subject undergoing anticoagulant therapy. It is contemplated that the antidotes or derivatives of the present invention may be short-duration drugs to be used in elective or emergency situations which can safely and specifically neutralize a fXa inhibitor's conventional anticoagulant properties without causing deleterious hemodynamic side-effects or exacerbation of the proliferative vascular response to injury.</p><p id="p-0304" num="0299">In one embodiment, the therapeutically effective amount of an antidote exhibits a high therapeutic index. The therapeutic index is the dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects which can be expressed as the ratio between LD<sub>50 </sub>and ED<sub>50</sub>. The LD<sub>50 </sub>is the dose lethal to 50% of the population and the ED<sub>50 </sub>is the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population. The LD<sub>50 </sub>and ED<sub>50 </sub>are determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in animal cell cultures or experimental animals. The antidotes or derivatives of this invention may be administered once or several times when needed to neutralize the effect of a fXa inhibitor present in a subject's plasma. Preferably, the antidotes of this invention is sufficient when administered in a single dose.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0300">It is contemplated that a typical dosage of the antidotes of the invention will depend on the actual clinical setting and inhibitor concentration in plasma. In in vitro assay, such as thrombin generation, clinical clotting assays such as aPTT, PT and ACT, a therapeutically effective amount of an antidote is expected to produce a correction of ex vivo clotting activity of 10% or more. In vitro assays indicate that an antidote/inhibitor ratio&#x3e;1.0 should show reversal effect. The maximum plasma concentration for antidote is expected to be in the micro molar range, probably between 10 micromolar or below.</p><p id="p-0306" num="0301">In a clinical setting, one of the criteria in determining the effectiveness of an antidote is that it produces any change of actual measures of bleeding. In clinical trials, categories of major bleeds include fatal hemorrhage, bleeds into vital organs (intracranial, intraocular, retroperitoneal, spinal, pericardial), any bleed requiring re-operation or a new therapeutic procedure (e.g., aspiration of an operated knee, thoracotomy tube insertion for hemothorax, endoscopic electrocoagulation, etc) or a bleeding index of &#x3e;2.0 if it is associated with an overt bleed. The bleeding index is defined as the number of units of packed red cells or whole blood transfused plus the hemoglobin values before the bleeding episode minus the hemoglobin values after the bleed has stabilized (in grams per deciliter).</p><p id="p-0307" num="0302">Another criterion for antidote efficacy in clinical settings is that it reduces clinically significant non-major bleeding. This category of hemorrhages include bleeding that is not major but is more than usual and warrants clinical attention, including epistaxis that is persistent or recurrent and in substantial amount or will not stop without intervention; rectal or urinary tract bleeding that does not rise to a level requiring a therapeutic procedure (e.g., new insertion of a Foley catheter or cystoscopic inspection), substantial hematomas at injection sites or elsewhere that are spontaneous or occur with trivial trauma; substantial blood loss; bleeding requiring unplanned transfusion. As used herein, &#x201c;substantial blood loss&#x201d; refers to amount of blood loss that is more than that amount usually associated with surgical procedure. Substantial blood loss leads to swelling that is managed conservatively because it falls short of requiring drainage.</p><p id="p-0308" num="0303">In one embodiment, the derivatives of this invention have sufficient plasma circulating half life for substantially neutralizing the fXa inhibitor present in plasma. Activated fXa has essentially no circulating half life in humans, as it is effectively inhibited by ATIII, TFPI and other plasma inhibitors (Fuchs, H. E. and Pizzo, S. V., <i>J. Clin. Invest., </i>1983, 72:2041-2049). Inactive fXa has been shown to have a circulating half-life of 2-3 hours in humans. In a baboon model, the half-life of a fXa blocked in the active site by DEGR ([5-(dimethylamino)1-naphthalenesulfonyl]-glutamylglycylarginyl chloromethyl ketone) was approximately 10 hours or 2 hours, as determined by isotopic or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, respectively (Taylor, F. B. et al., <i>Blood, </i>1991, 78(2):364-368).</p><p id="p-0309" num="0304">It may be desirable to extend the half life of an antidote fXa derivative to 24-48 hours. It is contemplated that conjugation or addition of one or more of the following moieties will increase the plasma half life of an antidote:</p><p id="p-0310" num="0000">a) polyethylene glycol;<br/>b) an acyl group;<br/>c) liposomes and encapsulating agents;<br/>d) carrier proteins;<br/>e) artificial phospholipid membrane;<br/>f) immunoglobulin; and<br/>g) nanoparticle.<br/>The conjugation site may not be limited to special chain or residue so long as the conjugation does not mask the inhibitor binding site(s) of the antidote. The antidotes described herein may be administered in combination with any one or more than one of the compounds described above.</p><p id="p-0311" num="0305">In general, administered antibodies have much longer half life than circulating blood coagulation proteins. It is possible to use a complex consisting of Gla-domain deficient fXa and an antibody bound to the exosite of fXa as an antidote with extended circulating half life. Formation of a complex between fXa and the antibody targeting the exosite may reduce interaction of an Gla-domain deficient fXa with macromolecular substrates and inhibitors, such as prothrombin and antithrombin III, while leaving the active site cleft unperturbed so that the complex can act as an antidote to bind active site directed small molecule inhibitor. Formation of &#x3b1;-2-macroglobulin-fXa complex can also be of useful as an antidote for fXa small molecule inhibitors.</p><p id="p-0312" num="0306">Efficacy of the antidotes in reversal of the anticoagulant activity of fXa inhibitors as well as its procoagulant activity may be determined by in vitro assays and animal models by those of skill in the art. Examples of in vitro assays are thrombin generation, clinical clotting assays such as aPTT, PT and ACT. An antidote of this invention is contemplated to be capable of producing 10% or more correction of ex vivo clotting activity. Several in vivo animal models of bleeding time and/or blood loss in, for example, rodents, such as mice, dogs and primates, such as monkeys, may be used to measure efficacy.</p><heading id="h-0020" level="1">VII.

In other embodiments, the kit further comprises a label explaining when these two agents in (a) and (b) should be used.</p><p id="p-0314" num="0308">The first and second container can be a bottle, jar, vial, flask, syringe, tube, bag, or any other container used in the manufacture, storage, or distribution of a pharmaceutical product.

In a typical experiment setting, 0.5 milligrams/milliliter (mg/mL) anhydro-fXa (SEQ ID NO: 20) was incubated with 5 units/milliliter (U/mL) &#x3b1;-chymotrypsin-agarose beads with gentle agitation. At the end of the reaction, the &#x3b1;-chymotrypsin-agarose beads were removed by centrifugation or filtration. This was followed by incubation with excess amount of inhibitors 4-amidino-phenyl-methane-sulfonyl fluoride (APMSF), tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), and tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) to quench the residual fXa activity or any activity of chymotrypsin possibly leached from the beads. Gla-domain fragment and inhibitors were removed from the final product, des-Gla anhydro-fXa (SEQ ID NO:10), by an Amicon Ultra Centrifugal filter device (YM10 membrane) or by conventional dialysis. Concentrating or buffer exchange, if necessary, was also achieved at the same time.

As discussed in Example 17, anti-fXa U/ml=1 corresponds to human therapeutic levels of anticoagulation.</p><p id="p-0382" num="0399">There are no specific reversal agents available for LMW heparins. Thus, protamine sulfate, an agent developed for reversal of activity of unfractionated heparin during procedures such as coronary artery bypass graft surgery, is used for this purpose. For enoxaparin, the prescribing information describes that neutralization of up to 60% of activity may be obtained by slow intravenous infusion of protamine sulfate. However, given the incomplete extent of reversal, coupled with the possibility of hemodynamic and anaphylactic side effects (Weiss and Adkinson, Clin Rev Allergy, 1991; 9: 339), this mode of reversal is seldom used as a first mode of action in enoxaparin treated patients.</p><p id="p-0383" num="0400">In order to test the ability of r-Antidote to reverse enoxaparin induced anticoagulation and to compare the results to the extent of protamine reversal, we tested the agents in the following regimen: Rats were administered enoxaparin diluted into normal saline at 3.0 mg/kg or vehicle (normal saline) as an intravenous bolus injection (1 mL) at t=0. At 10 minutes post enoxaparin injection, vehicle, antidote (5 mg) or protamine sulfate (0.9 mg, Sigma) was administered intravenously as a 5 minute bolus injection. This was followed by a maintenance infusion for the remainder of the study (additional 45 minutes, 5 mg/h for r-Antidote and normal saline for protamine). Serial blood samples anticoagulated with 3.2% sodium citrate (1:10 dilution) were obtained for measurement of plasma aPTT and antidote concentrations at 0, 5, 15 (end of bolus treatment administration), 30 and 60 minutes. Plasma aPTT measurements were determined using a MLA Electra 800 Automatic coagulation timer.

There was no statistically significant difference (p=0.27) between the correction of aPTT by r-Antidote or protamine group.

Serial plasma samples were collected and analyzed for antidote concentration using an enzyme linked immunosorption assay (ELISA, Enzyme Research Laboratory, Cat #: FX-EIA). Plasma concentration-time profiles of the antidote was described by a two compartment model. Systemic clearance of the antidote was low (1.65 mL/min/kg) and volume of distribution was small (0.27 L/kg). The distribution half-life was 19 minutes followed by a much longer terminal half-life of 10 hours. If immediate and near complete reversal of anticoagulation has to be achieved in a patient, based on rat experiments (Examples 18, 19, 20 and 22) the ratio of r-Antidote concentration to circulating fXa inhibitor concentration is expected to be targeted at around 2. Thus, to immediately maintain antidote plasma concentration above that of a fXa inhibitor, the distribution half-life is expected to have a much bigger impact than the terminal half-life on the human dose selection during an overdose treatment.</p><p id="p-0389" num="0405"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref> shows plasma concentration-time profile of r-Antidote in Sprague-Dawley rats.</p><heading id="h-0045" level="1">Example 24.

Reversal of Blood Loss Due to Enoxaparin and Fondaparinux in Rat by r-Antidote</heading><p id="p-0403" num="0428">The effect of r-Antidote on reversal of blood loss due to enoxaparin anticoagulation was tested in Sprague-Dawley rats. Specifically, rat tail transection blood loss model for restoration of hemostasis was employed. The enoxaparin was dosed by IV bolus (4.5 mg/kg). The r-Antidote was administered as two doses: 1) a 2 milligram bolus and then infused at a rate of 2 mg/hour for a total of 15 minutes; and 2) a 4 milligram bolus and then infused at a rate of 4 mg/hour for a total of 15 minutes. Blood loss reversal was also tested using the vehicle. Immediately after the bolus injection of the r-Antidote was complete and the infusion started, the tip of the rat's tail was transected with a scalpel blade and placed into a vial containing physiological saline at 37&#xb0; C. The tail was allowed to bleed for 15 minutes. The resulting blood volume was determined by lysis of red blood cells, measuring the hemoglobin concentration spectrophotometrically and estimating the blood volume by comparison against a standard curve. Decreased blood loss correlated with both r-Antidote plasma concentrations (r<sup>2</sup>=0.80) and a reduction of anti-fXa units (r<sup>2</sup>=0.89). The results are provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref> (AD refers to the r-Antidote).</p><p id="p-0404" num="0429">In the same model, r-Antidote completely corrected increased blood loss due to fondaparinux (25 mg/kg) administration. Protamine (provided as a 0.9 mg IV bolus) failed to display corrective activity. The r-Antidote was provided as a 6 mg bolus and then another 6 g/hr for 15 min as an infusion.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>44</b></figref>, the increase in anti-fXa activity due to fondaparinux was rapidly and substantially reversed by the administration of r-Antidote.</p><p id="p-0413" num="0438">The anti-aa activity for fondaparinux was expressed as &#x3bc;g/ml by using a known concentration of fondaparinux as a standard. When measured using enoxaparin as the standard, 1 &#x3bc;g/ml fondaparinux was equivalent to 0.66 U/ml enoxaparin in rat plasma, or 0.80 U/ml enoxaparin in human plasma.</p><heading id="h-0051" level="1">Example 30. Correlation of Blood Loss, Anti-fXa Unit, and rfXa Antidote Concentrations in Rat Tail Transection Model</heading><p id="p-0414" num="0439"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b><i>b</i>, and <b>42</b><i>c </i></figref>shows the correlation between blood loss in the rat tail transection model and enoxaparin concentrations as measured by anti-aa units (r<sup>2</sup>=0.887). The anti-fXa units and rfXa antidote concentration refer to the levels obtained at the 15 minute time point&#x2014;just prior to tail transection. The results demonstrated a steep increase in blood loss as enoxaparin concentrations increased to &#x3e;1.5 anti-fXa Units/ml with a plateau in the maximum blood loss achieved with this model representing approximately 5% of normal rat blood volume lost over the 15 minute collection time. Higher doses of enoxaparin were tested during initial model development experiments but no greater blood loss was demonstrated. Further correlation analysis showed an r<sup>2</sup>=0.887 between blood loss and rfXa antidote concentrations and r<sup>2</sup>=0.689 between anti-aa units and rfXa antidote concentrations.</p><p id="p-0415" num="0440">It is to be understood that while the invention has been described in conjunction with the above embodiments, that the foregoing description and examples are intended to illustrate and not limit the scope of the invention.
