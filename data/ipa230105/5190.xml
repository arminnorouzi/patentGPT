Outputting the image dataset can comprise visualizing an equilibrium metaphor which can be performed with an HMI, such as a display screen of the infotainment system. Alternatively or additionally, the visualization can be performed with an HMI assigned to the infotainment system which has only a data transmission connection to the infotainment system, such as e.g. data glasses worn by the driver.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0016">Feedback can thus be given to the driver through visualization of an equilibrium metaphor of this type, so that said driver can counteract the occurrence of motion sickness by means of a corresponding driving style.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0017">According to one embodiment, loading the passenger movement dataset comprises loading a pressure distribution which is produced by a passenger sitting on a vehicle seat of the motor vehicle. The values of the pressure distribution can be captured e.g. with a plurality of pressure sensors which are arranged in the form of a mat in a sitting area or backrest of a vehicle seat. The changes therein over time can then be regarded as representative of movements of the passenger. A passenger movement dataset of this type can thus be defined in a particularly simple manner.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0018">According to a further embodiment, loading the passenger movement dataset comprises loading an image dataset of a passenger of the motor vehicle. The image data of the image dataset can be obtained with a camera such as e.g. a CCD camera for monitoring the passenger compartment of the motor vehicle. A passenger movement dataset of this type can be defined in a particularly simple manner in this way also. The pressure distribution data and the image data of the image dataset can further be fused during an evaluation in order to obtain higher-quality data in this way.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0019">According to a further embodiment, evaluating the motor vehicle movement dataset and the passenger movement dataset by means of a transfer function with a predefined threshold value comprises defining unintentional and intentional movements of the passenger. The threshold value can be regarded as a measure of normal movements of the passenger of the type which occur during a normal operation of the motor vehicle. It is therefore established by means of a comparison with the threshold value whether the passenger movement dataset describes unintentional or intentional movements of the passenger. If the threshold value is exceeded during operation, this shifts a visualized object according to the image dataset from an unstable equilibrium into a stable equilibrium, such as e.g. a visualized upright-standing egg into a lying position. The driver can thus be given feedback in a particularly simple manner.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0020">The invention also relates to a computer program product, designed to carry out a method of this type, an infotainment system for a motor vehicle and a motor vehicle having an infotainment system of this type.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0021">Reference now is first made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an HMI <b>6</b>, e.g. of an infotainment system <b>4</b> of a motor vehicle <b>2</b> which, in the present exemplary embodiment, is a passenger vehicle.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0023">An infotainment system <b>4</b> is understood to mean the combination of an automobile radio, a navigation system, a hands-free device, driver assistance systems and further functions in a central operating unit.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0024">An HMI <b>6</b> is understood to mean a human-machine interface.

The motor vehicle movement dataset KBD therefore contains values for accelerations which occur while the motor vehicle <b>2</b> is travelling and can be captured with e.g. acceleration sensors (not shown) of the motor vehicle <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0027">The infotainment system <b>4</b> is further designed to load a passenger movement dataset PBD indicative of movements of a passenger of the motor vehicle <b>2</b>.

The image data of an image dataset can be obtained with a camera, such as e.g. a CCD camera for monitoring the passenger compartment (similarly not shown) of the motor vehicle <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0030">In the present exemplary embodiment, the infotainment system <b>4</b> is designed to fuse the data of the pressure distribution and the image data of the image dataset during an evaluation in order to define the passenger movement dataset PBD.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0031">In the present exemplary embodiment, the infotainment system <b>4</b> is further designed to evaluate the motor vehicle movement dataset KBD and the passenger movement dataset PBD in order to define intentional and unintentional movements of the passenger. Unintentional movements of the passenger are movements which are caused by the accelerations of the motor vehicle <b>2</b> in operation. In other words, these are essentially involuntary movements in response to external accelerations. Conversely, intentional movements cannot be assigned to such accelerations of the motor vehicle <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0032">For this purpose, the infotainment system <b>4</b> uses a transfer function &#xdc;F which links e.g. accelerations on the input side with movements of the passenger on the output side.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0033">The transfer function &#xdc;F has a predefined threshold value SW. The threshold value SW can be regarded as a measure of normal movements of the passenger of the type which occur during a normal operation of the motor vehicle <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0034">In other words, if the threshold value SW is exceeded, an unwanted movement of the passenger is inferred.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0035">In the present exemplary embodiment, the motor vehicle movement dataset KBD is evaluated for this purpose in order to define an acceleration measured value KM for the accelerations acting on the passenger during a predefined time interval. For this purpose, accelerations can be weighted differently in the direction of different spatial axes. Accelerations in the direction of travel and opposite the direction of travel, for example, can be weighted less than accelerations along spatial axes across the direction of travel of the motor vehicle <b>2</b>. Furthermore, in the present exemplary embodiment, the passenger movement dataset PBD is evaluated in order to define a movement measured value PM for movements and/or gestures performed by the passenger during a predefined time interval.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0036">In the present exemplary embodiment, a corresponding value W for the movement measured value PM can be defined for the acceleration measured value KM by means of the transfer function &#xdc;F.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0037">The difference Diff between the corresponding value W defined with the transfer function &#xdc;F and the movement measured value PM is then defined and compared with the threshold value SW.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0038">In contrast to the present exemplary embodiment, it can also be provided that a corresponding value for the acceleration measured value PM is defined with the transfer function &#xdc;F in the present exemplary embodiment for the movement measured value PM, a difference between the corresponding value defined with the transfer function &#xdc;F and the acceleration measured value KM is defined and compared with a threshold value.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0039">The infotainment system <b>4</b> is further designed to generate and then also output an image dataset BS for the HMI <b>6</b> of the motor vehicle <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0040">In the present exemplary embodiment, the image dataset BS serves to visualize an equilibrium metaphor. In other words, if the threshold value is exceeded during operation, this shifts a visualized object O from an unstable equilibrium into a stable equilibrium, e.g. an upright-standing egg into a lying position.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0041">In particular, the infotainment system <b>4</b> of the motor vehicle <b>2</b> can have correspondingly designed computer hardware, processor, memory and/or software components for implementing these described tasks and functions. For instance, the processor may execute software to provide the described tasks and functions described herein.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0042">A method sequence for operating the infotainment system <b>4</b> will now be explained.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0043">In a first step S<b>100</b>, the motor vehicle <b>2</b> is controlled by the driver F, wherein control signals SS are transmitted, e.g. via a CAN bus of the motor vehicle <b>2</b>, to different components of the motor vehicle <b>2</b>, such as e.g. for the steering, brakes or the powertrain of the motor vehicle <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0044">The driver F can further perform inputs, e.g. by means of the HMI <b>6</b>, before the start of the journey, with which he can define one or more parameters which characterize at least a predefined driving style, such as e.g. a particularly sporty driving style or a more comfortable driving style with comparatively significantly reduced accelerations. A value for the threshold value SW which is greater for a sporty driving style than for a more comfortable driving style can be derived from these parameters.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0045">In a further step S<b>200</b>, the operating data BD of the motor vehicle <b>2</b> come into play, with which e.g. values for accelerations in the direction of different spatial axes are associated.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0046">In a further step S<b>300</b>, the values produced by the operating data BD for the accelerations are then captured in a first partial step with acceleration sensors of the motor vehicle and are provided in the form of the motor vehicle movement dataset KBD. The acceleration measured value KM is further defined in a further partial step.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0047">In a further step S<b>400</b>, a pressure distribution produced by the passenger sitting on the vehicle seat of the motor vehicle <b>2</b> is captured in a first partial step. Image data of the image dataset of the passenger are captured in a further partial step. The data representing the pressure distribution or the changes therein over time and the image data of the image dataset are combined by means of sensor fusion into the passenger movement dataset PBD. The movement measured value PM is further defined in a further partial step.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0048">In a further step S<b>500</b>, it is established for the evaluation in a first partial step by means of the transfer function &#xdc;F through comparison with the threshold value SW whether the passenger movement dataset PBD describes unintentional or intentional movements of the passenger. The image dataset BS is further generated in a further partial step. As already described, the image dataset BS serves in the present exemplary embodiment to visualize an equilibrium metaphor. If the threshold value SW is exceeded, this shifts the visualized object O from an unstable equilibrium into a stable equilibrium, wherein the object O in the unstable equilibrium is an upright-standing egg, and in the stable equilibrium a lying egg.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0049">In a further step S<b>600</b>, the image dataset BS is output through visualization by means of the infotainment system <b>4</b>, i.e. with the HMI <b>6</b> assigned to the infotainment system <b>4</b>, in order to give feedback to the driver F in this way.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0050">In contrast to the present exemplary embodiment, the sequence of the steps or partial steps can also be different. A plurality of steps or partial steps can furthermore also be carried out concurrently or simultaneously. Individual steps or partial steps of the method can furthermore also be omitted or skipped.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0051">Feedback can thus be given to the driver F through visualization of an equilibrium metaphor of this type so that said driver can counteract the occurrence of motion sickness by means of a corresponding driving style.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
