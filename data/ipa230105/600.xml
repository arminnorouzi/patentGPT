Patent Application No. 10-2021-0086444, filed on July 1, 2021 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Field of the Disclosure</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a tooth model, and more particularly, to a tooth model for dental treatment practice, with the same morphology and structure as a neural tube in actual teeth so as to be applicable to the practice, as well as a method for manufacturing the same.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, endodontic treatment of a tooth is executed when odontopathogens such as cariogenic bacteria (commonly &#x201c;tooth cavity&#x201d;) invade a dental nerve, in particular, the pulp cavity and root canal over the dentin of a coronal part causing pain.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The endodontic treatment may be a type of prosthetic treatment performed such that, when endodontic diagnosis is confirmed in a tooth, a hole is drilled in the tooth body using a dental treatment drill, dental tissue or a blood vessel of the dental nerve is removed using a device for nerve removal, and then the root canal is disinfected, followed by filling the root canal and the hole with alternative materials.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">With regard to the endodontic treatment above, since the dental nerve should be completely removed while minimizing damage to the dentin of teeth in order to prevent recurrence of pain and preserve natural teeth as much as possible, dental neuropathic therapies must be thoroughly practiced to master neuropsychiatric techniques.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, since tooth models even forming a neural structure inside a tooth for practice of such endodontic treatment are not sufficiently present in existing dental educational institutions, dental offices and dentistry seminar, etc., most students may observe the professor who practices the endodontic treatment and then may rely on audiovisual data as a result of recording the above practical treatment on a videotape, otherwise, typically learn such endodontic treatment using a general tooth model, hence causing a problem of deteriorated efficiency in practice.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In other words, since a typical tooth model is manufactured in a form in which only the external shape of a tooth or an oral cavity is formed, it is impossible to directly practice treatment of a neural portion formed in the tooth and, even if the practice is conducted using the above typical tooth model, correct identification of the neural structure and/or direct treatment for removal of dental nerves cannot be performed, and therefore, it is quite difficult to master endodontic treatment.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, in order to overcome the above problems, the existing tooth model has been manufactured by filling a neural tube formed in a root canal of a tooth with wax, thereby similarly imitating the same.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, since the existing tooth model has a neural tube filled with wax and a nerve removing device (endodontic file) is smeared with sticky wax after removal of nerves, the nerves may not be clearly removed.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, in the case of conventional tooth models, the morphology of neural tubes formed in the root canal of a tooth is not sufficiently represented, which in turn is not suitable for practice. Further, when seen from the outside, the tooth model entails a problem in that the neural tube is not clearly distinguished.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">RELATED ART LITERATURE</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">(Patent Document 1) Korean Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 10-2019-0143108 (Dec. 30, 2019)</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Therefore, the present disclosure has been made in view of the above problems, and it is an object of the present disclosure to provide a tooth model for dental treatment practice, in which an opaque material-based paint stains an inner surface of a neural tube formed inside a (dental) root canal of the tooth model composed of a transparent material, so as to show (or expose) the neural tube out of the root canal in the tooth model, as well as a method for manufacturing the same.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is another object of the present disclosure to provide a tooth model for dental treatment practice, in which the inside of a neural tube has an empty, hollow form, thus enabling easy endodontic treatment practice, as well as a method for manufacturing the same.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is still another object of the present disclosure to provide a tooth model for dental treatment practice, in which the inner surface of a neural tube is coated with a non-aqueous or insoluble resin-based paint so as to easily confirm whether nerves were sufficiently eliminated after removal thereof, and which can obviously indicate a condition of treatment after irrigation, as well as a method for manufacturing the same.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0000">In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, the above and other objects can be accomplished by the provision of a tooth model for dental treatment practice, which is made of a transparent material, comprising: a root canal including a hollow neural tube formed therein;

(b) a second step of introducing a paint based on an opaque material into the neural tube which is formed inside the root canal; (c) a third step of injecting air into the neural tube, to which the paint was introduced, in order to disperse the paint, thereby enabling the paint to be applied to an inner surface of the neural tube; and (d) a fourth step of allowing the paint applied to the inner surface of the neural tube to be cured or hardened over a predetermined time, so as to form a coating layer with a predetermined thickness on the inner surface of the neural tube.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0021">The paint applied to the inner surface of the neural tube in step (d) may be used for surface-coating of the inner surface by any one process among flame heat treatment, high frequency inductive heat treatment, laser heat treatment, ultraviolet (UV) curing and infrared (IR) curing processes.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0008" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0022">The above and other objects, features and other advantages of the present disclosure will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0025" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating the tooth model for dental treatment practice according to an embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a photograph illustrating the tooth model for dental treatment practice according to an embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a photograph illustrating the tooth model for dental treatment practice in a state that the tooth model is mounted on a dentiform according to an embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view and a cross-sectional view illustrating the tooth model for dental treatment practice according to another embodiment of the present invention;
