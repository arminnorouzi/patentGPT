Transl. Med. </i>6:224ra25, 2014; Kochenderfer et al., <i>J. Clin. Oncol. </i>33:540, 2015; Maude et al., <i>N. Engl. J. Med. </i>371:1507, 2014; Porter et al., Sci. Transl. Med. 7:303ra139, 2015; Turtle et al. I, <i>J. Clin. Invest. </i>126:2123, 2016; Turtle et al. II, <i>Sci. Transl. Med. </i>8:355ra116, 2016). Durable complete responses (CRs) without subsequent anti-tumor therapy have been observed in a subset of patients who received CD19 CAR-T cell therapy, demonstrating the potential of this approach (Turtle et al. I and II, 2016; Porter et al., 2015).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, when infused antigen-specific CAR-modified T cells encounter an antigen positive target cell, in vivo signaling through the CAR induces CAR-T cell proliferation, cytokine secretion, and target cell lysis (Turtle et al., <i>Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. </i>100:252, 2016). Within approximately 2 weeks after CAR-modified T cell infusion, some patients will develop cytokine release syndrome (CRS), a systemic inflammatory response initiated by T cell activation and characterized by fever and hypotension (Brudno and Kochenderfer, <i>Blood </i>127:3321, 2016; Lee et al., <i>Blood </i>124:188, 2014). Neurologic adverse events are frequently observed in association with CRS after CAR-modified T cell immunotherapy, and in rare instances can be fatal (Davila et al., 2014; Kochenderfer et al., 2015; Maude et al., 2014; Porter et al., 2015; Turtle et al. I, 2016; Turtle et al. II, 2016); however, a detailed clinical description of the syndrome has not been reported and the mechanisms of neurotoxicity have not been identified.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">After adoptive transfer, activation of CAR-T cells by encounter with CD19<sup>+</sup> tumor or normal B cells results in proliferation of CAR-T cells, lysis of the target cell, and cytokine secretion, which can be associated with the clinical presentations of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity. CRS after CD19 CAR-T cell therapy occurs in 54-91% of patients, including severe CRS in 8.3-43% (Turtle II, 2016; Turtle I, 2016; Kochenderfer et al., 2015; Porter et al., 2015; Davila et al., 2014; Locke et al., <i>Mol Ther. </i>25:285, 2017; Brentjens et al., <i>Blood. </i>118:4817, 2011; Porter et al., <i>N. Engl. J. Med. </i>365:725, 2011). CRS presents with fever, hypotension, coagulopathy and capillary leak, and, if severe, can be fatal; however, a comprehensive description of the kinetics of presentation and biomarkers of CRS in a large cohort of patients has not been reported (Brudno and Kochenderfer, <i>Blood. </i>127:3321, 2016). The increased availability of CD19 CAR-T cell therapies in multicenter trials highlight the need to provide clinicians treating B-ALL, NHL and CLL patients with a detailed description of the clinical syndrome of CRS.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Hence, there remains a need in the art for biomarkers to identify a subject at risk of having an adverse event in response to immunotherapy. The present disclosure meets such needs, and further provides other related advantages.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>G</figref>.

Risk factors that are associated with the incidence and severity of subsequent CRS were identified before and after CAR-T cell infusion, allowing identification of patients at high risk of severe toxicity and candidates for early intervention. In particular, various biomarkers examined individually and in various combinations indicate what therapies to apply, what therapeutic regimens to apply, what therapies to adjust, what therapies to avoid, or any combination thereof that will be the most beneficial to a subject at risk of having an adverse event associated with immunotherapy. Such biomarkers include the subject's temperature, levels of inflammatory cytokines and the presence of endothelial activation biomarkers. Exemplary endothelial activation biomarkers include angiopoietin-2 (encoded by ANGPT2), angiopoietin-1 (encoded by ANGPT1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1, encoded by VCAM1, which can be the soluble form, sVCAM-1), a ratio of angiopoietin-2 to angiopoietin-1, a ratio of VCAM-1 to angiopoietin-1, von Willebrand factor (vWF), or a ratio of ADAMTS13 to vWF.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The instant disclosure further provides methods for treating hematologic malignancies in mammalian subjects, comprising obtaining the results from the methods comprising identifying the subject as at risk of developing an adverse event associated with cellular immunotherapy when the adverse event biomarker is altered as compared to a normal sample; and administering to the subject a pre-emptive treatment, an altered cellular immunotherapy regimen, or both to minimize the risk for the potential adverse event.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">By way of background, lymphodepletion chemotherapy and targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T (CAR-T) cell infusion for hematologic malignancies, including relapsed and refractory malignancies, can be complicated by various adverse events (AEs), including cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurotoxicity, or both. For example, in CD19-specific CAR-T cell immunotherapy patients, the incidence of grade&#x2265;3 neurotoxicity is similar to that described in previous reports (Davila et al., 2014; Kochenderfer et al., 2015; Maude et al., 2014; Porter et al., 2015). The instant disclosure provides an approach to reduce the risk of, for example, CD19 CAR-T cell therapy by early identification of patients who are at high risk of developing severe CRS at a time when intervention or modification of the treatment regimen could be instituted. Multivariable analysis identified baseline and treatment risk factors for CRS, including those associated with more robust CAR-T cell expansion, such as higher marrow tumor burden, Cy/Flu lymphodepletion, and higher CAR-T cell dose. Other factors that were associated with CRS (which may reflect the higher tumor burden in these patients) included thrombocytopenia and manufacturing of CAR-T cells from bulk CD8+ T cells.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">This disclosure also provides detailed clinical, radiologic and pathologic characterization of neurotoxicity associated with CD19 CAR-T cell infusion that will facilitate management of patients undergoing CD19 CAR-T cell therapy. For example, the Examples herein show that cytokine-mediated endothelial activation causing coagulopathy, capillary leak, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, which allows transit of high concentrations of systemic cytokines into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In autopsy studies of two patients who had fatal toxicity, endothelial activation was identified, resulting in loss of cerebral vascular integrity in one patient manifesting as multifocal hemorrhage. In certain embodiments, a predictive classification tree algorithm based on the presence of fever and high serum IL-6 and/or CCL2 (MCP-1) concentrations to identify patients within the first 12-48 hours of CAR-T cell infusion who are at high risk of subsequent severe neurotoxicity and are candidates for early intervention. Finally, the present disclosure provides that patients with evidence of endothelial activation before lymphodepletion, before CAR-T cell infusion, or both are at increased risk of neurotoxicity after immunotherapy, and are candidates for early intervention, modification of the treatment regimen, or both.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Prior to setting forth this disclosure in more detail, it may be helpful to an understanding thereof to provide definitions of certain terms to be used herein.

The study was conducted with approval of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) institutional review board, and is available at clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01865617. Informed consent was obtained from all patients.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0118">CD19-specific CAR-modified T cells were manufactured as described in Turtle et al. I, 2016; and Turtle et al. II, 2016. In brief, patients underwent leukapheresis to obtain PBMC, from which CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> central memory T cell subsets were enriched. Enriched CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> central memory T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 coated paramagnetic beads and transduced with a lentivirus encoding a CAR comprising a FMC63-derived CD19-specific scFv, a modified IgG4-hinge spacer, a CD28 transmembrane domain, a 4-1BB costimulatory domain, and a CD3&#x3b6; signaling domain. A cell surface human EGFRt was also encoded in the lentiviral vector separated from the CAR coding sequence cassette by a T2A ribosomal skip sequence to allow precise enumeration of transduced CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> CAR-T cells by flow cytometry. The modified T cells were formulated in a 1:1 ratio of CD3<sup>+</sup>/CD4<sup>+</sup>/EGFRt<sup>+</sup> T cells to CD3<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup>/EGFRt<sup>+</sup> T cells for infusion at one of three dose levels (DL) as follows: DL1=2&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>EGFRt cells/kg; DL2=2&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>EGFRt<sup>+</sup> cells/kg; and DL3=2&#xd7;10<sup>7 </sup>EGFRt cells/kg. In patients with high circulating tumor burden or severe lymphopenia, selection of bulk CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells rather than CD8<sup>+</sup> central memory T cells could be performed. Patients received lymphodepletion chemotherapy with a cyclophosphamide-based regimen with or without fludarabine (Table 1), followed 2-4 days later by infusion of the CD19-specific CAR-modified T cells. Delay of CAR-T cell infusion was permitted for patients with clinical conditions (e.g. active and uncontrolled infection) that precluded CAR-T cell infusion at the scheduled time.

Within 28 days of CD19-specific CAR-T cell infusion, 40% of patients (53/133) had one or more grade&#x2265;1 neurologic AEs (40%; 19% grade1-2; 16% grade3; 2% grade4; 3% grade5), presenting a median of 4 days after CAR-T cell infusion (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>). The median time from onset to the highest neurotoxicity grade was 1 day (range 0-19) and the median duration of reversible neurologic AEs was 5 days (range 1-70 days). Forty-eight of 53 patients with any neurologic AE (91%) also had cytokine release syndrome (CRS) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>).

Grade 1-2 headache was the only neurologic AE in 9 patients. A decreased level of consciousness occurred in 13 of 53 patients (25%), and in 6 cases was associated with coma requiring invasive ventilatory support. In those who recovered, the median duration of the decreased level of consciousness was 2 days (range 1-12 days). Language disturbance was observed in 18 of 53 patients (34%) for a median of 4 days (range 1-9) and was accompanied in 15 of 18 patients (83%) by decreased level of consciousness and/or delirium, which complicated the distinction between impaired attention and aphasia as the etiology of language disturbance.

(5%) developed grade&#x2265;4 neurotoxicity, of whom 6 were treated with CAR-T cell doses that were subsequently determined to be above the maximum tolerated dose for each disease and tumor burden (B-ALL with &#x2264;5% marrow blasts, 2&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>CAR-T cells/kg; B-ALL with &#x2265;5% marrow blasts, 2&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>CAR-T cells/kg; NHL, 2&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>CAR-T cells/kg; and CLL, 2&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>CAR-T cells/kg). Four of 133 patients (3%) died due to neurotoxicity: one died from multifocal brainstem hemorrhage and edema associated with DIC, 2 died due to acute cerebral edema, and one developed cortical laminar necrosis with a persistent minimally conscious state until death 4 months after CAR-T cell infusion. With the exception of those with fatal neurotoxicity and one patient in whom a grade1 neurologic AE resolved 2 months after CAR-T cell infusion, neurotoxicity completely resolved in all patients by day 28 after CAR-T cell infusion (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0144" num="0139">Of the 53 patients with neurotoxicity, 23 underwent brain MRI within 28 days of CAR-T cell infusion. Acute abnormalities on MRI were evident in 7 of 23 patients (30%), 4 of whom had fatal neurotoxicity, indicating that an abnormal MRI scan during acute neurotoxicity is associated with a high risk of a poor outcome. FLAIR/T2 changes indicative of vasogenic edema, leptomeningeal enhancement, and/or multifocal microhemorrhages were present in a majority of patients with severe neurotoxicity and abnormal MM scans. Contrast enhancement, consistent with breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), was also seen in some FLAIR/T2 lesions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>F</figref>). One patient developed extensive cortical diffusion restriction indicative of cytotoxic edema (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>G-<b>2</b>I</figref>), which appeared distinct from vasogenic edema observed in other patients. None of the other patients had lesions that were diffusion restricting. Electroencephalography (EEG) was performed in 17 of 53 patients during acute neurotoxicity. Diffuse slowing was present in 13 of 17 patients (76%). Focal slowing was noted in one patient (6%) with known epilepsy, and clinical and subclinical seizures were observed in one patient. EEG was normal in 2 of 17 patients (12%).</p><heading id="h-0025" level="1">Example 3</heading><heading id="h-0026" level="1">Treatment of Neurotoxicity after Infusion of CD19-Specific CAR-Modified T Cells</heading><p id="p-0145" num="0140">Tocilizumab, an antagonistic IL-6R monoclonal antibody, effectively ameliorates fever and hypotension in most patients with severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS) after CD19-specific CAR-T cell (CAR-T cell) therapy, and is frequently administered with or without corticosteroids to patients with neurotoxicity (Turtle et al. I, 2016; Turtle et al. II, 2016). Twenty of 53 patients with neurotoxicity (38%) received tocilizumab (4-8 mg/kg, intravenous (IV)) and dexamethasone (10 mg IV, twice a day (b.i.d.)), one (2%) received tocilizumab alone, and 6 (11%) received dexamethasone alone (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref>). Fourteen patients received a single dose of tocilizumab, five received two doses, and two received three doses. A median of two doses (range 1-31) of dexamethasone 10 mg IV b.i.d. were administered and one patient received methylprednisolone (1,000 mg IV&#xd7;9). In 14 of 21 patients (67%), the peak grade of neurotoxicity occurred after the first dose of tocilizumab, and in 8 of those patients neurotoxicity first presented after tocilizumab had been administered for CRS. In patients with reversible neurotoxicity, the time from the first tocilizumab and/or dexamethasone dose to resolution of neurotoxicity (median 4 days, range 1-64 days) was longer than the time to resolution of fever (temperature&#x3c;38&#xb0; C. for at least 48 hours, median 0.4 days, range 0-3.8 days, p&#x3c;0.0001).</p><p id="p-0146" num="0141">These data indicate that established neurotoxicity is less responsive than CRS to interventions that suppress IL-6 activity or CAR-T cell function.</p><heading id="h-0027" level="1">Example 4</heading><heading id="h-0028" level="1">Baseline Characteristics Associated with Risk of Neurotoxicity after Infusion of CD19-Specific CAR-Modified T Cells</heading><p id="p-0147" num="0142">Baseline characteristics of patients receiving CAR-T cell immunotherapy were analyzed to identify factors associated with an increased risk of subsequent neurotoxicity. In univariate analyses (Table 3), neurotoxicity was more frequent in younger patients (p=0.094), those with B-ALL (p=0.084), a high fraction of tumor (p=0.072) and CD19<sup>+</sup> cells (p=0.062) in bone marrow, and a high CAR-modified T cell dose (p&#x3c;0.0001). The presence of any pre-existing neurologic comorbidity was also associated with neurotoxicity (p=0.0059). Only the infused CAR-T cell dose was associated with the occurrence of more severe neurotoxicity (grade&#x2265;3 versus grade1-2, p=0.014). The selection of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell subset in CAR-T cell manufacturing, the patient's sex and race, the number of prior chemotherapy regimens, previous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and pretreatment performance score were not associated with neurotoxicity in univariate analyses.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00003" num="00003"><table frame="none" colsep="0"

Severe neurotoxicity was also accompanied by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), with elevated prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and d-dimer beginning 2-5 days after CAR-T cell infusion, prolonged thrombocytopenia, and a late reduction in fibrinogen to a nadir approximately 1-2 weeks after CAR-T cell infusion (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>).

The angiopoietin (Ang)-Tie2 axis regulates the balance between endothelial quiescence and activation (Page and Liles, <i>Virulence </i>4:507-16, 2013). Ang-1 is produced constitutively, primarily by vascular pericytes, and favors endothelial cell quiescence and stabilization when bound to the endothelial Tie2 receptor. Ang-2 is stored in endothelial Weibel-Palade bodies and released upon endothelial cell activation by stimuli including inflammatory cytokines. Ang-2 displaces Ang-1 from Tie2, resulting in activation of pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory pathways and increased microvascular permeability. The concentrations of Ang-2 and Ang-1 in serum from patients after CAR-T cell infusion were evaluated, and it was found that the serum Ang-2 concentration (p=0.0003) and the Ang-2:Ang-1 ratio (p=0.0014) were higher in patients with grade&#x2265;4 neurotoxicity compared to those with grade&#x2264;3 neurotoxicity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>). To confirm the presence of in vivo endothelial activation in patients with severe neurotoxicity, the serum concentration of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) antigen (vWF Ag) was evaluated, a glycoprotein in hemostasis that, like Ang-2, is also stored in Weibel-Palade bodies in endothelial cells and released in response to endothelial cell activation (Schwameis et al., <i>Thromb. Haemost. </i>113:708-18, 2015). Compared to patients without neurotoxicity or with grade0-3 neurotoxicity after infusion of CAR-modified T cells, those with grade&#x2265;4 neurotoxicity had higher concentrations of vWF Ag in serum (P=0.004), which in some patients was 4-5 fold higher than those observed in pooled serum from healthy donors (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>). IL8 was sequestered with vWF in Weibel-Palade bodies and was also elevated during severe neurotoxicity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref>).

Furthermore, in paired samples between day 0 and day 1 after CAR-T cell infusion, the magnitude of the change in Ang-2 concentration correlated with increasing severity of subsequent neurotoxicity (grade0-2, median 80 ng/mL; grade3, median 394 ng/mL; grade&#x2265;4, median 6,392 ng/mL; P=0.0039), indicating that endothelial activation occurs early after CAR-T cell infusion and precedes the onset of neurotoxicity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>).</p><p id="p-0154" num="0148">To determine whether endothelial cell activation is induced by serum from patients who had received CAR-T cell infusions, serum was collected from normal donors and from patients with neurotoxicity 3-5 days after CAR-T cell infusion and each were examined for their ability to induce endothelial cell activation. Serum from the patients with neurotoxicity was found to induce a higher formation of strings comprising platelets and vWF bound to human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) compared to serum from normal donors (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref> and data not shown). vWF-platelet string unit formation was examined in HUVECs incubated with serum collected at least 7 days after infusion of CAR-modified T cells. Lower vWF string unit formation was observed for serum from patients with grade&#x2265;4 neurotoxicity compared to serum from patients with grade0-3 neurotoxicity, despite the presence of higher concentrations of IL-6, IFN-&#x3b3;, Ang-2, and vWF Ag in patients with grade&#x2265;4 neurotoxicity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref>).

No evidence was found on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses to indicate that neurotoxicity after CD19-specific CAR-modified T cell therapy was associated with central nervous system (CNS) infection, and only one patient had concurrently detected CSF leukemia and neurologic signs. In CSF collected during acute neurotoxicity, a high protein concentration and leukocyte count was observed in comparison to CSF collected before lymphodepletion, consistent with increased permeability of the BBB (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>).

To determine whether increased BBB permeability during severe CRS would permit transit of serum cytokines into the CSF, cytokine concentrations were evaluated in paired blood and CSF samples before lymphodepletion and during acute neurotoxicity. Prior to lymphodepletion, there was a detectable cytokine concentration gradient between blood and CSF, with IFN-&#x3b3;, TNF-&#x3b1;, and TNF-&#x3b1; stabilizing soluble receptors, TNFR p55 and TNFR p75, being higher in blood (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref>). During acute neurotoxicity, the concentrations of IFN-&#x3b3;, TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-6, and TNFR p55 had increased and were comparable between serum and CSF, which indicated that either the BBB did not protect the CSF from high serum cytokine concentrations or there was local cytokine production in the CSF (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref>).</p><p id="p-0160" num="0154">High concentrations of cytokines in the CSF might activate brain vascular pericytes, which together with endothelial cells play an important role in maintenance of the BBB (Armulik et al., <i>Nature </i>468:557-61, 2010; Rustenhoven et al., <i>Trends Pharmacol.

This was confirmed by demonstrating that severe CRS was accompanied by high serum concentrations of VWF and Ang-2, which are released from Weibel-Palade bodies on endothelial activation. The mechanisms that lead to endothelial activation in CRS have not been characterized; however, the high serum concentrations of endothelium activating cytokines, such as IL-6 and IFN-&#x3b3; observed in patients with severe CRS suggest that these cytokines may contribute. The serum VWF and the Ang-2:Ang-1 ratio were also found to be higher prior to commencing CAR-T cell immunotherapy in patients who subsequently developed more severe CRS, indicating that pre-existing endothelial activation might be a previously unrecognized risk factor for severe CRS. It is noteworthy that thrombocytopenia before lymphodepletion chemotherapy was associated with subsequent severe CRS.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0172">The presence of vascular instability, capillary leak and a consumptive coagulopathy raised the possibility that endothelial activation might contribute to the clinical findings in patients with severe CRS. Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) is released from Weibel-Palade bodies on endothelial activation, and plays a key role in the initiation of coagulation. To determine whether in vivo endothelial activation was present in patients with severe CRS, serum concentrations of VWF at the peak of CAR-T cell expansion in blood was evaluated in a subset of patients (n=60; grade0 CRS, n=12; grade1-3 CRS, n=39; grade&#x2265;4 CRS, n=9), which showed that patients with grade&#x2265;4 CRS had higher VWF concentrations compared to those with grade&#x2264;3 CRS (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>J</figref>). The serum concentrations of Ang-2 was also evaluated, which is also released from Weibel-Palade bodies on endothelial activation and promotes capillary leak, which showed that, like VWF, Ang-2 concentrations were higher in patients with grade&#x2265;4 CRS (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref>). Ang-1 promotes endothelial stability and an increase in the Ang-2:Ang-1 ratio has been associated with morbidity and mortality in sepsis and cerebral malaria (Mikacenic et al., <i>PLoS One </i>10:1-13, 2015; Page and Liles, <i>Virulence </i>4:507, 2014; Page et al., <i>J.

Of note, before both lymphodepletion and CAR-T cell infusion, and on day 1 after CAR-T cell infusion, increasing serum VWF concentration was associated with increased severity of subsequent CRS (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref>). Furthermore, before lymphodepletion and on day 1 after CAR-T cell infusion an increased Ang-2:Ang-1 ratio was associated with a higher risk of developing grade&#x2265;4 CRS (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0183" num="0173">In an initial study of 10 patients, similar results were observed for Ang-2, Ang-1, Ang-2:Ang-1 ratio, platelet counts, sVCAM1 and sVCAM1:Ang-1 ratio (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>A-<b>16</b>G</figref>).

In addition, some patients who developed grade4-5 neurotoxicity (6, 9, 10) had high Ang-2:Ang-1 or sVCAM-1:Ang-1 ratios before chemotherapy (green) or before CAR-T cell infusion (red), providing an opportunity to modify chemotherapy or CAR-T cell dosing and re-evaluate risk before starting therapy.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0174">Together, these data indicate that biomarkers of endothelial activation are elevated during severe CRS, and that even prior to commencing lymphodepletion and CAR-T cell therapy endothelial activation might increase the risk of subsequent development of severe CRS.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0000">Patient and Treatment Characteristics Associated with Development and Severe CRS</p><p id="p-0186" num="0175">To identify patients at risk of developing CRS, univariate analyses of the impact of baseline characteristics on the development of any grade of CRS were performed. These analyses showed that patients with higher marrow tumor burden (P&#x3c;0.0001), a higher percentage of CD19<sup>+</sup> cells in the marrow (P=0.0001), and more severe thrombocytopenia (P=0.002) were at higher risk of developing CRS (Table A). Manufacturing of CAR-T cells using bulk CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells without selection of the central memory subset (P=0.001) and the infused CAR-T cell dose (P=0.002) were associated with increased risk of CRS. Despite our previous observation that addition of Flu to Cy in lymphodepletion enhanced in vivo CAR-T cell expansion (Turtle I and II, 2016), this was not associated with increased occurrence of CRS in univariate analysis. However, analysis of the interaction between CAR-T cell dose and Cy/Flu lymphodepletion showed that addition of Flu at any given CAR-T cell dose increased the risk of CRS (P=0.03). Stepwise multivariable analysis showed that higher bone marrow CD19<sup>+</sup> tumor burden (P&#x3c;0.0001), more severe thrombocytopenia (P=0.05), bulk CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell selection (P=0.03), Cy/Flu lymphodepletion (P=0.02), higher CAR-T cell dose (P=0.003), and the interaction effect of CAR-T cell dose and Cy/Flu lymphodepletion (P=0.009) were independently associated with development of CRS (Table A).

This strategy was effective in mitigating toxicity in B-ALL patients without impairing efficacy (see Turtle et al. I, 2016). However, logistic regression studies indicated that the therapeutic window was narrow and that a reduction in CAR-T cell dose that results in peak CD8<sup>+</sup> CAR-T cells&#x3c;10 cells/&#x3bc;L and CD4<sup>+</sup> CAR-T cells&#x3c;5/&#x3bc;L was likely to result in reduced efficacy. This is particularly true in NHL, in which the probabilities of CR in grade&#x2265;2 CRS and grade&#x2265;3 neurotoxicity were similar at any given peak CAR-T cell count.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0178">Consistent with the observation that Cy/Flu lymphodepletion and a high CAR-T cell dose were associated with severity of CRS, earlier and higher peaks in blood CAR-T cell counts in patients with grade&#x2265;4 CRS compared to grade1-3 or no CRS (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>D</figref>). To identify in each disease a therapeutic window of CAR-T cell counts that would minimize the risk of CRS and neurotoxicity while retaining a high probability of anti-tumor activity, logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between peak CAR-T cell counts in blood and the occurrence of toxicity or disease response (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>E-<b>12</b>H</figref>). In B-ALL patients achieving a peak of 10 CD8<sup>+</sup> CAR-T cells/&#x3bc;L, the probability of MRD<sup>&#x2212; </sup>CR was 95%, and the probabilities of grade&#x2265;2 CRS and grade&#x2265;3 neurotoxicity were 37% and 15%, respectively. Similar findings were noted for patients with 5 CD4<sup>+</sup> CAR-T cells/&#x3bc;L (MRD-CR, 94%; grade&#x2265;2 CRS, 42%; grade&#x2265;3 neurotoxicity, 19%). Reduction of the infused CAR-T cell dose in B-ALL patients with high marrow tumor burden were improved within in a narrow therapeutic window and were consistent targeting of peak CAR-T cell counts that were associated with high efficacy without undue toxicity (see Table 9).</p><p id="p-0194" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00012" num="00012"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 9</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Peak CAR-T Cell Level in Blood from B-ALL Patients Stratified by</entry></row><row><entry>Dose Level (DL) and Percentage of Blasts in Bone Marrow</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="77pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Dose level</entry><entry>DL2 (2 &#xd7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells/kg)</entry><entry>DL1 (2 &#xd7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/kg)</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="77pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>% Marrow Blasts (n)</entry><entry>&#x2264;5% (7)</entry><entry>&#x3e;5% (6)</entry><entry>&#x2264;5% (5)</entry><entry>&#x3e;5% (14)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Peak CAR-T cells/&#x3bc;l</entry><entry>25</entry><entry>315</entry><entry>10</entry><entry>35</entry></row><row><entry>CD8<sup>+</sup> Median [IQR]</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>[7.4, 260]</entry><entry>[109, 825]</entry><entry>[1.3, 15]</entry><entry>[15, 170]</entry></row><row><entry>CD4 <sup>+</sup>Median [IQR]</entry><entry>7.7</entry><entry>16</entry><entry>5.4</entry><entry>5.3</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>[4.4, 22]</entry><entry>[3.8, 27]</entry><entry>[1.3,9]</entry><entry>[1.3, 15]</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0195" num="0179">The probabilities of marrow response and toxicity in CLL patients were similar to those in B-ALL.

Classification-tree modeling was used to design a simple two-step algorithm to predict grade&#x2265;4 CRS, in which serum MCP-1 concentrations were measured only in patients with fever within 36 hours of infusion.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0181">We investigated whether patients who would subsequently develop life-threatening CRS could be identified early after CAR-T cell infusion when early intervention strategies might be instituted. All patients who developed grade CRS had fever&#x2265;38.9&#xb0; C. within the first 36 hours after CAR-T cell infusion; however, using fever&#x2265;38.9&#xb0; C. within 36 hours as an indication for intervention would have resulted in unnecessary treatment of 20 patients with grade&#x2264;3 CRS (sensitivity 1.00, specificity 0.84). Within 36 hours after CAR-T cell infusion IFN-&#x3b3;, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, MCP-1, TNFRp55, and MIP-1&#x3b2; concentrations were higher in serum from patients who developed grade&#x2265;4 CRS compared to grade&#x2264;3 CRS (P&#x3c;0.0001), which were further possible predictive biomarkers for grade&#x2265;4 CRS (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-<b>13</b>H</figref>). Classification tree modeling was performed, which showed that in patients with fever&#x2265;38.9&#xb0; C. within 36 hours of CAR-T cell infusion, a serum IL-6 concentration&#x2265;16 pg/mL, a serum MCP-1 concentration&#x2265;1343.5 pg/mL enhanced identification of patients who developed grade&#x2265;4 CRS (sensitivity 1.00, specificity 0.95) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>I</figref>). Using this approach, only 4.5% of patients (6/133) were misclassified as at high risk of grade&#x2265;4 CRS, 4 of whom developed grade CRS and/or neurotoxicity, indicating that the combination of fever with IL-6 and/or MCP-1 level would sensitively and specifically identify patients at risk of developing CRS and/or neurotoxicity (i.e., unnecessary intervention would be uncommon in patients who were less likely to develop moderate or severe CRS and/or neurotoxicity). We also investigated whether patients with pre-existing endothelial activation were at higher risk for neurotoxicity. Before lymphodepletion, patients who developed gr&#x2265;4 NT had higher Ang-2:Ang-1 ratios than those with gr&#x2264;3 NT, indicating that endothelial activation before lymphodepletion or CAR-T cell infusion can be used as a risk factor for neurotoxicity that identifies patients who would benefit from a modified treatment regimen.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0182">In general, in the following claims, the terms used should not be construed to limit the claims to the specific embodiments disclosed in the specification and the claims, but should be construed to include all possible embodiments along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled.
