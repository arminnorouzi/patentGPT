Specifically, the present invention relates to a biaxially oriented polyester film, which is suitable for secondary processing such as coating and vapor deposition to further enhance the functions thereof, and is an environmentally friendly polyester film obtained using polyester resin recycled from the market and society, including PET bottles (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;polyester resin recycled from PET bottles&#x201d; in some cases) as well as has little variations in physical properties in the longitudinal direction when being wound into a long film roll having a long winding length as well, and a production method therefor.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventionally, biaxially oriented polyester films have been widely utilized in a wide range of fields such as packaging materials and industrial materials because of their excellent mechanical strength, thermal properties, optical properties, and the like. Biaxially oriented polyester films exhibit excellent oxygen barrier properties, but there have been increasing demands for oxygen barrier properties and water vapor barrier properties related to denaturation and degradation of the contents and there is a problem that the contents are denatured and degraded in packaging applications for general food products, retort pouch food products, pharmaceuticals and the like.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Hence, measures are taken for biaxially oriented polyester films used in packaging applications for general food products, retort pouch food products, pharmaceuticals and the like to further improve the adhesive properties to printing ink and further improve the gas barrier properties such as oxygen barrier properties and water vapor barrier properties.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, as a method to improve gas barrier properties, there is a method in which a film formed of a resin exhibiting favorable gas barrier properties such as polyvinylidene chloride or polyethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer is pasted to a biaxially oriented polyester film, a method in which a thin film is laminated by applying a liquid in which these resins are dissolved, or a method in which a thin film is formed on the film surface by depositing a metal such as aluminum or a metal oxide such as aluminum oxide.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In particular, a vapor-deposited polyester film in which a metal oxide is provided on the film surface is excellent from the perspective of heat resistance and transparency in addition to gas barrier properties, and is thus often used.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, it has not been easy to industrially stably obtain a vapor-deposited polyester film, which exhibits favorable gas barrier properties and has a metal oxide thin film such as a silicon oxide or aluminum oxide film provided on the film surface.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Hence, the gas barrier properties of a vapor-deposited polyester film is improved by controlling the surface state of the biaxially oriented polyester film used as the base material of the vapor-deposited polyester film. A biaxially oriented polyester film in which the surface roughness of the center plane and the number of protrusions are prescribed (see, for example, Patent Document 1) and a biaxially oriented polyester film in which the surface roughness of the center line is prescribed (see, for example, Patent Document 2) have been proposed.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Furthermore, a biaxially oriented polyester film in which the number of fine protrusions each having a specific height or more is controlled has been proposed (see, for example, Patent Document 3).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">All of these films focus only on improving the gas barrier properties after a metal oxide thin film is provided, but it cannot be said that the improvement of wrinkles on the film roll and the adhesion between the films in the film roll, so-called blocking, when the film is wound into a film roll after production is sufficient. Moreover, the performance after secondary processing such as coating and vapor deposition has not also been sufficient.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In recent years, with the growing demand for the construction of a sound material-cycle society, the utilization of recycled raw materials has been promoted in the material field as well. In the polyester resins mentioned above as well, used beverage PET bottles are also recycled, and their utilization methods are attracting attention. It is said that the use of recycled PET bottles leads to CO2 reduction, and there is a desire to increase the usage ratio of recycled PET bottle raw materials from the perspective of the global environment as well.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">For example, Patent Document 4 discloses a biaxially oriented polyester film, which is a biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate film produced using a recycled PET bottle raw material and in which the melting resistivity at a temperature of 285&#xb0; C. is within 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>8 </sup>&#x3a9;&#xb7;cm and the contents of sodium and potassium contained in the film are more than 0 ppm and 150 ppm or less, respectively.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to such a technique, a biaxially oriented polyester film is obtained in which there are little residues of cleaning liquid components used when preparing recycled PET bottle raw materials, the thermal stability is excellent, there are few foreign substances, the resistivity at the time of melting is stable, and the productivity and quality of the film are not impaired.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">However, a vapor-deposited polyester film, which exhibits favorable gas barrier properties and has a metal oxide thin film such as a silicon oxide or aluminum oxide film provided on the film surface is not mentioned, and silica particles having an average particle size of 2.5 &#x3bc;m are used in order to improve easy slipperiness, but the maximum height Sz is likely to increase, there is a problem that the coating film and the inorganic thin film layer after the secondary processing are missing or defective on the surface of the biaxially oriented polyester film, and this has not been sufficiently considered. Environmentally friendly polyester films, which exhibit excellent transparency, are easily subjected to secondary processing such as coating and vapor deposition, exhibit excellent properties after secondary processing, and are produced using polyester resins recycled from the market and society, including PET bottles, have not yet been realized.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">As a means to obtain environmentally friendly polyester films, which exhibit excellent transparency, are easily subjected to secondary processing such as coating and vapor deposition, exhibit excellent properties after secondary processing, and are produced using polyester resins recycled from the market and society, including PET bottles, as described above, it can be expected to obtain the environmentally friendly polyester films by biaxially stretching polyester resin compositions in which polyester resin containing particles are blended with polyester resins recycled from the market and society, including PET bottles, and it is common to mix resin chips having normal specific gravity and resin chips, which contain particles and have a large specific gravity, to form a film. However, since the difference in specific gravity between the resin chips containing particles and the normal resin chips is large, the raw material ratio is likely to vary in the mixing and extrusion steps because of the segregation of these raw material resin chips, and the difference in physical properties in the longitudinal direction of the film is caused. As a result, there are cases where a product having uniform physical properties in the longitudinal direction of a long product roll is not obtained.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0015">Patent Document 1: JP-A-10-119172</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0016">Patent Document 2: JP-A-11-010725</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0017">Patent Document 3: JP-B-4834923</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0018">Patent Document 4: JP-A-2014-65282</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0019">An object of the present invention is to improve the problems of the prior art and to provide an environmentally friendly polyester film, which exhibits excellent transparency, is easily subjected to secondary processing such as coating and vapor deposition, exhibits excellent properties after secondary processing, and is produced using a polyester resin recycled from the market and society, including PET bottles, and a production method therefor. More suitably, an object of the present invention is to provide a biaxially oriented polyester film in which the usage ratio of recycled PET bottle raw materials is further increased and a production method therefor. Still more suitably, an object of the present invention is to provide a biaxially oriented polyester film containing few foreign substances and a production method therefor. Particularly suitably, an object of the present invention is to provide a biaxially oriented polyester film roll having little variations in physical properties in the longitudinal direction when being a long film roll having a long winding length as well, and a production method therefor.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0020">The present inventors have investigated the causes, which decrease the properties after secondary processing, as a result, found out that since a biaxially oriented polyester film has electrical insulation, static marks, which are locally charged parts, and static mark discharge marks due to the discharge of stored static electricity and the like are likely to be generated by contact with the transport roll, peeling off and the like in the film producing process and secondary processing process, and it is difficult for coated dissolved resin and vapor-deposited inorganic oxide molecules to form a thin film regularly and uniformly on the film surface without defects at this part.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0021">As a result of diligent studies, the present inventors have found out that in a biaxially oriented polyester film obtained by biaxially stretching a polyester resin composition in which a polyester resin containing particles is blended with a polyester resin recycled from the market and society, including PET bottles, it is possible to obtain a uniform film having little variations in physical properties in the longitudinal direction of the film by setting the angle of repose of the polyester resin pellets containing particles to a specific range and by supplying the polyester resin chips recycled from the market and society, including PET bottles to the hopper from above as well as supplying the polyester resin chips containing particles through a pipe (hereinafter, referred to as an inner pipe in some cases) having an outlet in the hopper and directly above the extruder when mixing the resin chips that are the raw materials, mixing both chips, and melting and extruding the mixture. In addition, the present inventors have found out that there are little residues of cleaning liquid components used particularly when alkaline cleaning is performed to remove foreign substances when preparing recycled raw materials from the market and society, including PET bottles to be used in the present invention, and there are few foreign substances as well as the adhesive properties between the polyester film and the sealant is improved by using polyester resin recycled from the market and society, including PET bottles. Furthermore, the present inventors have found out that it is possible to suppress the generation of locally strongly charged parts called static marks and discharge marks described above and improve the performance after secondary processing, for example, gas barrier properties by setting the number of fine protrusions each having a specific height or less on the film surface on the side where the coating film or the vapor-deposited film is formed to a specific number or more, and it is possible to improve the slipperiness between films by setting the number of fine protrusions each having a specific height or more and the shape of protrusions to specific ranges, and thus completed the present invention.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0022">In other words, the present invention has the following configuration.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0023">1.

By using a polyester resin recycled from the market and society, including PET bottles, it is possible to increase the ratio of recycled raw materials in the film and obtain an environmentally friendly film.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The polyester resin recycled from the market and society, including PET bottles, which is used in the biaxially oriented polyester film of the present invention, is mainly composed of a recycled product of a container mainly composed of polyethylene terephthalate. For example, recycled products of containers for beverages such as tea beverages and soft drinks can be preferably used, and these may be appropriately oriented, and are preferably colorless, but may contain some colored components.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The recycled raw material recycled from the market and society, including PET bottles, which can be preferably utilized, is polyester that is produced and molded by a normal polymerization method and a solid phase polymerization method, is preferably composed mainly of polyethylene terephthalate, and may contain other polyester components and copolymerization components. A metal compound such as antimony, germanium, or titanium may be contained as a catalyst, and a phosphorus compound as a stabilizer may be contained. Germanium is often used as a catalyst in polyester for PET bottles, and the film contains germanium at 1 ppm or more when the film is formed of a raw material recycled from PET bottles. However, the content of germanium is the content of the catalyst to the last, and is thus usually 100 ppm or less at most, and is usually 50 ppm or less.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The collected used recyclable PET bottles are sorted so as not to be mixed with other materials and garbage, labels and the like are removed from the PET bottles, and then the PET bottles are crushed into flakes. Foreign substances are often attached to or mixed in these flakes.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">A case is also conceivable where consumers have filled chemical substances such as chemicals and solvents in the used PET bottles for use. For example, detergents for tableware and the like, pesticides, herbicides, pesticides and various kinds of oils are conceivable. It is preferable to perform alkaline cleaning since the chemical substances adsorbed on the surface of PET bottles cannot be sufficiently removed by normal cleaning. As the solution of the alkali metal hydroxide used in this cleaning step, a sodium hydroxide solution or a potassium hydroxide solution is used. In such a cleaning step, pre-cleaning may be performed before alkaline cleaning.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">When alkaline cleaning is not performed, the chemical substances remain in the raw material resin as a foreign substance, thus these are mixed in and cause breakage during film formation, and this decreases the productivity, as well as the chemical substances remain in the film as a foreign substance and may cause the appearance of the film and printing omissions in the printing step performed later.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The concentration of the aqueous solution of an alkali metal hydroxide used in the cleaning step depends on the temperature, time, and stirring state but is usually in a range of 1 to 10% by weight. The time required for cleaning is in a range of 10 to 100 minutes, and it is preferable to perform the cleaning while performing stirring in order to enhance the effect.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">It is preferable to perform rinsing and drying subsequently to the alkaline cleaning. Alkaline cleaning and rinsing may be repeatedly performed several times. When the aqueous solution components of an alkali metal hydroxide used for cleaning in the alkaline cleaning step remains in the flakes, these components may affect the physical properties of the film finally obtained through the melt extrusion step in the subsequent pellet granulation step and the melt extrusion step at the time of film formation.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The concentration of sodium and potassium in the film finally obtained by using the polyester resin recycled from the market and society, including these PET bottles is preferably more than 0 ppm and 150 ppm or less, more preferably 3 to 120 ppm, still more preferably 5 to 80 ppm. It is not preferable that the concentration of sodium or potassium contained in the film is higher than 150 ppm since the heat resistance and thermal stability of the film decrease or the film is colored. It is not preferable that sodium or potassium is not contained at all since the effect of suppressing the production of diethylene glycol is diminished. There is a case where slight amounts of these components are contained in the polyester resin recycled from the market and society, including PET bottles, and it is difficult to completely remove these components.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In such a cleaning step, a part of the PET bottle flakes is hydrolyzed by the aqueous solution of an alkali metal hydroxide. The degree of polymerization of the resin decreases by heating performed when PET bottles are molded. Furthermore, the degree of polymerization decreases by the influence of heat and water added when the recovered PET bottles are crushed for reuse, then melted again, and pelletized. The resin can be reused as it is, but cannot be reused as it is in some cases since the moldability, strength, transparency, heat resistance and the like are inferior depending on the used application when the degree of polymerization is decreased.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In such a case, in order to restore the decreased degree of polymerization, it is preferable to conduct solid phase polymerization of the flakes of PET bottles, which have been crushed and cleaned, or flakes, which have been melted and pelletized.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The solid phase polymerization step can be carried out by performing continuous solid phase polymerization of washed flakes or flakes, which have been melt-extruded and pelletized, in an inert gas such as nitrogen gas or noble gas at 180 to 245&#xb0; C., preferably 200 to 240&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">It is desirable to conduct the solid phase polymerization by adjusting the conditions of the flakes or pellets so that the limiting viscosity of the polyester resin recycled from the market and society, including PET bottles is finally 0.55 to 0.90 dl/g, preferably 0.60 to 0.85 dl/g.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The step of pelletizing the flakes will be described. The flakes are melted, extruded, cooled and granulated using an extruder equipped with degassing and filtering means.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The melting step in the extruder can be carried out by performing melting and kneading at 260 to 300&#xb0; C., preferably 265 to 295&#xb0; C. The crushed flakes of PET bottles to be put are required to be sufficiently dried, it is preferable to perform drying at 5 to 200, preferably 10 to 100 ppm, more preferably 15 to 50 ppm. When the amount of water contained in the flakes is large, the hydrolysis reaction proceeds in the melting step, and the limiting viscosity of the obtained polyester resin decreases. As the degassing means, those having at least one vacuum vent in the melting zone of the resin are preferable.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The extruder preferably has a filter capable of filtering and removing solid foreign substances having a particle size of 25 &#x3bc;m or more, preferably 15 &#x3bc;m or more, more preferably 10 &#x3bc;m or more in the molten resin as a filtering means.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The molten resin that has passed through the filter passes through a die, is cooled in water, and then is cut into pellets having a desired shape, and granulated.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">[Polyester Resin Composition]</heading><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The biaxially oriented polyester film in the present invention is formed of a polyester resin composition containing the following polyester resin as a main component.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The polyester resin constituting the biaxially oriented polyester film of the present invention is a polymer synthesized from a dicarboxylic acid or an ester-forming derivative thereof and a diol or an ester-forming derivative thereof.

Examples of the diol component include diethylene glycol, hexamethylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, and cyclohexanedimethanol. Examples of the diol component also include polyoxyalkylene glycols such as polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol.

Among these, particles formed of silica (silicon oxide), calcium carbonate, or alumina (aluminum oxide), or particles formed of polymethacrylate, polymethylacrylate, or derivatives thereof are preferable, and particles formed of silica (silicon oxide) or calcium carbonate are more preferable, and inorganic particles formed of silica (silicon oxide) are particularly preferable.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The particle size distribution of the particles used in the present invention is preferably monodisperse.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The shape of the inorganic fine particles is not particularly limited, but as the shape is closer to a sphere, the number of fine protrusions each having a height of less than 3 nm can be increased without changing the number of fine protrusions each having a height of 3 nm or more and the arithmetic mean height Sa so much.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The weight average particle size of the particles in the present invention measured using a Coulter counter is preferably in a range of 0.8 to 1.8 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">When the weight average particle size of the particles is 0.8 &#x3bc;m or more, the number of fine protrusions each having a height of less than 3 nm and the arithmetic mean height Sa are likely to be set to the lower limit values of (1) and (3) or more, respectively.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">When the weight average particle size of the particles is 1.8 &#x3bc;m or less, it is easy to set the arithmetic mean height Sa to the upper limit of (3) or less and this is also suitable for setting the number of fine protrusions each having a height of less than 3 nm to the lower limit of (1) or more.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The lower limit of the content of particles in the polyester resin composition (masterbatch) containing particles in the present invention is 1,000 ppm by weight, more preferably 1300 ppm by weight, particularly preferably 1400 ppm by mass. When the particle content is 1,000 ppm by weight or more, it is easy to set the number of fine protrusions each having a height of less than 3 nm and the number of fine protrusions each having a height of 3 nm or more to the lower limits of (1) and (2) or more, respectively.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The upper limit of the content of particles is preferably 3,000 ppm by weight, more preferably 2,500 ppm by weight, still more preferably 2,200 ppm by weight, particularly preferably 1,800 ppm by weight.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The concentration of the inorganic particles in the masterbatch is preferably 7,000 to 400,000 ppm, more preferably 8,000 to 350,000 ppm, particularly preferably 9,000 to 300,000 ppm. When the concentration of the inorganic particles in the masterbatch is less than 7,000 ppm, the addition ratio of the masterbatch containing the inorganic particles becomes large, the proportion of polyester resin recycled from the market and society, including PET bottles, which are the main raw material, decreases, and inexpensive resin and resin properties for environmental consideration and the like are not effectively obtained. When the concentration of the inorganic particles in the masterbatch is greater than 400,000 ppm, the raw material ratio greatly fluctuates in the longitudinal direction because of segregation of the raw materials, and thus the variation in the longitudinal direction of the obtained film is likely to be large.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The angle of repose of the master pellet (masterbatch) is preferably 25 to 40 degrees, more preferably 30 to 40 degrees. When the angle of repose is larger than 40 degrees, segregation is likely to occur before being supplied to the extruder after being mixed with the polyester resin recycled from the market and society, including PET bottles, and the variation in the longitudinal direction of the obtained film is likely to be large. The angle of repose of the master pellet can be adjusted by changing the shape and size of the pellet. The angle of repose is smaller as the pellet is closer to a sphere, and the angle of repose is larger as the pellet is longer. The angle of repose is smaller as the pellet size is smaller.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">As the method for blending the particles into the polyester resin composition in the present invention, for example, the particles can be added at any stage of the stage of esterification for production of polyester-based resin, the stage after the termination of transesterification reaction, or the stage before the start of polycondensation reaction, but it is preferable to add the particles as a slurry dispersed in ethylene glycol or the like and to conduct the polycondensation reaction.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">It is also preferable to blend the particles by a method in which a slurry of particles dispersed in ethylene glycol, water or the like is blended with a polyester-based resin raw material using a kneading extruder with a vent or a method in which the dried particles are blended with a polyester-based resin raw material using a kneading extruder.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the step of mixing the particles with the polyester-based resin raw material, it is preferable to decrease the aggregates of particles as much as possible in order to stably obtain the desired surface state, but the influence can be diminished by adjusting the conditions in the step of forming the biaxially oriented polyester film after the mixing step.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The polyester resin composition in the present invention may contain a small amount of other polymers, antioxidants, heat stabilizers, anti-static agents, ultraviolet absorbers, plasticizers, pigments or other additives and the like as long as the object of the present invention is not impaired.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The polyester film obtained as described above preferably contains an isophthalic acid component in a content rate range of 0.02 mol % or more and 2.0 mol % or less with respect to 100 mol % of the total dicarboxylic acid components in the biaxially oriented polyester film.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Polyester, which is generally used for PET bottles, is subjected to crystallinity control in order to improve the appearance of bottles, and as a result, polyester containing an isophthalic acid component at 10 mol % or less is used in some cases.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Therefore, the polyester film of the present invention contains a certain amount of a material containing an isophthalic acid component. In the present invention, it is possible to further improve the adhesive strength when the film is bonded to a sealant by containing a specific amount of isophthalic acid component in the film.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The reason why the adhesive property to a sealant is improved by containing an isophthalic acid component in the film is not clear, but it is presumed that this is because the isophthalic acid-ethylene glycol unit is less likely to crystallize than a terephthalic acid-ethylene glycol unit, thus a large amount of amorphous components remain in the film, as a result, not only the film is easily modified by the surface treatment such as corona treatment, but also the very surface of the film is easily dissolved in the solvent, and the affinity of the film for the adhesive used to bond the sealant is enhanced.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The lower limit of the amount of the isophthalic acid component in the total dicarboxylic acid components constituting the polyester resin contained in the film is preferably 0.02 mol %, more preferably 0.05 mol %, still more preferably 0.1 mol %, particularly preferably 0.15 mol %. As mentioned earlier, some polyester resins recycled from the market and society, including PET bottles, contain a large amount of isophthalic acid, and thus it is less preferable that the isophthalic acid component constituting the polyester resin in the film is less than 0.02 mol % since it is difficult to produce a polyester film having a high ratio of recycled resin as a result. The upper limit of the amount of the isophthalic acid component in the total dicarboxylic acid components constituting the polyester resin contained in the film is preferably 2 mol %, more preferably 1.5 mol %, still more preferably 1.0 mol %. It is not so preferable that the amount exceeds 2.0 mol % since the crystallinity decreases and the mechanical strength as a film decreases in some cases. It is preferable to set the content rate of the isophthalic acid component to be in the above range since it is easy to fabricate a film having excellent laminating strength, shrinkage rate, and even thickness.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The upper limit of the limiting viscosity of the polyester resin recycled from the market and society, including PET bottles is preferably 0.9 dl/g, more preferably 0.8 dl/g, still more preferably 0.75 dl/g, particularly preferably 0.69 dl/g. It is not so preferable that the limiting viscosity exceeds 0.9 dl/g since it is difficult to discharge the resin from the extruder and the productivity decreases in some cases.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In the polyester film of the present invention, the lower limit of the content rate of the polyester resin recycled from the market and society, including PET bottles with respect to the total amount is preferably 50% by weight, more preferably 70% by weight, still more preferably 90% by mass, particularly preferably 100% by weight. When the content rate is less than 50% by weight, the content rate is poor in terms of utilization of recycled resin and it is not so preferable in terms of contribution to environmental protection. Here, the fact that the content rate of the recycled polyester resin is 100% by mass includes a case where particles are contained at 0.5% by mass or less (namely, a case where the content rate of the recycled polyester resin is 99.5% by mass or more). Polyester resins recycled from the market and society, including PET bottles, can also be used as a masterbatch (high concentration resin) used when lubricants such as inorganic particles and additives are added to improve the functions as a film.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">[Production Method for Biaxially Oriented Polyester Film]</heading><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The biaxially oriented polyester film of the present invention can be obtained by, for example, supplying and mixing the polyester resin chips recycled from the market and society, including PET bottles and chips of a polyester resin composition containing a polyester resin as a main component in an extruder equipped in a hopper, and then melt-extruding the mixture using the extruder to form an un-stretched sheet, and stretching the un-stretched sheet.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Suitable examples are described below, but the production method is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The film of the present invention may have a single-layer structure having at least one layer, or may have a laminated structure having two or more layers. The film of the present invention may have two layers, three layers, four layers, or five layers. In the case of two layers, the film is composed of laminated portion/base layer portion, and in the case of three layers, the film is composed of a laminated portion (A)/base layer portion/laminated portion (B). In the case of three layers, the laminated portion (A) and the laminated portion (B) may have the same composition and configuration or may have different compositions and, for example, a configuration of a particle-free layer/base layer portion/particle-containing layer. The laminated portion (A) and the laminated portion (B) may have substantially the same thickness or different thicknesses. Preferably, it is desirable that the laminated portion (A) and the laminated portion (B) are designed to have the same composition for easy production.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Next, in the film of the present invention, it is preferable that at least one layer of each of the above-mentioned layers constituting the film is biaxially oriented. Among the laminated structures having two or more layers, it is particularly preferable that all the layers are biaxially oriented. It is not so preferable that all layers are non-oriented or uniaxially oriented since it is difficult to use the film for body-wrapping labels.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">When the resin chips, which are raw materials, are mixed, it is preferable that the polyester resin chips recycled from the market and society, including PET bottles are supplied to the hopper from above as well as the chips of the polyester resin composition are supplied through the pipe having an outlet in the hopper and directly above the extruder (hereinafter, referred to as an inner pipe in some cases), both chips are mixed, and the mixture is melt-extruded. When the polyester resin chips recycled from the market and society, including PET bottles and the chips of the polyester resin composition are supplied to the hopper above the extruder in a mixed state, there is a possibility that the resin chips having different specific gravity and chip shapes cause segregation of raw materials in the hopper. In particular, there is a high concern that raw material segregation occurs at the place (the part that is slanted) where the inner wall of the hopper is not vertical. However, when the polyester resin composition is directly supplied to the directly upper part of the extruder in the hopper through the inner pipe, the raw material segregation can be diminished and the polyester film can be stably industrially produced although the resin chips have different specific gravity and chip shapes.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">An example of a specific mixing procedure is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an example of the relation between an extruder <b>2</b> equipped with a hopper <b>1</b> and an inner pipe <b>3</b>.

Examples of the solvating medium (solvent) used for forming the protective layer include aromatic solvents such as benzene and toluene; alcohol-based solvents such as methanol and ethanol; ketone-based solvents such as acetone and methyl ethyl ketone; ester-based solvents such as ethyl acetate and butyl acetate; and polyhydric alcohol derivatives such as ethylene glycol monomethyl ether.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0177">The urethane resin is preferable since the polar groups of the urethane bond interact with the inorganic thin film layer, the urethane resin also exhibits flexibility due to the presence of amorphous moieties, and thus the damage to the inorganic thin film layer can be suppressed even when a bending load is applied.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0178">The acid value of urethane resin is preferably in a range of 10 to 60 mg KOH/g. The acid value of urethane resin is more preferably in a range of 15 to 55 mg KOH/g, still more preferably in a range of 20 to 50 mg KOH/g. When the acid value of the urethane resin is in the above range, the liquid stability is improved when an aqueous dispersion is prepared, the protective layer can be uniformly deposited on the highly polar inorganic thin film, and thus the coating appearance is favorable.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0179">The urethane resin has a glass transition temperature (Tg) of preferably 80&#xb0; C. or more, more preferably 90&#xb0; C. or more. By setting Tg to 80&#xb0; C. or more, swelling of the protective layer due to molecular motion in the heat-moisture treatment process (temperature rise to temperature retention to temperature fall) can be diminished.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0180">As the urethane resin, it is more preferable to use a urethane resin containing aromatic or aromatic-aliphatic diisocyanate components as a main component from the viewpoint of improving the gas barrier properties.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0181">Among these, it is particularly preferable to contain a meta-xylylene diisocyanate component. By using the resin, the cohesive force of the urethane bond can be further increased by the stacking effect between the aromatic rings, and as a result, favorable gas barrier properties are obtained.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0182">In the present invention, the proportion of aromatic or aromatic-aliphatic diisocyanates in the urethane resin is preferably set to be in a range of 50 mol % or more (50 to 100 mol %) in 100 mol; of polyisocyanate component (F). The proportion of the total amount of aromatic or aromatic-aliphatic diisocyanates is preferably 60 to 100 mol %, more preferably 70 to 100 mol %, still more preferably 80 to 100 mol %. As such a resin, the &#x201c;TAKELAC (registered trademark) WPB&#x201d; series commercially available from Mitsui Chemicals, Inc. can be suitably used. When the proportion of the total amount of aromatic or aromatic-aliphatic diisocyanates is less than 50 mol %, there is a possibility that favorable gas barrier properties are not obtained.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0183">The urethane resin preferably has a carboxylic acid group (carboxyl group) from the viewpoint of improving the affinity for the inorganic thin film layer. In order to introduce a carboxylic acid (salt) group into the urethane resin, for example, a polyol compound having a carboxylic acid group such as dimethylolpropionic acid or dimethylolbutanoic acid as a polyol component may be introduced as a copolymerization component. When a carboxylic acid group-containing urethane resin is synthesized and then neutralized with a salt forming agent, a urethane resin in the form of an aqueous dispersion can be obtained. Specific examples of the salt forming agent include trialkylamines such as ammonia, trimethylamine, triethylamine, triisopropylamine, tri-n-propylamine, and tri-n-butylamine; N-alkylmorpholines such as N-methylmorpholine and N-ethylmorpholine; and N-dialkylalkanolamines such as N-dimethylethanolamine and N-diethylethanolamine.

For example, from the viewpoint of imparting moisture resistance, a multilayer film in which a resin such as an ethylene-cyclic olefin copolymer or polymethylpentene is interposed can be used. In the sealant layer, various additives such as a flame retardant, a slipping agent, an anti-blocking agent, an oxidation inhibitor, a light stabilizer, and a tackifier may be blended.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0189">The thickness of the sealant layer is preferably 10 to 100 &#x3bc;m, more preferably 20 to 60 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0190">Examples of the layer configuration of the laminate for packaging material obtained using the biaxially oriented polyester film of the present invention as the base film include base film/gas barrier layer/protective layer, base film/gas barrier layer/protective layer/adhesive layer/sealant layer, base film/gas barrier layer/protective layer/adhesive layer/resin layer/adhesive layer/sealant layer, base film/adhesive layer/resin layer/gas barrier layer/protective layer/adhesive layer/sealant layer, base film/gas barrier layer/protective layer/printing layer/adhesive layer/sealant layer, base film/printing layer/gas barrier layer/protective layer/adhesive layer/sealant layer, base film/gas barrier layer/protective layer/adhesive layer/resin layer/printing layer/adhesive layer/sealant layer, base film/adhesive layer/resin layer/printing layer/gas barrier layer/protective layer/adhesive layer/sealant layer, base film/printing layer/gas barrier layer/protective layer/adhesive layer/resin layer/adhesive layer/sealant layer, base film/printing layer/adhesive layer/resin layer/gas barrier layer/protective layer/adhesive layer/sealant layer, and base film/adhesive layer/resin layer/gas barrier layer/protective layer/printing layer/adhesive layer/sealant layer.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0191">The laminate obtained using the biaxially oriented polyester film of the present invention can be suitably used for applications such as packaged products, various label materials, lid materials, sheet molded products, and laminated tubes. In particular, the laminate is used for packaging bags (for example, pillow bags, pouches such as standing pouches and four side pouches).

Moreover, the film had a too large arithmetic mean height Sa, thus had a large external haze, and was inferior in transparency.</p><p id="p-0296" num="0304">The obtained film of Comparative Example 5 had the number of fine protrusions each having a height of 3 nm or more within the range, but had a small number of fine protrusions each having a height of less than 3 nm, thus had a high friction-charged electrostatic potential, and was poor in the static mark evaluation.</p><p id="p-0297" num="0305">In Example 11, since the particle content in the polyester resin composition containing particles was small, the usage ratio of recycled PET bottle raw materials was decreased slightly, but the film and the film roll were a film and a film roll having favorable physical properties as in Examples 6 to 10.</p><p id="p-0298" num="0306">In Reference Example 2, since the angle of repose of the pellets of the polyester resin composition containing particles was large, and the raw material ratio fluctuated greatly in the longitudinal direction because of the segregation of raw materials, the number of fine protrusions each having a height of 3 nm or more and the number of fine protrusions each having a height of less than 3 nm of the obtained film varied greatly in the longitudinal direction, it was possible to obtain a favorable film having physical properties equivalent to those in Examples 6 to 10 partially in the film roll, but the film roll was inferior as a film roll.</p><p id="p-0299" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00004" num="00004"><table
