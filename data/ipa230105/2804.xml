A non-exhaustive list of sample processing issues include, for example, the need to remove contaminants from the sample, compounds in the sample that inhibit nucleic acid amplification, the conditions needed to lyse certain pathogens of interest, and/or sample processing conditions that are not compatible with nucleic acid synthesis. There is a need in the art to reduce the amount of sample processing, the time sample processing takes before a sample can undergo amplification and to reduce the cost associated with sample processing.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Improvements in nucleic acid synthesis during nucleic acid amplification is another area of significant research. Much effort is being directed to improving the efficiency and/or speed by which nucleic acids are synthesized during nucleic acid amplification. There is significant interest in methods and compositions that can improve nucleic acid melting temperatures, the annealing process, and/or nucleic acid synthesis during nucleic acid amplification.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Additionally, a process for screening compounds that increase the melting temperature of nucleic acids, improve the annealing process and/or improve nucleic acid synthesis is an active area of research and the object of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods are currently being developed for point-of-care (POC) molecular diagnostic clinical testing applications.

In Ampiprobe amplification, the 2 primers in the PCR type amplification are brought into close proximity, causing the signal to decay as more amplicon is produced.

This panel was run as recommended, cycling from 95 C&#xb0; for 10 seconds, 68&#xb0; C. for 30 seconds, and reading the FAM, Hex, Rox and Cy5 channels after each cycle for 38 cycles.
