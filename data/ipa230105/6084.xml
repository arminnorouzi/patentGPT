The drawings are not necessarily to scale. It is to be understood that other embodiments are contemplated and may be made without departing from the scope or spirit of the present description. The following detailed description, therefore, is not to be taken in a limiting sense.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Light redirecting films (LRFs), such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,972,734 (Chen et al.), can be laminated onto the conducting tabbing ribbons (e.g., zinc plated copper tabbing ribbons) of (e.g., silicon) photovoltaic cells (e.g., solar cells), for example. The film can redirect/reflect light rays that would otherwise be absorbed or scattered by the tabbing ribbons to increase the captured power of the cell (e.g., by about 2%). Such films have typically included aluminum coated, 120 degree microreplicated prisms formed on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate with an adhesive on the PET substrate opposite the prisms for attaching the film to the tabbing ribbons. One of the downsides with traditional LRF film is that it exacerbates the problem of cell fracture/cracking upon thermal cycling since the presence of tabbing ribbons can cause stress on the photovoltaic cell and the LRF disposed on the tabbing on the tabbing ribbons can increase the stress. This problem can be addressed by increasing the thickness of the encapsulating material (typically ethylene-vinyl acetate) to counteract the stress. Attaching the LRF to the tabbing ribbons serves to further increase the stress, and so the thickness of the encapsulating material would need to be further increased to counteract the stress. The need to increase the thickness of the encapsulating material is a problem for traditional LRFs since the industry is driving towards thinner and thinner solar cells to minimize material costs.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to some embodiments of the present description, a thin (e.g., less than about 55 micrometers thick, not including any carrier layer or release layer that may be present) LRF is provided. The thin LRF can include an adhesive layer (e.g., a hot melt adhesive layer) disposed on a polymeric layer with an optically reflective (e.g., metal) layer disposed therebetween. In some embodiments, the LRF is mechanically stable (e.g., even though the LRF can be thin). For example, in some embodiments, bonding the LRF to a predetermined surface (e.g., a surface of a tabbing ribbon) by applying the adhesive layer to the predetermined surface and raising a temperature (e.g., to at least a bonding temperature and/or to at least a softening temperature of the adhesive layer) of at least portion(s) of the adhesive layer, and/or applying a pressure (e.g., of at least about 1 atmosphere or at least about 100 kPa) to at least portion(s) of the light redirecting film, changes an optical characteristic (e.g., diffuse reflectance or surface roughness or included prism angle) of the optically reflective layer by less than about 5%.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of a light redirecting film, according to some embodiments, including layers <b>200</b>, <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> and optionally layer <b>500</b>. In some embodiments, layer <b>200</b> is an adhesive layer, such as a hot melt adhesive layer, and layer <b>300</b> is a polymeric layer. In some embodiments, layers <b>200</b> and <b>300</b> are each polymeric layers (e.g., a first polymeric layer and a second polymeric layer, respectively) where layer <b>200</b> has a lower softening temperature than layer <b>300</b>. Layer <b>200</b> and/or layer <b>300</b> and/or layer <b>400</b> can be a unitary layer. Layer <b>200</b> has a structured major surface <b>201</b> and an opposite major surface <b>202</b> which is substantially planar in some embodiments. Layer <b>300</b> has a substantially planar major surface <b>303</b> and an opposite structured major surface <b>304</b>. A surface can be described as substantially planar if the surface is planar, or nominally planar (planar up to minor surface variations that would occur in normal manufacturing processes, for example), or planar up to minor surface variations that are small or negligible compared to those provided by the structures of the opposing structured major surface. Suitable materials for the layer <b>200</b> include the hot melt adhesives and other adhesives described elsewhere herein. Suitable materials for the layer <b>300</b> include thermoplastic olefin (TPO) polymers and copolymers (including, for example, linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) or high-density polyethylene (HDPE)), fluoropolymers (e.g., polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)) or fluoropolymer blends, cyclic olefin copolymers, or blends thereof, for example. Such polymers have refractive indices similar to encapsulants used in solar cell applications and are photochemically stable to wavelengths experienced in solar cell applications. Other suitable materials for layer <b>300</b> include polycarbonate, (co)polyester (polyester or copolyester), or combinations thereof, optionally blended with one or more other polymers or copolymers described elsewhere for layer <b>300</b> to lower the refractive index, for example. Suitable TPO resins include TPX Grade DX310, a 4-methylpentene-1-based olefin copolymer (also known as polymethylpentene) available from Mitsui Chemicals America, Inc. (Rye Brook, N.Y. 10573 USA), and HD6719, a high density polyethylene copolymer available from Exxon Mobil Chemical (Baytown, Tex. 77520 USA).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Layer <b>400</b> is disposed between the structured major surfaces <b>201</b> and <b>304</b>. Layer <b>400</b> can be one or more an optically reflective layer, a metal layer, or a dielectric reflector. In some embodiments, layer <b>400</b> is an optically reflective layer. In some embodiments, the optically reflective layer is electrically conductive. In some embodiments, the optically reflective layer is or incudes a metal layer. The metal layer can include one or more of silver, gold and aluminum. For example, the metal layer can be an aluminum layer.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Layer <b>500</b> can be a carrier layer and/or a release layer and can be present prior to bonding the light redirecting film to a surface and then can be subsequently removed. Layer <b>500</b>, when included, can be formed from any polymer that provides a desired peel force with layer <b>300</b>. For example, the material for layer <b>500</b> can be selected to be a polymer that is incompatible with the material of layer <b>300</b> so that the layer <b>500</b> can readily separate from the layer <b>300</b>. In some embodiments, layer <b>500</b> is or includes polycarbonate or (co)polyester based resins. Suitable materials for layer <b>500</b> include MARKROLON 2407, a polycarbonate available from Covestro North America (Pittsburgh, Pa. 15205 USA), and EASTAR GN071 is a copolyester available from Eastman Chemical Company (Kingsport, Tenn. 37660 USA).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Structured major surfaces <b>201</b> and <b>304</b> include structures <b>210</b> and <b>310</b>, respectively. The structures <b>210</b> and/or <b>310</b> can be arrays of structures and/or can be (e.g., linear) microstructures extending in a first direction (x-direction) and arranged along an orthogonal second direction (y-direction). For example, the microstructures can be linear prisms. As another example, the microstructures can extend primarily along a first axis but can have a lateral displacement from the first axis that can vary along the length of the microstructures such that the microstructures have a &#x201c;wavy&#x201d; shape as described in U.S. Pat. Appl. Pub. No. 2018/0040757 (O'Neill et al.). Such &#x201c;wavy&#x201d; microstructures can be described as extending along a first direction and can be arranged along an orthogonal second direction such that the microstructures are substantially parallel. A microstructure can have at least two orthogonal dimensions (e.g., a height, h, and a width, W) that are each greater than about 10 nm and less than about 1 mm. A microstructure can have a third dimension (e.g., the length L schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) greater than about 1 mm, for example. In some embodiments, the major surfaces <b>201</b> and <b>304</b> face and substantially conform to one another (e.g., nominally conform to one another or conform up to variations on a scale of about the thickness of layer <b>400</b> or smaller, for example).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, the structures <b>210</b> are a plurality of substantially parallel microstructures (e.g., within 10 degrees or within 5 degrees of parallel).

In some embodiments, each of the average values D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> are in a range of 110 degrees to 130 degrees. In some embodiments, one or both of the average values D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> is about 120 degrees. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic plan view of the structured major surface <b>201</b>, according to some embodiments, schematically illustrating structures <b>210</b> extending in the first direction (x-direction) and arranged along the orthogonal second direction (y-direction).

The hot melt adhesive layer <b>200</b>, the polymeric layer <b>300</b> and the optically reflective layer <b>400</b> can be co-extensive or substantially co-extensive with each other. Layers can be described as substantially co-extensive with each other if at least about 60% of one layer is co-extensive with at least about 60% of the other layer. In some embodiments, for layers describes as substantially co-extensive, at least about 80% or at least about 90% of one layer is co-extensive with at least about 80% or at least about 90% of the other layer. In some embodiments, the structured first (<b>201</b>) and fourth (<b>304</b>) major surfaces conform to each other.

In some embodiments, the optical characteristic of the optically reflective layer <b>400</b> is an average diffuse reflectance (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) of the optically reflective layer <b>400</b>. The average diffuse reflectance can be an average over an area of the reflective layer and an average over wavelengths in a range of about 450 nm to about 650 nm, or from about 350 nm to about 1100 nm, or from about 350 nm to about 1500 nm, for example. In some embodiments, the optical characteristic of the optically reflective layer <b>400</b> is an average surface roughness of the optically reflective layer <b>400</b> (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>).

The bonding temperature can be associated with a thermal transition temperature of the hot melt adhesive (e.g., the bonding temperature can be the thermal transition temperature, or the bonding temperature can be somewhat (e.g., about 10&#xb0; C. or about 20&#xb0; C.) greater than the thermal transition temperature). The thermal transition temperature can be a glass transition temperature, a melting temperature, or a softening temperature, for example. In some embodiments, the bonding temperature is no less than the thermal transition temperature. For example, for crystalline or semi-crystalline hot melt adhesives, the bonding temperature can be the melting temperature or can be about 10&#xb0; C. greater than the melting temperature. As another example, for amorphous hot melt adhesives that don't have a sharply defined melting point, the bonding temperature can be the softening temperature or can be about 10&#xb0; C. greater than the softening temperature. In some embodiments, the bonding temperature is at least about 50&#xb0; C., or is in a range of about 50&#xb0; C. to about 120&#xb0; C., for example.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The melting temperature can be determined according to D3418-15 &#x201c;Standard Test Method for Transition Temperatures and Enthalpies of Fusion and Crystallization of Polymers by Differential Scanning calorimetry&#x201d;, for example. The softening temperature can be determined according to ASTM D693-11 &#x201c;Standard Test Methods for Softening Point of Hydrocarbon Resins and Rosin Based Resins by Automated Ring-and-Ball Apparatus&#x201d;, or according to ASTM D1525-17e1 &#x201c;Standard Test Method for Vicat Softening Temperature of Plastics&#x201d;, or according to ASTM D6090-17 &#x201c;Standard Test Method for Softening Point Resins (Mettler Cup and Ball Method)&#x201d;, or according to ASTM E2347-16 &#x201c;Standard Test Method for Indentation Softening Temperature by Thermomechanical Analysis&#x201d;, for example.

Hot melt adhesives are applied in the molten state and form a bond upon cooling to a solid state. Suitable hot melt adhesives include those that include ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer, polyolefin, metallocene polyolefin (e.g., metallocene polyethylene), polyamide, polyester, polyurethane, or styrene block copolymer, for example. These materials can be blended with tackifier(s). For example, an EVA-based hot melt adhesive can include EVA blended with terpene-phenol resin (TPR) tackifier. Suitable EVA-based hot melt adhesives are available from 3M Company, St. Paul, Minn. or from Dow Chemical Company, Midland, Mish., for example. Exemplary EVA-based hot melt adhesives include ELVAX 3180 and ELVAX 3175, both available from Dow Chemical Company. Suitable polyolefin-based adhesives include amorphous polyolefin hot melt adhesives, for example. Other suitable hot melt adhesives include copolymers of ethylene and methyl acrylate such as ELVALOY 1224 available from Dow Chemical Company.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, the hot melt adhesive layer is substantially cross-linked. The hot melt adhesive layer can be substantially cross-linked (e.g., cross-linked to at least the extent that a modulus (e.g., Young's modulus) increases by at least about 5%, for example) by electron-beam (e-beam) cross-linking, for example. After cross-linking, the adhesive layer is still a hot melt adhesive layer having a bonding temperature and/or a thermal transition temperature (e.g., a softening temperature and/or a melting temperature) that can be determined as described elsewhere. It has been found that crosslinking improves the adhesion force with a tabbing ribbon, for example, and can provide improved mechanical stability of the light redirecting film. The polymeric layer <b>300</b> can also, or alternatively, be substantially cross-linked to provide improved mechanical stability, for example.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, the hot melt adhesive is pressure sensitive such that when bonded at a temperature at or above the bonding temperature, the bond strength is improved by applying pressure during bonding. The pressure can be at least about 1 atmosphere (about 100 kPa), or at least about 2 atmospheres, or in a range of about 1 atmosphere to about 5 atmospheres, for example. The pressure will be understood to be relative to ambient atmospheric pressure so that applying a pressure of 1 atmosphere, for example, means that the applied pressure is 1 atmosphere above ambient pressure.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of a temperature T.

In some embodiments, layer <b>500</b> is included to provide support for the layer <b>300</b> which, in some embodiments, is difficult to handle or process without the layer <b>500</b> due to the thinness of the layer. In some embodiments, the layers <b>300</b> and <b>500</b> are formed together by coextrusion, layer <b>400</b> is then deposited on the structured surface <b>304</b> (e.g., layer <b>400</b> can be an aluminum or other metal layer deposited by sputtering or evaporative deposition), layer <b>200</b> is then deposited onto layer <b>400</b>. For example, layer <b>200</b> can be extruded onto layer <b>400</b> at a temperature above the softening temperature of the layer <b>200</b> and cast against a chill roll, which can have a flat or roughened surface. As another example, layer <b>200</b> can be formed by laminating a film adhesive to the surface of layer <b>400</b> by thermally embossing the film at a nip using layer <b>400</b> to form structures in film (e.g., using layer <b>400</b> as an &#x201c;embossing roll&#x201d;). A surface treatment (e.g., oxygen plasma treatment) can be applied to the structured surface <b>304</b> of the layer <b>300</b> prior to depositing the layer <b>400</b> to improve adhesion. After the layers <b>200</b> and <b>300</b> are formed, one or both of the layers may be cross-linked as described elsewhere.

For example, the layer <b>500</b> can be removed from the layer <b>300</b> without substantially damaging the layer <b>400</b> since the bonding of the layer <b>400</b> to the layer <b>200</b> is substantially stronger than the bonding of the layer <b>300</b> to the layer <b>500</b>, in some embodiments. In some embodiments, a bonding strength between the polymeric layer <b>300</b> and the optically reflective layer <b>400</b> is also greater than a bonding strength between the carrier layer <b>500</b> and the polymeric layer <b>300</b>.

Useful materials for the first polymeric layer <b>200</b> include the hot melt adhesives described elsewhere herein and adhesives described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,972,734 (Chen et al.), for example. An adhesive is a pressure sensitive adhesive when it is a pressure sensitive adhesive for at least one temperature. For example, an adhesive or a polymer layer may be a pressure sensitive adhesive at an elevated temperature (e.g., at about 50&#xb0; C. or higher) but not at room temperature. Pressure sensitive adhesives possess certain properties at for the at least one temperature including the following: (1) aggressive and permanent tack, (2) adherence with no more than finger pressure, (3) sufficient ability to hold onto an adherend, and (4) sufficient cohesive strength to be removed cleanly from the adherend. Pressure sensitive adhesives are known in the art and are described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,972,734 (Chen et al.), for example.

The structural bonding layer can be applied to a surface and then heated to cross-link the layer. The structural bonding layer can initially soften when heated and then subsequently harden as the layer is cross-linked. In some embodiments, the structural bonding layer is a heat activated layer that is non-tacky at room temperature and that becomes tacky at elevated temperature before cross-linking. In some embodiments, the structural bonding layer is a pressure sensitive adhesive when initially applied to the predetermined surface. Such adhesives are described in U.S. Pat.

Suitable structural adhesives include hybrid adhesives, such as epoxy/acrylate hybrid adhesives, where at least one monomer or oligomer component is initially cured to form a structural bonding layer and at least one other monomer or oligomer component is subsequently cured after the structural bonding layer has been applied to a surface. For example, an epoxy/acrylate hybrid adhesive can be coated onto layer <b>400</b> and then can be ultraviolet (UV) cured to cure acrylate monomers to form a structural adhesive layer. The structural adhesive layer can then be applied to a surface and then heated to cure the epoxy monomers or oligomers. Suitable hybrid adhesives are described in U.S. Pat. Appl. Pub.
