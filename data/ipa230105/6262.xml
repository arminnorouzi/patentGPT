A secondary battery generally includes battery members such as a positive electrode, a negative electrode, and a separator that isolates the positive electrode and the negative electrode from each other and prevents short circuiting between the positive and negative electrodes.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Known secondary battery structures include a stacked structure in which a positive electrode, a separator, and a negative electrode are stacked alternately and a wound structure in which an elongated positive electrode, separator, and negative electrode are overlapped and then wound up concentrically. In particular, stacked secondary batteries have been attracting interest in recent years from a viewpoint of having excellent energy density, safety, quality, and durability.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In production of a secondary battery, a battery member having adhesive material at a surface thereof may be produced, and this battery member may then be affixed to another battery member, for example.

Particularly in the case of large batteries that are for in-vehicle use or like, when the secondary battery includes electrode tabs such as a positive electrode tab connected to a positive electrode and a negative electrode tab connected to a negative electrode, deposition of metal such as lithium has a high tendency to occur around a location where an electrode tab is connected at an electrode surface due to concentration of current at that location. Since reduction of capacity and short circuiting between electrodes may occur when metal is deposited at the surface of an electrode in a secondary battery, it is desirable to inhibit such metal deposition at electrode surfaces.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, there is room for improvement of a conventional secondary battery such as described above in terms of inhibiting metal deposition at an electrode surface during charging.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, an object of the present disclosure is to provide a secondary battery in which metal deposition at an electrode surface during charging is inhibited.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The inventors conducted diligent investigation to achieve the object set forth above. The inventors discovered that it is possible to inhibit metal deposition at an electrode surface during charging of a secondary battery by, at a surface Z that is either or both of an affixing surface X of a positive electrode and a separator and an affixing surface Y of a negative electrode and a separator, setting the resistance A per unit area of a region P that has a rectangular shape having a connecting side of a positive electrode tab or a negative electrode tab and a line segment a specific distance from the connecting side as one pair of opposite sides as larger than the resistance B per unit area of a region Q other than the region P.

For example, a material that forms a current collector of the electrode may be caused to protrude from the periphery of the electrode such as to form the electrode tab. More specifically, the electrode tab can be formed by, in production of the electrode, forming an electrode mixed material layer on a current collector such that a region where the electrode mixed material layer is not formed is provided at an end section of the current collector and subsequently performing cutting or the like of this region to a desired shape.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In terms of arrangement of the positive electrode tab <b>44</b> and the negative electrode tab <b>28</b> in plan view of the surface Z, the positive electrode tab <b>44</b> and the negative electrode tab <b>28</b> may be disposed at a side corresponding to the same edge of a surface Z that is rectangular as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, but this is not a limitation, and the positive electrode tab <b>44</b> and the negative electrode tab <b>28</b> may be disposed at sides corresponding to different edges of the surface Z.

However, the laminate in the presently disclosed secondary battery is not limited to this configuration.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">A feature of the presently disclosed secondary battery is that the resistance A per unit area of the above-described electrode tab-bordering region P is larger than the resistance B per unit area of a region Q (other region Q) other than the electrode tab-bordering region P at the surface Z. By setting the resistance A per unit area of the electrode tab-bordering region P as larger than the resistance B of the region Q other than the electrode tab-bordering region P at the surface Z in this manner, metal deposition at an electrode surface during charging of the secondary battery can be inhibited.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Note that the presently disclosed secondary battery should satisfy either or both of: (i) the resistance A<b>1</b> per unit area of the positive electrode tab-bordering region P<b>1</b> being larger than the resistance B<b>1</b> per unit area of another region Q<b>1</b> that is a region other than the positive electrode tab-bordering region P<b>1</b> at the surface Z; and (ii) the resistance A<b>2</b> per unit area of the negative electrode tab-bordering region P<b>2</b> being larger than the resistance B<b>2</b> per unit area of another region Q<b>2</b> that is a region other than the negative electrode tab-bordering region P<b>2</b> at the surface Z. From a viewpoint of further inhibiting metal deposition at an electrode surface during charging of the secondary battery, the presently disclosed secondary battery preferably satisfies both (i) and (ii) set forth above.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Although it is not clear why metal deposition at an electrode surface during charging of the secondary battery can be inhibited by setting the resistance A per unit area of the electrode tab-bordering region P as larger than the resistance B per unit area of the other region Q, the reason for this is presumed to be as follows.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Firstly, current flows at the surface Z during charging of the secondary battery, and locations of high current density at the surface Z are prone to deposition of metal such as lithium. In the case of a conventional secondary battery in which a value for the resistance A of an electrode tab-bordering region P is equal to or less than a value for the resistance B of the secondary battery, and particularly in the case of a large battery for in-vehicle use or the like, current density is thought to be high and deposition of metal is thought to have a high tendency to occur in the electrode tab-bordering region P because this region is close to an electrode tab that is responsible for input/output of electrical power.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In response to this issue, the presently disclosed secondary battery makes it possible to equalize current density of the overall secondary battery during charging as a result of the resistance A per unit area of the electrode tab-bordering region P being set as larger than the resistance B per unit area of the other region Q. This is thought to enable reduction of deposition of metal such as lithium in the electrode tab-bordering region P. It is presumed that for this reason, metal deposition at an electrode surface can be inhibited during charging of the secondary battery.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">A ratio (A/B) of the resistance A per unit area of the electrode tab-bordering region P and the resistance B per unit area of the other region Q is required to be more than 1, is preferably more than 1.005, and more preferably more than 1.01, and is preferably less than 2, and more preferably less than 1.5. Through the ratio (A/B) of the resistance A per unit area of the electrode tab-bordering region P and the resistance B per unit area of the other region Q being more than 1, it is possible to sufficiently inhibit metal deposition at an electrode surface during charging of the secondary battery. On the other hand, when the ratio (A/B) of the resistance A per unit area of the electrode tab-bordering region P and the resistance B per unit area of the other region Q is less than 2, output characteristics of the secondary battery can be improved.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Note that the resistance A per unit area of the electrode tab-bordering region P and the resistance B per unit area of the other region Q can be adjusted through the ratio of coverage of adhesive material in each of these regions, the type of polymer used as the adhesive material, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">[Adhesive Material]</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">An adhesive material is normally present at the surface Z (affixing surface X and/or Y).
