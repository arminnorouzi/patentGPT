The second connecting assembly <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> includes the second connecting member <b>2</b>-<b>20</b> and the fixing assembly <b>2</b>-<b>21</b>.

For example, to install an air filter assembly (e.g., <b>22</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref> above with or without the inertia separators) on a turbine engine, the first connecting assembly <b>2</b>-<b>1</b> above may be disposed on the turbine engine or air intake frame of the turbine engine, and the second connecting assembly <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> may be disposed on the air filter, such that the fixing assembly <b>2</b>-<b>21</b> is configured to connect the second connecting member <b>2</b>-<b>20</b> and the first connecting assembly <b>2</b>-<b>1</b> on the turbine engine or the air intake frame of the turbine engine, and the fixing assembly <b>2</b>-<b>21</b> is locked on the second connecting assembly <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> by means of the locking portion <b>2</b>-<b>3</b>. Therefore, an operator only needs to operate the fixing assembly <b>2</b>-<b>21</b> to disassemble or assemble the turbine engine and the air-filter. A plurality of connecting structures <b>2</b>-<b>300</b> may be further implemented, and the plurality of connecting structures <b>2</b>-<b>300</b> may be disposed at intervals in an extending direction of the turbine engine or air intake frame of the turbine engine.

The bracket <b>2</b>-<b>5</b> is connected with the turbine engine or air intake frame of the turbine engine, and may be positioned between two adjacent connecting structures <b>2</b>-<b>300</b>. A sealing gasket <b>2</b>-<b>6</b> is further disposed between the air pre-filter and the turbine engine or air intake frame of the turbine engine. The sealing gasket <b>2</b>-<b>6</b> may be annular. By disposing the sealing gasket <b>2</b>-<b>6</b>, leakage of air flow between the air filter assembly and the turbine engine or air intake frame of the turbine engine is avoided. The air filter assembly may or may not include an inertia separator.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some example implementations, the second connecting member <b>2</b>-<b>20</b> is rotatably disposed around a first predetermined axis.

The first predetermined axis and the second predetermined axis are staggered. In this way, the fixing assembly <b>2</b>-<b>21</b> is configured to drive the second connecting member <b>2</b>-<b>20</b> to move, and meanwhile rotates relative to the second connecting member <b>2</b>-<b>20</b> to be connected with the locking portion <b>2</b>-<b>3</b>.
