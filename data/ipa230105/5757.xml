The conductive surface of the pad may contact the dielectric layer. By configuring the dielectric layer to cover the side surface of the chip on which the plurality of pads are disposed, airtightness of the chip may be improved. At the same time, the dielectric layer covers the plurality of pads, such that surfaces of the pads may be prevented from being exposed to the air to be oxidized to form an oxidation layer.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an embodiment, the dielectric layer may be polyimide or photoresist. The polyimide or photoresist may be configured to cover the side surface of the chip on which the plurality of pads are disposed, such that the polyimide or the photoresist may contact the side surface of the chip and the conductive surface of the pad. The dielectric layer may cover the entire exposed surfaces of the pads so that the surfaces of the pads may not contact the air. In detail, the polyimide or the photoresist may be provided in a fluid form and coated to the side surface of the chip on which the plurality of pads are disposed.

Further, an appearance of the chip, articulated leads, and the like, may be maintained.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In another embodiment, the dielectric layer may be resin. The resin may cover the side surface of the chip on which the plurality of pads are disposed, such that the resin may contact the side surface of the chip and the conductive surface of the pad. In detail, the resin may be coated on the side surface of the chip on which the pads are disposed, and the resin may be heated and cured to form the dielectric layer. In this way, the resin may cover the side surface of the chip on which the pads are disposed, which may prevent the oxidation layer on the surfaces of the pads and the surface of the chip from being corroded by the solution, and the chip may be packaged.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to the present disclosure, the dielectric layer may cover the side surface of the chip on which the pads are disposed, and the conductive surface of the pad may contact the dielectric layer. The dielectric layer covering the side surface of the chip and the conductive surface of the pad does not need to be partially removed by etching. Therefore, while improving the airtightness of the package chip to avoid the pad from being oxidized by air contact, the etching process performed on the pad may be avoided, such that the surface of the chip may be avoided from being corroded by the etching solution, which may lead to the short circuit.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flow chart of a method of manufacturing a rewired packaged chip according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In an operation S<b>201</b>, a chip may be provided.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">After the packaged chip from an upstream manufacturer is passed to the downstream vendor, a further process may need to be performed.

The first dielectric layer may be formed by performing the heat process or the UV curing process on the polyimide or the photoresist. The second dielectric layer may be formed by curing the resin. Alternatively, before curing the resin, cleaning by acidic or alkaline solution may be performed to remove surface impurities, preventing the impurities from affecting chip performance. As the first dielectric layer may contact the side surface of chip and the conductive surface of the pad, the airtightness of the chip may be improved, and the chip may be prevented from being damaged by the etching solution. At the same time, the first dielectric layer may prevent the surface of the pad from being exposed to the air to be oxidized to form an oxidation layer. The second dielectric layer may be configured to package the chip to protect the chip circuit from being corroded by the impurities in the air, which may result in decreasing in the electrical performance of the chip.

The packaged chip may be connected to the external components through the pads.

In detail, the through hole is defined in the first dielectric layer and the second dielectric layer at the position corresponding to the pad. The second dielectric layer may be formed by curing resin. Therefore, the resin of the second dielectric layer at the position corresponding to the pad may be removed by a laser drilling process. The first dielectric layer may be formed by performing the heating process on the polyimide or the photoresist or performing the UV curing process on the polyimide or the photoresist to cure the polyimide or the photoresist. Therefore, the polyimide or the photoresist of the first dielectric layer at the position corresponding to the pad may be removed by a plasma or a UV laser process, such that the through hole is defined. The through hole may be a laser burnt hole or a plasma bombarded hole, and thus unlike a solution etched hole. A wall of the through hole defined in the present disclosure may be have an axially flat surface. In the present disclosure, the position of the through hole may be determined by the laser drilling process. The through hole may further be defined precisely by the plasma or the UV laser process without damaging the pads. At the same time, the through hole may be defined at any position of the pads. In the present disclosure, an area that is allowed to define the through hole may be larger, and the through hole may be defined more accurately.
