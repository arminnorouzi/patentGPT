For example, one might leave for a trip and forget to pack their medication, have their prescription stolen, lose their prescription, or not realize that they only have a two-day supply left in their current prescription, but they are scheduled to be gone for a week. In such cases and others, it may be difficult to obtain needed medications. Even where a prescription is available (new, refill, or the like), it may not be desirable to fully transfer a prescription to another pharmacy. In some cases, the transfer may take several days. For example, transferring pharmacies sometimes have little motivation to move a prescription from their business such that transfers are a low priority item. Indeed, in some cases no refills are even left for a pharmacy to act on. Getting in contact with the prescribing physician to have a new prescription issued at a new pharmacy is time consuming and may then require later transferring the new prescription back to the original pharmacy. This difficulty is sometimes compounded by the fact that access to the medication may be critical to ensuring appropriate care and continued health. As another example, an ongoing global pandemic may leave a patient stranded in a remote location or otherwise render an in-person consultation less than desirable. In such cases, a prescription (new, refill, or the like) may be difficult or impossible to otherwise obtain.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, the prescription and dispensation of medication is fraught is fraud. Addicts will stop at little to obtain narcotics or other medications. These addicts will often go so far as to fake symptoms and injuries in the pursuit of drugs. While telemedicine is one way in which patients might remotely consult with a healthcare provider to obtain needed prescriptions, refills, or the like, the remote nature of telehealth consultation brings added risks for fraud. Besides fraud, mistakes and misunderstandings do occur regarding underlying symptoms, conditions, diagnoses, and the like which are used to justify a prescription. Gathering evidence to support prescription of medication may reduce the likelihood of fraud, mistake, and misunderstanding and protect the patient and healthcare provider should such an accusation regarding the same be later made. Therefore, what is needed is a system and method for providing global accessibility to evidence supported, telehealth prescribed medications.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Systems and methods for providing global accessibility to telehealth prescribed medications are disclosed herein. A patient may schedule a consultation with a healthcare provider. The consultation may take place by way of telephonic and/or videographic means, though such is not required. During or following the consultation, the healthcare provider may elect to prescribe one or more medications as part of a new prescription, a refill, or the like. Such prescriptions may be uploaded to a prescription database. In exemplary embodiments, the prescriptions are coupled with evidence of the underlying disease, condition, or injury observed or otherwise collected by the healthcare provider in conjunction with the consultation, though such is not required. For example, without limitation, the evidence may comprise photos of an injury or other condition. Alternatively, or additionally, the evidence may comprise test results, medical imaging results, self-reported symptoms, some combination thereof, or the like. The evidence may be uploaded to the patient prescription database and associated with the prescription.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The prescriptions may reside electronically on the prescription database. The patient prescription database may be the only database that the prescriptions may reside on during their existence, though such is not necessarily required. The patient prescription database may be electronically partitioned so as to provide a private, virtual storage vault for the patient's prescription(s). For example, each of the patient's prescriptions may be contained with a partitioned area of the patient prescription database such that the area is not shared with other patients. The uploaded evidence may be associated with the prescription and be contained within the partitioned area such that the evidence is not shared with other patients, though such is not required. In exemplary embodiments, the prescribing healthcare provider may upload a prescription directly to the patient's partitioned area within the patient prescription database and the prescription may be removed once dispensed or expired. In exemplary embodiments, a unique prescription identifier may be associated with each prescription uploaded to the prescription database.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The evidence may be directly uploaded, though such is not required. In exemplary embodiments, the evidence may remain within the partitioned area or otherwise for a period of time or indefinitely. The evidence may be retrieved when the prescription is accessed to verify the patient's identity. For example, the evidence may show a broken arm and checked against the appearance of the alleged patient for identity verification. Alternatively, or additionally, the evidence may be accessed to compare a patient's current presentation of symptoms, injury, condition, disease, or the like with a former presentation for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of a prescription, the potential for fraud, the need for a refill, the need for further treatment, some combination thereof, or the like. For example, the prescription of a significant amount of powerful narcotic against a relatively minor injury may trigger the dispensing pharmacist to verify the amount, type, or the like of medication prescribed to treat the underlying alleged pain or otherwise flag the prescription as potentially mistaken, fraudulent, or the like.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The patient prescription database may comprise one or more of: a number of prescriptions, a list of unique patient identifiers, a list of unique pharmacist identifiers, and a list of unique healthcare providers. The database may be contained within a single electronic storage device or spread across multiple, locally or remotely located electronic storage devices. Identification information may be stored at the patient prescription database and associated with various patient identifiers. Upon receipt of a patient identifier at a pharmacy system, the patient prescription database may be queried to retrieve information associated with the received unique patient identifier. The information may comprise identification information, prescription information, evidence, some combination thereof, or the like.

However, Europe may have access to different equivalent or alternative drugs than the United States. Alternatively, or additionally, Europe may have the same drug marketed under a different brand or generic name. The patient prescription database <b>12</b> may be configured to automatically retrieve the brand name equivalent, alternatives, or generics available in the geographic area associated with the unique pharmacist identification code, which may or may not be available in all geographic areas.

If a user is traveling on a seven-day cruise and only has two days' worth of medication, for example without limitation, only five days' worth of medication may be dispensed. The pharmacy team member may be required to enter such information as part of the dispensing information. For example, without limitation, the pharmacy team member may be required to provide a detailed explanation for the number of units of medication dispensed for storage at the patient prescription database <b>12</b>.
