Amplifier arrays can be of significant size in order to contain the required number of amplifiers. Other approaches for RF amplification include radial combiners or Gysel combiners. Current RF amplifier systems, particularly those for high-power applications, are susceptible to overloading and struggle with delivering power in a stable manner.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In one aspect, a distributed power system is configured to provide power to a number of loads, the system comprising: power converters configured to receive DC power from a common power source, each of the plurality of power converters configured to provide DC power to a corresponding load from the loads. Each of the power converters is positioned proximal to the corresponding load that it powers.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In some variations, each of the power converters can be integrated with the corresponding load and can be on a printed circuit board (PCB) and/or connected to the corresponding load by a wire having a length less than about 5 inches.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In other variations, the power converter providing power to the amplifier can include an output filter to provide regulate power provided to the amplifier, the output filter comprising a capacitor associated with the amplifier. The capacitor can be a bulk capacitor used to provide enough energy to support operation of the amplifier in a pulsed mode, and a fast capacitor used to provide initial load demand and improve high-frequency regulator response.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In yet other variations, the power converters can include a limiter configured to limit the amount of power drawn by the load. At least one of the power converters can include a sensor configured to sense a current or a voltage drawn by the load. A programmable processor can be configured to: monitor the sensor output; and adjust an amount of current or voltage provided to the load.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an interrelated aspect, a system for amplifying high-frequency or pulsed RF signals includes an amplifier and a split capacitor system connected between a power supply and the amplifier, the split capacitor system comprising: a fast capacitor; and a bulk capacitor. The bulk capacitor has a slower response and more energy storage than the fast capacitor.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some variations, the fast capacitor can be a ceramic capacitor and the bulk capacitor can be an electrolytic capacitor. The amplifier can be configured amplify RF signals in a pulsed mode, wherein an initial portion of the current needed for an RF pulse is delivered to the amplifier by the fast capacitor. For example, the fast capacitor can be configured to provide more current than the bulk capacitor in response to a voltage change across the fast capacitor and the bulk capacitor when the rate at which the voltage changes is greater than or equal to about 100 MHz.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an interrelated aspect, a system for protecting amplifiers for high-frequency or pulsed RF signals, the system comprising: an amplifier; and a limiter configured to limit the amount of current or power drawn by the amplifier, the limiter including a plurality of inductors such that power through the limiter always passes through at least one of the plurality of inductors.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some variations, the limiter can be a voltage limiter configured to maintain a constant voltage across an output inductor through which an output current passes or can be current limiter configured to maintain a constant current across an output inductor through which an output current passes. The limiter can include an input inductor configured to receive an input current; and a second switch connected between a first ground and an input of the input inductor, the system configured to open the second switch in response to an overvoltage or overcurrent status and thereby shunt the input current at least partially to ground. The limiter can also include an output inductor configured to receive an output current; a capacitor connected between the output inductor and a second ground; and a third switch connected between the capacitor and an input inductor, the system configured to open the third switch in response to an overvoltage or overcurrent status and thereby shunt the input current at least partially to the capacitor. The switches can be connected to a control system configured to open the second switch and the third switch synchronously in response to an overvoltage or overcurrent status.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an interrelated aspect, a system includes a power source (e.g., a battery, a generator or a AC-DC converter); an amplifier powered by the power source; and at least one programmable processor; a non-transitory machine-readable medium storing instructions which, when executed by the at least one programmable processor, cause the at least one programmable processor to perform operations comprising: monitoring, with a sensor, gate voltage of the amplifier; determining that the gate voltage is not, or is expected not to be, in a range between an upper threshold and a lower threshold; and maintaining the voltage to be within the range between the upper threshold and the lower threshold.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some variations, the range can be between &#x2212;2V and &#x2212;5V and the maintaining can include drawing power from a battery backup system to maintain the gate voltage to be within the range.

For example, amplifier systems are disclosed that have higher power density, are compact, scalable, have improved cooling, have reduced electromagnetic interference (EMI), etc. Such features are important for providing compact, high-power RF amplification, with applications in industry, defense, radar, communications, signal jammers, etc. The systems and methods described herein can also be used in systems employing high power semiconductor devices used in electrical vehicle charging applications.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The overall system, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, is designed for high power radio frequency transmissions, such as in high power microwave, directed energy, radar, and communications applications. The mission computer <b>120</b> runs the software code controlling the system, generally receives control commands, and prioritizes the hardware according to those commands. For example, the mission computer, in a directed energy application, receives inputs about the location of targets such as automated target cues from an external radar, from a user who is using a user console to select targets, or from an automated target recognition and classification software based on image or radar inputs. The mission computer, <b>120</b> can be configured to determine duty cycle, pulse repetition rate, signal frequency and modulation characteristics of a waveform to be transmitted from the system and translate these into phase and waveform commands for a waveform generator <b>150</b>. In various implementations, the waveform generator <b>150</b> can comprise a RF field programmable gate array (FPGA). These waveform commands are also synchronized with the line replaceable modular power amplifiers, <b>170</b> (also referred to herein as &#x201c;modular power amplifier&#x201d;). In some embodiments the waveform is generated directly in the modular power amplifier <b>170</b>, if a direct digital synthesizer or waveform generator is contained in the modular power amplifiers, <b>170</b>, instead of the waveform generator RF FPGA <b>150</b>. The modular power amplifier <b>170</b> can be connected to a batter, a generator or some other power Alternating Current (AC) power source. For example, in some implementations, the modular power amplifier <b>170</b> can be connected to an AC power source through the AC power system <b>130</b>. The AC power system <b>130</b> can have current monitoring, current control, and on/off switches. In some implementations, the AC power system can be controlled by the mission computer <b>120</b>. The AC power system <b>130</b> can also translate voltages from AC to DC with AC/DC conversion. In some systems this AC/DC conversion happens in a centralized way right after the AC power is received from the AC power unit <b>130</b>, or in other embodiments the AC/DC conversion is done locally on each modular power amplifier <b>170</b>, where each one has its own power distribution unit <b>140</b>. In some embodiments the AC/AC conversion and AC/DC conversion is done in multiple steps, where voltage and current levels are changed, this is done in the AC power unit <b>130</b>. The power distribution unit (PDU), <b>140</b> will generally translate the voltage to the final direct current (DC) voltage needed by each amplifier input as discussed below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>13</b></figref>. In various implementations, the PDU can be configured to generate DC voltage in a range between 10 V-100 V. For example, in one embodiment, there are 65 volt, 50 volt, and 12 volt regulators on board the power distribution unit to power the modular power amplifier voltages. The PDU <b>140</b> regulates these voltages, also stores energy to provide impulses of power without the voltage level drooping, and generally is in charge of providing a constant DC voltage to the modular power amplifiers <b>170</b>. The PDU <b>140</b> may also have current sensors, current monitoring, and current limiters. The system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> can be configured as a phased array configuration, so multiple power amplifier can connect to an antenna element to create an array of radiating antennas <b>190</b>. These antenna elements <b>190</b>, can have special connectors designed to handle very high voltage levels and power levels, in the directed energy application and must have their impedance well matched to the modular power amplifiers. Overall, the mission computer <b>120</b> commands waveforms and the power sources, the power sources <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> translate power into the voltages and currents needed to drive the modular power amplifiers <b>170</b>, the modular power amplifiers <b>170</b> amplify the RF signal to very high levels and radiate out of the antennas <b>190</b>. In some embodiments, the modular power amplifiers may be in contact with a thermal pad <b>180</b> for heat dissipation.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the implementation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a user input device <b>110</b> can provide input or command to the computer <b>120</b>. The user input device <b>110</b> can be a computer, tablet, smartphone, an augmented reality/virtual reality device or any computing device capable of receiving text, mouse, touch, voice commands, etc. from a user. The computer <b>120</b> can control the operation of the waveform generator <b>150</b> and/or the modular power amplifiers <b>170</b> based on the input or commands received from input device <b>110</b>. As discussed above, computer <b>120</b> can also be in communication with power supplies for the amplifier systems disclosed herein. For example, an AC (or DC) power supply <b>130</b> can be controlled by computer <b>120</b> to deliver power to a power distributor <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some implementations, the RF pulse amplified by the amplifier systems disclosed herein can be generated from a waveform generator <b>150</b> that may be in communication with computer <b>120</b>. The waveform generator generates the radio frequency waveforms through a digital to analog converter (DAC). The DAC can have a digital input which can receive a stream of binary data that represents the amplitude of the analog waveform that is output. This binary data can be fed from computer memory where the binary representation of the samples of a waveform is stored or the binary data can be generated by direct digital synthesizers (DDS). Some embodiments may include an array of DACs, each with its own binary stream. The binary stream can be controlled such that there is a phase offset between the waves going to the different DACs to generate a beam.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The waveform generator <b>150</b> can provide RF signals to be amplified to an amplifier assembly <b>160</b> containing an arbitrary number of modular power amplifiers <b>170</b>. As described in further detail herein (e.g., with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>9</b></figref>), such modular power amplifiers <b>170</b> can have an efficient 3D configuration in the amplifier assembly, allowing for numerous technical improvements over conventional 2D amplifier systems. For example, cooling elements such as fans, heat sinks, etc. can be interspersed within the amplifier assembly between two or more of the modular power amplifiers. The output of the modular power amplifiers can then be delivered to an antenna array <b>190</b>, which may be an EMP system.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Examples of applications of the disclosed systems can include L-band systems capable of providing RF power output in the kilowatt range (e.g., 1 kW, 3 kW, 5 kW, 12 kW, 20 kW, etc.), though power output will vary with implementation and should not be limited to the examples provided. Similarly, the RF frequencies that may be utilized in the disclosed systems need not be limited to L-band systems but may include other frequencies as well, such as for example, S-band, K-band, etc.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A block diagram of an exemplary modular power amplifier is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The modular power amplifier <b>170</b> can include an amplifier subsystem <b>210</b>, which can receive RF input signal <b>220</b> and provides an amplified RF output signal <b>230</b>. Modular power amplifier <b>170</b> can receive input power <b>240</b> at a power distribution module <b>250</b> and a power sequencer <b>270</b>. These components can provide power for components of the modular power amplifier, as described in further detail herein. In this way, an amplifier subsystem <b>210</b> can be independently controlled to provide a particular RF output signal.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some implementations, power distribution module may include a current sensor <b>260</b> for monitoring of current output to the amplifier subsystem. The current sensor can then provide information to the power sequencer to adjust the power output from the power distribution module. Reading the current of the power amps during operation alerts the system to the health of the power amplifiers, that the current is within the expected range. The current also enables the system to infer the temperature of the power amplifiers during operation since the current will rise for a given power output as the temperature increases. The current sensor can also be used to detect the set point of the power amplifiers prior to operation; when the power amplifiers are off with no RF input, leakage current will change as a function of the bias current being applied. This leakage current is read in the current sensor until the desired current is detected, and thus gives the desired gate voltage set point that should be applied during operation. In one embodiment, the set point can be detected automatically prior to operation by slowly tuning the gate bias voltage until the ideal leakage current is detected. This voltage bias set point can be stored in memory and then during operation, applied when RF is applied. If the current reading is either very low, indicating the power amplifier is no longer pulling any power, or it is very high, indicating a short, this indicates the power amplifier is no longer operational. In this way, the health of the power amplifier can be determined by reading the current.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The power distribution module <b>250</b> can be configured to regulate an amount of power input (e.g., input power <b>240</b>) to intermediate power amplifier(s) (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) of the amplifier subsystem. Specifically, the power distribution module <b>250</b> can receive power at a given voltage, but provide power as needed (e.g., 50V, 65V, etc.) to the amplifier subsystem.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The power distribution module <b>250</b> provides several features. First it can regulate the voltage received from the power supply to the power amplifiers, such as a 50 volt supply to the drain of the gallium nitride power amp transistors. In some embodiments, the power distribution unit can provide DC to DC conversion of the voltage (e.g., acting as a voltage divider), such as if the incoming voltage from the power supply is much higher than the power amplifier voltage. Second, power distribution module <b>250</b> can contain current sensor <b>260</b> where the power distribution unit <b>270</b> detects the current and reports the current back to the power sequencer for use in determining gate voltage bias set point and power amplifier health. Third, the power distribution unit <b>250</b> can also provide a current limiter to limit the current to the power amplifiers; this prevents the power amplifiers from blowing out should any errors occur such as a short, electromagnetic interference, loss of power, or other causes that would cause an incorrect gate bias voltage, and thus a dangerous over-current situation without a current limiter. In some embodiments, no more than a threshold amount of current (e.g., 0.5-60 Amperes) can go through the power amplifiers before failure, so such a current limiter on the PDU can be set to the threshold amount. The power distribution unit consists of voltage regulators, analog to digital converters to read the current, as well as a current limiter circuit made of transistors, diodes and resistors.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some implementations power sequencer <b>270</b> can be configured to control the timing of power delivery by the power distribution module. For example, the power sequencer can turn on or off the gate bias to the intermediate power amplifiers in synchronization with the RF input. This has the benefit of controlling the power and improve heat dissipation. The power sequencer circuit can include analog to digital converters (ADC) to read voltages and currents from power amplifier circuits, digital to analog converters (DAC) to apply voltages to power amplifier circuits, such as gate bias voltages, as well as a processor such as a microcontroller or field programmable gate array (FPGA). The power sequencer can have digital input pins for receiving commands when radio frequency signals are being applied to the amplifier circuit. In this way the power sequencer can apply a gate bias voltage to turn the power amplifier &#x201c;ON&#x201d; just as RF signals are flowing through the power amplifier and then remove the gate bias voltage to turn the power amplifier &#x201c;OFF&#x201d; when no RF is flowing to save power. The power sequencer also has a memory to store gate bias set points. In the preferred embodiment, the power sequencer can have a plurality of ADCs and DACs to control multiple power amplifiers simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Amplification of the RF input signal for a given modular power amplifier occurs in one or more amplifier subsystems. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a</i></figref>, an example amplifier subsystem <b>210</b> (of modular power amplifier <b>170</b>) can receive RF input signal <b>220</b> at an optional preamplifier <b>310</b>, which is in turn connected to bandpass filter <b>320</b>. Bandpass filter <b>320</b> can limit the frequency ranges of the signals passing through the system to a specified bandwidth. Power amplifiers can provide higher power out and higher gain when the bandwidth is smaller, so limiting bandwidth helps increase the gain and power of the amplifier system. Bandpass filter <b>320</b> can also eliminate out-of-band spurs, harmonics, and other out-of-band content. In other embodiments, bandpass filter <b>320</b> can instead be a low-pass filter or a high-pass filter to eliminate either high frequency content or low frequency content, respectively.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Amplifier subsystem <b>210</b> can also include, in some implementations, a number of 90 degree hybrid blocks that can split or combine an RF signal by respectively adding or removing a 90 degree phase shift to the split RF signal. Such RF signal components can be amplified individually and later recombined. For example, a first 90 degree hybrid <b>330</b> can be configured to receive an RF signal and output a split RF signal with components having a 90 degree phase shift. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, 90 degree hybrid <b>330</b> can have RF i/o port <b>332</b>, a &#x201c;0 degree&#x201d; port <b>334</b>, and a &#x201c;90 degree&#x201d; port <b>336</b>. The 90 degree hybrid block <b>330</b> can also have a dump port <b>338</b> which includes a termination to dump mismatches.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">A similar, or even identical, second 90 degree hybrid block <b>340</b> in the amplifier subsystem <b>210</b> can be configured to receive and combine the split RF signal by removing the 90 phase shift. As apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a</i></figref>, the unshifted RF signal component from the 0 degree port <b>334</b> goes into the 90 degree input port <b>346</b>. Similarly, the shifted RF signal component from the 90 degree port <b>336</b> goes into the 0 degree input port <b>344</b>. The two signals can be combined and output through RF i/o port <b>342</b>. 90 degree hybrid block <b>340</b> can also have a dump port <b>348</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some implementations, a high-power amplifier(s) <b>370</b> can be configured to amplify at least one component of the split RF signal. For improvement of the amplification process, the bias for the high-power amplifier <b>370</b> can be independently controlled via the power distribution module. The 90 degree hybrid combiner <b>340</b> combines the two high-power amplifiers <b>370</b>, to create a signal of double the power that the individual high-power amplifier <b>370</b>, can produce, and transmits this out of the output port of the hybrid power amp <b>230</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a</i></figref>, the power distribution module <b>250</b> and power sequencer module <b>270</b>, are connected to the high-power amplifiers <b>370</b>. In one embodiment, the power sequencer <b>270</b> can control the gate bias voltage to some or all of the amplifiers in the hybrid combination network such that they are synchronized. In some embodiments, the power sequencer module <b>270</b> turns on the pre amplifiers <b>310</b> just before the high power amplifiers <b>370</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In other implementations, any/either/both 90 degree hybrid block can include a resistor configured to dissipate at least a portion of RF power going through the 90 degree hybrid block when the RF power is above a threshold. For example, such power dissipation can be used to reduce voltage standing wave ratio effects, thus improving the robustness of the amplifier system.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In many power amplifier systems the voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) is a critical parameter. VSWR measures the total amount of power vs. how much power is transmitted and radiated out of the antenna. If power gets reflected back into the power amplifier system, this reduces the efficiency of the power amplifier system since not all of the power gets radiated, and high power levels such as with high power microwave and electromagnetic pulse applications, jamming, and high power radar, will damage the power amplifier system. In implementations using other means of power combining, such as using Gysel combiners or radial combiners, if one leg of the circuit fails due to lack of protection, the entire 2-way, 4-way, or many-way combined Gysel or radial circuit will completely fail. In this way, the disclosed resistive dissipation provides a significant technical improvement over prior art systems. While one VSWR ratio that is usually acceptable is no more than 2:1, 1.5:1 can be used for conservative systems. Power combiners, such as this 90 degree hybrid approach, can dissipate VSWR levels at up to 10:1 (and potentially higher) and so is very safe. VSWR depends on how well matched the resonant frequency of the power amplifier circuit is to the resonant frequency of the antenna. In some implementations, matching circuits can be created such that multiple frequencies are resonant in the power amplifier and the antenna is broadband and covers many frequencies. As the frequency being transmitted differs from the resonant frequency the VSWR gets worse. Temperature variations also degrade VSWR, other antenna elements in an array mutually coupling also degrades VSWR, anything that changes the impedance of the circuit changes VSWR. Thus, VSWR can change very dynamically throughout the operation of a radio frequency system, and instantaneously, it is possible for the VSWR to reach to very high levels such as up to 10:1 (or more), illustrating the benefits of the disclosed protective circuit.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>b</i>-<b>3</b><i>d </i></figref>illustrate embodiments utilizing a differential antenna with certain aspects of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>b </i></figref>illustrates an exemplary power amplifier subsystem having a splitter <b>380</b> configured to split an RF signal into a first RF component and a second RF component. Such a splitter can be configured to split the RF signal into two RF components of varying amplitude (e.g., a 50/50 splitter, 70/30 splitter, etc.). The system can further include a first high-power amplifier <b>370</b> configured to amplify and output the first RF component and a second high-power amplifier <b>370</b> configured to amplify and output the second RF component. The high-power amplifiers <b>370</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>b</i>-<i>d </i></figref>can be similar to other high-power amplifiers disclosed herein (e.g., high-power amplifier <b>370</b> as discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Differential antenna <b>390</b> can have a first input operatively connected to the first high-power amplifier to receive the first RF component and a second input operatively connected to the second high-power amplifier to receive the second RF component. In some embodiments this embodiment can reduce the number of (or eliminate entirely) the need for combining circuitry. In any of the disclosed implementations, the differential antenna can be a high-impedance low-profile planar aperture <b>392</b>. A number of such high-impedance, low-profile apertures <b>392</b> can be implemented to form an array such as a connected dipole array <b>392</b><i>a</i>, or its conjugate, a long-slot array antenna <b>392</b><i>b </i>with orthogonal polarization, as also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>c</i></figref>. The connected dipole array can include gaps having an approximately 300-ohm gap impedance (denoted by the arrows between various high-impedance, low-profile apertures <b>392</b>). The long-slot array antenna <b>392</b><i>b </i>can include an array of long slots excited at Nyquist interval by differential amplifiers. One advantage of such designs is eliminating the need of a conventional balun, and hence reducing the depth of the array antenna and the front-end RF loss.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>d </i></figref>illustrates how the previously disclosed amplifier subsystems <b>210</b> can be utilized with a differential antenna. Here, a modular power amplifier can have two power amplifier subsystems. Each power amplifier subsystem can include a first 90 degree hybrid block configured to receive an RF signal and output a split RF signal with components having a 90 degree phase shift, a high-power amplifier configured to amplify at least one of the components of the split RF signal, and a second 90 degree hybrid block configured to receive, combine, and output the split RF signal by removing the 90 degree phase shift. Similar to the implementations in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>b,c</i></figref>, a differential antenna can be configured to receive the output of the second 90 degree hybrid blocks of the two power amplifier subsystems.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates how implementations of the present disclosure can allow the formation of a scaled power amplifier assembly <b>410</b> that combines multiple amplifier subsystems into a circuit equivalent to a single amplifier subsystem but having increased gain. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, two power amplifier subsystems are shown, each including the first hybrid block and the second hybrid block. However, these power amplifier subsystems <b>210</b> are integrated into scaled power amplifier assembly <b>410</b> where they have replaced the intermediate power amplifier(s) in another power amplifier subsystem to form the scaled power amplifier assembly <b>410</b>. Such scaling can be extended to combine any number of power amplifier subsystems in a scaled power amplifier assembly (that may itself be made up of scaled power amplifier assemblies). While the implementation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates the combination of three power amplifier subsystems, any number of power amplifier subsystems can be utilized, for example, 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, etc.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the waveform generation circuitry is embedded into the modular power amplifier <b>170</b> itself instead of having a radio frequency signal be provided as input to the modular power amplifier. This is a distributed method of waveform generation where a digital command is provided to the input of the modular power amplifier <b>170</b> instead of a radio frequency input. In some embodiments, the input <b>530</b> will contain a digital message with a phase offset value, amplitude, and a frequency value to command the module to transmit an RF waveform with the specified waveform and phase offset. These commands can also become more complex such as a series of commands such that the amplitude, phase offset and frequency vary as a function of time. A clock sync signal <b>520</b> can be input that originates at a common source such as a master clock with the purpose of synchronizing multiple modular power amplifiers so they can transmit commands phase-coherently to one another. This clock sync pulse can be used to align the digital clocks within the module to the sync pulse. The phase locked loop (PLL) sync clock <b>560</b> can be input into a PLL circuit <b>570</b> such that the PLL circuit <b>570</b> provides the clocking to the rest of the module and synchronizes with the PLL input <b>560</b> as another mechanism to synchronize the clocks. In some embodiments, an FPGA <b>510</b> and digital to analog converter <b>540</b> receive digital commands and the clock synchronization signal and translate the digital commands into a radio frequency signal for the power amplifier subsystem. In other embodiments, a direct digital synthesizer (DDS) chip is used instead of an FPGA and a DAC. In some embodiments, the RF signal generated from the DAC <b>540</b> is a sufficiently high frequency and is converted to the desired RF frequency by the DAC and input into the modular power amplifier <b>210</b>. In other embodiments the DAC <b>540</b> outputs an intermediate frequency (IF) which is upconverted using a mixer subsystem <b>550</b> to the final desired frequency. There are multiple ways the mixing can be done, such as homodyne mixing, heterodyne mixing, etc.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">As illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the modular aspects of the disclosed amplifier systems can be utilized in a parallel configuration to provide high-gain amplification of an RF input signal <b>610</b>. In some implementations, a driver amplifier <b>620</b> can receive the RF input signal <b>610</b> and provide an RF output to a power divider <b>630</b>. The power divider <b>630</b> can be coupled to modular power amplifiers <b>170</b> arranged in parallel and configured to receive and amplify respective RF signals from the power divider <b>630</b>. Optionally, the power divider can receive control signals <b>640</b> to control the splitting of the RF input signal. Also, the power divider can have various power channels <b>650</b>, including inputs and/or returns for AC and/or DC power. The power divider <b>630</b> can be a Wilkinson power divider or other circuit that divides the incoming signal power evenly between multiple output channels.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The illustrated examples of modular power amplifiers <b>170</b> can be substantially similar to any of those described throughout the present disclosure.

The power combiner assembly can be a Wilkinson power combiner, radial power combiner, or Gysel power combiner. In this way, a single, greatly amplified RF output signal <b>614</b> can be generated.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As used herein, the term &#x201c;parallel&#x201d; can mean geometrically parallel (e.g., disposed in parallel planes) or electrically parallel (e.g., not in series). For example, the block diagram illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows how the disclosed system has aspects that are electrically parallel, but not necessarily geometrically parallel. An example implementation having aspects that are specifically not geometrically parallel is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, below, where some of the generally planar amplifier circuits are oriented orthogonally to each other.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates an implementation with a 3D configuration of amplifiers having the benefits of, for example, reduced electromagnetic interference, efficient use of space, and access to cooling mechanisms. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> one implementation of a three-dimensional power amplifier <b>700</b> can include a first modular power amplifier <b>710</b> configured to receive a first RF signal and output a first amplified RF signal. The three-dimensional modular power amplifier <b>700</b> can also have a second modular power amplifier <b>730</b> configured to receive a second RF signal and output a second amplified RF signal. In some embodiments, RF input signals can be received by 90 degree hybrids (which may be similar to the 90 degree hybrid <b>330</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a</i></figref>). RF signals can be similarly power combined into another 90 degree hybrid output block (which may be similar to the 90 degree hybrid <b>340</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a</i></figref>). Various implementations can have the second high-power amplifier <b>730</b> can have a different orientation than the first high-power amplifier <b>710</b>. Thus, the different orientations can cause a reduction in electromagnetic interference between the first high-power amplifier and the second high-power amplifier. Also, antenna <b>770</b>, for three-dimensional power amplifier <b>700</b>, can optionally be part of antenna array <b>190</b> depicted in the implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As used herein, the term &#x201c;orientation&#x201d; refers to an orientation of the high-power amplifier in 3D space. For example, the high-power amplifier may be a somewhat planar circuit oriented generally horizontally. As described above, a different high-power amplifier may have a different orientation (e.g., generally vertically). Because such high-power amplifiers may generally be of substantially similar construction, it would be understood by a person of skill what it means to have two high power amplifiers have different orientations. Furthermore, while the present disclosure contemplates that high-power amplifiers may have different orientations, this can also include other circuitry (besides the high-power amplifiers) such as the 90&#xb0; hybrids, splitters, FPGAs, etc. Any combination of the components disclosed herein that are associated with a given high-power amplifier can thus have a particular orientation which may be different than any other combination of components associated with another high-power amplifier.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Some implementations can include the first high-power amplifier and/or the second high-power amplifier being of generally planar construction and the generally planar amplifiers can have different orientations. Accordingly, in some implementations, the first high-power amplifier and the second high-power amplifier can be constructed on printed circuit boards and disposed to have the different orientations.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The present disclosure contemplates the non-parallel orientations of these high-power amplifiers can mitigate electromagnetic interference between the amplifiers by, for example, reducing interference (constructive or destructive). When the present disclosure notes that two amplifiers are &#x201c;not in the same plane,&#x201d; this means that they are non-coplanar but may be in parallel planes. When high-power amplifiers (or other circuitry) has the same orientation, metal shielding can be included around one or more locations to mitigate EMI. In some embodiments, some portions of the disclosed system can have high-power amplifiers parallel to each other, either vertically or horizontally. This can be in combination with any non-parallel arrangements of circuits, as discussed below and elsewhere herein.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the different orientations can have an angle of 90 degrees between them to form a portion of a square (or rectangular) distribution of high-power amplifiers. Orienting at a 90 degrees angle around a heat sink, (such as a piece of metal or a fan) also helps to ease thermal constraints and remove heat.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In other implementations, the different orientations can have an angle of 120 degrees between them to form a portion of a hexagonal distribution of modular power amplifiers. In yet other implementations, the different orientations can have an angle of 60 degrees between them to form a portion of a triangular distribution of modular power amplifiers. In general, any geometric distribution of modular power amplifiers is contemplated, further including parallelograms or other polygonal or irregular shapes. In this way, most generally, the present disclosure contemplates that at least two of the power amplifiers may not be geometrically parallel, for at least the above-described benefits of heat removal and reduction of EMI.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, in other implementations, there can be a third high-power amplifier having an orientation substantially perpendicular to the first high-power amplifier and a fourth high-power amplifier having an orientation substantially perpendicular to the second high-power amplifier. Such a configuration is similar to the square distribution described above, but also includes parallelogram-shaped distributions.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As discussed, the disclosed three-dimensional power amplifier has several technical advantages, including improved cooling due to the ability to of, for example, generally planar modular power amplifiers, to have their planes facing a cooling element. This can expose an increased surface area to a cooling element and thus improve cooling. Cooling elements can include, for example, a heat sinks, fans, etc. with number and any sort of cooling element implemented. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, there can be a cooling component (e.g., heat sink <b>750</b>) located proximate to the first high-power amplifier or the second high-power amplifier. Also, a fan <b>760</b> can be included to provide direct air cooling over the amplifier circuitry and heat sinks.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The amplifier designs contemplated herein provide improved mitigation of electromagnetic interference. In some implementations, this can include providing electromagnetic shielding between the first high-power amplifier and the second high-power amplifier. Such electromagnetic shielding can include, for example, Faraday cages, RF absorptive foam, RF reflective materials, etc. In some implementations, such shielding can be located around or between modular power amplifiers.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Some implementations can provide further mitigation by virtue of the separation between any adjacent parallel modular power amplifiers. For example, the first high-power amplifier and the second high-power amplifier can be configured to receive the first RF signal and the second RF signal, both signals having a wavelength, and the first high-power amplifier and the second high-power amplifier are separated by at least approximately half of the wavelength. In some embodiments, the amplifiers can be separated by less than half a wavelength. Such arrays can be challenging to integrate from a mechanical packaging standpoint due to the tight spacing, but can provide higher power per unit area. In other embodiments, the modular power amplifiers are separated by more than half a wavelength. Any spacing more than half a wavelength can cause a smaller grating-lobe free field of regard. At a half-wavelength spacing, a beam can be scanned over a 180 degree field of regard from the array. As the spacing increases up to lambda (the wavelength), the grating lobe free field of regard is reduced. In one a 0.7 lambda spacing can be used, which allows more space to fit the modules but also allows a larger area for the antenna array. As the gain is related to the area of the antenna array, moving out the modules enables higher gain. Separations can include, for example, 1-8 inches, which can be appropriate for some L-band and S-band phased array applications. Other separations are contemplated, based on the wavelength of the RF being amplified, as discussed above, or other separations that act to mitigate interference. In some implementations, the wavelength used is the wavelength of the highest frequency being used in the design.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, an exemplary modular power amplifier <b>800</b> can include many of the components disclosed herein, allowing, for example, efficient replacement of damaged or upgraded modules.

In this way, the power converters can be integrated with the corresponding load. In some embodiments, the power converters can be integrated with the corresponding load on a common substrate. The common substrate can include a printed circuit board (PCB). Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the power converters can be connected to the corresponding load by a printed circuit board (PCB) trace (e.g., a conductor embedded into the PCB). For certain embodiments (which may not utilize a PCB) similar technical benefits relating to a reduction in parasitic capacitance can be realized by, for example, the power converters being connected to the corresponding load by a wire having a length less than about 5 inches, less than about 4 inches, less than about 3 inches, less than about 2 inches, less than about 1 inch, etc.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In certain embodiments, the common source can include an AC-DC converter <b>1040</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>.

The output of the AC-DC converter <b>1040</b> can be to a distributed DC bus <b>1170</b> which can be input to a number of DC-DC converters <b>1110</b> that can provide further rectification.

Such split capacitance can thus further regulate the voltage/power delivered to the modular power amplifier. In some specific embodiments, output <b>1216</b> (from the fast capacitor and the bulk capacitor) can be delivered to a drain terminal of a high-power amplifier.

Such an approach provides effective isolation between input DC bus voltage and individual amplifier voltages and is virtually fail-safe against short circuits since there is always inductance in the path of the main load current. In various implementations, the limiter can employ synchronous switches in the design to reduce the power dissipation across the switches and improve overall power efficiency. The limiter shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> can be operated as a Buck limiter or a Boost limiter.

In some other implementations, the limiter can be a voltage limiter that maintains a constant voltage across the inductor Lout. In various implementations, the current/voltage limiter can be a programmable to limit the amount of current/voltage drawn by each amplifier.

The current sensor also provides other features, such as an almost instantaneous hardware short circuit protection to disable damaged/defective amplifiers and other electronic components in a phased array without affecting operation of the rest of the system to improve reliability and operability of the system. The decentralized topology provides an improved system fault protection as compared to a centralized power distribution architecture, since power faults become local to each phased array element and do not affect other elements. Further, power distribution becomes simpler and more efficient in the power system based on POL converters since only a single DC voltage rail may be required to be distributed within the system. Therefore, such distributed power systems can be scaled up in voltage and power to support increased power outputs of the RF amplifiers.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, power converters <b>1200</b> can include a sensor configured to sense a current or a voltage drawn by the load.

As certain embodiments are implemented as arrays or otherwise having multiple amplifiers or loads, in certain implementations there may be between 4 and 12 loads or amplifiers.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> illustrates an implementation of a PoL PDU <b>1310</b> connected to a battery <b>1320</b>, in accordance with some embodiments. The PoL PDU <b>1310</b> can be configured to power a load (e.g., a modular power amplifier comprising 2 or more high-power amplifiers). The depicted circuit and components can be similar to the power distribution unit <b>1010</b> as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. Similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, an array of PoL PDUs <b>1310</b> can be connected to the battery <b>1320</b>. A limiter <b>1330</b>, which may be the same as limiter <b>1230</b> in some embodiments, can facilitate the connection of the DC-DC converters <b>1350</b>, <b>1355</b>, <b>1360</b>, and <b>1365</b> to the battery <b>1320</b>. Converter <b>1350</b> can generate voltages <b>1370</b> and <b>1372</b> required to drive amplifiers connected to its output and converter <b>1355</b> can generate voltages <b>1374</b> and <b>1376</b> required to drive amplifiers connected to its output. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, there may be some situations where the battery is always on. In such situations, were the converters <b>1350</b> and <b>1355</b> be directly connected to the battery, there could be a current surge due to charging of the capacitors associated with the amplifiers powered by the converters <b>1350</b> and <b>1355</b>. In such situations, the limiter <b>1330</b> can slow or prevent the current surge and reduce the risk of damage to the amplifier.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In some implementations, battery <b>1320</b> can be connected to the converters by a DC bus. In some implementations, the DC bus can be a +48V DC input line and +48V DC return line. The PDU can include a power sequencer <b>1340</b> that can be configured to execute a power sequencing safety algorithm to ensure the gate voltage to an amplifier is always the first on and last off in order to protect the amplifier. The DC-DC converters <b>1360</b> and <b>1365</b> can be configured to generate +12V output <b>1378</b> and &#x2212;12V <b>1380</b> and can be based on a synchronous step-down regulator, for example similar to limiter <b>1230</b>. The +12V and &#x2212;12V output can be used to provide power to the bias controller discussed above. In various implementations, the converters <b>1350</b> and <b>1355</b> can be configured to provide the voltage at the drain terminal of a plurality of three-terminal semiconductor devices (e.g., a FET amplifiers) and the converters <b>1360</b> and <b>1365</b> can be configured to provide the voltage at the gate terminal of the plurality of three-terminal semiconductor devices. For example, the converters <b>1350</b> and <b>1365</b> can be configured to provide 65V and 50V respectively in some implementations. The architecture of the converters <b>1350</b> and <b>1365</b> can be similar to the step-up converter discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In various implementations, the bias controller can raise a fault bit to alert the system to an overcurrent situation for each amplifier in a system (e.g., the driver amplifiers and the high-power amplifiers in the LRAM) in response to the sensed current/voltage. Amplifiers comprising Gallium Nitride (GaN) can malfunction if the gate voltage goes to zero, and the drain voltage is on. A GaN amplifier is an always on device and it can drive a large amount of current from the supply if the gate is at ground (or 0 Volts). Accordingly, in various implementations, a battery backup system may be provided to the bias controller which can maintain the gate voltage at appropriate voltage level (e.g., between &#x2212;2V and &#x2212;5V) as a protection system to maintain the 12V supply to the bias controller in the event of a power failure so that the amplifier gate voltage is always on.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The power distribution unit can include a current sensor and/or a voltage sensor that can monitor the driving current and/or voltage output to the amplifier. The PoL PDU can be configured to turn off the driving power to the amplifier if the current and/or the voltage is not within a range defined by an upper threshold limit and a lower threshold limit. This feature can safely disable amplifiers that are dead or defective and also prevent amplifier malfunctions.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Accordingly, some embodiments of the disclosed systems can include a battery, an amplifier powered by the battery, and a programmable processor that can be configured to perform various operations. Such operations can include monitoring, with a sensor, a gate voltage of the amplifier. The operations can also include determining that the gate voltage is not, or is expected not to be, in a range between an upper threshold and a lower threshold. The voltage can then be maintained to be within the range between the upper threshold and the lower threshold. In certain implementations, the range can be between &#x2212;2V and &#x2212;5V, but can also be between &#x2212;1V and &#x2212;5V, &#x2212;3V and &#x2212;4V, or any combination of negative voltages between &#x2212;1 and &#x2212;10V. Maintaining the voltage can also include drawing power from a battery backup system to maintain the gate voltage to be within the range. Some implementations can include an operation shutting off a supply voltage to the amplifier.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The bias controller in cooperation with the power distribution unit can execute other safety mechanisms, such as, for example, using &#x201c;learning&#x201d; about the power amp and other methods to set a gate voltage threshold such that smart power never brings the gate voltage above (less negative, such as never go above &#x2212;2V) this safety threshold. Thus, the operations can further include determining, by a machine-learning algorithm, a gate voltage threshold that is the most positive voltage in the range.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">There is also a safety mechanism that upon detecting the current, the RF input voltage to the amplifier can be limited to a certain level, because overdriving the amplitude of the RF input voltage can also cause the amplifier to malfunction. Accordingly, some implementations can include controlling the power sequencer to provide power to a bias controller to turn on or turn off the amplifier.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">With the above disclosure, it is contemplated that aspects of the disclosed systems can be utilized for RF generation control numerous applications. For example, the improved ability to provide high-power RF can be utilized in static and/or vehicle-mounted systems. Similarly, such improvements can be utilized in UAV-mounted, backpack, and/or handheld systems. Accordingly, while some features are described in the context of a rack-mounted system, such features can be utilized in more compact designs.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In the following, further features, characteristics, and exemplary technical solutions of the present disclosure will be described in terms of items that may be optionally claimed in any combination:</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Item 1: A distributed power system configured to provide power to a plurality of loads, the system comprising: a plurality of power converters configured to receive DC power from a common power source, each of the plurality of power converters configured to provide DC power to a corresponding load from the plurality of loads, wherein each of the plurality of power converters is positioned proximal to the corresponding load that it powers.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Item 2.
