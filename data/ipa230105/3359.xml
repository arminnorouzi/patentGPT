The contents of the aforesaid Patent Application are incorporated herein for all purposes.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a light module for a lighting device of a vehicle having at least one illuminant and a light-guiding body which is suitable and destined for guiding radiation emanating from the illuminant and coupled into the light-guiding body to a light exit surface of the light-guiding body. The present invention further relates to a lighting device as well as a method for reducing a color desaturation in a light module, for example for a lighting device for example of a vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">This background section is provided for the purpose of generally describing the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently named inventor(s), to the extent the work is described in this background section, as well as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Lighting devices for vehicles have long been known from the prior art. Usually, a lighting device of a vehicle fulfills at least one light function.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Depending on the configuration of the lighting device (for instance as a headlight and/or as a signal lamp such as, for example, a brake lamp, a side marker lamp, turn signal lamp and/or as a rear lamp and/or as a daytime running lamp), the light function may be selected from a group of light functions which have an illumination function (for instance of a region of a roadway), a repeating flasher function for instance for indicating a turn, a brake light function for displaying braking activity, a side-marker light function such as, for instance, a back light function, in order to ensure the visibility of the vehicle by day and/or night, and the like as well as combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A light module for a motor vehicle having an extensive light body and an illuminant, the light beams of which may be coupled into the light body and which exit the light body outwards via a light exit surface, is known to the inventors. In this setup, a rear surface opposite the light exit surface may be covered with a reflective or diffusely backscattering cover which is formed by a frame-like component.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some light modules, a color desaturation of white taillight elements may be observed by day behind transparent lenses. For example, a color desaturation may occur in the case of <b>3</b>D LED back lights as in the case of taillight and turn indicator surfaces, for example.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As a solution to avoid a color desaturation, implementing monochromatic light functions with colored lenses is possible. However, this does result in the disadvantage that multi-colored dual functions cannot be implemented.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A change in the color and surface structure of the entire rear wall in order to remedy this disadvantage adversely entails a restriction in the homogeneity or light yield. Using a surface light guide without a rear wall leads, in turn, to the disadvantage of an intensity superimposition of elements located behind one another.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A need exists to overcome the disadvantages known from the prior art and to provide a light module, a lighting device, and a method for reducing a color desaturation in a light module, for example for a lighting device of a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The need is addressed by the subject-matter of the independent claims. Embodiments of the invention are described in the dependent claims, the following description, and the drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b></figref> <i>a</i>-<i>d </i>show comparative representations of vehicle lamps operated at night and by day according to the prior art;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b><i>b </i></figref>show representations of a front view in each case of a rear wall apparatus of a light module in accordance with an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a schematic cross-sectional representation of a light module according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a detailed representation of a cutout from the light module depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b><i>a, b </i></figref>show a front view as well as the night appearance of a vehicle lamp according to a further embodiment;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a schematic cross-sectional representation of a light module according to a further embodiment;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a detailed representation of a cutout from the light module depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b><i>a</i>, <b>8</b><i>b </i></figref>show a front view as well as the night appearance of a vehicle lamp according to a further embodiment;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a schematic cross-sectional representation of a light module according to a further embodiment;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows a detailed representation of a cutout from the light module depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b </i></figref>show a front view as well as the night appearance of a vehicle lamp according to a further embodiment;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows a schematic cross-sectional representation of a light module according to a further embodiment;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows a detailed representation of a cutout from the light module depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> shows three representations of a taillight having an implementation of a rear wall, each having a different pattern;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> shows three representations of a turn signal having an implementation of a rear wall, each having a different pattern;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>-<b>19</b></figref> show a representation to illustrate the theory regarding color desaturation at dusk or by day; and</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> shows a vehicle having a light module according to an embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features will be apparent from the description, drawings, and from the claims.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the following description of embodiments of the invention, specific details are described in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known features have not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily complicating the instant description.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments and in a light module for a lighting device, for example of a vehicle, having at least one illuminant and a light-guiding body, the light-guiding body is suitable and destined for guiding radiation emanating from the illuminant and coupled into the light-guiding body to a light exit surface of the light-guiding body (for example in order to exit from the light-guiding body).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, the light module has at least one rear wall apparatus which is for example arranged at least in certain areas in the beam path of ambient radiation incident from externally through the light exit surface of the light-guiding body into the light-guiding body. The light exit surface is for example a substantially planar (side) surface of the light-guiding body.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, the rear wall apparatus (for example on the side facing the light body) has at least one first rear wall region and at least one second rear wall region, wherein the at least one first rear wall region and the at least one second rear wall region differ from one another in terms of reflection and/or absorption properties, for example with regard to the ambient radiation (or ambient radiation which is incident from externally through the light exit surface into the light-guiding body).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In other words, a rear wall apparatus is proposed, which has for example on its side facing the light-guiding body at least two rear wall regions which differ from one another in terms of their reflection and/or absorption properties, for example with regard to the ambient radiation incident into the light-guiding body and striking the rear wall apparatus.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The provision of various rear wall regions, which differ from one another in terms of their absorption and/or reflection behavior, for example with regard to the (ambient) rays, offers the benefit that good homogeneity, for example the large range of an angle of visibility of a rough light (white) rear wall region may therefore be combined, at the same time, with a colored or reflective rear wall region which offers a reduced color desaturation.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Advantageously, thanks to the, in each case, at least one first and second rear wall regions which differ in their reflection and/or absorption properties, the benefit of a rear wall region having high reflection and/or low absorption may be combined with the benefit of a rear wall region having low reflection and/or high absorption, which may provide a reduced color desaturation.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A decrease in the color desaturation of externally illuminated optical surfaces may be attained at the same time as fulfilling the desired light function in the best possible way by the at least one first and second rear wall region proposed according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">For example, the at least one first and/or the at least one second rear wall region is for example arranged in the beam path of ambient radiation incident from externally through the light exit side of the light-guiding body into the light-guiding body.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The at least one first rear wall region is for example designed and the absorption and/or reflection properties are for example selected in such a way that, for example, the absorption and/or (diffuse) scattering or reflection of the radiation striking the first rear wall region cause(s) the spectrum of the radiation emanating from the light exit surface to substantially correspond to the spectrum of the radiation emanating from the light exit surface, coupled in by the at least one illuminant into the light-guiding body, and/or to only slightly deviate from the latter. For example, the term &#x201c;only slight deviation&#x201d; may be understood to mean that (substantially) no difference may be visually perceived by a user of the light function or said difference is within a (for example predefined) tolerance range.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">However, it is also conceivable that the at least one first rear wall region is adjusted to a light function to be fulfilled by the light module (for example, output of light of a predefined spectrum) in such a manner that it is suitable and destined for absorbing (and/or reflecting) radiation striking the at least first rear wall region wavelength-selectively as a function of the predefined spectrum or spectrum to be output.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">For example, the first rear wall region may have a colored or reflective (surface) region. The color of the rear wall region may for example be adapted to the spectrum to be output by the light module and/or the light function to be fulfilled by the light module. The first rear wall region for example has the color of the radiation to be output by the light module.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The at least one second rear wall region is for example designed and the absorption and/or reflection properties are for example selected in such a way that (for example as good as possible) a homogeneity and/or (as large as possible) a light yield and/or (as high as possible) an intensity of the radiation emanating from the light exit surface is/are attained for example by reflection of the radiation striking the second rear wall region. For example, the at least one second rear wall region may have a light, for example white, and/or (comparatively) rough surface.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The term &#x201c;a rough surface&#x201d; is for example understood to be a non-reflective surface, by which radiation striking the surface is for example diffusely reflected.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The term &#x201c;reflection properties&#x201d; is for example to be understood to be a quantity which is characteristic of a reflection and/or backscattering of incident radiation, for example a reflectance. In particular, the term &#x201c;reflection&#x201d; not only includes directed (mirroring) reflection, but also diffuse reflection or radiation scattered on the surface (for example in an undirected manner or diffusely). The reflection properties may for example relate to at least one portion of the at least first or second rear wall region and, particularly for example, to the entire at least first or second rear wall region.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The term &#x201c;absorption properties&#x201d; is for example to be understood to be a quantity which is characteristic of an absorption of incident radiation, for example an absorptance. The absorption properties may for example relate to at least one portion of the at least first or second rear wall region and, particularly, for example, to the entire at least first or second rear wall region.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The absorption properties and/or reflection properties may relate to the light exit surface (and/or for example in relation to a notional plane formed through the light exit surface and/or a notional plane parallel to the light exit surface) and, as a result, ambient radiation incident from externally (and striking the respective at least first or second rear wall region).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">(In other words), the absorption properties (and, analogously, the reflection properties) may for example be a quantity which is characteristic of an absorption (and, analogously, the reflection) of (ambient) radiation incident through the light exit surface from externally into the light-guiding body, which strikes the respective (at least first or second) rear wall region, through the respective (at least first or second) rear wall region.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">For example, the at least first rear wall region (at least in certain areas and for example substantially over the entire rear wall region) may have an absorptance and/or reflectance which differ(s) from the absorptance and/or reflectance of the at least second rear wall region.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The at least first rear wall region may for example have at least in sections and for example over the respective entire region thereof a substantially homogeneous and/or identical reflectance and/or absorptance.

In this case, a main extension direction of the first rear wall region <b>32</b> and/or of at least one portion of the first rear wall region (which for example runs along a central axis M of the first rear wall region <b>32</b>), along which the first rear wall region extends into the interior of the light-guiding body, for example encloses an acute angle, and, particularly, an angle of 45&#xb0;, with the main extension plane E.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">The light trap and/or the first rear wall region is/are for example inclined with respect to the main extension plane E of the rear wall apparatus <b>20</b> in such a way that a bottom region of the first rear wall region <b>32</b> is arranged in (exclusively) one direction running along the main extension plane E closer to the illuminant (here the light-emitting diode <b>19</b>) than an opening region and/or an edge region of the light trap or of the first rear wall region <b>32</b> (which is adjacent to a second rear wall region <b>34</b>).</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">As is obvious from the beam path illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> of ambient radiation <b>44</b> incident from externally through the light exit surface A into the light-guiding body <b>24</b>, this is received and absorbed in the light trap <b>31</b> formed and/or delimited by the first rear wall region <b>32</b> (illustrated by beam path <b>45</b>), so that at least no more directed back-reflection of the ambient radiation <b>44</b> leaves the light trap <b>31</b> (at least in the direction of the light exit surface A).</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">Secondary radiation generated or created at the outcoupling apparatus of the light-guiding body <b>24</b> of the primary radiation emitted by the light-emitting diode and coupled into the light-guiding body is reflected here by the reflection surface of the second rear wall region (in the direction of the light-guiding body) (see secondary LED beam path <b>48</b>) and/or is reflected and/or scattered in an upper region of the light trap or of the first rear wall region by a wall side <b>47</b> further away from the illuminant in the direction of the light exit surface A of the light-guiding body (illustrated by the beam path identified with reference numeral <b>46</b>), so that this is not absorbed into secondary radiation <b>48</b> in the light trap but rather contributes to the increase in the light intensity and light yield of the light module <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b </i></figref>show representations of a front view in each case of a rear wall apparatus <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> of a light module <b>10</b> in accordance with an embodiment (wherein only the rear wall is depicted). A structured rear wall (having a beam trap) is in each case obvious here, wherein a plurality of first and second rear wall regions are each arranged periodically or regularly line by line (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref>) and in a checkered manner.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">In order to suppress the stray radiation or ambient radiation, it is therefore proposed that the (existing) rear wall is structured periodically so that a beam trap is created and external light is absorbed. This decreases or avoids the color desaturation of externally illuminated optical surfaces while at the same time fulfilling the desired light function in the best possible way.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">It is possible to vary the structure size (for various embodiments of the rear wall). Furthermore, an additional absorbent coating and/or nanomaterials having an aligned structure may be applied.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">The proposed configuration provides a scalable approach (area size of the rear wall) which simultaneously stands out due to the low production costs and suitability for high-volume production.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a schematic cross-sectional representation of a light module <b>10</b> according to a further embodiment, for example having a structured rear wall for a surface light guide <b>24</b>.

In this case, the first material differs from the second material for example due to a scattering property (for example with regard to the ambient radiation which is for example light from the wavelength range of the daylight spectrum).</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a detailed representation of a cutout from the light module <b>10</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.
