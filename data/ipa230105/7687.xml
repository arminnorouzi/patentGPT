Typical wireless communication systems may employ multiple-access technologies capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources (e.g., bandwidth, transmit power, and/or the like). Examples of such multiple-access technologies include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, single-carrier frequency-division multiple access (SC-FDMA) systems, time division synchronous code division multiple access (TD-SCDMA) systems, and Long Term Evolution (LTE). LTE/LTE-Advanced is a set of enhancements to the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) mobile standard promulgated by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A wireless communication network may include a number of base stations (BSs) that can support communication for a number of user equipment (UEs). A user equipment (UE) may communicate with a base station (BS) via the downlink and uplink. The downlink (or forward link) refers to the communication link from the BS to the UE, and the uplink (or reverse link) refers to the communication link from the UE to the BS. As will be described in more detail herein, a BS may be referred to as a Node B, a gNB, an access point (AP), a radio head, a transmit receive point (TRP), a New Radio (NR) BS, a 5G Node B, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The above multiple access technologies have been adopted in various telecommunication standards to provide a common protocol that enables different user equipment to communicate on a municipal, national, regional, and even global level. New Radio (NR), which may also be referred to as 5G, is a set of enhancements to the LTE mobile standard promulgated by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). NR is designed to better support mobile broadband Internet access by improving spectral efficiency, lowering costs, improving services, making use of new spectrum, and better integrating with other open standards using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with a cyclic prefix (CP) (CP-OFDM) on the downlink (DL), using CP-OFDM and/or SC-FDM (e.g., also known as discrete Fourier transform spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM)) on the uplink (UL), as well as supporting beamforming, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna technology, and carrier aggregation. However, as the demand for mobile broadband access continues to increase, there exists a need for further improvements in LTE and NR technologies. Preferably, these improvements should be applicable to other multiple access technologies and the telecommunication standards that employ these technologies.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some aspects, a method of wireless communication, performed by a user equipment (UE), may include receiving, in association with a frame-based equipment (FBE) mode, a message associated with a designation of the UE for either channel occupancy time (COT) sharing or non-COT sharing.

This disclosure may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to any specific structure or function presented throughout this disclosure. Rather, these aspects are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the disclosure to those skilled in the art. Based on the teachings herein one skilled in the art should appreciate that the scope of the disclosure is intended to cover any aspect of the disclosure disclosed herein, whether implemented independently of or combined with any other aspect of the disclosure. For example, an apparatus may be implemented or a method may be practiced using any number of the aspects set forth herein. In addition, the scope of the disclosure is intended to cover such an apparatus or method which is practiced using other structure, functionality, or structure and functionality in addition to or other than the various aspects of the disclosure set forth herein. It should be understood that any aspect of the disclosure disclosed herein may be embodied by one or more elements of a claim.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Several aspects of telecommunication systems will now be presented with reference to various apparatuses and techniques. These apparatuses and techniques will be described in the following detailed description and illustrated in the accompanying drawings by various blocks, modules, components, circuits, steps, processes, algorithms, and/or the like (collectively referred to as &#x201c;elements&#x201d;). These elements may be implemented using hardware, software, or combinations thereof. Whether such elements are implemented as hardware or software depends upon the particular application and design constraints imposed on the overall system.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">It should be noted that while aspects may be described herein using terminology commonly associated with 3G and/or 4G wireless technologies, aspects of the present disclosure can be applied in other generation-based communication systems, such as 5G and later, including NR technologies.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a wireless network <b>100</b> in which aspects of the present disclosure may be practiced. The wireless network <b>100</b> may be an LTE network or some other wireless network, such as a 5G or NR network. The wireless network <b>100</b> may include a number of BSs <b>110</b> (shown as BS <b>110</b><i>a</i>, BS <b>110</b><i>b</i>, BS <b>110</b><i>c</i>, and BS <b>110</b><i>d</i>) and other network entities. A BS is an entity that communicates with user equipment (UEs) and may also be referred to as a base station, a NR BS, a Node B, a gNB, a 5G node B (NB), an access point, a transmit receive point (TRP), and/or the like. Each BS may provide communication coverage for a particular geographic area. In 3GPP, the term &#x201c;cell&#x201d; can refer to a coverage area of a BS and/or a BS subsystem serving this coverage area, depending on the context in which the term is used.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">A BS may provide communication coverage for a macro cell, a pico cell, a femto cell, and/or another type of cell. A macro cell may cover a relatively large geographic area (e.g., several kilometers in radius) and may allow unrestricted access by UEs with service subscription. A pico cell may cover a relatively small geographic area and may allow unrestricted access by UEs with service subscription. A femto cell may cover a relatively small geographic area (e.g., a home) and may allow restricted access by UEs having association with the femto cell (e.g., UEs in a closed subscriber group (CSG)). A BS for a macro cell may be referred to as a macro BS. A BS for a pico cell may be referred to as a pico BS. A BS for a femto cell may be referred to as a femto BS or a home BS. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a BS <b>110</b><i>a </i>may be a macro BS for a macro cell <b>102</b><i>a</i>, a BS <b>110</b><i>b </i>may be a pico BS for a pico cell <b>102</b><i>b</i>, and a BS <b>110</b><i>c </i>may be a femto BS for a femto cell <b>102</b><i>c</i>. A BS may support one or multiple (e.g., three) cells. The terms &#x201c;eNB&#x201d;, &#x201c;base station&#x201d;, &#x201c;NR BS&#x201d;, &#x201c;gNB&#x201d;, &#x201c;TRP&#x201d;, &#x201c;AP&#x201d;, &#x201c;node B&#x201d;, &#x201c;5G NB&#x201d;, and &#x201c;cell&#x201d; may be used interchangeably herein.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some aspects, a cell may not necessarily be stationary, and the geographic area of the cell may move according to the location of a mobile BS. In some aspects, the BSs may be interconnected to one another and/or to one or more other BSs or network nodes (not shown) in the wireless network <b>100</b> through various types of backhaul interfaces such as a direct physical connection, a virtual network, and/or the like using any suitable transport network.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Wireless network <b>100</b> may also include relay stations. A relay station is an entity that can receive a transmission of data from an upstream station (e.g., a BS or a UE) and send a transmission of the data to a downstream station (e.g., a UE or a BS). A relay station may also be a UE that can relay transmissions for other UEs. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a relay station <b>110</b><i>d </i>may communicate with macro BS <b>110</b><i>a </i>and a UE <b>120</b><i>d </i>in order to facilitate communication between BS <b>110</b><i>a </i>and UE <b>120</b><i>d</i>. A relay station may also be referred to as a relay BS, a relay base station, a relay, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Wireless network <b>100</b> may be a heterogeneous network that includes BSs of different types, e.g., macro BSs, pico BSs, femto BSs, relay BSs, and/or the like. These different types of BSs may have different transmit power levels, different coverage areas, and different impacts on interference in wireless network <b>100</b>. For example, macro BSs may have a high transmit power level (e.g., 5 to 40 Watts) whereas pico BSs, femto BSs, and relay BSs may have lower transmit power levels (e.g., 0.1 to 2 Watts).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A network controller <b>130</b> may couple to a set of BSs and may provide coordination and control for these BSs. Network controller <b>130</b> may communicate with the BSs via a backhaul.

Some carriers for wireless communication are licensed carriers. Cellular networks, such as an LTE network or a 5G network, may use licensed carriers. Wireless local area networks, or Wi-Fi networks, may use unlicensed carriers. 5G networks may utilize License Assisted Access (LAA), which leverages unlicensed carriers in combination with licensed carriers to improve performance for UEs.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Transmissions on unlicensed carriers may require a transmitting device, such as a UE, to determine whether a carrier (frequency channel) is clear for transmission. Listen Before Talk (or listen before transmit) (LBT) is a mechanism by which a device should apply a clear channel assessment (CCA) check (i.e., spectrum sensing for a certain period, called the CCA period) before using the channel. CCA uses energy detection (ED) to detect the presence (channel is busy) or absence (channel is clear) of other signals on the channel. If the detected energy during an initial CCA period is lower than a certain threshold (the ED threshold), the device can access the channel for a period called a channel occupancy time (COT). Otherwise, an extended CCA period starts, in which the detected energy is again compared against the ED threshold until channel access is granted.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">COT sharing is a mechanism where one device acquires a COT using one LBT and another device shares the COT using another LBT. A duration of the COT may be limited by a maximum COT limit. A purpose of COT sharing is to allow a concession for LAA uplink in which one device (e.g., eNB) may send a grant to another device (e.g., UE) before the UE can transmit an uplink communication.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">COT sharing may involve two devices sharing a time resource, such as a frame in a frame based equipment (FBE) mode. Although FBE mode involves unlicensed frequency bands, the FBE mode may have a fixed frame period rather than being demand driven. A device in FBE mode may perform a CCA using ED for a channel observation time. If the channel is clear, the device may transmit with a COT, during which there is no need to re-evaluate the channel. The device may perform a new CCA for a next frame. If the channel is not clear, the device may remain quiet for the next frame. The device may perform CCA once every frame, and a channel access opportunity may be once every frame.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">COT sharing may be used for transmissions from a UE to a base station (e.g., gNB). In FBE mode, without COT sharing, the UE is able to sleep until a next frame if the UE does not detect an initial signal at the frame boundary. With COT sharing, a UE may not be able to go to sleep at all. For example, with UE to gNB COT sharing, a UE may be awake to share a frame of a COT with the gNB. With gNB to gNB COT sharing, if one gNB fails LBT at a frame boundary, the gNB may join the other gNB's frame (with a single shot LBT). With gNB to gNB COT sharing, a non-sharing UE may need to monitor downlink control signals and broadcast signals. In other words, if COT sharing is not applicable to a UE (e.g., no low latency requirement, not high data throughput), a UE may not be aware of this and may otherwise stay awake to monitor for signals or expect to share a frame of a COT. The UE may waste power as well as processing and signaling resources by missing sleeping opportunities in the context of COT sharing in FBE mode.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">According to various aspects described herein, a base station may indicate information about COT sharing to UEs so that the UEs have more information to determine when to go to sleep, when to monitor for signals, or when to communicate with the base station. In this way, the UEs may take advantage of sleep opportunities and spend less time on activities that consume power and processing and signaling resources.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some aspects, a base station may divide UEs into two categories based on parameters such as a quality of service (QoS) requirement. For UEs that require a high QoS, which is important for transmissions with a low latency requirement or a high data rate, or for transmissions for certain services, the base station may designate these UEs as belonging to a first category that is COT sharing. The remaining UEs may form a second category, where there is no COT sharing. UEs in the second category may sleep more and save power.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example <b>500</b> of signaling for COT sharing in FBE mode, in accordance with various aspects of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a BS <b>510</b> (e.g., BS <b>110</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>) that may communicate with a UE <b>520</b> (e.g., UE <b>120</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">As shown by reference number <b>530</b>, BS <b>510</b> may determine a designation of another device (e.g., a UE, a gNB) for COT sharing or non-COT sharing in an FBE mode, based at least in part on one or more parameters associated with communication by the other device.

The UEs may receive a designation for COT sharing and receive an indication, by a radio resource control (RRC) configuration message or a downlink control information (DCI) message, of a type of COT sharing. Type 0, for example, is a type of COT sharing that may include UE to gNB COT sharing. For Type 0 COT sharing, UE <b>520</b> may need to monitor downlink control signals and broadcast signals. UE <b>520</b> may monitor for the downlink control signals and the broadcast signals with a limited number of symbols. For example, UE <b>520</b> may monitor fewer symbols, such as 2 symbols for a subcarrier spacing (SCS) of 15 kHz, 4 symbols for an SCS of 30 kHz, and 8 symbols for an SCS of 60 kHz. Type 1 COT sharing may include TRP to TRP COT sharing, or gNB to gNB COT sharing.
