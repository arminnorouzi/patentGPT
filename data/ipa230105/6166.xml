disclosure relates to an organic electroluminescence element which is a light emitting element and equipment and apparatus which include the element.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">An organic electroluminescence (EL) element is a light emitting element which emits light by energizing an organic EL layer including a pair of electrodes and a light emitting layer interposed between the pair of electrodes. In recent years, full-color light emitting arrays in which a white light emitting organic EL element and red, green, and blue color filters are combined have been developed. The white light emitting organic EL elements are roughly divided into a single-layer type organic EL element in which light emitting dopants, each emitting red, green, or blue light, are included together in an organic EL layer so as to obtain white light emission and a layered type organic EL element in which organic EL layers, each emitting red, green, or blue light, are stacked. Regarding the layered type organic EL element, since a plurality of organic EL layers are connected in series, a configuration in which an intermediate layer called an electric charge generation layer or an intermediate electrode layer is interposed between two organic EL layers is known. Regarding the white light emitting organic EL element, since painting is not performed on a pixel basis, when the intermediate layer has low electrical resistance, adjoining pixels emit light through the intermediate layer. Therefore, intermediate layers having high resistance have been developed.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2003-45676 (PTL 1) discloses a configuration in which an organic compound doped with a conductive organic compound or an alkali metal is used as the intermediate layer. In addition, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2015-518287 (PTL 2) discloses that a layered structure of an organic compound layer doped with an alkali metal compound and an organic compound layer doped with a metal element of group II of the periodic table is included.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Regarding the organic EL element disclosed in PTL 1, an alkali metal is used for the intermediate layer. However, there is a disadvantage that the alkali metal tends to react with moisture in air and is hard to handle. On the other hand, regarding the organic EL element disclosed in PTL 2, an organic compound layer doped with an alkali metal compound which is easy to handle is formed as the intermediate layer, and an organic compound layer doped with a metal of group II is stacked. In such an instance, it is conjectured that the alkali metal compound is reduced by the metal of group II so as to realize the electron injection performance. In this regard, since the organic compound doped with the metal of group II is used, the intermediate layer has high resistance compared with the instance in which a metal element is used alone.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In particular, an alkali metal can be used for injecting electrons into the organic EL layer, but the alkali metal tends to react with moisture in air and is hard to handle. Consequently, a layer of an alkali metal compound such as lithium fluoride or a lithium-quinolinol complex which is easy to handle is formed, subsequently, a metal such as aluminum or a metal of group II which has a reducing property is vapor-deposited so as to reduce a portion of the alkali metal compound due to heat during vapor deposition and to realize the electron injection performance. In this method, the adhesiveness between the alkali metal compound layer and the metal layer having a reducing property is important. Aluminum has high adhesiveness to the alkali metal compound layer but has low electrical resistance and is unsuitable for the intermediate layer desired to have high resistance. In this regard, when a metal of group II is vapor-deposited alone, the adhesiveness to the underlying layer is low and the film forming performance is low. Therefore, when the metal of group II is used for a negative electrode or the like, to enhance the adhesiveness to the underlying layer, vapor co-deposition with silver or the like is frequently performed. However, a layer resulting from vapor co-deposition of the metal of group II and silver has low electrical resistance and is unsuitable for the intermediate layer desired to have high resistance.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In PTL 2, high adhesiveness between organic compound layers is exploited, and the adhesiveness is enhanced by stacking an organic compound layer of an organic compound doped with an alkali metal compound and an organic compound layer of an organic compound doped with a metal of group II. However, since the compatibility between the organic compound and the metal of group II is low, even when the organic compound and the metal of group II are subjected to vapor co-deposition, the metal of group II is not readily taken into the organic compound layer. Consequently, the metal compound in the underlying organic compound layer is not readily reduced, and there is a concern that the electron injection performance is not limited to being sufficiently realized.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure was realized in consideration of the above-described disadvantages and

In this regard, an intermediate layer is interposed between the two organic EL layers, and the intermediate layer contains an alkali metal compound, a reduced form of the alkali metal compound, and a metal element of group II of the periodic table (hereafter referred to as &#x201c;metal of Group II&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The configuration of an EL element according to the present disclosure will be described below in detail based on an example of a favorable embodiment with reference to the drawings. However, the configuration, relative arrangement, and the like described in the embodiment are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure, unless otherwise specified.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Organic EL Element</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic sectional view in the thickness direction (stacking direction) illustrating the configuration of an organic EL element according to the present disclosure. In the drawing, reference <b>1</b> denotes an organic EL element, reference <b>2</b> denotes a substrate, reference <b>3</b> denotes a positive electrode, reference <b>4</b> denotes an organic compound layer, reference <b>5</b> denotes a negative electrode, reference <b>10</b> denotes an organic EL layer, and reference <b>20</b> denotes an intermediate layer. In this regard, the organic compound layer <b>4</b> according to the present disclosure also includes layers, such as the intermediate layer <b>20</b>, not containing an organic compound, but, for the sake of convenience, a multilayer body interposed between the positive electrode <b>3</b> and the negative electrode <b>5</b> is referred to as an &#x201c;organic compound layer&#x201d; in the present specification.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the organic EL element <b>1</b> according to the present disclosure includes the organic compound layer <b>4</b> in which a plurality of organic EL layers <b>10</b> are stacked with the intermediate layer <b>20</b> interposed therebetween. In the organic EL element <b>1</b> according to the present disclosure, three organic EL layers <b>10</b> that emit red, green, and blue colors respectively may be included so as to emit white light in combination, or two organic EL layers <b>10</b> in which one emits two colors of red and green and the other emits a color of blue may be included so as to emit white light in combination. In addition, a plurality of organic EL layers <b>10</b> may have the same emission color so as to obtain a plurality of times of light emission and to realize high luminance. For example, when the organic EL layers <b>10</b> are two layers, obtained light emission is twice the light emission in the instance in which the organic EL layer <b>10</b> is a single layer.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the present disclosure, the organic EL layers <b>10</b> may be three or more layers, but the voltage applied between the electrodes is increased and the heat generation quantity of the element is increased. Therefore, the organic EL layers <b>10</b> can be composed of two layers. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic sectional view in the thickness direction illustrating the configuration of an embodiment in which the organic EL layers <b>10</b> are composed of two layers. In the following explanations, for the sake of convenience, a positive-electrode-side organic EL layer <b>10</b><i>a </i>is referred to as a first organic EL layer, and a negative-electrode-side organic EL layer <b>10</b><i>b </i>is referred to as a second organic EL layer. In this regard, the positions of the positive electrode <b>3</b> and the negative electrode <b>5</b> may be exchanged. However, as described below, when electron injection layers <b>15</b><i>a </i>and <b>15</b><i>b </i>are composed of an alkali metal compound, to reduce the alkali metal compound, the positive electrode <b>3</b> may be located near the substrate <b>2</b> and the layers may be formed successively from the positive electrode <b>3</b> to the negative electrode <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The intermediate layer <b>20</b> according to the present disclosure is a vapor co-deposition layer formed by subjecting the alkali metal compound and the metal of group II to vapor co-deposition. The alkali metal compound used for the intermediate layer <b>20</b> according to the present disclosure is a substance such as a halide, an oxide, a carbonate, or an organic coordination compound in which an alkali metal forms a positive ion and is bonded to a negative ion. In contrast to the alkali metal, the alkali metal compound is a substance which does not vigorously react with moisture in air, which is stable even in air, and which is easy to handle. In addition, the alkali metal compound is an essentially insulating substance due to being an ionic substance and does not exert electron injection performance without modification. When such an alkali metal compound is made into a film, and a metal such as aluminum (Al) or a metal of group II having a reducing property is vapor-deposited thereon, a portion of the alkali metal compound is reduced and the electron injection performance is realized. However, since Al has low electrical resistance, a disadvantage that adjoining pixels emit light through the intermediate layer occurs. When the metal of group II is vapor-deposited alone, since the adhesiveness to the underlying layer is low, a film is not readily formed, and vapor co-deposition with silver (Ag) or the like having high adhesiveness to the underlying layer is necessary. However, since Ag has low electrical resistance in the same manner akin to Al, a disadvantage that adjoining pixels emit light through the intermediate layer occurs. It is known that the resistivity of Al at 0&#xb0; C. is 2.50&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>&#x3a9;m and that the resistivity of Ag at 0&#xb0; C. is 1.47&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>&#x3a9;m. Therefore, the resistance tends to be lower than, for example, 3.94&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>&#x3a9;m of magnesium (Mg) classified in the metal of group II.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the present disclosure, since reduction is performed without using Al and Ag, the alkali metal compound can be subjected to vapor co-deposition with the metal of group II so as to reduce the alkali metal compound during vapor deposition. When the alkali metal compound is subjected to vapor co-deposition with the metal of group II, a portion of the alkali metal compound is reduced by the metal of group II, and the electron injection performance is realized. In this regard, the intermediate layer <b>20</b> according to the present disclosure has high electrical resistance since the alkali metal compound which is an insulating substance, a reduced form of the alkali metal compound, and the metal of group II having high resistance in spite of being a metal are mixed in the layer. When the intermediate layer <b>20</b> is formed by vapor co-deposition of the alkali metal compound and the metal of group II, the intermediate layer <b>20</b> composed of only the alkali metal compound, the reduced form of the alkali metal compound, and the metal of group II is obtained.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the present disclosure, the organic EL layers <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>include at least light emitting layers <b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b</i>, respectively.

A reducing device to reduce the light from the infrared light emitting portion to the display portion in plan view being included suppresses the image quality from deteriorating.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0119">The line of sight of the user toward the display image is detected from the image of the imaged eyeball obtained by imaging the infrared rays. Any known method may be applied to the line-of-sight detection by using the image of the imaged eyeball. As an example, a line-of-sight detection method based on a Purkinje image due to reflection of irradiation light at the cornea may be used.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0120">More specifically, line-of-sight detection treatment based on a pupil center corneal reflection method is performed. The pupil center corneal reflection method is used, and a line-of-sight vector indicating the direction (rotation angle) of the eyeball is calculated on the basis of the image of the pupil and the Purkinje image included in the image of the imaged eyeball so as to detect the line of sight of the user.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0121">The imaging display apparatus according to the present embodiment may include the imaging apparatus including a light receiving element and may control a display image of the display apparatus on the basis of the line-of-sight information of the user from the imaging apparatus. Specifically, the display apparatus determines a first line-of-sight region at which the user gazes and a second line-of-sight region other than the first line-of-sight region on the basis of line-of-sight information. The first line-of-sight region and the second line-of-sight region may be determined by the control apparatus of the display apparatus, or a signal of determination by an external control apparatus may be received. In the display region of the display apparatus, the display resolution of the first line-of-sight region may be controlled so as to be higher than the display resolution of the second line-of-sight region. That is, the second line-of-sight region may have lower resolution than the first line-of-sight region.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0122">The display region includes a first display region and a second display region different from the first display region.

The first line-of-sight region and the second line-of-sight region may be determined by the control apparatus of the display apparatus, or a signal of determination by an external control apparatus may be received. The resolution of the high priority region may be controlled so as to be higher than the resolution of a region other than the high priority region. That is, the resolution of the region having a relatively low priority may be lowered.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0123">In this regard, AI may be used for determining the first line-of-sight region and the high priority region. AI may be a model configured to estimate the angle of the line of sight and the line-of-sight distance up to the object on the basis of the image of the eyeball where the training data are the image of the eyeball and the actual line-of-sight direction of the eyeball of the image. The AI program may be included in any one of the display apparatus, the imaging apparatus, and the external apparatus. The AI program included in the external apparatus is passed to the display apparatus through communications.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0124">Display control based on visual recognition detection can be applied to the smart glasses further including an imaging apparatus to image the outside.
