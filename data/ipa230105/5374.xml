A person requesting a booking would speak to a human operator who would record the booking details such as pickup and drop off locations, the number of passengers and a journey start time.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Vehicles and drivers were then allocated to bookings by a human operator, called a controller. The controller would be in contact with the drivers of vehicles of a fleet by voice channels (typically one shared voice channel) of a radio system, through which the controller and the drivers could speak with one another. The controller could ascertain the locations of drivers by requesting the drivers to provide their locations verbally. The controller could also enquire of drivers when they expected to drop passengers and thus become free again for fulfilling a booking. Drivers would be provided with details of bookings allocated to them by the controller verbally through the radio system. Such manual systems are still widely in use.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Attempts have been made to automate the actions of the controller, and further to automate the reporting of some vehicle characteristics such as location to the controller. However, in most instances such techniques still require drivers to acknowledge and authenticate the system at various stages in order to ensure successful and safe operation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Increasingly, vehicles have autonomous driving capabilities. In order to take advantage of such capabilities in the management of a fleet of vehicles, improved techniques are required.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a computer-implemented method of managing a fleet of autonomous vehicles, comprising: receiving at least one request for a passenger journey from a client device associated with a passenger; allocating an autonomous vehicle to the passenger from the fleet; receiving, from the client device, confirmation that the autonomous vehicle has reached the passenger; receiving, from the allocated autonomous vehicle, one or more vehicle status signals; and authorising the autonomous vehicle to proceed with the passenger journey in dependence on the vehicle status signals.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">As such, a fleet of vehicles can be managed in such a way as to ensure safety and/or other criteria are met before a passenger journey proceeds. By receiving confirmation from the client device that the autonomous vehicle has reached the passenger and receiving one or more status signals (optionally directly) from the vehicle, account can be taken by a centrally managed fleet of both vehicle and passenger requirements. For example, both passenger presence and vehicle readiness may be assessed prior to the vehicle proceeding on a scheduled journey.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some examples, the vehicle status signals comprise one or more door status indicators. Additionally or alternatively, the vehicle status signals comprise one or more luggage compartment indicators. For example, the vehicle status signals may be used to confirm that doors and/or luggage compartments are closed before a journey proceeds. Moreover, signals from the doors and or luggage compartment may be used to infer additional information for later journey control. For example, signals indicating the opening and closing of the luggage compartment may be used to infer the presence of passenger luggage in the compartment.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The vehicle status signals may additionally or alternatively comprise one or more seat occupied indicators. Furthermore, they may additionally or alternatively comprise one or more seat belt engagement indicators. Signals of these kinds can be said to assist in ensuring passenger safety and also to identify the number of passengers within a vehicle in order to ensure efficient operation of the fleet.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the method further comprises: identifying a user profile from the request, the user profile indicating one or more vehicle environmental preferences; and transmitting instructions to the allocated autonomous vehicle to comply with the vehicle environmental preferences. In some embodiments, the vehicle environmental preferences may comprise one or more of: temperature, lighting and audio preferences. In this manner, environmental conditions of the vehicle can be set prior to arrival at a passenger location. Thee can be particularly advantageous in respect of conditions which cannot be immediately altered; for example, arriving at a preferred temperature may require a period of temperature adjustment and performing this adjustment prior to reaching the passenger will improve passenger experience.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Optionally, the method may further comprise: transmitting one or more alerts to the client device in dependence on the vehicle status signals; receiving one or more passenger responses to the alerts from the client device; wherein authorising the autonomous vehicle to proceed with the passenger journey is further dependent on the one or more passenger responses. For example, a passenger may be alerted that an apparently occupied seat does not have a seatbelt secured; the passenger may confirm that the seat occupancy warning is the result of luggage present on the seat and that the vehicle is nonetheless safe to proceed. Many other types of alerts may be provided to passengers in dependence on vehicle signals in order to allow passenger response to control subsequent actions, and particularly whether the vehicle proceeds with the journey.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the method may further comprise instructing the allocated autonomous vehicle to unlock one or more doors in response to receiving confirmation that the autonomous vehicle has reached the passenger. In this manner, the vehicle may be secured until it reaches the passenger.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The method may further comprise receiving confirmation from the allocated autonomous vehicle that the vehicle has reached a destination. Moreover, the method may comprise receiving confirmation from the client device that the passenger journey is complete. In some embodiments, subsequent to receiving confirmation that the passenger journey is complete, the method may comprise: receiving one or more further vehicle status signals from the allocated autonomous vehicle; and identifying the vehicle as empty in dependence on the one or more further vehicle status signals. The method may further comprise providing one or more further alerts to the client device in response to the one or more further vehicle status signals. As such, when a vehicle journey is complete, steps may be taken to confirm with a passenger that no further action is required. For example, a passenger may be alerted to luggage stored in the luggage compartment or additional information of interest/use.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the method may comprise receiving one or more passenger responses to the further alerts from the client device; and identifying the vehicle as empty may be further dependent on the one or more passenger responses. For example, the passengers may confirm that there is no further action to be taken and/or that luggage has been removed from the vehicle. Once the vehicle has been identified as empty, the method may comprise returning the vehicle to a pool of vehicles for allocation.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Further aspects of the present disclosure provide a computer-implemented method of managing a fleet of autonomous vehicles, comprising: receiving at least one request for a passenger journey from a client device associated with a passenger; allocating an autonomous vehicle to the passenger from the fleet; and controlling environmental conditions within the allocated vehicle to match a passenger profile. Still further aspects provide a computer-implemented method of managing a fleet of autonomous vehicles, comprising: receiving a one or more requests for a passenger journey from a client device associated with a passenger; allocating an autonomous vehicle to the passenger from the fleet; receiving, from the allocated autonomous vehicle, one or more vehicle status signals; inferring vehicle occupancy from the received signals and authorising the autonomous vehicle to proceed with the passenger journey in dependence on the vehicle occupancy. For example, the vehicle may be authorised to proceed only if the vehicle occupancy matches a requested occupancy in the request for the passenger journey. Still further aspects provide a computer-implemented method of managing a fleet of autonomous vehicles, comprising: receiving at least one request for a passenger journey from a client device associated with a passenger; allocating an autonomous vehicle to the passenger from the fleet; receiving, from the client device, confirmation that the autonomous vehicle has reached the passenger; providing, to the autonomous vehicle, one or more notifications in dependence upon a profile associated with the passenger.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Further aspects of the present disclosure provide an apparatus having at least one processor and at least one memory having computer-readable code stored thereon which, when executed, controls the at least one processor to manage a plurality of networked vehicle resources by performing the method of the previous aspects. Still further aspects may provide a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having stored thereon computer-readable code, which, when executed by computing apparatus, causes the computing apparatus to manage a plurality of networked vehicle resources, by performing the method of the first aspect.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The skilled person will recognize that the features of the aspects above may be combined as appropriate and that optional elements of the first aspect may also be applied to other aspects.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a system for management of a private hire vehicle service according to various aspects of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a passenger companion service implemented by the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref></p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a vehicle companion service implemented by the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref></p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a journey fulfilment service implemented by the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a safety companion service implemented by the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates exemplary operation of the services of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>5</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating components of a server forming part of the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Overview</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Embodiments of the disclosure provide a system that can integrate with a fleet of partially or fully autonomous vehicles.

The system <b>100</b> includes at its centre a core system <b>101</b>. This comprises one or more server computers running system software that ensures smooth operation of the system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Key functions of the system wo are bookings, allocation of a private hire vehicle to a booking, vehicle management, account management and record keeping.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The booking function is provided primarily by a web booking server <b>102</b>, an application booking server <b>103</b> and call centre terminals <b>104</b>A and <b>104</b>B, all of which are coupled to the core system <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The allocation function is provided primarily by a job allocation module <b>105</b>, with information from other parts of the system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The system includes database functions. In particular, an operational database <b>130</b> stores records that relate to general operation of the system <b>100</b>. A vehicle database <b>131</b> stores records that relate to vehicles that are managed by the system <b>100</b>. Lastly, a historical database <b>132</b> stores records that have been archived from the operational is database <b>130</b>. Archiving of records from the operational database <b>130</b> to the historical database <b>132</b> occurs periodically and only records that are no longer needed for general operational use are archived.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The vehicle management function is provided primarily by a vehicle location monitoring module <b>106</b> and a vehicle devices server <b>107</b>, with reference to the vehicle database <b>131</b> as well as other components of the system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The account management function is provided primarily by an account management module <b>117</b>, utilising accounts information stored in the operational database <b>130</b> along with other components of the system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The operational database <b>130</b> stores details of every account held with the operator of the system <b>100</b>. Each account is identified by an account number stored in the operational database <b>130</b>. The accounts information stored in the operational database <b>130</b> may also include an account name, such as a company name and contact details for the company. The accounts information stored in the operational database <b>130</b> stores credit card details and/or other payment details so that payment can be taken from the account holder if permitted. A password and/or PIN (personal identification number) is associated with each account and stored with the accounts information in the operational database <b>130</b>. Furthermore, a list of persons authorised to make bookings on the account may be stored, and optionally profiles for the individual authorised persons within the accounts.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The accounts information stored in the operational database <b>130</b> may also include a contact name and telephone number of a person who should be contacted in case of problems with the account. The accounts information stored in the operational database <b>130</b> includes information regarding invoicing preferences, for example the frequency of invoicing, date on which the invoice should be sent, the monthly/weekly credit limit and what information from each booking should be included on the invoice. The accounts information stored in the operational database <b>130</b> may indicate whether each account is active, or if it has been placed on hold. An account may be placed on hold by a credit control department and this may prevent further bookings being made on the account. Historical data of spending on the account may also be stored in the operational database <b>130</b>, or this may be stored in the historical database <b>132</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The record keeping function is provided primarily by the historical database <b>132</b>, although the operational database <b>130</b> and the vehicle database <b>131</b> also provide some record keeping function.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In brief, a fleet of private hire vehicles is managed by the system <b>100</b>. Each vehicle has a respective record in the vehicle database <b>131</b>, as will now be described.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The vehicle database <b>131</b> stores information about every vehicle in the fleet. The registration number (license plate number) of each vehicle is stored in the vehicle database <b>131</b>. This may be used to identify each vehicle. Alternatively or in addition, a unique identifier separate from the registration number may be assigned to each vehicle as the primary means of identification within the vehicle database <b>131</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Each Service is defined according to its vehicle type, capacity and other characteristics. In some embodiments, these types are &#x201c;Up to 4 passengers&#x201d;, &#x201c;Up to 7 passengers&#x201d;, &#x201c;Electric vehicle&#x201d;, &#x201c;VIP&#x201d; and &#x201c;Up to 4 passengers with luggage&#x201d;. The vehicle database <b>131</b> stores the type of each vehicle and may also store a corresponding number or short string of characters which represents each type. Any special equipment such as a baby seat or the ability to accommodate a wheelchair is also identified in the vehicle database <b>131</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The vehicle database <b>131</b> stores the make and model and optionally the colour of each vehicle. The vehicle database <b>131</b> also indicates the current status of the vehicle. In some embodiments, the status is chosen from &#x201c;Vehicle Pool&#x201d;, meaning that the car is in use, &#x201c;Free Pool&#x201d;, meaning that the car is not currently being used and is free to be allocated and &#x201c;Workshop&#x201d;, meaning that the car is undergoing maintenance or repair. The vehicle database <b>131</b> also stores the private hire license number (PCO) for each vehicle and the date on which this license expires as well as the road tax, vehicle insurance and MOT (vehicle roadworthiness certificate) expiry dates if appropriate. Examples of other data which may be stored are the date of purchase of the vehicle, the price paid for the vehicle, the date of manufacture, the supplier of the vehicle, warranty information and the date of the last inspection/maintenance.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Historic data about each vehicle may also be stored in the vehicle database <b>131</b>, such as a record of the previous registration numbers. The service history and details of any accidents and repairs may also be stored.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Each vehicle has an associated control system <b>110</b> or autonomous mode controller, three of which are shown at <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B and <b>110</b>C in the Figure. In the example shown, the vehicles are autonomous vehicles, also known as driverless vehicles or driverless cars. The autonomous mode controller controls the speed and direction of the autonomous vehicle and maintains an accurate record of the unmanned vehicle's location and orientation. Autonomous driving sensors may include any number of devices configured to generate signals that help navigate the vehicle while the vehicle is operating in an autonomous (e.g., driverless) mode. The autonomous vehicle may comprise a number of cameras and other sensors, including LIDAR and/or radar sensors, which feed information about the vehicle's surroundings to the on-board operating system. The information includes the position, constitution, orientation and velocity of nearby objects, including other vehicles. The autonomous driving sensors help the vehicle &#x201c;see&#x201d; the roadway and the vehicle surroundings and/or negotiate various obstacles while the vehicle is operating in the autonomous mode. The on-board operating system may communicate with the core system <b>101</b> via the radio network <b>111</b> using any suitable protocol. The autonomous mode control <b>110</b> may return additional vehicle status signals to the core system <b>101</b>, including information about current passenger conditions and the status of doors, luggage compartments, seat belt and seat monitors etc.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The autonomous mode controller may be configured to control one or more subsystems while the vehicle is operating in the autonomous mode. Examples of subsystems that may be controlled by the autonomous mode controller may include a brake subsystem, a suspension subsystem, a steering subsystem, and a powertrain subsystem. The autonomous mode controller may control any one or more of these subsystems by outputting signals to control units associated with these subsystems. The autonomous mode controller may control the subsystems based, at least in part, on signals generated by the autonomous driving sensors.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The autonomous vehicles may have on-board route planning modules as part of the autonomous mode controller. Upon the autonomous vehicle receiving information representing a start and end location for a route, the on-board route planning module accesses the map and location database <b>109</b> and optionally traffic data in the historical database <b>132</b> and/or live traffic information to calculate a best route. The autonomous vehicle may also be given information representing one or more waypoints to travel to between the start and end locations, or a number of waypoints or locations which can be travelled to in any order. The route planning module may then calculate the most efficient route to take to visit each of the locations.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Alternatively, the autonomous vehicle may not have an on-board route planning module and may instead receive route information, i.e. information specifying one or more routes, or navigation instructions from the core system <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The control systems <b>110</b> are connected to the vehicle server <b>107</b> via radio network <b>111</b>, which may for instance be a mobile phone (cellular phone) network. In this case, the control systems <b>110</b> are provided with subscriptions to the mobile phone network such that they can send digital data to and from the vehicle server <b>107</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The radio network <b>111</b> may alternatively be a dedicated radio network, for instance a private mobile phone network or a private radio network of some other type.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Data may be communicated between the control systems <b>110</b> and vehicle server <b>107</b> over any suitable communications link, for instance using a data channel of a cellular telephone network such as a GSM, EDGE, GPRS, UMTS, HSxPA or LTE network.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The control systems <b>110</b> are configured to report their locations at regular intervals, for instance 30 second intervals. The control systems <b>110</b> may include GPS (global positioning system) receivers, which calculate the locations of vehicles. Alternatively, they may include some other positioning module or device that is operable to calculate the positions of the vehicles with a suitable level of accuracy and resolution.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">A private hire vehicle may be booked by a customer in one of three ways. Firstly, a private hire vehicle may be booked in a telephone conversation with a call centre operator. In this case, the customer initiates a telephone call with a call centre, an agent of which operates one of the call centre computer terminals <b>104</b>A and <b>104</b>B. The call centre agent then operates the terminal <b>104</b>A, <b>104</b>B so as to make the booking of the private hire vehicle according to the customer's requirements. The customer's requirements are obtained verbally during the telephone conversation between the customer and the agent.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the second option, the customer may make the private hire vehicle booking using a browser application on a computing device <b>113</b>, three examples of which are shown at <b>113</b>A, <b>113</b>B and <b>113</b>C in the Figure. Each of the computing devices <b>113</b> is connected to the web booking server <b>102</b> by a network <b>114</b>, which may for instance be the Internet or another public or private network. The web booking server <b>102</b> includes web server functionality that causes display of suitable web pages by the browser of the terminal <b>113</b>. The customer's requirements with respect to the private hire vehicle booking are obtained by the web booking server <b>102</b> through the provision of suitable pages to the computer terminal <b>113</b> requesting the provision of the required information by the customer. The information may be provided by the customer through free text entry through the use of drop down lists, radio buttons etc. Some information may be pre-filled into the web pages provided by the web booking server <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Booking through the web booking server <b>102</b> may require the customer to login to a web portal before they can make their booking. The logging in may require the entering of a username and a password or PIN number. Through the control of a web session by the web booking server <b>102</b>, for instance using cookies provided to the computer terminals <b>113</b>, the booking can be known to have been validly made by virtue of the customer having being logged in to the web booking server at the time the booking was made.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The final way in which a customer can make a booking of a private hire vehicle is using a dedicated software application (&#x201c;app&#x201d;) that is installed on and running on a portable communications device <b>112</b>, three of which are shown at <b>112</b>A, <b>112</b>B and <b>112</b>C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The portable communications devices <b>112</b> may take any suitable form, but typically are smart phones, feature phones, tablet computers or personal digital assistants or such like. The communication devices <b>112</b> are coupled to the application booking server <b>103</b> by a radio network <b>111</b>, which may be the same as the radio network <b>111</b> described above with relation to the control systems <b>110</b> and the vehicle server <b>107</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The application is configured to provide a user interface that allows the customer to provide the software application with the information required to make the private hire vehicle booking. For instance, the software application, when executed, may cause the display of interactive pages that allow the customer to select or enter the required information. The software application is configured also to communicate the information relating to the booking that has been provided by the customer to the application booking server <b>103</b>. If based on information provided by the customer it is determined that the application booking server <b>103</b> requires additional information, the software application running the mobile device <b>112</b> is configured to provide an interactive display to the customer such that the customer can provide the information, following which the software application causes it to be provided to the application booking server <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The customer may be required to log in to the software application on the mobile device <b>112</b>, prior to making a booking. Logging in to the software application may require a username and a password or PIN number. Alternatively, the username may be entered during set up of the application and may not need to be entered subsequently when this software application is executed. If the username is not required to be entered, the user may log in to the software application simply by entering the password or PIN number.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The information about the private hire vehicle booking that is obtained during the booking process is as follows.<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0057">Customer details.

This indicates the category of vehicle. For instance, the service type may indicate a vehicle of a standard type and having four seats, or a vehicle of a standard type and having seven seats. The service may alternatively indicate a VIP vehicle, or an environmentally-friendly (electric or hybrid) vehicle (also known as a green vehicle).</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0059">Journey type. The journey type may be a single (one-way) trip, or it may be a wait and return trip. The journey type may alternatively be a journey including multiple pick-up locations or multiple drop off locations or both multiple pick-ups and multiple drop off locations. The journey type may alternatively indicate that it is a pick-up from an airport or a drop at an airport.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0060">Pick-up address. This indicates an address at which the customer is to be picked up at the beginning of the journey. The address is a natural language address. The address is selected from one of the plurality of addresses stored in a database. The addresses may be stored in the operational database <b>130</b> or the historical database <b>132</b>, or they may be provided by an external address database service, for instance geo.me or qas.co.uk. The addresses each have associated therewith a verified coordinate location expressed in latitude and longitude. Multiple databases may be used (in a hierarchical fashion) for address lookup. The pick-up address may be selected by the customer in any suitable way, with the most appropriate way depending on whether the customer is using the software application on their mobile device, using the web booking service or using an agent in a call centre. If the journey type is an airport pick-up type, the pick-up address indicates the airport and terminal and optionally flight number.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0061">Drop off address. The drop off address again is selected from one of multiple addresses stored in the database and is selected by the customer in any suitable way. If the journey type is an airport drop off type, the pick-up address indicates the airport and terminal and optionally flight number.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0062">Pick-up date and time. This indicates a time and date which the customer requires the journey to start. Alternatively, the date and time may indicate ASAP (as soon as possible), if the customer requires the private hire vehicle at the earliest opportunity.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0058" num="0063">Optional information regarding the booking includes the following.<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0064">Customer's reference.

The cost calculation module <b>122</b> executes software code which determines the price for a requested journey, during the booking process and prior to vehicle allocation. Journey cost calculation is performed at the time of a booking and the result returned to the customer requesting the booking. The resulting cost for the journey is provided before the customer confirms the booking.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0067">The journey cost calculation module <b>122</b> uses a number of different ways of calculating the base cost of the journey. The module <b>122</b> may set a fixed price for some journeys. These are agreed in advance with a particular account customer for journeys between pre-determined points. The cost calculation module <b>122</b> checks whether the booked journey and customer meet the requirements for a fixed price tariff. If the conditions are not met, then another pricing method is used. The cost calculation module <b>122</b> may use zonal pricing if a fixed price is not used. Where every point on the journey is within a defined zone, zonal pricing can be used. If neither fixed pricing nor zonal pricing is used, or if the conditions for their application are not met, then the cost calculation module <b>122</b> may use an A to B (A-B) pricing method. The A-B method may specify the number of units between points A and B. A unit price depending on the type of vehicle etc. is then used to calculate the price. If there is no A-B record for a particular journey, the crow fly (direct) distance (i.e. the length of a straight line between the pick-up and drop-off locations) is used to calculate the base cost for the journey. This method may use map grid references or alternatively may be based on GPS data, i.e. the latitude and longitude of the pick-up and drop-off points.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0068">The cost calculation module <b>122</b> may retrieve all the map and location information needed to make these calculations from the historical database <b>132</b>. The historical database <b>132</b> may store a detailed geospatial model of a particular region, such as a city. As an alternative, or in addition to the methods described above, the cost calculation module <b>122</b> may use the real road distance for the journey, which is calculated using the road map from the historical database <b>132</b> and a route planning algorithm. Different rates may be used for different parts of a single journey. For example a first per mile rate may be used for the first 10 miles of a journey and a second per mile rate may be used for the rest of the journey. The historical database <b>132</b> may also store information regarding speed limits and historical traffic data. This information may also be used by the cost calculation module <b>122</b> to calculate an estimated time for the journey. The estimated journey time may then form the basis of the cost calculation.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0069">Other criteria used by the cost calculation module <b>122</b> when calculating the price are the type of vehicle (VIP, green, 7-seater etc.) including any special facilities the vehicle has, the method of payment and the date and time of the journey. The cost calculation module <b>122</b> may also apply a flat &#x201c;pick-up fee&#x201d; for every journey.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0070">The allocation function allocates a vehicle to a booking. The allocation function is arranged to ensure a vehicle is allocated to the booking, and the associated customer, having regard to a number of factors including the pick-up location specified in the booking, the drop off location specified in the booking, the service type specified in the booking, the date and time specified in the booking, the geographical distribution of the vehicles that are managed by the system <b>100</b>, and the demand for vehicles that are managed by the system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0071">The allocation function is automatic insofar as it does not require any manual involvement once the booking has been made. Once a job has been allocated to a particular vehicle, this is recorded in the operational database <b>130</b> with an indication that the journey has not yet been travelled.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0072">The vehicle management function includes a number of features. These include the monitoring of vehicle in terms of distance travelled etc. and ensuring that they provided for mechanical servicing at appropriate times.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0073">The accounts management function acts to manage information relating to customer's accounts with the operator of the system <b>100</b>. This includes the maintenance and management of information such as authorised users, credit limits, invoicing requirement etc.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0074">The record keeping function acts to store various information that is created by or observed by the system <b>100</b>. This information includes information about bookings yet to be fulfilled, which is included in the operational database <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0075">In order to take advantage of, and improve control in view of, the autonomous capabilities of the vehicles of the fleet under control, the system <b>100</b> may provide one or more autonomous vehicle services to complement the modules identified above. Examples of such services are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>5</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a passenger companion service <b>200</b>; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a vehicle companion service <b>300</b>; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates journey fulfilment service <b>400</b>; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a safety companion service <b>500</b>.

In part this may relay information to a passenger but it also may provide an appropriate interface via which a passenger may optimise their experience. The passenger companion service <b>200</b> handles in car and out of car passenger experience through identity and passenger profile preferences combined with advisory prompts and additional information.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0077">For example, a passenger companion event queue <b>202</b> may be implemented to receive vehicle status signals via vehicle interface <b>210</b> and provide instructions to the vehicle interface <b>210</b>.

Through the voice analytics channel <b>514</b>, there may also be provided the ability to detect anxiety within the passenger's voice and consequently will trigger an intervention from the autonomous safety team <b>516</b> via live chat or a call. That is, the system may monitor the voice of passengers within a vehicle and in dependence on characteristics of that voice selectively activate a communication channel with the autonomous safety team <b>516</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0139">The intelligent passenger alarm function <b>506</b> allows a passenger within the vehicle to trigger an alarm either through an app on the user device <b>112</b> or through the vehicle's own interface. This function may initiate a live video feed that will be presented to autonomous safety team <b>516</b>. The autonomous safety team <b>516</b> may then engage with the passenger via live chat or a call or other suitable mechanism. The choice of mechanism may depend on vehicle occupancy count. In some embodiments, once an alarm is triggered the vehicle will automatically be sent an instruction to stop at the next available safe location unless overridden by a member of the autonomous safety team <b>516</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0140">Whether the system loo includes one or multiple servers, each server includes a number of features as will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows one server <b>40</b>. If the system <b>100</b> comprises plural servers, multiple versions of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> server <b>40</b> are connected together.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0141">Each server <b>40</b> in the system <b>100</b> includes a processor <b>412</b>. The processor <b>412</b> is connected to volatile memory such as RAM <b>413</b> by a bus <b>418</b>. The bus <b>418</b> also connects the processor <b>112</b> and the RAM <b>413</b> to non-volatile memory, such as ROM <b>414</b>. A communications interface <b>415</b> is coupled to the bus <b>418</b>, and thus also to the processor <b>412</b> and the memories <b>413</b>, <b>414</b>. The interface <b>415</b> is connected to a radio network in any suitable way, for instance via the Internet or a local network. Within the ROM <b>414</b> is stored a software application <b>417</b>, which includes program code that causes the server to perform the functions required of it. An operating system (OS) <b>420</b> also is stored in the ROM <b>414</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0142">An output device such as a display <b>419</b> may be provided with the server <b>40</b>. An input device such as a keyboard <b>421</b> may be provided with the server <b>40</b>. This allows configuration, monitoring and updating by administrators and other users as required.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0143">The server <b>40</b> may take any suitable form. Generally speaking, the server <b>40</b> comprises processing circuitry <b>412</b>, including one or more processors, and a storage device <b>414</b>, <b>413</b>, comprising a single memory unit or a plurality of memory units. The storage device <b>414</b>, <b>413</b> stores computer program instructions that, when loaded into the processing circuitry <b>412</b>, control the operation of the server <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0144">In use, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a customer may submit a booking request (at step s<b>1</b>) through an app downloaded on user device <b>112</b>. This request may comprise passenger identity details together with details of the proposed booking. A vehicle is then allocated to the booking. Passenger companion service <b>200</b> may identify the passenger and passenger preferences, passing these through vehicle companion service via vehicle interface <b>210</b> (at step s<b>2</b>) to be implemented at the vehicle allocated to the job. Journey fulfilment service <b>400</b> may communicate (at step s<b>3</b>) with the allocated vehicle to provide relevant journey instructions and to provide information to the passenger when the vehicle is on its way or has arrived.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0145">When the passenger locates the vehicle (step s<b>4</b>), the passenger fulfilment service <b>200</b> via identity service channel <b>226</b> authenticates the passenger identity (step s<b>5</b>). The safety companion service <b>500</b> may then be invoked.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0146">The safety companion service <b>500</b> instructs (at step s<b>6</b>) the vehicle to be unlocked to allow the passenger to enter. It then obtains multiple vehicle status signals (at step s<b>7</b>) associated with passenger activity. As noted above, this may comprises door opened/closed events, luggage compartment open/closed events, seat occupied notifications and seatbelt notifications, amongst others. In this manner the safety companion service <b>500</b> may ascertain whether the vehicle is safe to proceed with the journey, only authorising the vehicle to proceed once this has been confirmed. For example, the safety companion service may ascertain that all doors are closed prior to proceeding, or that all passengers are seated/have engaged their seatbelts. The safety companion service <b>500</b> may also identify any additional, unauthorised passengers have entered the vehicle and prevent the vehicle proceeding in such circumstances unless appropriate changes are made to the booking. In this manner, the system can assist in ensuring the effectiveness and operational efficiency of ride-sharing bookings, for example.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0147">In the event that the safety companion service <b>500</b> identifies that the passenger must be alerted to an aspect of the vehicle situation that does not allow the vehicle to proceed, it may provide an alert (step s<b>8</b>) via either the user device <b>112</b> or through a user interface provided within the vehicle. In some circumstance, a user may interface with the app on their device <b>112</b> to respond (step s<b>9</b>) to such alerts (for example, by confirming that a bag is on a seat and thus no seatbelt is required). The user may also interface via a voice-controlled chatbot integrated with the vehicle and via AI chatbot channel <b>510</b> to receive and provide similar information.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0148">There may be occasions on which it is beneficial for the user to be connected with autonomous safety team <b>516</b>. In some circumstances, for example, the voice-controlled chatbot may be analyse the voice of the passenger and detect a level of anxiety that is above a threshold; in response, it may initiate contact between the passenger and the autonomous safety team <b>516</b>. The autonomous safety team <b>516</b> may then engage with the passenger via live chat or a call or other suitable mechanism.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0149">Where the vehicle is in motion there may be circumstances where the safety companion service <b>500</b> acts to instruct the vehicle to stop at the next safe opportunity.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0150">Once the safety companion service <b>500</b> establishes it is safe to do so, it instructs the vehicle (at step s<b>10</b>) that it may proceed to its destination. The journey fulfilment service <b>300</b> may monitor this progress (at step s<b>11</b>) through the vehicle GPS, while the passenger companion service <b>200</b> may provide relevant information (at step s<b>12</b>) to the user throughout the journey via the AI data insight feed <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0151">When the vehicle arrives at its destination (step s<b>13</b>), the system loo may receive additional vehicle status signals from the vehicle (at step s<b>14</b>) to confirm satisfactory and safe completion of the journey. Further, the system may establish that the booking is complete via the reception of additional status signals indicating, for example, that the passengers have opened at closed the doors and are no longer present in the vehicle. The safety companion service <b>500</b> may act to remind passengers that they used the luggage compartment when entering the vehicle and monitor to see if luggage is retrieved via additional status signals from the vehicle. Again, alerts or notifications can be provided to the passenger to ensure that all necessary information is available.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0152">Once it has been established that all passengers have left the vehicle it may be identified as empty and returned to the pool of vehicles for later allocation. At this point, the vehicle companion service <b>300</b> may act to return the environmental conditions of the vehicle to a default setting ready for the next booking by instructing the vehicle accordingly (step s<b>15</b>).</p><p id="p-0104" num="0153">The term &#x2018;memory&#x2019; when used in this specification is intended to relate primarily to memory comprising both non-volatile memory and volatile memory unless the context implies otherwise, although the term may also cover one or more volatile memories only, one or more non-volatile memories only, or one or more volatile memories and one or more non-volatile memories.
