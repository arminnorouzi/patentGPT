end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Bearing units provided with rolling elements are known, said rolling elements being used to allow relative movement of a component or group with respect to another component or group. The bearing unit has in general a first component, for example a radially outer ring, which is fixed to a rotating element, and a second component, for example a radially inner ring, which is fixed to a stationary element. It frequently happens that the radially inner ring is rotatable, while the radially outer ring is stationary, but in other applications, e.g. in the food industry, in the marble industry, the outer ring rotates (in the marble industry a typical rotational speed is around 750 rpm) and the inner ring is stationary. In any case, rotation of one ring with respect to the other ring is allowed by a plurality of rolling elements, which are positioned between the cylindrical surface of one component and the cylindrical surface of the second component, normally called raceways. The rolling elements may be balls, cylindrical or tapered rollers, needle rollers, or similar rolling elements.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is likewise known that bearing units have suitable sealing devices for protection against external contaminants and for ensuring sealing of grease or other lubricants inside the bearing unit. Typically these sealing devices consist of a shaped screen mounted by means of interference in suitable seats of the rings of the bearing unit, for example the radially outer ring, and are made of metallic or plastic material, for example PTFE. These sealing devices must ensure an optimum performance both from a functional point of view and in terms of reliability, during a whole working life of the bearing unit. The sealing devices must not deteriorate over time and must always remain within their seats, otherwise they risk losing complete functionality.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In fact, one of the main problems of known sealing devices is the sealing device becoming accidentally detached, namely coming out of the seat during operation of the bearing unit. In order to avoid this problem, sealing devices are provided with an element for anchoring the sealing means by locking it mechanically. Typically, the anchoring element is a snap ring, which is made of metallic material and locked inside a seat of the radially outer ring of the bearing unit.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Problems still exist with known anchoring elements. The anchoring of a shaped screen poses a problem associated with axial play. Known snap rings require an axial play equal to at least 15% of its total width in order to be assembled. The consequence of this axial play is that the snap ring does not push the shaped screen against the radially outer ring. Therefore, there is risk that the shaped screen may rotate inside the seat of the radially outer ring and damage not only the outer ring, but also the radially inner ring.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Moreover, a lack of a contact with the radially outer ring means that there is a possibility of a significant leakage of grease on an anchoring side of the shaped screen. This may happen because, in applications where the radially outer ring rotates, resultant centrifugal forces cause the grease to reach a top part of the anchoring system. Therefore, there is a possibility that the grease may escape the sealing system of the bearing unit.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In specific applications where large dimensions are involved, grease leakage is very real because large and thin snap rings utilized have a very marked undulation. Thus, during assembly, a groove of a seat formed on the radially outer ring tends to flatten out the snap ring as far as possible, such that in some places, the snap ring will not make contact with the shaped screen, creating a small labyrinth along which the grease is able to pass.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">There therefore exists a need to define a bearing unit provided with a sealing system which does not have the aforementioned drawbacks.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">An object of the present disclosure is to provide a bearing unit with an optimized sealing device that seals the bearing unit from external contaminants while preventing leakage of grease from inside of the bearing unit.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">An object of the present disclosure is achieved by means of a particular geometry of an anchoring groove of a sealing device present in a radially outer ring. In particular, the geometry of the groove has an inclined face, which allows a snap ring to fill all empty spaces and to enter perfectly into contact with a shaped screen. This allows the shaped screen to avoid any type of rotation inside the seat of the outer ring and to avoid assuming an inclined position and come into contact with the surfaces of the inner ring of the bearing unit, with consequent damage thereto.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">With reference now to the figures, exemplary embodiments of a bearing unit according to the present disclosure are described purely by way of non-limiting example.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a bearing unit <b>10</b> may include a rotatable radially outer ring <b>31</b> with a central axis of rotation X of bearing unit <b>10</b>, a stationary radially inner ring <b>33</b>, a row of rolling elements <b>32</b>, e.g. balls, rollers, interposed between radially outer ring <b>31</b> and radially inner ring <b>33</b>, and a cage <b>34</b> for containing row of rolling elements <b>32</b> so as to keep the rolling elements in position.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the whole of the present disclosure and in the claims, terms and expressions indicating positions and orientations such as &#x201c;radial&#x201d; and &#x201c;axial&#x201d; are understood as referring to central axis of rotation X of bearing unit <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">For simplicity of graphical illustration, reference number <b>32</b> will be attributed both to individual rolling elements and to a row of elements. Again for simplicity, the term &#x201c;ball&#x201d; may be used by way of example in the present disclosure and in the attached drawings instead of the more generic term &#x201c;rolling element&#x201d; (and likewise the same reference numbers will be used). Some examples of embodiments and the associated drawings may envisage the use of rolling elements other than balls (for example rollers) without thereby departing from the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Bearing unit <b>10</b> may also be provided with one or more sealing devices <b>35</b> for sealing off bearing unit <b>10</b> from an external environment. Below the sealing devices <b>35</b> may be indicated also more simply as seals <b>50</b>, obviously understood as referring to the same component.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In various embodiments, a bearing unit <b>10</b> may be provided with a sealing device <b>35</b> having an optimized anchoring system. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a sealing device <b>35</b> may be interposed between radially inner ring <b>33</b> and radially outer ring <b>31</b>. Sealing device <b>35</b> may have a shaped sealing screen <b>40</b> made of a metallic material and include a cylindrical portion <b>41</b>. Shaped sealing screen <b>40</b> may have a particular shape configured to allow shaped sealing screen <b>40</b> to form a labyrinth seal <b>39</b> between cylindrical portion <b>41</b> and radially inner ring <b>33</b> that is particularly advantageous for preventing entry of contaminants inside bearing unit <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In various embodiments, shaped sealing screen <b>40</b> may be stably inserted by means of a radially distal flanged portion <b>42</b> inside a first seat <b>50</b> of radially outer ring <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Shaped sealing screen <b>40</b> may be kept in a stable position inside first seat <b>50</b> due to a locking action of an anchoring element <b>60</b>, e.g., a snap ring <b>60</b> made of a metallic material. Snap ring <b>60</b> may be inserted by means of interference inside a second seat <b>70</b> of radially outer ring <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, an optimized anchoring system for anchoring a sealing device <b>35</b> to a bearing unit <b>10</b> according to the present disclosure is described below.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In various embodiments, an axial thickness Ss of shaped sealing screen <b>40</b> may be greater than an axial depth Pa of seat <b>50</b> by an axial length L<b>0</b>. In other words, shaped sealing screen <b>40</b> axially occupies at least part of an inlet <b>72</b>&#x2032; of second seat <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A second seat <b>70</b> may be a groove <b>70</b> formed in radially outer ring <b>31</b>. Groove <b>70</b> may extend radially outwards from axis X and inside outer ring <b>31</b> from an inner-lying free cylindrical surface <b>1</b> of outer ring <b>31</b>. Groove <b>70</b> may be defined radially by a cylindrical bottom surface <b>71</b> and axially by an annular surface <b>72</b>, which is inclined with respect to axis X, and by a straight annular surface <b>73</b> transverse to axis X.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Inclined annular surface <b>72</b> may be connected to cylindrical surface <b>1</b> and to cylindrical bottom surface <b>71</b> by means of a first fillet radius r<b>2</b> and a second fillet radius r<b>4</b>, respectively. Straight annular surface <b>73</b> may be connected to cylindrical bottom surface <b>71</b> and to cylindrical surface <b>1</b> by means of a third fillet radius r<b>6</b> and a fourth fillet radius r<b>8</b>, respectively. Annular surface <b>72</b> may be inclined with respect to axis X by an angle &#x3b1; ranging between a minimum value of 94&#xb0; and a maximum value of 100&#xb0; and with a nominal value of 95&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Inclined annular surface <b>72</b> helps ensure that snap ring <b>60</b>, once mounted inside groove <b>70</b>, locks shaped sealing screen <b>40</b> inside first seat <b>50</b> against a surface <b>31</b>&#x2032; of radially outer ring <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In various embodiments, a snap ring <b>60</b> that is a Seeger type ring that has a slit that allows snap ring <b>60</b> to deform by means of compression when inserted inside groove <b>70</b>. Groove <b>70</b> may therefore have a total diameter Ds that is smaller than a diameter Da of snap ring <b>60</b> in a rest condition, i.e. when snap ring <b>60</b> is not compressed. In various embodiments, diameter Da of snap ring <b>60</b> may be greater than a maximum of diameter Ds of groove <b>70</b> by an amount ranging between 3% and 5%.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In various embodiments, snap ring <b>60</b> may have an axial play of at least 15% of a total axial width of snap ring <b>60</b> in an assembly process. In other words, snap ring <b>60</b> may</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Once inserted inside groove <b>70</b>, snap ring <b>60</b> expands due to its elasticity. When snap ring <b>60</b> comes into contact with inclined annular surface <b>72</b>, snap ring <b>60</b> may be pushed towards straight annular surface <b>73</b>, thus eliminating axial play with shaped screen <b>40</b> that is present at a start of an assembly process of snap ring <b>60</b>. Snap ring <b>60</b> may begin to exert a thrusting action that pushes shaped sealing screen <b>40</b> against surface <b>31</b>&#x2032; of radially outer ring <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In other words, inclined annular surface <b>72</b> forces snap ring <b>60</b> against shaped screen <b>40</b> and pushes both against radially outer ring <b>31</b>. This effect is due to elasticity of snap ring <b>60</b>. As mentioned, outer diameter Da snap ring <b>60</b> is greater than diameter Ds of groove <b>70</b>. This means that when snap ring <b>60</b> is forced inside groove <b>70</b>, it tries to come into contact with cylindrical bottom surface <b>71</b> of groove <b>70</b>. However, this is not possible because, owing to a conical shape of groove <b>70</b>, the greater the diameter of snap ring <b>60</b>, which is trying to expand, the greater will be a pressure of snap ring <b>60</b> against shaped sealing screen <b>40</b> and radially outer ring <b>31</b>, resulting in a robust and stable positioning.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Furthermore, since snap ring <b>60</b> is elastic, centrifugal forces arising from rotation of inner ring <b>33</b> help to ensure that snap ring <b>60</b> is pushed inside groove <b>70</b>, increasing the effects described above. In various embodiments, a rotational speed of outer ring <b>31</b> may be of the order of 750 rpm.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">By stably locking shaped sealing screen <b>40</b>, a sealing device <b>35</b> prevents possible inclination of shaped sealing screen <b>40</b> inside first seat <b>50</b> and consequent damage to inner ring <b>33</b> and outer ring <b>31</b> of bearing unit <b>10</b> and grease leakages on an anchoring side of shaped sealing screen <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Optimized dimensions of a groove <b>70</b> are of fundamental importance for fully achieving optimum sealing performance and preventing damage to inner ring <b>33</b> and outer ring <b>31</b> of bearing unit <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In various embodiments, a thickness Sa of a snap ring <b>60</b> may be configured to maximize these effects together with angle &#x3b1; of inclined annular surface <b>72</b> of groove <b>70</b>. As mentioned previously, angle &#x3b1; may range from 94&#xb0; to 100&#xb0; with respect to axis X.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">If angle &#x3b1; is below 94&#xb0;, inclined annular surface <b>72</b> becomes practically transverse to axis X and therefore may not compensate for axial play between the axial width of snap ring <b>60</b> and the axial width of groove <b>70</b>. In fact, the greater a radial development of annular surface <b>72</b>, the less an axial thrust pushing snap ring <b>60</b> against shaped sealing screen <b>40</b> and radially outer ring <b>31</b> may be.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">If a is greater than 100&#xb0;, inclined annular surface <b>72</b> may act as a ramp due to the increased incline, causing an external force to push snap ring <b>60</b> out of groove <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">An angle &#x3b1; in a range of 94&#xb0;-100&#xb0; with respect to a central axis X of a bearing unit <b>10</b> ensures a stable axial seal due to the axial force created by an inclined annular surface <b>72</b>. In various embodiments, a range of angle &#x3b1; may be assessed together with other dimensions, e.g., a width of snap ring <b>60</b>, a width of groove <b>70</b>, to ensure that snap ring <b>60</b> enters radially as far as possible inside groove <b>70</b> to prevent any risk of ejection.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In various embodiments, groove <b>70</b> may have a radial depth Ps measured from cylindrical surface <b>1</b>. In various embodiments, radial depth Ps may be measured from an inlet <b>72</b>&#x2032; arranged along cylindrical surface <b>1</b>. Inlet <b>72</b>&#x2032; may be defined by an engaging point of radius r<b>2</b> and an engaging point of radius r<b>8</b>, both points engaging with cylindrical surface <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Radial depth Ps of groove <b>70</b> may not be less than 70% of a length Lf of an edge of snap ring <b>60</b>. In this way, about 50-60% of length Lf will be situated inside groove <b>70</b>, ensuring that snap ring <b>60</b> does not come out of groove <b>70</b> during operating conditions. The remaining 30-40% of length Lf may provide a sealing action against shaped sealing screen <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">An axial length Ls of cylindrical bottom surface <b>71</b> has been calculated using a statistical approach to maximize an effect of the pressure of snap ring <b>60</b> on shaped sealing screen <b>40</b>. Axial length Ls may be considered the minimum axial width of groove <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Consider, by way of non-limiting example, at least one embodiment in which a thickness Ss of shaped sealing screen <b>40</b> is between 0.75 mm and 0.8 mm with a nominal value of 0.8 mm, a thickness Sa of snap ring <b>60</b> is between 1.45 mm and 1.5 mm with a nominal value of 1.5 mm, and an axial distance L<b>1</b> from an inlet <b>72</b>&#x2032; to a surface <b>31</b>&#x2032; of outer ring <b>31</b> is between 2.4 mm and 2.45 mm with a nominal value of 2.4 mm.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In these embodiments, entry of snap ring <b>60</b> inside groove <b>70</b> is ensured.

Fillet radii r<b>2</b>, r<b>4</b>, r<b>6</b>, and r<b>8</b> are subtracted from width L<b>2</b> according to:</p><p id="p-0052" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Ls=L</i>2&#x2212;(<i>Ps&#x2212;r</i>2&#x2212;<i>r</i>4)&#xd7;tan (&#x3b1;&#x2212;90)&#x2212;<i>r</i>2&#x2212;<i>r</i>4<i>&#x2212;r</i>6&#x2212;<i>r</i>8.<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0053" num="0050">An axial projection of each fillet radii may be considered, but in various embodiments, these projections more or less coincide with corresponding values of the fillet radii.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0051">An interference between thickness Sa of snap ring <b>60</b> and minimum width Ls of groove <b>70</b> at cylindrical bottom surface <b>71</b> may be at least equal to 0.04 mm in unfavorable and extreme conditions. This ensures that snap ring <b>60</b> is unable to reach cylindrical bottom surface <b>71</b> of groove <b>70</b> but remains inside groove <b>70</b> in an intermediate position where snap ring <b>60</b> may push against shaped sealing screen <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0052">Advantageously, a length of snap ring <b>60</b> may be calculated so that, once assembled, a slit of snap ring <b>60</b> has a size equal to between 2% and 4% of a total length of groove <b>70</b> calculated along cylindrical bottom surface <b>71</b>. In various embodiments, a slit is equal to 3.2% of the total length of groove <b>70</b>. This ensures the stability of snap ring <b>60</b> inside groove <b>70</b> because in order to be removed from groove <b>70</b>, a diameter of the snap ring must be reduced. This would require the size of the slit to be zero and therefore snap ring <b>60</b> remains locked in groove <b>70</b> unless extracted with a special tool.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0053">Another particular feature of this disclosure is that angle &#x3b1; of inclined annular surface <b>72</b> is small enough to ensure that snap ring <b>60</b> remains inside groove <b>70</b> even if an external force is applied to it, but at the same time is big enough to ensure contact with shaped sealing screen <b>40</b> even in extreme conditions.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0054">In various embodiments in which snap ring <b>60</b> has a small thickness and a large diameter, a pressing effect of snap ring <b>60</b> on shaped sealing screen <b>40</b> is further increased due to a very marked undulation. Once snap ring <b>60</b> has been inserted inside groove <b>70</b>, the undulation makes snap ring <b>60</b> much more rigid by subjecting snap ring <b>60</b> to reaction forces acting against both inclined annular surface <b>72</b> and straight annular surface <b>73</b> and against shaped sealing screen <b>40</b>. Consequently, there will be a greater pressure against shaped sealing screen <b>40</b>, further ensuring that shaped sealing screen <b>40</b> remains in position.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0055">By including an inclined annular surface <b>72</b> in groove <b>70</b>, shaped sealing screen <b>40</b> may be kept in contact against surface <b>31</b>&#x2032; of radially outer ring <b>31</b>. Furthermore, snap ring <b>60</b> may be kept in contact with shaped sealing screen <b>40</b>, preventing shaped sealing screen <b>40</b> from rotating independently of radially outer ring <b>31</b> and subjecting outer ring <b>31</b> to wear. As a result, there is no gap between shaped sealing screen <b>40</b> and radially outer ring <b>31</b> and therefore no grease leakage. Additionally, there is no gap between snap ring <b>60</b> and shaped sealing screen <b>40</b> and consequently no grease leakage.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0056">In addition to the embodiments of the disclosure, as described above, it is to be understood that numerous further variants exist. It must also be understood that said embodiments are only examples and do not limit either the scope of the disclosure, nor its applications, nor its possible configurations.
