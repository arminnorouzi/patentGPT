modify the speed of a carrier gas as the carrier gas traverses the ion channel. In one case, the ion channel has segments of constant diameter in which the speed of the flowing gas is constant but different than the speed in other segments of the ion channel. This controlled variation in speed from segment to segment, together with the control of the axial electric field in the ion channel, together provide greater control on the separation of ions in the ion channel. Within the context of the present disclosure, the expression &#x201c;linear velocity&#x201d; is to be understood as meaning &#x201c;linear speed&#x201d; or simply &#x201c;speed&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a side, cross-sectional view of an embodiment of an ion mobility spectrometer (IMS) <b>20</b> in accordance with the present disclosure. The IMS <b>20</b> is connected to an ion source <b>24</b> that provides ions to be analyzed to the IMS <b>20</b>. Any suitable type of ion source can be used without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. For example, an electrospray ionization source can be used. Other types of ion sources include: a laser ablation ion source, a sputtering ion source, a discharge ion source, an inductively coupled plasma ion source, a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization ion source, etc.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The IMS <b>20</b> has an entrance guide <b>30</b>, which is configured to guide the ions provided by the ion source <b>24</b> to an analyzer <b>32</b>. The analyzer <b>32</b> is coupled to an exit guide <b>34</b>, which is configured to output the ions analyzed by the analyzer <b>32</b> outside the IMS <b>20</b>. The ions output from the exit guide <b>34</b> can be provided or coupled to, for example, a mass spectrometer, a Faraday cage, an electron multiplier, a photomultiplier, etc.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In the analyzer <b>32</b> of the present embodiment, the analyzer <b>32</b> has a body <b>38</b>, made of an electrically insulating material that defines an ion channel <b>40</b>, which extends through the body <b>38</b> from an input section <b>37</b> to an output section <b>39</b>. The ion channel <b>40</b> has a diameter that, rather than being constant along the entire length of the ion channel <b>40</b>, varies monotonically along the ion channel <b>40</b>. In this example, the analyzer <b>32</b> has four segments <b>42</b>A, <b>42</b>B, <b>42</b>C and <b>42</b>D that each has a constant diameter different than the diameter of the other segments. Separating the segments <b>42</b>A, <b>42</b>B, <b>42</b>C and <b>42</b>D from each other are transition sections <b>44</b>A, <b>44</b>B and <b>44</b>C, which each have a diameter that varies along the length the respective transition section.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Then analyzer can be of any suitable dimensions. For example, in some embodiments, the length of the analyzer can be about 120 mm. The length of the segments <b>42</b>A, <b>42</b>B, <b>42</b>C and <b>42</b>D can be 28 mm each, the length of transition sections <b>44</b>A, <b>44</b>B and <b>44</b>C can be 2 mm each, and the width can be 34 mm. The diameter of segments <b>42</b>A, <b>42</b>B, <b>42</b>C and <b>42</b>D can be 14 mm, 12 mm, 10 mm and 8 mm respectively. In other embodiments, the IMS <b>20</b> can be miniature IMS fabricated using 3D printing. In other embodiments, the analyzer can be manufactured using 3D printing technology. In such embodiments, the analyzer can be manufactured as a body out of a poorly conductive material, so that an application of a potential difference (voltage) between the ends of the analyzer generates a DC electric field along the ion channel defined by the body. Examples of such poorly conductive materials include carbon, metal-loaded plastics, nanoparticles composites, etc. In such embodiments, the electrodes set in the body <b>38</b> are electrically isolated from the body <b>38</b> by, for example, providing an insulating material between the electrodes and the body.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example of a plot of the diameter of the ion channel <b>40</b> as a function of the length of the ion channel <b>40</b>. In every lengthwise portion of the ion channel, the diameter is either constant or decreasing, which is akin to a monotonic decreasing function. As such, the ion channel <b>40</b> has a diameter that varies monotonically along the ion channel <b>40</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> also show a plot of the linear velocity of the flowing gas in each segment of the ion channel.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the IMS <b>20</b> has a carrier gas inlet <b>26</b> and a carrier gas outlet <b>28</b>. The carrier gas inlet in coupled to a carrier gas source <b>22</b>. The pressure at the carrier gas inlet <b>26</b> is greater than the pressure at the carrier gas outlet <b>28</b>. This difference in pressure causes the carrier gas to flow through the ion entrance guide <b>30</b>, the ion channel <b>40</b> and the ion exit guide <b>34</b>, in the direction indicated by the arrow <b>36</b>. The analyzer <b>32</b> further includes electrodes <b>46</b>, which are discussed in detail further below. In general, the carrier gas can be un-reactive (for example, nitrogen, argon, etc.). However, any suitable carrier gas can be used. In some embodiments, reagent gases can be used to cause a chemical transformation of the ions being analyzed. In cases where dissimilar ions have the same mass to charge ratio and are difficult to differentiate, adding a reagent gas can result in modified ions that have different mobilities and that are more easily distinguishable than the pre-reaction ions. The reagent gas can include any suitable carrier gas to which reagent compounds are added. In some cases, the carrier gas can be reagent in itself. In other cases, the carrier gas can be water vapor, methanol, acetonitrile, etc. As will be understood by the skilled worker, the carrier gas, reagent gas and reagent compounds can be selected in accordance with the particular chemical properties of the ions being analyzed. In cases where the carrier gas is not by itself a reagent gas, reagent compounds can be added to the carrier gas in any suitable way. For example, reagent compounds can be added to the carrier gas source <b>22</b>. Alternatively, the reagent compound can be provided by the ion source <b>24</b> in order to mix with the carrier gas prior to the gas traversing the ion channel <b>40</b>. In other cases, a reagent compound source <b>23</b> can be coupled to IMS <b>20</b> and configured to provide reagent compounds to the IMS <b>20</b> in order for the reagent compounds to mix with the carrier gas prior to the gas traversing the ion channel <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In order to have a laminar flow of the carrier gas in the ion channel <b>40</b>, and to minimize/avoid any turbulent flow of the carrier gas, the transition regions <b>44</b>A, <b>44</b>B and <b>44</b>C are slopped from one segment to the next. The shape of the slope can be linear, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, or can be curved. For example, the curve in the transition region can be similar to that of one side of a de Laval nozzle such that the thermal energy of the gas is more efficiently converted into kinetic energy along the flow axis. A sigmoidal curve or similar embodiment could also be an option.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an end view of the body <b>38</b>, taken from the input section side <b>37</b>. The transition sections <b>44</b>A, <b>44</b>B and <b>44</b>C are shown in the figure. The cross-section shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is perpendicular to the ion channel <b>40</b> and is, in the present example, dodecagonal. However, any suitable cross-section is to be considered within the scope of the present disclosure. For example, instead of a dodecagonal cross-section, the body <b>38</b> can have, perpendicular to the ion channel <b>40</b>, a circular cross-section, a square cross-section, a hexagonal cross-section, etc. The electrodes <b>46</b> are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, as the segments <b>42</b>A, <b>42</b>B, <b>42</b>C and <b>42</b>D have decreasing diameters, the speed at which the carrier gas traverses the segments <b>42</b>A, <b>42</b>B, <b>42</b>C and <b>42</b>D of the ion channel <b>40</b> will increase from one segment to the next. Any ion in the ion channel <b>40</b> will consequently move faster as it passes from one segment of the ion channel <b>40</b> to the next. Because of the moving carrier gas, any ion present in the ion channel <b>40</b> will be subjected to a drag force that increases as the speed (linear velocity) of the carrier gas increases.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">To counteract the drag force exerted by the carrier gas on the ions present in the ion channel <b>40</b>, the analyzer <b>32</b> has electrodes <b>46</b> set in the body <b>38</b>. These electrodes are used to generate an electric field inside the ion channel <b>40</b>. The electric field is to exert an electric force on the ions in the ion channel <b>40</b>, in a direction parallel to the ion channel <b>40</b>. The electric field is such that the electric force pushes the ions in the direction opposed to the direction in which the carrier gas flows in the ion channel <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The electrodes <b>46</b> are set along the ion channel <b>40</b> and around the ion channel <b>40</b>. For clarity purposes, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows electrodes <b>46</b> set only at the lower part of the ion channel.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a cross-section of the analyzer <b>32</b> with a group of electrodes <b>46</b> set in the body <b>38</b>, in segment <b>42</b>A. In this embodiment, the twelve electrodes <b>46</b> of the group are radially aligned with to the ion channel <b>40</b> and are all in a same plane, which is perpendicular to the ion channel <b>40</b>. Further, the electrodes <b>46</b> are angularly equi-spaced around the diameter of the ion channel <b>40</b>. As will be understood by the skilled worker, analyzers that have a different number of electrodes or in which the electrodes are arranged differently than in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> are to be considered within the scope of the present disclosure. As shown in this figure, the protruding electrodes define a circle <b>47</b> that has a diameter smaller than the diameter of the segment <b>42</b>A.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows the same cross-section of the analyzer <b>32</b> as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, but with indications of where, on the group of electrodes, a DC electrical signal can be provided and where a time-varying electrical signal (e.g. AC(&#x2212;) and AC(+)) can be provided. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a top perspective view of the body <b>38</b>, with apertures <b>48</b>.

When the time-varying electrical signal is an ideal two-dimensional multipole radio frequency (RF) electrical signal, the signal (V) can be expressed, in polar coordinates, as:</p><p id="p-0084" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <mi>V</mi>   <mo>&#x2061;</mo>   <mo>(</mo>   <mrow>    <mi>r</mi>    <mo>,</mo>    <mi>&#x3d5;</mi>    <mo>,</mo>    <mi>t</mi>   </mrow>   <mo>)</mo>  </mrow>  <mo>=</mo>  <mrow>   <msub>    <mi>V</mi>    <mn>0</mn>   </msub>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mrow>    <mi>cos</mi>    <mo>&#x2061;</mo>    <mo>(</mo>    <mrow>     <mi>n</mi>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mi>&#x3d5;</mi>    </mrow>    <mo>)</mo>   </mrow>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <msup>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mfrac>      <mi>r</mi>      <msub>       <mi>R</mi>       <mn>0</mn>      </msub>     </mfrac>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>    <mi>n</mi>   </msup>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mrow>    <mi>sin</mi>    <mo>&#x2061;</mo>    <mo>(</mo>    <mrow>     <mi>&#x3c9;</mi>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mi>t</mi>    </mrow>    <mo>)</mo>   </mrow>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0085" num="0000">Where V<sub>0 </sub>is the RF amplitude, R<sub>0 </sub>is the inscribed radius of the RF electrodes, and w denotes the angular frequency. V<sub>0 </sub>can have a value of a few hundreds of volts; in some embodiments, V<sub>0 </sub>will not exceed 300 volts. R<sub>0 </sub>can be of the order of 1 MHz or, as will be understood by the skilled worker, depending of the configuration of the analyzer, can have any other suitable value. &#x201c;r&#x201d; is the radial coordinate and &#x201c;&#x3d5;&#x201d; is the angular coordinate. As will be understood by the skilled worker, in practice, the RF signal is created by 2n electrodes (i.e., for a quadrupolar field n=2, for a hexapolar field n=3, and so on). The radial dependence of the above described electric potential is plotted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. With increasing n, the confining RF field remains flatter and closer to zero further from the ion channel center axis. In other words, by increasing n, ions can occupy a larger near-zero field region near the ion channel center axis. This increases the relative number of ions which can be loaded into the analyzer and decreases space-charging effects which might limit mobility resolution.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0083">In segments of the analyzer <b>32</b>, there can be groups of twelve electrodes disposed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. As will be understood by the skilled worker, this need not be the case. For example, if the diameter of a particular segment is sufficiently small to prevent reliably setting twelve electrodes therein, then fewer than twelve electrodes can be set. For example, six electrodes can be set instead of twelve. In other embodiments there can be more than twelve electrodes per group of electrodes.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0084">In the present embodiment, the DC electrical signal provided to the electrodes <b>46</b> can be different for each of the segments <b>42</b>A, <b>42</b>B, <b>42</b>C and <b>42</b>D, as shown by plot <b>50</b> in the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. This divides the analyzer <b>32</b> into four sectors which can be controlled individually. Dividing the mobility analyzer into independent sectors facilitates several new modes of operation. In the mode shown at plot <b>50</b>, the analyzer <b>32</b> is employed as a series of four parallel flow ion mobility devices. This enables multiple simultaneous instances of ion separation and isolation for multiplexing measurements or for pre-concentrating analytes prior to detection (at a mass spectrometer for example). Of note, the variation of the speed along the ion channel <b>40</b> provides an additional degree of tuning of the analyzer <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0085">In other modes of operation, multiple sectors can be combined and utilized as a single parallel flow device. One may then employ a linear DC ramp across several sectors while taking advantage of variation of the speed of the carrier gas in the segments <b>42</b>A, <b>42</b>B, <b>42</b>C and <b>42</b>D (see plot <b>56</b>), or one can tune the voltages for the individual sectors to shape the electric field gradient across the device (e.g., approximate square root function in plot <b>54</b>, or exponential function in plot <b>58</b>). Further, it is possible to generate multiple shaped electric fields across the device as is shown in plot <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows an end view of the entrance guide <b>30</b>, which, in this embodiment, is funnel shaped. The entrance guide comprises a plurality of ring segments <b>60</b> concentrically aligned with each other, from the ring segment having the largest aperture to the ring segment having the smallest aperture. In the present embodiment, the exit guide <b>34</b> is, as the entrance guide <b>30</b>, funnel shaped and looks similar to the entrance guide <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. The ion funnels of the entrance guide <b>30</b> and the exit guide <b>34</b> have a decreasing orifice size and decreasing applied voltage from the point where the ions enter to where they exit. There is also a dipolar RF applied between adjacent annular electrodes (i.e. longitudinal along the device axis). This acts as an ion lens, focusing ions down to a smaller cross-section at the funnel exit, resulting in higher ion transmission to the detector. The force applied by the funnel electric field is in the same direction as the gas/ion flow. Also, while the ions are radially confined in the funnel, an operator can select the mass range for confinement by tuning the voltages; when higher mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio species are selected, low m/z ion trajectories become unstable and these species are lost/neutralized.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0087">Within the analyzer, there is a radial RF field (not a longitudinal RF field). This confines all m/z ions efficiently. By employing higher multipolar fields (for example, hexapole, octupole, etc.), this generates a relatively large low-field volume in the center of the analyzer <b>34</b> (the analyzer can also be referred to a mobility cell). This allows loading of the mobility cell with significantly more ions than prior art mobility cells (prior art analyzers), and it mitigates the effects of field-induced heating, which can lead to ion fragmentation that has a confounding effect in molecular determination. The DC voltage applied in the mobility cell (analyzer <b>34</b>) opposes the direction of ion/gas flow. This, combined with the radial confinement, traps the ions in the region where the force provided by the opposing DC field perfectly counteracts the force applied by the gas flow.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0088">The funnel-like electrode arrangement within the mobility cell (analyzer <b>34</b>) is used to ensure that the electric field gradient matches the gas flow gradient throughout the mobility cell.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows a segment <b>60</b> of the entrance guide <b>30</b> divided in eight sections configured to receive either a DC electrical signal or an AC electrical signal. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows a segment <b>62</b> of the exit guide <b>30</b> divided in eight sections configured to receive either a DC electrical signal or an AC electrical signal.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows another embodiment of an IMS <b>20</b> in accordance with the present disclosure.

At step <b>100</b>, a flowing carrier gas is provided to an ion channel. The ion channel has an input section and an output section and the flowing carrier gas is input at the input section. The flowing carrier gas containing the ions. The ion channel has a plurality of segments parallel to the ion channel and a speed of the flowing carrier gas is constant within each segment but, the speed of the flowing carrier gas in a particular segment is different than the speed of the flowing carrier gas in any other segment of the ion channel. The speed of the flowing carrier gas changes monotonically along the ion channel. The flowing carrier gas generates a drag force on the ions and the drag force depends on the speed of the flowing carrier gas. Examples of such an ion channel are shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and <b>16</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0104">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, at step <b>102</b>, an electric field is generated in the ion channel to produce an electric force acting on the ions. The field is such that the electric force is in a direction opposite the direction of the drag force. The different speed of the flowing carrier gas in each segment of the ion channel and the electric force result is a separation of the ions along the ion channel.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0105">At step <b>104</b>, a variation of at least one of an amplitude of the electric field and the speed of the carrier gas in each linear segment of the ion channel is effected in order to eject ions from the output section of the ion channel.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0106">Additionally, a step of generating a time-varying electric field in the ion channel to confine the ions to a central region of the ion channel can be performed. Further, ions can be accumulated ions in the ion channel prior to varying at least one of an amplitude of the electric field and the speed of the carrier gas in each segment of the ion channel.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0107">Further, the ejected ions can be provided to an ion characterization device. For example, a mass spectrometer.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0108">Furthermore, in some embodiments of the method, the form of the ion channel can be such that the speed of the flowing carrier gas is greater in a segment of the plurality of segments closest to the output section than the speed of the flowing carrier gas in a segment of the plurality of segments closest to the input section.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0109">As detailed above, the present disclosure provides an ion mass spectrometer that has an ion channel shaped to modify the speed of a carrier gas as the carrier gas traverses the ion channel. In one case, the ion channel has segments of constant diameter in which the speed of the flowing gas is constant but different than the speed in other segments of the ion channel. The controlled variation in speed from segment to segment, together with the control of the axial electric field in the ion channel, provide greater control on the separation of ions in the ion channel.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0110">In another aspect according to the present disclosure, direct coupling of a sample preparation, such as solid phase microextraction (SPME), to ion spectrometric techniques such as ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) would benefit from focusing techniques in an attempt to achieve optimum sensitivity as the desorption time from SPME device is much longer compared to determination time by conventional IMS. Accordingly, the present disclosure provides example devices and techniques for facilitating focusing of ions in an ion mobility drift tube. This may be accomplished by an accumulation of the ions at a characteristic place or region along the tube for a given ion, where the mobility of the ion driven by electric field is balanced by a drift gas linear flow rate. In an embodiment, an ion mobility spectrometer may have an analyzer, where the analyzer comprises a body defining an ion channel therethrough. The analyzer body with the ion channel may be referred to as an ion mobility drift tube.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0111">In addition to focusing ions within a channel, a device may have a high-resolution feature such that both a linear fluid flow gradient and an opposing DC electric field may be generated in the analyzer. In an embodiment, the linear fluid flow gradient and the opposing DC electric field may be generated uniformly in the separation device. This may be accomplished by using resistive material, for instance in the form of a resistive conductor, along an ion channel having a changing internal diameter. For example, the channel may have some form of a tapered shape, which generally means that the analyzer body defines the ion channel to have a diameter that varies monotonically along the ion channel. Passing current through the resistive material will generate an electric field opposing the flow of ions contained in a drift gas and therefore facilitate focusing ions at appropriate positions in the channel according to their mobility. In an embodiment, the resistance of the resistive material should be high so that not much heat is generated during operation. In an embodiment, cooling of the drift gas, cooling of the channel, or cooling of the body or analyzer, can be incorporated to prevent the temperature in the channel from rising too much or at all. In an embodiment, the ion mobility analyzer may be configured to control a temperature in the drift tube to be substantially below the ambient temperature. This may be done by cooling the tube in any suitable way, for example by using any suitable cooling device or system, or other cooling technique. In addition, lowering of the drift gas temperature may increase resolution as lower thermal energy of ions would result in lower dispersion of the focused ion bands in the ion channel and therefore should, in at least some embodiments, result in sharper, narrower separated zones facilitating better resolution.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0112">In an embodiment, the resistive material may have a uniform resistance along the ion channel resulting in a substantially uniform electric field as the tapered ion channel and generated linear flow velocity gradient would facilitate the effect of focusing of ions in the channel. In another embodiment, a diameter of the ion channel may be constant, meaning the diameter does not change along the length of the channel. The resistive material have a gradient of resistivity along the channel to produce an electric field gradient facilitating the focusing effect. In addition, in an embodiment, an application of gradients in the electric field and the fluid flow, for example by using a tapered ion channel, at the same time may be used to improve performance of the separation device as mentioned above.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0113">In an embodiment, the analyzer may be miniaturized, which may result in a low-cost device that is able to perform convenient on-site direct multicomponent determination tasks when combined with SPME technology.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0114">In some previously described embodiments described above in relation to other aspects of the present disclosure, an analyzer has a plurality of discrete electrodes arranged at spaced apart locations along and perpendicular to a length of the ion channel. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> show an embodiment(s) in which an analyzer <b>32</b> has a group of electrodes <b>46</b> set in the body <b>38</b>, in segment <b>42</b>A. In this embodiment, the twelve electrodes <b>46</b> of the group are radially aligned with to the ion channel <b>40</b> and are all in a same plane, which is perpendicular to the ion channel <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0115">In these previously described embodiments, improving the uniformity of the electric field and therefore improving the resolution obtained by the analyzer could require increasing the number of electrodes along the channel, for example to reduce the spacing between electrodes along the length of the ion channel, which may be difficult to accomplish practically.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0116">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, another way of improving the uniformity of the electric field and therefore improving the resolution obtained by the analyzer, which may be more convenient, is to produce a uniform continuum of electric field. A uniform continuum of electric field may generated by a resistive conductor, which may comprise one or more conductor elements, having a uniform or substantially uniform resistance along the longitudinal axis of the ion channel. The resistive conductor may extend along the ion channel and may be configured to generate an electric field along the ion channel when a DC signal is applied across the resistive conductor. The resistive conductor may be separate from the body. The DC signal may be adjustable. This may provide for a similar effect as having an infinite number of electrodes spaced side by side. Such an arrangement may provide for improved resolution since both the opposing field (e.g. electric field) and the driving field (e.g. velocity gradient) may be highly uniform.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0117">The resistive conductor may have any suitable shape or form. In an embodiment, the resistive conductor comprises a plurality of elongate resistive conductor elements disposed at the body in the ion channel and extending along the ion channel. Being disposed at the body in the ion channel may mean in contact with the body, or proximate to the body. In an embodiment, it may mean fully or partially embedded in the body. The elongate resistive conductor elements may be of any suitable shape or form. For example, they may be in the form of wires or strips.

Also, an approach of using a body made of an electrically conductive material may be used in ion mobility instruments that do not use focusing of ions in the drift tube but rather produce a uniform electric filed required to separate ions based on their arrival time at the detector.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0144">In another aspect according to the present disclosure, an ion mobility analyzer is provided comprising a transparent material for the channel body. Photo-excitation, for example, a tunable laser source may be employed to study ions trapped within the device. Trapped ion spectroscopy is usually done in a low-pressure open ion trap but not within the mobility device.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0145">In an embodiment, an ion mobility analyzer is provided wherein RF voltage may be applied to adjacent sets of electrodes along the flow axis to induce fragmentation of ions trapped within the device. Fragments may then be analyzed in subsequent regions of the mobility analyzer.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0146">In the preceding description, for purposes of explanation, numerous details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the disclosure.
