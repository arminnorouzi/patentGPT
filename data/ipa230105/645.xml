If the joints cannot be healed using conservative methods, it may become necessary to replace the joint. In the human body, it is often necessary to replace damaged shoulder joints, hip joints or knee joints with replacement joint implants. Various methods for the implantation of artificial joints are available dependent upon the joint affected. In some cases, a so-called inverse shoulder prosthesis is used in the shoulder joint region. Inverse shoulder prostheses are characterised in that the artificial joint socket replaces the damaged humeral head and the artificial joint head replaces the damaged glenoid.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One peculiarity of modern inverse shoulder prostheses is the use of bone transplants in the glenoid region. The use of a bone transplant allows a secure fixing of an implant despite bone loss.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, the bone transplant used is obtained from the humeral head of the operated shoulder. For this purpose, a guide wire is positioned in the humeral head by means of a positioning instrument. In a next step, the surface of the bone transplant is milled flat. In this context, residues of cartilage and the hard bony parts of the humeral head are removed. Using a core drill, the bone to be extracted is separated at its lateral edges from the humeral head. A hole is then drilled into the bone fragment to be extracted, so that the guide wire is removed at the same time. Separation of the bone fragment to be extracted at its lateral edges and drilling can be implemented in one operating stage by using a core drill with integrated central drill. In the last step of the extraction, a cutting guide instrument is used. This cutting guide instrument is embodied in such a manner that it is placed with an exact fit on the milled surfaces. A bone saw is guided in a slot within the cutting guide instrument in such a manner that the bone transplant to be extracted is resected with a specified angle. Other variants of the cutting guide tools contain a plateau for guiding the bone saw. In this context, the bone saw is guided by unilateral support against the plateau.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">US 2019/020 9186 A1 describes such a cutting guide instrument for extracting a bone transplant. The cutting guide instrument contains a base plate which is placed onto the bone fragment to be extracted. Furthermore, the cutting guide instrument contains a saw guide which is designed to receive and to guide a saw blade of a bone saw. This saw guide is connected to the base plate via a depth flange with a spacing distance.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">With this cutting guide instrument for the extraction of a bone transplant, it is disadvantageous that the cutting guide instrument is used in the patient's body. As a result of the type of guiding of the saw blade, especially the unilateral guide, a dimensional accuracy of the extracted bone transplant is low.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention is therefore based on the object of providing a device for extracting a bone transplant of a human or animal bone and an associated method for configuring the device, without the need to consider the disadvantages mentioned.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The object is achieved in an advantageous manner by a device according to the invention for preparing a bone transplant outside the human or animal body according to claim <b>1</b> and by a method for configuring the device outside the human or animal body according to claim <b>11</b>. Advantageous further developments form the subject matter of the dependent claims relating back to these claims.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The device according to the invention for preparing a bone transplant outside the human or animal body comprises a base element and at least one holding element. The at least one holding element is inserted into the base element of the device for preparing a bone transplant. A bone transplant which has previously been removed from the body can be held in a particularly advantageous manner for the preparation by the holding element disposed in the base element. Secure holding of the bone transplant in a precisely specified position is achieved by the holding element. Only this secure holding of the bone transplant with the holding device can ensure an extremely accurate processing of the bone transplant.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Advantageously, the device for preparing a bone transplant preferably comprises a first holding element and a second holding element, wherein the first holding element is a guide insert and the second holding element is a holding insert. In a particularly advantageous manner, the bone transplant to be prepared is guided securely in its position by the guide insert and fixed in this position by the holding insert.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an advantageous manner, the base element preferably comprises at least one slot for guiding a material-removing tool. By means of the at least one slot, the material-removing tool is guided in such a manner that the position and the angle specified by the slot are observed accurately.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Advantageously, the guide insert comprises a contact surface, which preferably comprises an angle relative to the slot for guiding the material-removing tool. The holding insert preferably comprises an angle corresponding to the angle of the guide insert relative to the slot for guiding the material-removing tool. The contact surface of the guide insert arranged at an angle allows the precise processing of the extracted bone fragment while observing the specified angle. With an appropriate angle of the holding insert, it is possible to fix the bone fragment in such a manner that, during the entire cutting process, no change of angle can occur.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Advantageously, the guide insert preferably comprises a further contact surface with a further, different angle relative to the slot for guiding the material-removing tool. Furthermore, the holding insert preferably comprises a further angle corresponding to the angle of the guide insert relative to the slot for guiding the material-removing tool. In this manner, it is possible with only one device for the preparation of a bone transplant, to prepare bone fragments with different cutting angles.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an advantageous manner, the contact surface and the further contact surface(s) of the guide insert are arranged opposite one another. Such an arrangement allows the user to adapt the cutting parameters simply by turning the guide insert to the specifications for the prosthesis.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Advantageously, the holding insert preferably comprises at least two guides, wherein the at least two guides are embodied geometrically differently. Correspondingly, the base element preferably contains at least two guide receivers for receiving the guides of the holding insert. The different embodiment of the two guides prevents the holding insert from being inserted incorrectly. This considerably improves the safety of the process.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is also advantageous that the holding insert preferably contains at least one finger recess. The finger recess allows the application of an increased thrust to the holding insert. Accordingly, a reliable holding force is exerted on the bone transplant. Furthermore, the risk of the preparer's finger slipping is significantly reduced by the finger recess.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Advantageously, the guide insert preferably contains at least one semi-circular or semi-cylindrical recess for receiving the bone transplant, of which the axis is arranged at right angles to the contact surface of the guide insert. This guarantees a secure positioning of the extracted bone fragment in the required position in the device for preparing a bone transplant.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is further advantageous if the guide insert preferably contains a further semi-circular or semi-cylindrical recess for receiving the bone transplant, of which the axis is arranged at right angles to the further contact surface of the guide insert. This arrangement allows bone transplants with a different geometry to be prepared by inserting the guide insert correspondingly into the base element.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the method for configuring the device for the preparation of a bone transplant outside the human or animal body, the at least one holding element is inserted into the base element of the device for preparing a bone transplant.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">It is further advantageous if, in the method for configuring a device for the preparation of a bone transplant, a guide insert of the first holding element is preferably inserted into the base element, and that a holding insert of the second holding element is inserted into the base element. This allows the device for preparing a bone transplant to be assembled in a configuration adapted to the implant.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Accordingly, during the preparation of a bone transplant outside the human or animal body with the device according to the invention, a bone fragment to be prepared can be placed into the at least one holding element inserted in the base element, the bone fragment to be prepared can be fixed with the at least one inserted holding element and the bone fragment to be prepared can be processed. This allows the bone transplant to be prepared for the patient in a particularly safe and accurate manner.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Exemplary embodiments of the device according to the invention for preparing a bone transplant outside the human or animal body and the associated method are explained in greater detail based on the following description.

Based on this exploded diagram, we explain in the following the method for configuring the device according to the invention for preparing a bone transplant <b>200</b>. Prior to the preparation of a bone fragment, the components of the device for preparing the bone transplant <b>200</b> are assembled as follows:</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In a first step, the guide insert <b>206</b> is inserted into the base element <b>201</b>. This is implemented by inserting the guide insert <b>206</b> with its two guide recesses <b>213</b> into the recesses <b>208</b> of the base element <b>201</b> provided for this purpose. In this context, the contact surface <b>216</b>, <b>217</b> with the required angle is orientated in such a manner that it faces towards the slots <b>204</b>, <b>205</b> for guiding the cutting tool in the base element.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In a second step, the holding insert <b>207</b> is inserted into the base element <b>201</b>. In this context, the holding insert <b>207</b> is positioned in such a manner that the end surface <b>224</b>, <b>225</b> is orientated with the required angle in the direction of the guide insert <b>206</b>. The geometry of the guides <b>222</b>, <b>223</b> of the holding insert <b>207</b> in conjunction with the geometry of the guide recesses <b>210</b>, <b>211</b> ensure that the holding insert <b>207</b> cannot be inserted the wrong way round. If a holding insert <b>207</b> inserted incorrectly were to be pressed against the bone fragment, the bone fragment could be damaged by an inaccurate cutting guide or the impact of a punctual force and could possibly be rendered unusable.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows the second exemplary embodiment of the device according to the invention for preparing a bone transplant <b>200</b> with a positioned bone transplant <b>227</b>. The bone transplant <b>227</b> to be prepared is supported flat on the contact surface <b>217</b> of the guide insert <b>206</b>. By means of the holding insert <b>207</b>, the bone transplant <b>227</b> is pressed against the contact surface <b>217</b>. For this purpose, the user pushes the holding insert <b>207</b> with the help of the finger recess <b>226</b> in the direction towards the guide insert <b>206</b>. During the processing of the bone transplant <b>227</b>, the user holds the bone transplant <b>227</b> firmly on the holding insert <b>207</b>. The preparation, i.e. the cutting to size of the bone transplant <b>227</b> takes place via one of the slots <b>204</b>, <b>205</b> in the base element <b>201</b>. The slot <b>204</b>, <b>205</b> to be used is selected corresponding to the specifications for the bone transplant <b>227</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">By way of further explanation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows the second exemplary embodiment of the device for preparing a bone transplant <b>200</b> with positioned bone transplant <b>227</b> in sectional view.

It is evident here how the support surface <b>215</b> of the semi-circular recess is orientated at right angles to the associated contact surface <b>217</b>. Accordingly, the bone transplant <b>227</b>, which is cylindrical before the preparation, is positioned accurately. In this example, the device for preparing a bone transplant <b>200</b> is configured in such a manner that the smaller of the two possible angles for processing is used. The guide insert <b>206</b> is inserted in such a manner that the contact surface <b>217</b> points with the smaller angle in the direction towards the slot <b>204</b>, <b>205</b> of the base element <b>201</b>. Correspondingly, the holding insert <b>207</b> is inserted in such a manner that its front surface <b>225</b> is supported with the smaller of the two possible angles on the bone transplant <b>227</b>. By means of the finger recess <b>226</b>, the holding insert <b>207</b> is pushed in the direction towards the bone transplant <b>227</b> and held firmly by it.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> visualises the relationship between the shape of the guide insert <b>206</b> and an extracted bone transplant on one side of the guide insert <b>206</b> only. These relationships are transferable to all the other usable sides of the guide insert. In this context, the bone transplant <b>227</b> is a cylindrical disc of bone. The diameter of this bone disc is determined by a core drill which is used for extracting bone, e.g. from the humeral head, and it is adapted to the joint implant to be inserted. The circular surfaces of the bone transplant <b>227</b> are aligned with its cylindrical wall through the extraction process. The semi-circular recess <b>215</b> of the guide insert <b>206</b> has a diameter corresponding to the bone transplant <b>227</b>.
