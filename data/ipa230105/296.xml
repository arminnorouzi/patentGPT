Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to air filters, and, more particularly, to high-efficiency filters, and filter materials that are used in the manufacture of air filters, including vacuum filter bags.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">b. Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Air filters and filter media are commonly classified using the MERV (Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value) system. In this system, a filter is assigned a number according between 1 and 20 to its overall efficiency in removing particles from air&#x2014;a higher number representing a more efficient filter. For example, for residential applications in the US, the ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62.2-200716 requires a filter with a designated minimum efficiency of MERV 6 or better. A filter with a MERV rating of 6 is capable of removing 35-50% of airborne particles that are 3-10 &#x3bc;m (micrometers) across. Most common home furnace filters are in the range of MERV 6-8. This is in contrast, for example, with a filter with a MERV rating of 13, which is capable of removing up to 75% of particles of 0.3 &#x3bc;m, and 90% of particles larger than 1 &#x3bc;m. A class of filter that is receiving increased interest, as concern with airborne contaminants grows, is referred to as HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air). A HEPA rating corresponds to a MERV 17, and indicates that the filter is capable of removing 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Because of the increased interest in more efficient filters, some manufacturers or sellers describe their filters as HEPA-type, HEPA-like, HEPA-style, etc. Such terms suggest that the products in question have not been tested by an independent laboratory, or were not found to meet the MERV 17 criteria. On the other hand, the difference in efficiency between a MERV 13 rating and a MERV 17 rating is, in practice, insignificant except in highly critical environments, such as laboratories, hospitals, clean rooms and the like. In a residence, the difference would be generally undetectable, because homes are not sealed from the surrounding environment, and air exchange with the exterior is frequent or continuous.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to an embodiment, a filter assembly is provided that includes a first element with a selected value of efficiency in removing airborne particulates, and a second element that is impregnated with silver or a silver compound.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to an embodiment, the first element includes a plurality of layers, each having a respective value of efficiency in removing airborne particulates.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an embodiment, the second element also functions as one of the layers of the first element.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an embodiment, the filter assembly is configured such that air passes first through the first element, then through the second element.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to another embodiment, the first element has a MERV rating of 13 or greater.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an embodiment, the functions of the first and second elements are combined into a single element that is configured to remove airborne particulates and that is impregnated with silver.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to an embodiment, the filter assembly is a vacuum filter bag.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to an embodiment, a vacuum cleaner is provided that is configured to receive the vacuum filter bag.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to a further embodiment, the vacuum includes an output filter configured to filter air as it exits the vacuum cleaner.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to an embodiment, the output filter has a MERV rating that is higher than that of the filter assembly.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to an embodiment, the second filter includes a layer of silver-impregnated material.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagrammatic side elevation view of a vacuum cleaner, according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a diagrammatical side view of a vacuum filter bag such as can be used in the vacuum cleaner of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a detailed diagrammatic view of a portion, indicated at <b>2</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, of the vacuum filter bag of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of an air filter assembly <b>300</b>, according to an embodiment, with one side removed to show internal elements.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagrammatic representation of a canister vacuum, according to an embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">It will be understood that the scope of the appended claims should not be limited by particular embodiments set forth herein, but should be construed in a manner consistent with the specification as a whole.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the drawings, a reference number followed by a letter, e.g., &#x201c;<b>203</b><i>a</i>, <b>203</b><i>b</i>,&#x201d; is used where it may be useful in the corresponding description to refer to or differentiate between specific ones of a number of otherwise similar or identical elements.

The vacuum cleaner <b>100</b> includes a main body <b>102</b>, a base assembly <b>104</b>, a handle <b>106</b>, and a power cord <b>108</b>. Elements that are inside the vacuum cleaner <b>100</b> are shown in hidden lines.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The main body <b>102</b> includes a support element <b>110</b>, a bag housing <b>112</b>, and a motor assembly <b>114</b>. The bag housing <b>112</b> defines a hollow interior that is separated by a dividing wall <b>116</b> into a bag chamber <b>118</b> and an output plenum <b>120</b>. The motor assembly includes a motor and an air blower (not shown in detail), with an air intake <b>122</b> in fluid communication with the bag chamber <b>118</b> and an exhaust outlet <b>124</b> in fluid communication with the output plenum <b>120</b>. A plurality of louvres collectively form a clean air outlet <b>126</b> between the output plenum <b>120</b> and the exterior of the bag housing <b>112</b>. A filter element <b>128</b> is positioned within the output plenum <b>120</b> over the clean air outlet <b>126</b> US 2019/0239707 A1 such that air passes through the filter element prior to exiting the output plenum. A waste intake channel <b>130</b> is positioned within the support element <b>110</b> with an upper end extending into the bag chamber <b>118</b>. A vacuum filter bag <b>132</b> is positioned within the bag chamber <b>118</b> and is attached to the upper end of the waste intake channel <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The base assembly <b>104</b> includes a pair of rear wheels <b>134</b> and a beater brush <b>136</b>. The beater brush <b>136</b> is rotatably positioned within a collection chamber <b>138</b> and extends from a waste intake port <b>140</b> so as to make contact with the floor beneath the base assembly <b>104</b>. An air passage <b>142</b> is in fluid communication with the collection chamber <b>138</b> and is coupled to the waste intake channel <b>130</b> via a flexible coupling (not shown in detail) that permits rotation of the main body <b>102</b> relative to the base assembly <b>104</b>. The main body <b>102</b> is configured to rotate relative to the base assembly <b>104</b> around a rotation axis of the motor, which is coupled via a drive belt to the beater brush <b>136</b>, which rotates during operation.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">During operation, the blower draws air into the motor assembly <b>114</b> from the bag chamber <b>118</b> via the air intake <b>122</b> and blows the air from the exhaust outlet <b>124</b> into the output plenum <b>120</b>. This produces a partial vacuum within the bag chamber <b>118</b>, drawing air into the vacuum filter bag <b>132</b> via the waste intake channel <b>130</b>, the air passage <b>142</b>, and the collection chamber <b>138</b>, pulling air, together with waste matter lifted by the beater brush <b>136</b>, from the exterior via the waste intake port <b>140</b>. The waste is carried with the air into the vacuum filter bag <b>132</b>, which filters the waste from the air and passes the air through permeable walls to the bag chamber <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As noted above, vacuum filter bags, like other air filters, are rated according to their efficiency in removing particulates from air as it passes. As filter efficiency increases, the energy required to transmit air increases. To mitigate the increased resistance, most high-efficiency air filters are provided with deep pleats. This increases the thickness of the filter, but also increases the available surface area, reducing air resistance. Additionally, in many systems, a more powerful blower motor is provided to move air through the filter. However, space within a vacuum cleaner is limited, and any increase in bag thickness reduces the capacity of the bag, and a more powerful motor would be larger, heavier, and more expensive, making the vacuum less attractive to consumers. Thus, most vacuum cleaners on the market are provided with vacuum filter bags that are not HEPA rated, and that have a relatively low MERV rating. As a result, many pathogens that are lifted from a floor or carpet by a vacuum cleaner pass through the vacuum filter bag and are distributed into the air, to settle onto other surfaces in the room, or to be ingested by room occupants.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a diagrammatical side view of a vacuum filter bag <b>132</b> such as can be used in the vacuum cleaner <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, according to an embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a detailed diagrammatic view of a portion of the vacuum filter bag <b>132</b> indicated at <b>2</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, according to an embodiment. The vacuum filter bag <b>132</b> includes an inner bag wall <b>202</b>, an outer bag wall <b>204</b>, and a vacuum engagement element <b>206</b>. The inner bag wall <b>202</b> can be made of any appropriate material with a MERV rating that is adequate for the intended use. For example, the inner bag wall <b>202</b> can be a melt-blown non-woven filter material, a spun fiberglass material, a woven fabric material, etc. Preferably, the MERV rating is 9 or higher, and according to an embodiment, the MERV rating is at least 13, which is sufficient to remove many pathogens and contaminants from the air. According to another embodiment, the inner bag wall <b>202</b> is a true HEPA filter, (MERV 17), which is sufficient to remove substantially all bacteria, as well as mold and fungus spores and many viruses.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The vacuum engagement element <b>206</b> is configured to engage a mating structure of a selected make and model of vacuum cleaner. Such engagement elements can include various combinations of seals, rigid panels, and openings, etc. Most vacuum cleaner machines require engagement elements and bag designs that are unique to the particular make and model. The claims are not limited to any particular filter bag design except where such limitation is explicit in the claim.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to an embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the inner bag wall <b>202</b> includes a plurality of individual layers <b>203</b>, each having a respective degree of efficiency, and each contributing to a collective efficiency. For example, according to an embodiment, an innermost layer <b>203</b><i>a </i>is of a porous tissue material configured to capture a first level of pet hair, dust, fluff, etc. A second layer <b>203</b><i>b</i>, and even a third layer <b>203</b><i>c </i>can be of the same porous tissue material, while a finer and heavier outermost layer <b>203</b><i>d </i>is of either a sufficiently porous paper or a pressed fiber material that serves to filter out the remaining finer particles. Alternatively, each of the layers <b>203</b> of the inner bag wall <b>202</b> is of a progressively finer filter material, each configured to capture more and smaller particles. In either case, the overall or collective efficiency of the inner bag wall <b>202</b> is typically greater than the efficiency of any one of the individual layers, such that while the outermost&#x2014;and finest&#x2014;layer <b>203</b><i>d </i>may have a MERV rating of no more than 9, the collective efficiency may be MERV 13 or higher.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The outer bag wall <b>204</b> can also be made, for example, of a melt-blown non-woven filter material, porous paper, or any other appropriate material. In the embodiment shown, the outer bag wall <b>204</b> has a MERV rating that is at least slightly lower than that of the inner bag wall <b>202</b>, so as to permit air to pass without significantly increasing the total air flow resistance of the vacuum filter bag <b>132</b>. The material of the outer bag wall <b>204</b> is impregnated with silver, or a compound that includes silver, which acts as an antimicrobial agent, preventing live pathogens from passing through the inner and outer bag walls.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As used herein, the term impregnated means to have been subject to any process or treatment by which silver, ions of silver, or silver-bearing compounds are incorporated into, on, or with a porous or permeable material so as to come into contact with air and/or air-entrained pathogens as the air passes through the material. Processes that can be employed include infusion, spraying, sintering, sputter or vapor deposition, plating, etc.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to an embodiment, micro- and/or nanoparticles of silver are blended with a polymer that is melted and blown from a nozzle onto a support surface, such as the surface of a rotating drum, in a melt-blowing process. According to another embodiment, a non-woven textile media is coated with a silver-bearing substance. According to a further embodiment, a bi-component sheath-core material is provided, in which the sheath of the fiber is silver-impregnated.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> shows an inner bag wall <b>202</b> with four layers <b>203</b> and an outer bag wall <b>204</b> with a single layer, US 2019/0239707 A1 other embodiments are contemplated that include other numbers of layers in either or both of the inner and outer bag walls <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, as required to accommodate a selected rate of air flow while providing a selected efficiency in particle removal and a selected antimicrobial capacity. Additionally, embodiments are contemplated in which the positions of the inner and outer bag walls <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> are reversed or mixed, so that a silver impregnated layer is innermost, or is positioned between particle filter layers, with one or more particle filter layers positioned outside of that layer. Furthermore, embodiments are contemplated in which the functions of the inner and outer bag walls <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> are combined, with one or more of the layers <b>203</b> of the inner bag wall <b>202</b> being impregnated with silver, while the separate silver-impregnated outer bag wall is omitted. With regard to the structure of the vacuum filter bag <b>132</b>, the material of the inner and/or outer bag walls <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> can be laminated or pressed together, or can be separate from each other, with some amount of space between.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The antimicrobial properties of silver have been known for centuries, although the mechanism by which it operates is still not fully understood. While the use of silver has been largely discontinued with the advent of immunizations, antibiotics, antiseptic cleaners, and the like, many recent and ongoing studies are exploring the benefits of silver, which in some cases still exceed those of more recent&#x2014;and more expensive&#x2014;treatments. Silver used in research and treatment is provided in various different forms and compounds, including, for example, silver nitrate, silver sulfadiazine, colloidal silver, and nanoparticles of silver. In each case, it is generally understood that the active antimicrobial agent is ionized silver, and that whatever the form in which it is delivered to the site, the silver releases ions when it comes into contact with moisture. Accordingly, it would not be expected that silver would be effective as an antimicrobial agent while dry. However, recent research has shown that when impregnated with silver, dry, porous materials can exhibit significant antimicrobial properties. For example, a recent study examined the antimicrobial effect of surgical masks coated with nanoparticles of silver nitrate and titanium dioxide. In that study, a 100% reduction in viable <i>E. coli </i>and <i>S. aureus </i>was observed in the coated mask materials after 48 hours of incubation. (Antimicrobial effect of surgical masks coated with nanoparticles (abstract), Li Y et al., The Journal of Hospital Infection, 2006 January; 62(1):58-63. Epub 2005 Aug. 15.)</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">It should be noted that in known systems that provide a true HEPA-quality vacuum filter bag, the bag traps most pathogens that are collected. However, this means that after use, the bag itself may be highly contaminated, so that a user who handles the vacuum filter bag risks being infected by pathogens present in or on the surface of the bag, or that are released in high concentration in the air when the bag is removed from the machine or thrown into a garbage receptacle. In embodiments that include an inner layer of silver impregnated material, the silver kills any pathogens that come into contact, significantly reducing the danger of infection to those who handle the bag or come into contact with the contents.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes a filter assembly <b>128</b> through which exhaust air is passed prior to exiting the machine. According to an embodiment, the filter assembly <b>128</b> includes a filter element that is impregnated with silver, and that serves as a final stage to ensure that the exhaust air is free of live pathogens. Depending upon its selected MERV rating, the filter assembly can also act to remove particulates that pass through the vacuum filter bag. In some embodiments, the filter assembly <b>128</b> is provided as an alternative to the silver-impregnated outer bag wall <b>204</b>; in other embodiments, the filter assembly is provided in addition to the silver-impregnated outer bag wall, acting as a backup stage. According to another embodiment, the filter assembly <b>128</b> has a MERV rating that is higher than that of the vacuum filter bag <b>132</b> and is positioned to further clean the exhaust air.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">It will be recognized that, while a manufacturer may recommend a particular schedule or frequency of service and bag replacement, the manufacturer cannot force compliance, and that some users may overfill a vacuum filter bag to a point well beyond its rated capacity, before replacing the bag. In such cases, a vacuum filter bag can degrade, so that it is no longer capable of removing small particles, and its antimicrobial properties may be compromised. In such cases, the addition of silver to the filter assembly <b>128</b> can act as insurance, and continue to extend antimicrobial protection and/or to remove very fine particles from the exhaust air.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The inventors have found that manufacturing a vacuum filter bag with silver impregnation, as described above, is relatively inexpensive, particularly when compared to the cost of producing a vacuum filter bag with a true HEPA rating, not to mention the cost of a vacuum cleaner capable of drawing air through such a bag without significant loss of efficiency.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of an air filter assembly <b>300</b>, according to an embodiment, with one side removed to show internal elements.

A second filter element <b>304</b> is also provided, which is impregnated with silver or a silver compound and is configured to exert an antimicrobial action on air as it passes through the filter assembly <b>300</b>. Side walls form a frame <b>306</b> that surround the filter assembly <b>300</b> on four sides, and is configured according to a particular intended use. For example, most systems that are configured to provide filtered air require specific unique filters, which must be replaced periodically to maintain efficiency.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">During operation, air pressure against the filter element <b>302</b>, as air passes through the assembly, can tend to push the filter and antimicrobial elements <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> outward from the frame <b>306</b>. Accordingly, a support grid <b>308</b> is attached to the frame <b>306</b> on the output side of the filter assembly <b>300</b> to provide physical support to the filter and antimicrobial elements <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>.
