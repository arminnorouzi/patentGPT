In particular, the computing device <b>200</b> allows the user to view the streamed game at any location and time remotely.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The computing device <b>200</b> may include various elements as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. It should be noted that the elements are exemplary and that other aspects may incorporate more or less than the elements illustrated. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the computing device <b>200</b> includes a main memory <b>202</b>, a central processing unit (CPU) <b>204</b>, at least one vector unit <b>206</b>, a graphics processing unit <b>208</b>, an input/output (I/O) processor <b>210</b>, an I/O processor memory <b>212</b>, a controller interface <b>214</b>, a memory card <b>216</b>, a Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface <b>218</b>, and an IEEE interface <b>220</b>, an auxiliary (AUX) interface <b>222</b> for connecting a tracking device <b>224</b>, although other bus standards and interfaces may be utilized. The computing device <b>200</b> further includes an operating system read-only memory (OS ROM) <b>226</b>, a sound processing unit <b>228</b>, an optical disc control unit <b>230</b>, and a hard disc drive <b>232</b>, which are connected via a bus <b>234</b> to the I/O processor <b>210</b>. The computing device <b>200</b> further includes at least one tracking device <b>224</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The tracking device <b>224</b> may be a camera, which includes eye-tracking capabilities. The camera may be integrated into or attached as a peripheral device to computing device <b>200</b>. According to various aspects, typical eye-tracking devices may use infrared non-collimated light reflected from the eye and sensed by a camera or optical sensor. The information is then analyzed to extract eye rotation from changes in reflections. Camera-based trackers focus on one or both eyes and record their movement as the user looks at some type of stimulus. Camera-based eye trackers use the center of the pupil and light to create corneal reflections (CRs). The vector between the pupil center and the CR can be used to compute the point of regard on surface or the gaze direction. A simple calibration procedure of the user may be needed before using the eye tracker.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In other aspects, trackers that are more sensitive may use reflections from the front of the cornea and that back of the lens of the eye as features to track over time. In yet other aspects, even more sensitive trackers image features from inside the eye, including retinal blood vessels, and follow these features as the eye rotates. Most eye-tracking devices may use a sampling rate of at least 30 Hz, although 50/60 Hz is most common. Some tracking devises may run as high as 240 Hz, which is needed to capture detail of very rapid eye movement. The foregoing describes example eye-tracking technology that may be used in accordance with the present disclosure. In various aspects, any known eye gaze tracking technology that one skilled in the art would be capable of applying could be used.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A range camera may instead be used with the present disclosure to capture gestures made by the user and is capable of facial recognition.

Further still, in various aspects, any technology suitable for measuring and/or capturing motion, facial expressions and/or any other physical or physiological state of a user may be used.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As noted above, the computing device <b>200</b> may be an electronic gaming console. Alternatively, the computing device <b>200</b> may be implemented as a general-purpose computer, a set-top box, or a hand-held gaming device. Further, similar user devices may contain more or less operating components.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The CPU <b>204</b>, the vector unit <b>206</b>, the graphics-processing unit <b>208</b>, and the I/O processor <b>210</b> communicate via a system bus <b>236</b>. Further, the CPU <b>204</b> communicates with the main memory <b>202</b> via a dedicated bus <b>238</b>, while the vector unit <b>206</b> and the graphics-processing unit <b>208</b> may communicate through a dedicated bus <b>240</b>. The CPU <b>204</b> executes programs stored in the OS ROM <b>226</b> and the main memory <b>202</b>. The main memory <b>202</b> may contain pre-stored programs and programs transferred through the I/O Processor <b>210</b> from a CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, or other optical disc (not shown) using the optical disc control unit <b>230</b>. The I/O processor <b>210</b> primarily controls data exchanges between the various devices of the computing device <b>200</b> including the CPU <b>204</b>, the vector unit <b>206</b>, the graphics processing unit <b>208</b>, and the controller interface <b>214</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The graphics-processing unit <b>208</b> executes graphics instructions received from the CPU <b>204</b> and the vector unit <b>206</b> to produce images for display on a display device (not shown). For example, the vector unit <b>206</b> may transform objects from three-dimensional coordinates to two-dimensional coordinates, and send the two-dimensional coordinates to the graphics-processing unit <b>208</b>. Furthermore, the sound processing unit <b>230</b> executes instructions to produce sound signals that are outputted to an audio device such as speakers (not shown).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A user of the computing device <b>200</b> provides instructions via the controller interface <b>214</b> to the CPU <b>204</b>. For example, the user may instruct the CPU <b>204</b> to store certain information on the memory card <b>216</b> or instruct the computing device <b>200</b> to perform some specified action. Example controllers associated with the controller interface <b>214</b> may include a touch-screen, keyboards, and game controllers.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Other devices may be connected to the computing device <b>200</b> via the USB interface <b>218</b>, the IEEE interface <b>220</b>, and the AUX interface <b>222</b>. Specifically, the tracking device <b>224</b>, including a camera or a sensor may be connected to the computing device <b>200</b> via the AUX interface <b>222</b>, while a controller may be connected via the USB interface <b>218</b>.

Hardware and related software for implementing an augmented reality (AR) experience may similarly be coupled to the computing device <b>200</b> via one or more computing interfaces.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram of an exemplary host server <b>140</b> that may be used in context of the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The host server <b>140</b> may include a plurality of different features that further facilitates automatic purchase of video games or digital media and related game assets. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the host server <b>140</b> may include memory <b>300</b>, one or more processor <b>305</b>, the host server application program interface (API) <b>140</b>, a gaming content storage and buffer <b>310</b>, a machine-learning module <b>315</b>, a parameter module <b>325</b>, a preselected list module <b>320</b>, an augmented interest list module <b>330</b>, a marketing module <b>335</b>, a purchasing module <b>340</b>, a social engagement module <b>345</b>, and a communication interfaces <b>350</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to one aspect, the host application program interface (API) <b>170</b> allows a host to manage how data, including but not limited to the game stream, is distributed to remote users. Using the API <b>170</b>, an administrator (e.g., developer, gaming platform provider, streaming game aggregator) can customize and modify how the host server operates with respect to what data is retrieved from the content server <b>110</b>, how the game stream is presented to the user devices.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In various aspects, the gaming content storage and buffer <b>310</b> may be used to store the streaming game temporarily until it can be processed and distributed to users. In various examples, the gaming storage and buffer is a physical memory storage of the host server <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to one aspect, the machine-learning module <b>315</b> recommends items to add to the preselected list. For example, the machine-learning module <b>315</b> may recommend items to add to the preselected list based upon user's known social networks and/or the user's past activity and interactions with the network system <b>100</b> and the host server <b>140</b>. The machine-learning module <b>315</b> may also suggest items (e.g. digital media or digital assets) to add to the preselected list based upon the user's unknown or passive social networks based on location, demographics etc. For example, the user may have gaming interests and other commonalities with others, that do not have active social network connections.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In another aspect, the machine-learning module <b>315</b> may identify or set and enact suggested thresholds based on the user's purchase history. In this aspect, the user may modify the threshold as desired. The thresholds, whether determined by the machine-learning module or modified by the user, may be used in the parameter module <b>325</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In other aspects, the machine-learning module <b>315</b> may recommend additional products based upon group purchasing dynamics. The machine-learning module may facilitate game plays or purchases in legacy games. The machine-learning module <b>315</b> may help identify a number of users who may not know each other, but have the same items on their wish list or preselected list. The machine-learning module <b>315</b> may recommend the identified users to book discounted video games or products, which also creates a new game play community that may lengthen life span of the legacy games. When the life span of the legacy games increases, there may be more opportunities to sell the legacy games to a dedicated group of players remain.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The preselected list module <b>320</b> may include preselected lists of products provided by users. The products may include games, digital media, and associated components with the games or digital media, among others. In various aspects, the data stored by the preselected list module may be used to further train the machine-learning module <b>315</b>. Additionally, the preselected list module may be modified by the outputs of the machine-learning module <b>315</b> in order to further identify and add gaming content closely related to that pre-selected by the user. For example, a user may identify a particular game or a particular game asset of interest that is organized and stored by the preselected list module <b>320</b>. In this example, the preselected list module <b>320</b> may work in conjunction with one or more other module described herein to identify another game content (e.g. a more powerful weapon of the same class or a higher resolution gaming asset) as that selected by the user and augment or update a preselected item list.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to various aspects, the parameter module <b>325</b> may be used to establish parameters or thresholds for the automatic purchase of the products on wish lists or preselected lists from users. For example, the parameters may include discount rates and maximum prices for the one or more products. The parameter module <b>325</b> may establish auto-purchase parameters or thresholds, such as percent discount, a number of similar items sold, a number of friends who have bought the products. The parameters may have a threshold, which may be percentage based, e.g. 20% or 35% discount. The parameter module <b>325</b> may have setup a maximum price for automatic purchase. There may be no refunds after the automatic purchase.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The host server also includes an augmented interest list module <b>330</b> that may include a combination of the preselected list of the products and the respective recommended list of additional products based upon the machine-learning module <b>315</b> for one of the users. In various aspects, the data stored by the preselected list module may be used to further train the machine-learning module <b>315</b>. Additionally, the preselected list module may be modified by the outputs of the machine-learning module <b>315</b> in order to further identify and add gaming content closely related to that pre-selected by the user. For example, a user may identify a particular game or a particular game asset of interest that is organized and stored by the preselected list module <b>320</b>. In this example, the preselected list module <b>320</b> may work in conjunction with one or more other module described herein to identify another game content (e.g. a more powerful weapon of the same class or a higher resolution gaming asset) as that selected by the user and augment or update a preselected item list.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to at least one aspect, the marketing module <b>335</b> may be used to send various marketing information to the users. For example, the marketing module <b>335</b> may send the at least one user reminders to the users to review the augmented interest list periodically. The marketing module <b>335</b> may also send the users highlights for price difference of products on the augmented interest list periodically. The marketing module <b>335</b> may also send the users suggested prices to purchase bundles of the products on the augmented interest list periodically. The marketing module <b>335</b> may also offer discounts of products to the users based upon the user's purchase history.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In other aspects, the marketing module <b>335</b> may also offer discounts based on user's data and market intelligence. The marketing module <b>335</b> may send users periodically (e.g. monthly) reminder user to review or update wish list. The marketing module <b>335</b> may send users periodically (e.g. monthly) offers to purchase bundles or suggest price thresholds. The marketing module <b>335</b> may periodically send users (e.g. monthly) highlights of price difference. The marketing module <b>335</b> may also offer incentives to users to purchase bundles of gaming content. By way of example, bundle purchases may include the purchase of multiple gaming content items that may or may not be related to the same game, for a price less than purchasing the content items individually.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In various other aspects, the marketing module <b>335</b> may offer crowd-funding sale, i.e. if there are a certain number of users buy a product, the price of the product drops down to a certain amount of dollars. For example, if &#x201c;N&#x201d; number of users buy a product, then the price of the game content is reduced to a particular amount or a percentage discount may be offered. In one aspect, the price reduction may be proportional to the number users participating in the sale. In another aspect, the price reduction is available only when number of purchasers exceeds a threshold as determined by the game content producer.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one aspect, the marketing module <b>335</b> may send offers to potential users or social connections identified using the machine-learning module <b>315</b>, where the discount may not be exactly what the users hope for (e.g. 25% off). The offers may be that the users can have 25% off if the user guarantees five purchases within a window of time.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As such, the offer may still be profitable for the game content producer within an acceptable margin at least from a business point of view. It may be difficult to justify a spending of $100, but may be easier to a group of users or buyers to spend $25 each time, but at four different times within the window of time. The sale may lead into creation of a new social network, which may open new social connections. The social connections, in turn, may facilitate group buying pressure, especially where one player may be pressured to power up by buying new games or game assets. [Note: We are considering a separate application built around this group purchasing concept. Do you have any additional thoughts or features that should be considered?]</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The host server <b>140</b> also includes the purchasing module <b>340</b> that may automatically replenish a user's virtual payment wallet or to charge a users' credit card. According to one aspect, the purchasing module <b>340</b> may also set up or identify separate or dedicated payment options for desired items on the user's preselected list or updated list. Alternatively, the purchasing module may limit the amount of funds available via a spending limit to purchase game content.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to various aspects, the social engagement module <b>345</b> facilitates and encourages further engagement with the game stream and social interactions among the users at the user devices <b>160</b>. In various aspects, the social engagement module <b>345</b> may facilitate social interactions between groups of users. For example, the social engagement module <b>345</b> may generate a video chat among users of the game stream. In another aspect, the social engagement module <b>345</b> may facilitate communication between users using chat, email, video chat, or any other suitable communication modalities.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In one aspect, the communication interface <b>350</b> facilitates communication between the various features of the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. For example, this would facilitate transmission of information from the content server <b>110</b> to the host server <b>140</b> and from the host server to the user devices <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary machining-learning module <b>315</b> for recommending products, in accordance with some aspects of the disclosed technology. The machine-learning module <b>315</b> may use the machine-learning model or algorithm for creating recommended list to the users, including one of collaborative filtering algorithm, content-based filtering, desirable content model, personalized video game ranker, or knowledge based recommendation systems.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the machine-learning model <b>406</b> receives the user's data <b>402</b> from data source server <b>190</b>. The user's data may include the user's purchase history, the user's social network, the user's location and demographics, among others. The machine-learning model <b>406</b> also receives the product data <b>404</b> from data source server <b>190</b>. The product data may include products' prices, discounts, sale volumes, among others. The machine-learning model <b>406</b> outputs recommended lists of products to a recommended list module <b>408</b> which includes the recommended list that may be of interest to the user(s).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some aspects, the desirable content model can take events from users' online activity to recommend a small subset of video games, digital media, or digital assets. Identification of desirable content is the first stage of determining a content recommendation. Given a query, the machining-learning algorithm generates a set of relevant desirable content. There are two common candidate generation approaches, including content-based filtering and collaborative filtering.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some aspects, the collaborative filtering algorithm can identify users who buy similar items in order to recommend products. The collaborative filtering simultaneously uses similarities between past or present queries and items purchased or otherwise selected to provide recommendations. For example, if user A is similar to user B, and user B likes video game 1, then the machine-learning algorithm can recommend video game content 1 to user A (even if user A hasn't played or viewed game content similar to video game content 1).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some aspects, the content-based filtering algorithm can recommend items based upon user's purchase history, ratings, or feedback, among others. The content-based filtering uses similarity between items to recommend items similar to what the user likes. For example, if user A plays video game A, the system can recommend similar video games to game A to that user.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some aspects, the knowledge-based recommendation system can analyze each time in a user's query to recommend a combination of items or products. The knowledge-based recommendation system is based on knowledge about the item assortment, user preferences, and recommendation criteria (i.e., which item should be recommended in which context). These systems are applied in scenarios where alternative approaches such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering cannot be applied.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some aspects, the personalized video game ranker can rank best matches from an entire database for each user in a personalized way. For example, the personalized video game ranker may rank the most likely best matches regardless of game content type based on user preferences or user equipment.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating an exemplary method <b>500</b> for automatic purchasing of products, in accordance with some aspects of the disclosed technology. The method <b>500</b> may be embodied as executable instructions in a non-transitory computer readable storage medium including but not limited to a CD, DVD, or non-volatile memory such as a hard drive. The instructions of the storage medium may be executed by a processor (or processors) to cause various hardware components of a computing device hosting or otherwise accessing the storage medium to perform or aid in performing the method.
