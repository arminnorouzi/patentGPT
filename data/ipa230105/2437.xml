Several oligonucleotides are undergoing clinic trials for such uses. Oligonucleotides can also serve as competitive inhibitors of transcription factors, which interact with double-stranded DNA during regulation of transcription, to modulate their actions.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Oligonucleotides and their analogs also have found uses in diagnostic tests, research reagents, and other laboratory procedures. The widespread use of such oligonucleotides has increased the demand for rapid, inexpensive and efficient procedures for their modification and synthesis.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">DCA (dichloroacetic acid) is a commonly used reagent for deblocking nucleotides during oligonucleotide synthesis. Because the addition of new nucleosides involves the repeated use of DCA for deprotecting the 5&#x2032;-hydroxy group, it is important that this reagent be as free as possible of contaminants which may propagate impurities and produce improper sequences of the target oligonucleotide. It has been discovered that the impurities in DCA which may cause the failure of oligonucleotide synthesis such as chloral hydrate and 2,2-dichloroacetic anhydride (DCAA).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Because of the repetitious use of DCA for the removal of the oligonucleotide protecting groups, it is critical that DCA be free of contaminants which may propagate impurities and produce improper sequences of the target oligonucleotide.

It has been further discovered that glyoxylic acid in DCA can be detected and its concentration accurately measured, by ion chromatography method (IC method).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">One object

The two most common classes of nucleobases are purines and pyrimidines. The naturally-occurring purine bases are guanine (G) and adenine (A), which are linked to the sugar through the 9-N nitrogen in the 13-anomeric position on the sugar ring. The naturally-occurring pyrimidine bases are uracil (U), thymine (T) and cytidine (C), which are linked to the sugar through the 1-N nitrogen. In double stranded DNA (dsDNA), Watson-Crick base pairing occurs between G and C, and between A and T. whereas in double stranded RNA (dsRNA), Watson-Crick base pairing occurs between G and C, and between A and U.

The term &#x201c;nucleobase analog&#x201d; (also referred to herein is a nucleobase mimetic or a nucleic acid base mimetic) refers to non-naturally-occurring nucleobases, and means a residue that functions like a nucleobase by providing sequence specific binding to a heterocyclic residue on a complementary oligomer. In some embodiments according to the disclosure, a nucleobase analog is a residue that is capable of establishing one or more non-covalent bonds with a nucleobase on a separate oligonucleotide strand. Non-covalent bonds are hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds and polar interactions. (Additional interactions with non-complementary nucleobases are also possible, such as base-stacking interactions). In some embodiments of the disclosure, non-covalent bonds are formed by hydrogen bonding between nucleobase ring constituents and/or exocyclic substituents, and may be analogous to Watson-Crick bonding, Hoogsteen bonding, some combination thereof, or some other regime as described herein or as known in the art.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0095">As used herein, &#x201c;unmodified&#x201d; or &#x201c;natural&#x201d; nucleobases mean the purine bases adenine (A) and guanine (G), and the pyrimidine bases thymine (T), cytosine (C) and uracil (U).

For example, adenine and thymine are complementary nucleobases which pair through the formation of hydrogen bonds. &#x201c;Complementary&#x201d; as used herein, refers to the capacity for precise pairing between two nucleotides. For example, if a nucleotide at a certain position of an oligonucleotide is capable of hydrogen bonding with a nucleotide at the same position of a DNA or RNA molecule, then the oligonucleotide and the DNA or RNA are considered to be complementary to each other at that position. The oligonucleotide and the DNA or RNA are complementary to each other when a sufficient number of corresponding positions in each molecule are occupied by nucleotides which can hydrogen bond with each other. Thus, &#x201c;specifically hybridizable&#x201d; and &#x201c;complementary&#x201d; are terms which are used to indicate a sufficient degree of complementarity or precise pairing such that stable and specific binding occurs between the oligonucleotide and the DNA or RNA target. It is understood in the art that the sequence of an antisense compound need not be 100% complementary to that of its target nucleic acid to be specifically hybridizable.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Phosphate Linkers</heading><p id="p-0114" num="0100">Oligonucleotides are generally those oligomers in which the monomeric subunits comprise linking members having pentavalent phosphorus as a constituent part.

This iterative elongation eventually results in a final oligomeric compound or other polymer such as a polypeptide. Suitable support media can be soluble or insoluble, or may possess variable solubility in different solvents to allow the growing support bound polymer to be either in or out of solution as desired. Traditional support media such as solid supports are for the most part insoluble and are routinely placed in reaction vessels while reagents and solvents react with and/or wash the growing chain until the oligomer has reached the target length, after which it is cleaved from the support and, if necessary further worked up to produce the final polymeric compound.
