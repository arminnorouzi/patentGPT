For example, if the electronic device is a device capable of wireless communication, the electronic device may include not only mobile phones but also home appliances such as TVs, air conditioners, and lighting devices.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the present disclosure, &#x201c;a calling device&#x201d; refers to an electronic device that receives a control command for controlling another electronic device, and &#x201c;a target device&#x201d; refers to an electronic device controlled by another electronic device. In other words, &#x201c;the calling device&#x201d; may be a subject that controls &#x201c;the target device&#x201d;, and &#x201c;the target device&#x201d; may be a target controlled by &#x201c;the calling device&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">For example, the user may input a control command to &#x201c;the calling device&#x201d; to control &#x201c;the target device&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a method for an electronic device to control another electronic device through a relay server according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The calling device <b>1</b> may receive a control command for another electronic device. In other words, the calling device <b>1</b> may receive a control command for the target device <b>2</b>, which is another electronic device.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">For example, the calling device <b>1</b> is a TV, and the TV may receive a control command such as &#x201c;turn on the air conditioner&#x201d;. In this case, the TV may transmit a signal requesting that the power of the air conditioner, which is the target device <b>2</b>, be controlled to be turned on to the relay server <b>3</b>. The relay server <b>3</b> may control the power of the air conditioner, which is the target device <b>2</b>, to be turned on based on the request signal received from the TV.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In this way, when the calling device <b>1</b> controls the target device <b>2</b> through the relay server <b>3</b>, the calling device <b>1</b> can control the target device <b>2</b> even if the target device <b>2</b> is located far from the calling device <b>1</b>.

In particular, since the calling device <b>1</b> controls the target device <b>2</b> through the relay server <b>3</b>, the time required for the calling device <b>1</b> to operate according to the control command after the calling device <b>1</b> receives the control command may be relatively long.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a method for an electronic device to control another electronic device through a local network according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The calling device <b>1</b> may receive a control command for another electronic device.

In this case, the smartphone may control the power of the lighting, which is the target device <b>2</b>, to be turned on through the hub <b>4</b>, and at this time, the hub <b>4</b> is a device for connecting at least one lighting to a Local Area Network (LAN), and the smartphone and the hub <b>4</b> may be connected to the same network. Alternatively, the calling device <b>1</b> such as a smartphone may directly control the target device <b>2</b> such as lighting through short-range communication.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As such, when the calling device <b>1</b> controls the target device <b>2</b> through the hub <b>4</b> or through short-range wireless communication, the network cost is low and the device can be controlled at a relatively high speed. On the other hand, since the calling device <b>1</b> and the target person <b>2</b> or the calling device <b>1</b> and the hub <b>4</b> must exist in the same network, there is a disadvantage of poor usability.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">When the electronic device controls another electronic device through only one of the method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and the method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, there are problems that the electronic device with improved usability may have a slow control speed of other electronic devices and the electronic device with improved speed are difficult to remotely control another electronic device.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Accordingly, the electronic device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure can increase usability and speed by adaptively controlling another electronic device according to a network configuration state.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a method for an electronic device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure to control an electronic device according to a network configuration state.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The calling device <b>1</b> may receive a control command for another electronic device.
