Most repair products are designed to be applied to either asphalt or cementitious substrates, but are not capable of bonding adequately to both.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Portland cement is hydraulic cement produced by pulverizing clinkers which consist essentially of hydraulic calcium silicates, usually containing one or more of the forms of calcium sulfate as an inter ground addition. It consists of at least two-thirds by mass of calcium silicates (3 CaO.SiO<sub>2 </sub>and 2 CaO.SiO<sub>2</sub>), the remainder consisting of aluminum- and iron-containing clinker phases and other compounds. The ratio of CaO to SiO<sub>2 </sub>shall not be less than 2.0. The magnesium oxide content shall not exceed 5.0% by mass.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Non-Portland cement is a high resistance, sustainable cement with the addition of raw materials such as: calcium sulfoaluminate, alkali aluminosilicates, and certain hydrocarbons.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Previous cementitious compositions comprise either multiple types of cement or only a single type of cement. These mixtures are formulated to achieve a balance of properties (such as set time, compressive strength, shrinkage, and chemical resistance) suited to a particular application. However, each previous composition, whether made of a multiple or single types of cement, come with their own set of challenges.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Two component polymer based materials require on-site mixing of the resin and hardener in precise ratios in order to achieve the targeted performance. Epoxy, polyurea, and polyester resins are the most common in use and are typically supplied in pre-measured packaging to reduce the potential of the end user mixing the proportions incorrectly. The directions often state that to ensure proper performance, mix the entire contents of the packaging. This often results in wasted excess material and associated higher costs. Another negative aspect is that frequently the aggregate is packaged separately and must be mixed in a secondary step, which adds to the labor time on-site. Still another negative aspect is that the polymers used are not water based and thus the tool and on-site clean up requires flammable solvents or aggressive detergents whose run-off may contaminate adjacent soil and waterways.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Single component polymer compositions are moisture cured and designed to simplify the process for the end user by simply adding water once the material is placed. They have the disadvantage of short shelf life due to moisture contamination during manufacturing and packaging, particularly when produced on high humidity days. Once the packaging is opened, any unused material will be exposed to atmospheric moisture, resulting in the curing and hardening in the packaging, even after resealing. The end result is that the product is susceptible to hardening in the packaging either from the factory over time or once opened, rendering it useless, instilling cost losses, and yielding waste material.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Prior to the present teaching, Portland Cement, calcium sulfoaluminate, calcium aluminate, calcium aluminosilicate, and fly ash cements do not bond to asphalt. Prior to the present teaching, the high strength cement, mortar, and concrete disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 8,016,937 by Schumacher, Patel, Sampson, and Riley, explicitly has less than 20% Portland content in the hydratable cement portion of the compositions. None of the composition examples described therein contain Portland cement or calcium sulfoaluminate cement. Further, this composition does not provide adequate bonding to asphalt.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Prior to the present teaching, it is known to use fly ash in Portland cement compositions as a filler material. Brook, et. al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,556,458 discloses that at least 20% Portland cement is needed to overcome the low early strength of their alkali earth metal salt activated fly ash cement compositions with calcium aluminate used for compensating autogenous shrinkage. Just like the other prior art, this composition does not provide adequate bonding to asphalt.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Prior to the present teaching, it is generally believed that fly ash, calcium aluminate, calcium sulfoaluminate, and Portland based hydraulic cements do not bond adequately to asphalt to be used as repair products.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Therefore, it would be beneficial to have a cementitious composition utilizing the synergistic effects of combining a particular blend of multiple types of cement, which provides a permanent repair product for both asphalt and cement based roadways and walkways without the negative attributes of previous cementitious compositions made up of cement blends.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The needs set forth herein as well as further and other needs and advantages are addressed by the present teachings, which illustrate solutions and advantages described below. The present teachings also provide a means of reducing stockpiles of waste asphalt millings which continue to accumulate in quantity.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The blended hydraulic cement composition of the present teaching may be formulated in the following manner. Each of the individual components may be added individually to the packaging and dry mixed in the packaging or on site prior to the addition of water. Each of the individual components may be pre-blended prior to packaging and the water added on site. The hydraulic cement may also have the aggregates incorporated into the packaging. Packaging may include plastic buckets, polyethylene lined Kraft paper bags, plastic bags, supersacks, and bulk totes, although not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The cementitious composition of the present teaching may be combined with fine and/or course aggregates as defined and recommended by the American Concrete Institute to produce a mortar, grout, or shotcrete. The aggregates may also include asphalt millings (i.e., bitumen covered stone that is generated by the grinding of existing pavement prior to re-surfacing with new asphalt pavement).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The cementitious composition of the present teaching will permit the user to avoid being exposed to hazardous organic vapors, chemical burns, and thermal burns.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The cementitious composition of the present teaching will permit the user to avoid use of flammable solvents or corrosive detergents to clean tools and supplies, thus eliminating potential environmental damage caused by spills and washout runoff.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The cementitious composition of the present teaching forms a hardened cement when a sufficient amount of water is added to achieve the desired consistency and can be mixed until homogenous using either hand tools, drill mixer, rotary drum mixer, mortar mixer, grout pump, auger, sprayer, or shotcrete mixer, although not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The cementitious composition of the present teaching may be placed onto a cement, concrete, macadam, brick, compacted aggregate, compacted soil, asphalt substrate(s), although not limited thereto, prior to hardening, consolidating the composition, surface finishing the composition, and allowing the composition to cure.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The cured composition of the present teaching can be used to form a road surface, walkway, vertical barrier, wall, flooring, decking, cast articles, or repairs thereof, although not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The composition of the present teaching forms a bond to the substrate that is stronger than the substrate.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The cementitious composition of one embodiment, according to the present teach, includes a Portland cement, and at least one other cement from a group comprising calcium sulfoaluminate cement, a calcium aluminosilicate cement, and calcium aluminate cement, where the Portland cement has a content of at least 10 percent based on the total weight of the non-Portland hydratable cement powder, and where the cementitious composition bonds to asphalt.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a further embodiment, the composition is free of latex bonding agents.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a further embodiment, the at least one other cement is between 0.5 to 70 percent of the composition.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a further embodiment, the cementitious composition includes an additive selected from a group comprising retarders, shrinkage reducing agents, air entraining agents, aggregates, fillers, extenders, pigments, water reducers, fiber reinforcements, rheology modifiers, and set accelerators.
