id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure relates to connection devices for expanded cellular confinement structures for the confinement of infill material. In particular, this disclosure relates to improved connectors having barbs and methods used for fastening together at least two expanded cellular confinement structures.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A cellular confinement structure serves to increase the load bearing capacity, stability, and erosion resistance of infill materials which are placed within the cells of the system. A commercially available system is Geoweb&#xae; plastic web confinement structure sold by Reynolds Presto Products, Inc., Appleton, Wis. Geoweb&#xae; cells are made from high density polyethylene strips that are joined by welds on their faces in a side-by-side relationship at alternating spaces so that when the strips are stretched out in a direction perpendicular to the faces of the strips, the resulting web section is honeycomb-like in appearance, with sinusoidal or undulated-shaped cells. Geoweb&#xae; sections are lightweight and are shipped in their collapsed form for ease in handling and installation. Geoweb&#xae; systems have been described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,395,372; 4,778,309; 4,965,097; and 5,449,543, each of these patents being incorporated by reference herein.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The cellular confinement structures are typically arranged adjacent to each other and then connected together. In the past, these sections have been connected together by using staples, wires, cable ties, etc. These devices are labor-intensive and consume excessive construction time. In many implementations, these types of connections are difficult to use because of the particular situation or terrain. Most often, these types of connection systems require power from generators and air actuation from compressors. The requirement for power can add to the difficulty, given the particular environment or terrain that such cellular confinement systems are typically placed. The unit cost per connection can be quite high on smaller projects as the fixed costs for supply of generators and air compressors are similar to a small installation as would be required for a large installation. Moreover, some of these connection devices provide relatively weak structural connections and are non-durable. In some implementations, these are not problems. In many applications, however, speed is important and the availability of power equipment is challenging.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Reynolds Presto Products developed a connection device for cellular confinement structures, described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,092,122, incorporated herein by reference. While this connection device solves many of the problems outlined above, improvements are desirable.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one aspect, a connection device for fastening two expanded cellular confinement structures is provided.

In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>-<b>26</b></figref>, the wall <b>500</b> is a single upstanding member <b>512</b> with a terminal free end <b>510</b> opposite from the first surface <b>492</b> of the washer member <b>490</b>. The upstanding member <b>512</b> extends between opposite wall side ends <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, which are perpendicular to the first surface <b>492</b>. The free end <b>510</b> extends between the side ends <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0134">In the example embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>-<b>26</b></figref>, the wall <b>500</b> has one or more curved surfaces, while in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>27</b>-<b>31</b></figref>, the wall <b>500</b> can have straight segments (described further below).</p><p id="p-0137" num="0135">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, the wall <b>500</b> has curved surface <b>502</b> and a curved surface <b>503</b>. These curved surfaces <b>502</b>, <b>503</b> help to give the wall <b>500</b> an S-shape between ends <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>. Many variations can be made in the shape of the wall <b>500</b>. In this example, the radius of curvatures for the curved surfaces <b>502</b>, <b>503</b> are made to allow for convenient grasping and turning by a human hand. In addition, wall <b>500</b> is designed to be attractive and eye catching, in that many variations in the appearance are possible. While there can be many variations, the radius of curvatures of the curved surfaces <b>502</b>, <b>503</b> can be in a range of 1.05 to 1.2 inches. For example, when sized within this range, one of the curved surfaces <b>502</b>, <b>503</b> comfortably accommodates most human thumbs, and works especially well during the installation process for use by an installer's right hand.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0136">The handle member <b>70</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>-<b>26</b></figref> further includes a plurality of ribs <b>506</b> protruding from opposite sides <b>508</b>, <b>509</b> of the wall <b>500</b>. The ribs <b>506</b> extend longitudinally, generally parallel to the longitudinal axis <b>482</b>. The ribs <b>506</b> extend from adjacent a terminal end <b>510</b> of the wall <b>500</b> to the first surface <b>492</b> of the washer section <b>490</b>. While there can be many variations, in this example, there are between 8-15 ribs (e.g., about 12) <b>506</b>, spaced from each other, on each side <b>508</b>, <b>509</b> of the wall <b>500</b>. The ribs <b>506</b> help to improve and enhance the grip of a human hand on the handle member <b>470</b>.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0137">The height of the wall <b>500</b> extends from the first surface <b>492</b> to the terminal end <b>510</b>. The height can be many variations, and in this example, can be greater than a length of the shank <b>64</b> but less than half the length of the insertion member <b>44</b>.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0138">In example embodiments, the outermost dimension of the washer section <b>490</b> is equal to or greater than an outermost dimension of the handle member <b>70</b>, in both parallel and perpendicular directions from the center longitudinal axis <b>482</b> of the handle <b>70</b>. In practice, this will ensure complete coverage of the receiving I-slot <b>36</b> when the device <b>424</b>, <b>624</b> is inserted and turned between 0 to 90 degrees to make a connection between two adjoining webs <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0139">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>27</b>-<b>31</b></figref>, the wall <b>500</b> has a plurality of connected straight sections <b>630</b> having generally flat, planar surfaces enclosing an interior <b>632</b>. Many variations are possible, and in the example shown, the straight sections <b>630</b> form a polygon <b>634</b>, including a regular polygon. The example polygon <b>634</b> shown is a hexagon <b>636</b>. The straight sections <b>630</b> can receive a tool, such as a wrench or an appropriately shaped hex socket, which can be used to rotate the handle member <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0140">In the interior <b>632</b> of the polygon <b>634</b>, there can be an additional inset <b>638</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>), recessed from the plane of the first surface <b>492</b>. The inset <b>638</b> can be centered in the interior <b>632</b> and have a polygon shape. While variations are possible, in this example, the inset <b>638</b> has the same shape as the wall <b>500</b>. In the example shown, the inset <b>638</b> is shaped as a hexagon <b>640</b>. A tool can be inserted in the inset <b>638</b> to rotate the handle <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0141">The connection device <b>424</b>, <b>624</b> can be used in the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>, analogous as that described for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. As can be appreciated, the washer section <b>490</b> is against and covers the open slots <b>36</b> on the first side <b>40</b> of the cell overlap region <b>38</b>. This helps to prevent migration of soil or other materials from passing through the slot <b>36</b>. In some applications, such as use with retaining walls, the connection device <b>424</b>, <b>624</b> having the washer section <b>490</b> is only used for the portion of the retaining wall that is externally visible, as it contributes to the attractiveness and beauty of the retaining wall. In those case, the portions that are not visible can use prior art connection devices according to U.S. Pat. No. 8,092,122; or, alternatively, according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>19</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0142">The connection device <b>424</b> can be used in a method of fastening to expanded cellular confinement structures, as described above with respect to connection device <b>24</b>. In this case, the step of inserting includes pressing the washer section <b>490</b> against the first side <b>40</b> of the overlap region <b>38</b>. There is also the step of rotating the handle member <b>70</b>, in which the handle member <b>70</b> includes the wall <b>500</b> projecting from the washer section <b>490</b>. The handle member <b>70</b> can also be rotated by using a tool acting on the polygon <b>634</b> or on the inset <b>638</b>.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0143">The connection device <b>424</b>, <b>624</b> can be part of a kit for the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>.
