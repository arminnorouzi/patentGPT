Once the fee is determined the seller is &#x2018;stuck&#x2019; in a exclusive listing contract which can not be changed until the contract expires between seller and real estate broker. During this exclusive listing agreement, a real estate agent has the monopoly at his discretion to who to give access to show this property too and to not show this property. Additionally, even if this fee is initially reduced there is no additional incentive to the buyer, renter, seller and even other agents.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the open listing platform, interested buyers compete for the ownership of assets, while open brokers compete to close deals with buyers on behalf of the sellers without exclusive contracts. Usually, the seller will set the price of the asset, which serve as the basis for the negotiation process. The interested parties bid for the asset, and the listing continues until the seller or a broker closes a deal with a buyer. To promote the sale of their property, the seller may provide an incentive to open brokers or to buyers. Due to its open nature, the broker fee/commission can be changed at will, the seller doesn't have to sign an exclusive listing agreement and can give broker/agent the commission/fee at what ever amount seller wants who brings a qualified buyer or renter at closing table. Moreover, instead of reducing the broker fee/commission the seller has the option to apportion part of the funds towards a credit for appliances or other home improvement items at the buyers discretion as an incentive to encourage purchase. Such incentives are implemented via an escrow to promote trust.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As part of process, potential buyers are allowed a preview to check the listed properties and examine their condition without restrictions imposed by any broker. Once potential buyers are done viewing all the items and are interested in placing their bids, they may register to participate in the process. The registration process requires the buyer's details like phone number, address, and identification such as a passport or driver's license number. Each registered potential buyer has a unique identifier that is used to identify the participant.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The seller gives a brief description of the asset for sale and starts the listing with a price that he/she considers a reasonable price. In an open listing platform, the bulk of the process is carried out online. An online listing system is different from listing for a home in person through a trustee's sale or a sheriff's sale. For starters, listing is conducted via the web.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Generally, an escrow is a financial arrangement where a third party holds and regulates payment of the funds required for two parties involved in a given transaction. It helps make transactions more secure by keeping the payment in a secure escrow account which is only released when all of the terms of an agreement are met as overseen by the escrow company.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Escrows are very useful in the case of a transaction where a large amount money is involved and a certain number of obligations need to be fulfilled before a payment is released like in the case of a website being built where the buyer might want confirmation of the quality of work being done before making a full payment, and the seller doesn't want to extend a massive amount of work without any assurance that he or she will receive payment. While traditional escrow service is quite difficult and must be obtained through banks and lawyers, there are online escrow services at affordable rates. While the payment is &#x2018;In Escrow&#x2019; the transaction can be safely carried out without risk of losing money or merchandise due to fraud. This eliminates all legal jargon and allows for secure transactions and confident buyers and sellers.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The following summary is an explanation of some of the general inventive steps for the system, method, architecture and tools in the description.

On a first portable computing device is configured a computer program product with a graphical user interface <b>13</b>, such a product being capable of generating an agent or owner entity <b>10</b>, a property entity <b>11</b>, the property details <b>12</b> such as price, location, images or any such information that would be of interest to a buyer, and an incentive <b>14</b> for purchasing the property including but not limited to a credit facility, purchase of certain items or even reduction of purchase price among others. The objects generated by the computer program product are transmitted via a network <b>3</b> to a database <b>4</b>, in a server <b>5</b>. On the other hand, a second portable computing device <b>2</b> is configured with a computer program product capable of receiving respective entities in a remote database through a network and displaying on the graphical user interface the agent or owner entity <b>10</b> of a certain property entity <b>11</b>, the property details <b>12</b> such as price, location, images or any such information that would be of interest to a buyer, an incentive <b>14</b> for purchasing the property including but not limited to a credit facility, purchase of certain items or even reduction of purchase price among others, and a buy function <b>15</b>. The incentive <b>14</b> is an incentive associated with a property as submitted as security such as to an escrow by an agent or owner of the respective property. Generally, each portable computing device has a configurable memory, on which a computer program can be configured, a graphical user interface, a processor that executes memory instructions and a network interface.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the second embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> of the diagrams is an illustration of an agent entity <b>20</b>, which for the purposes of this disclosure may alternatively be known as the owner, and its profile <b>21</b>, and how it relates to property entities <b>22</b> and the security such as escrow of incentives <b>23</b>. In accordance to the current invention, an agent is an entity in a database of a computer-implemented open listing system as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In the current context, an agent <b>20</b> is any such entity in the database <b>4</b> identifiable as owning a property such as <b>22</b>, has a profile <b>21</b>, and creates incentives for buyers who purchases a property or for open brokers that help close a deal in a security such as an escrow <b>23</b>. In the current invention, the security such as the escrow is out of control of the seller but it serves the function of ensuring that the seller is contractually obliged to fulfill the incentive after the sale. One such incentive is a commission to an open broker who is not contractually bound to the seller, but who nonetheless can participate in the sale process without the need to trust the buyer since the escrow ensures they can access their incentive after closing the deal.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> of the diagrams is yet another embodiment according to the current invention, which illustrates a property entity <b>22</b> with its associated details <b>24</b>, and how it relates to an agent or owner <b>20</b> and the escrow of incentives <b>23</b>. The property entity is also stored in the database <b>4</b>, in a storage device of the server <b>5</b>, wherein such a property has an associated incentive in a security such as an escrow <b>23</b>, such an incentive being one generated by the respective agent <b>20</b> using a portable computing device configured with the respective computer program product. Further, each property has associated details <b>24</b>, which may include the price, location, images or any such information that would be of interest to a buyer such as opening bid amount.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In another embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> of the diagrams is an illustration of a buyer entity <b>24</b> with its profile <b>26</b> and how it relates to a property <b>22</b>, an agent or owner <b>20</b> and the escrow of incentives <b>23</b>. The buyer entity is stored in the database <b>4</b>, in a storage device of the server <b>5</b>, wherein such a buyer has an associated buyer profile <b>26</b>, such a profile may include the buyer's details like phone number, address, and identification such as a passport or driver's license number. In the current context, a property <b>22</b> is any such property that a buyer may purchase or planning to purchase. The property has an agent or owner <b>20</b>, and an incentive associated with purchasing it in a security such as an escrow <b>23</b>. When a buyer submits a bid towards purchasing a property, such a bid becomes available to the agent through the relationship between a property entity and the agent. Furthermore, upon purchasing a property, the buyer may access the incentive associated with the respective property as provided by the agent from the security such as an escrow <b>23</b>. The incentive is also displayed on a configured portable computing device of the respective buyer.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Further still, in an embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> of the diagrams is an illustration of an escrow <b>24</b> of the current invention and its relationship with the agent or owner, property and buyer. In its essence, an escrow is any such financial arrangement where a third party holds and regulates payment of the funds required for two parties involved in a given transaction. It helps make transactions more secure by keeping the payment in a secure escrow account which is only released when all of the terms of an agreement are met as overseen by the security such as an escrow company. In the current context, the escrow securely holds incentives provided by sellers to buyers of property securely until a transaction is completed. An escrow contains an incentive <b>27</b>, such an incentive being the object of a property <b>22</b> as submitted by an agent <b>20</b>. The buyers <b>24</b> of a property with an incentive submitted in an escrow are entitled to such incentives without relying on the sellers that provided the incentive. On the other hand, the open brokers <b>24</b> in the context of the current invention are free agents that may opt to sell any property listed for an incentive such as a commission, such an incentive being securely held in the security such as an escrow.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the case of a transaction where a large amount money is involved and a certain number of obligations need to be fulfilled before a payment is released like in the case of purchase of properties where the buyer might want confirmation of the quality of work being done before making a full payment, and the seller doesn't want to extend a massive amount of work without any assurance that he or she will receive payment, an escrow is very useful. While traditional securities such as an escrow service is quite difficult and must be obtained through banks and lawyers, there are online services at affordable rates. While the payment is &#x2018;In Security&#x2019; the transaction can be safely carried out without risk of losing money or merchandise due to fraud. This eliminates all legal jargon and allows for secure transactions and confident buyers and sellers.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> of the diagrams teaches of a method of listing a property in a computer-implemented open listing system. On the figure is a process <b>30</b>, of creating a property to list. The process <b>30</b> is performed on a portable computing device configured with a respective computer program product, and the property stored in the database in a remote network. The process <b>31</b> entails creating an incentive associated with the purchase of a property. Subsequently, the incentive is transmitted to a security such as an escrow service <b>32</b> via a network, wherein such an incentive is recorded in the process <b>33</b>. The incentive is applied to either open brokers and buyers in the open listing system or both.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> of the diagrams, it is illustrated a method of purchasing a property in a computer-implemented open listing system. The method performed using a portable computing device comprises of the process of selecting a property for purchase <b>40</b>, the process of purchasing the property <b>41</b>, the process of getting an incentive associated with property <b>42</b>, and a process redeeming the incentive from the escrow <b>43</b>. In the context of the current invention, the process of redeeming the incentive from the escrow <b>43</b> entails acquiring the respective benefit provided by the seller from the escrow service. Such a benefit may be to either a buyer or an open broker who closed the sale on behalf of the seller. The purchase of property may be performed such as using an online payment service, electronic funds transfer or any such method of transacting, provided that the seller has access to such a transaction and can validate it as an authentic transaction.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a final embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> of the diagrams, it teaches of a method of creating an agent/home owner and listing a property with an associated incentive in a computer-implemented open listing system. On the figure is a process <b>50</b>, of creating a home owner or agent profile in the database. The method may entail collecting personally identifiable information such as email addresses, telephone numbers o any such information that allows them to gain access to the computer-implemented system in an identifiable manner. The process <b>51</b> is performed on a portable computing device configured with a respective computer program product, wherein a property listing associated with a home owner or agent profile is stored in the database in a remote network. The process <b>52</b> entails creating an incentive associated with a property at the close of a deal, either for a renter, buyer, open brokers or agents of a home owner. Subsequently, the incentive is transmitted to security such as an escrow service via a network, wherein such an incentive is recorded in the process <b>53</b>.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
