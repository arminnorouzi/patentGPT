Limited access to freshwater due to the absence of sources, such as lakes, rivers, and groundwater is becoming even more problematic, with many of these sources becoming contaminated from human activities. Traditional means to acquire clean water, such as reverse osmosis and distillation, is costly and energy-intensive which in turn restricts real-world uses.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The passive capture of clean water from humid air under a wide range of relative humidity without reliance on bulky equipment and high energy has been a substantial challenge. Such an approach, however, could provide a potential environmentally friendly alternative to traditional water harvesting methods. Direct water harvesting from air has been demonstrated through cooling water vapor below its saturation pressure.

Indeed, the present invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. As used in the specification, and in the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d;, &#x201c;the&#x201d;, include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to accessing non-traditional water reserves, such as atmospheric water vapor. In this regard, certain embodiments in accordance with the invention provide the ability to supply freshwater on-demand virtually anywhere on the earth. For example, atmospheric water harvesting, in accordance with certain embodiments of the invention, provides an attractive alternative by enabling access to the omnipresent water vapor in the earth's atmosphere off the grid and in virtually any environment. Accordingly, the present invention, in accordance with certain embodiments of the invention, provide sorbent materials comprising a nanofiber composite including a polymeric material defining a continuous phase and at least one metal organic framework (MOF) material defining a discontinuous phase. In this regard, the at least one MOF material is dispersed throughout the continuous phase of the polymeric material. For instance, the polymeric material may comprise a gel material or a hydrogel material. Accordingly, certain embodiments of the invention simultaneously take advantage of the fast rate of water absorption and/or desorption associated with certain gel or hydrogel materials with the relatively high water retaining capacity (e.g., mass of water retained per mass of material absorbing the water) associated with certain MOF materials.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Sorbent materials, in accordance with certain embodiments of the invention, may be particularly well suited for use inside a water harvesting device (e.g., atmospheric water harvesting device). In this regard, certain embodiments of the invention provide water harvesting devices that may include one of more absorption columns housing one or more sorption materials, such as those described and disclosed herein. The absorption columns may include one or more temperature swing adsorption (TSA) column and/or one or more pressure swing adsorption (PSA) columns that house one or more sorption materials therein. In accordance with certain embodiments of the invention, for example, the water harvesting device may include a sorption material comprising one or more nanofiber composites, such as those disclosed herein, that harvest (e.g., capture) water from air.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As noted above, certain embodiments of the invention provide a sorbent material comprising a nanofiber composite including a polymeric material defining a continuous phase and at least one MOF material defining a discontinuous phase. In this regard, the at least one MOF material is dispersed throughout the continuous phase of the polymeric material.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In accordance with certain embodiments of the invention, the nanofiber composite may have an average diameter from about 0.5 nm to about 5000 nm, such as at least about nay any of the following: 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 300, 400, and 500 nm, and/or at most about any of the following: 5000, 4500, 4000, 3500, 3000, 2500, 2000, 1500, 1000, 900, 800, 700, 600, and 500 nm. The nanofiber composites, for example, may comprise continuous fibers, discontinuous fibers (e.g., staple fibers), or a combination thereof. Additionally or alternatively, the nanofiber composite may be an electrospun fiber, a meltspun fiber, or a solution-spun fiber.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The polymeric material of the nanofiber composites may comprise a variety of water absorbing materials, such as those that exhibit water absorption below a lower critical solution temperature and desorb or release absorbed or retained water above the lower critical solution temperature. By way of example, the polymeric material may comprise N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM), a poly(NIPAM), a copolymer including NIPAM, or a polymeric blend including NIPAM and one more additional polymers. In accordance with certain embodiments of the invention, the polymeric material may comprise from about 10% to about 100% by weight of NIPAM, such as at least about any of the following: 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50% by weight of NIPAM, and/or at most about any of the following: 100, 98, 95, 90, 80, 70, 60, and 50% by weight of NIPAM. Additionally or alternatively, the polymeric material may comprise an average molecular weight above a molecular weight of entanglement for the given polymeric material. By way of example only, the polymeric material may have an average molecular weight of at least about 60,000 g/mol, such as at least about any of the following 80,000; 100,000; 150,000; 200,000; 250,000; 300,000; 350,000; 400,000; 500,000; and 600,000 g/mol.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In accordance with certain embodiments of the invention, the nanofiber composite may be formed, as referenced above, from a hydrogel material. For example only, the hydrogel material may be produced from a super water absorbing ionic liquid (e.g., 1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium acetate) copolymerized with, for example, NIPAM. In accordance with certain embodiments of the invention, the hydrogels may be spun (e.g., electrically spun) into nanofibers (e.g., nanofiber composites having one or more MOF materials dispersed throughout) to form fibrous mats or nanofabrics (e.g., consolidated or non-consolidated plurality of nanofiber composites). Although not necessary, in accordance with certain embodiments of the invention, solvent selection in an electro-spinning process of the hydrogels may facilitate or create the formation of surface porosities on the surface of the nanofibers to provide fast water diffusion and desorption of the resulting nanofiber composites. In accordance with certain embodiments of the invention, the nanofiber composites may optionally comprise a highly porous nature. For example, the surface area of the nanofiber composites may include a plurality of pores or pits formed therein.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The nanofiber composites, in accordance with certain embodiments of the invention, may comprise at least one MOF material and/or one or more covalent organic framework (COF). The COFs may comprise two-dimensional or a three-dimensional organic solids with extended structures in which building blocks are linked by strong covalent bonds. The COFs comprise a porous and crystalline structure that may be made entirely from light elements (e.g., H, B, C, N, and O) that may form strong covalent bonds. Similar to the MOFs, the COFs provide frameworks that can be functionalized in a manner similar to those described herein with respect to MOFs. In accordance with certain embodiments of the invention, the disclosure of properties associated with one or more MOFs may also be attributed to one or more COFs. In this regard, certain embodiments of the invention include one or more COFs alone or in combination with one or more MOFs dispersed throughout the continuous phase of the polymeric material of the nanofiber composites. For sake of brevity, it should be appreciated that discussion and disclosure of MOFs in the nanofiber composites and in water harvesting devices are equally applicable one or more COFs being present in the nanofiber composite and/or in water harvesting devices, in accordance with certain embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In accordance with certain embodiments of the invention, the MOF material may comprise an average pore size from 5 angstroms (&#x212b;) to about 300 &#x212b;, such as at least about any of the following: 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 125, 150, 175, and 200 &#x212b;, and/or at most about any of the following: 300, 275, 250, and 200 &#x212b;.

In accordance with certain embodiments of the invention, the surface area may be determined from Brunauer-Emmett-Tellar (BET) model analysis of N<sub>2 </sub>gas adsorption-desorption isotherm at 77K, which is the most common method to describe the accessible surface area that a MOF material has. In this regard, nitrogen gas adsorption isotherms are performed on a QUANTACHROME&#xae; NOVA&#xae; 2200e surface area and porosity analyzer at 77 K. Prior to the tests, all samples are thermally activated overnight at 100&#xb0; C. under 0.01 mmHg. Helium gas is used to measure the dead space volume prior to measurements.
