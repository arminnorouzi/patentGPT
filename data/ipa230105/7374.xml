Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a display apparatus, and more particularly, to a display apparatus that vibrates a display panel to generate sound.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Discussion of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">With the advancement of an information-oriented society, various requirements for the display field of expressing information in accordance with an electrical information signal are increasing. Thus, research is being conducted on various display apparatuses that are thin, light, and have low power consumption. For example, display apparatuses include a liquid crystal display (LCD) apparatus, a field emission display (FED) apparatus, an organic light-emitting display apparatus, etc.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Among the above display apparatus, the LCD apparatus may include an array substrate including a thin film transistor (TFT), an upper substrate including a color filter and/or a black matrix, and a liquid crystal layer between the array substrate and the upper substrate. An alignment state of the liquid crystal layer is controlled based on an electric field applied between two electrodes in a pixel region, whereby light transmittance is adjusted based on the alignment state of the liquid crystal layer, thereby displaying an image.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The organic light-emitting display apparatus, which is a self-light-emitting display apparatus, may have advantages, such as fast response speed, high light-emitting efficiency, high luminance, and a wide viewing angle in comparison with other display apparatuses. Thus, organic light-emitting display apparatuses are attracting much attention.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A display apparatus may display an image, and an additional speaker for supplying sound generally may have to be provided. If the speaker is provided in the display apparatus, the sound generated in the speaker advances toward a lower or rear portion of the display panel, instead of toward a front portion of the display panel. Thus, the sound does not advance toward the front portion of the display panel, i.e., toward a user who watches the image displayed on the display panel, which may be disruptive to a user's immersion experience.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, when the sound generated in the speaker advances toward the lower or rear portion of the display panel, sound quality is deteriorated due to interference with sound reflected on the wall or floor. Furthermore, when the speaker is included in a set apparatus, such as a television (TV), the speaker occupies a space, which may impose a restriction on design and a spatial disposition of the set apparatus is limited.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, the present disclosure is directed to a display apparatus that substantially obviates one or more of the issues due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An aspect of the present disclosure is to provide a display apparatus comprising sound generators that may improve sound quality.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another aspect of the present disclosure is to provide a display apparatus that may improve sound quality and improve a viewer's immersion experience.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Additional features and aspects will be set forth in the description that follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the inventive concepts provided herein. Other features and aspects of the inventive concepts may be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description, or derivable therefrom, and the claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">To achieve these and other aspects of the inventive concepts as embodied and broadly described, there is provided a display apparatus, including: a display panel including: a display area configured to display an image, and a non-display area, an optical module on a rear surface of the display panel, at least one first sound generator on a rear surface of the optical module, and at least one second sound generator in the non-display area and between the display panel and the optical module.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another aspect, there is provided a display apparatus, including: a display panel including: a display area configured to display an image, and a non-display area, a light guide member on a rear surface of the display panel, at least one first sound generator on a rear surface of the light guide member, a supporting member configured to support the display panel, and at least one second sound generator in the non-display area and between the display panel and the light guide member.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another aspect, there is provided a display apparatus, including: a display panel including: a display area configured to display an image, and a non-display area, a sheet portion on a rear surface of the display panel, a light guide member spaced apart from the sheet portion, a supporting member configured to support the display panel, at least one first sound generator between the light guide member and the supporting member, and at least one second sound generator between the display panel and the light guide member.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Other systems, methods, features and advantages will be, or will become, apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description.

Embodiments of the present disclosure may be carried out independently from each other, or may be carried out together in co-dependent relationship.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the present disclosure, examples of a display apparatus is used to encompass a display apparatus such as an organic light-emitting display module (OLED module) or a liquid crystal module (LCM), that may include a display panel and a driving unit for driving the display panel. The display apparatus is used to further encompass a set device (or a set apparatus) or a set electronic apparatus, as a finished product, such as a notebook computer or a laptop computer, a television set, a computer monitor, an equipment apparatus (e.g., display equipment in an automotive apparatus or another type of vehicle apparatus) or a mobile electronic apparatus that is a complete product or a final product (for example, a smartphone or an electronic pad, etc.) that may include the LCM or the OLED module. Therefore, in the present disclosure, the display apparatus is used display apparatus itself, such as the LCM or the OLED module, and also a set apparatus which is a final consumer apparatus or an application product including the LCM or the OLED module.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some example embodiments, the LCM or the OLED module including a display panel and a driving unit thereof may be referred to as a display apparatus, and the electronic apparatus as a final product including the LCM or the OLED module may be referred to as a set apparatus. For example, the display apparatus may include a display panel, such as an LCD or an OLED, and a source printed circuit board (PCB) as a controller for driving the same, the set apparatus may further include a set PCB that is a set controller set to be electrically connected to the source PCB and to control the overall operations of the set apparatus.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">A display panel applied to an embodiment may use all types of display panels, such as a liquid crystal display panel, an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display panel, and an electroluminescent display panel, but is not limited to these specific types. For example, the display panel of the present disclosure may be any panel capable of being vibrated by a sound generation device according to embodiments of the present disclosure to output a sound. A shape or a size of a display panel applied to a display apparatus according to embodiments of the present disclosure is not limited.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">For example, if a display panel is a liquid crystal display panel, the display panel may include a plurality of gate lines, a plurality of data lines, and a plurality of pixels respectively provided in a plurality of pixel areas of the gate lines and the data lines. Also, the display panel may include an array substrate including a thin film transistor (TFT), which is a switching element for adjusting a light transmittance of each of the plurality of pixels, an upper substrate including a color filter and/or a black matrix, and a liquid crystal layer between the array substrate and the upper substrate.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In addition, if a display panel is an organic light-emitting display panel, the display panel may include a plurality of gate lines, a plurality of data lines, and a plurality of pixels respectively provided in a plurality of pixel areas of the gate lines and the data lines. The display panel may include an array substrate including a TFT, which is an element for selectively applying a voltage to each of the pixels, an organic light-emitting device layer on the array substrate, and an encapsulation substrate disposed on the array substrate to cover the organic light-emitting device layer. The encapsulation substrate may protect the TFT and the organic light-emitting device layer from an external impact, and may prevent moisture or oxygen from permeating into the organic light-emitting device layer. A layer provided on the array substrate may include an inorganic light-emitting layer (for example, a nano-sized material layer or the like). The display panel may further include a backing such as a metal plate attached on the rear surface of the display panel, but the backing is not limited to the metal plate, and another structure may be included.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the present disclosure, the display panel including a sound generator may be implemented at a user interface module in a vehicle, such as the central control panel area in an automobile. For example, such a display panel may be configured between two front seat occupants, such that sounds due to a vibration of the display panel propagate towards the interior of the vehicle. As such, the audio experience within a vehicle can be improved as compared to having speakers at the interior sides or edges of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Studies for configuring a sound generator in a display apparatus without configuring a separate speaker in the display apparatus are ongoing. This will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrate a display apparatus according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates a rear surface of the display apparatus, and the display apparatus may include a display panel <b>10</b> for displaying an image and a sound generator <b>20</b> for generating sound by vibrating the display panel <b>10</b>. If the display panel <b>10</b> is a liquid crystal display panel, the display panel <b>10</b> may display an image by using light irradiated from a backlight. To realize a sound in the liquid crystal display panel that is the display panel <b>10</b>, the inventors of this disclosure have recognized that the sound may be generated by vibrating the liquid crystal display panel. Therefore, the inventors of the present disclosure have conducted experiments in which the sound generator is provided between the display panel and the backlight. In this case, the inventors of the present disclosure have recognized a problem that an image cannot be displayed on the display panel because the backlight is at least partially covered by the sound generator. Therefore, a method for configuring a sound generator on a rear surface of the backlight without configuring the sound generator to adjoin the display panel may have been studied. This will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line I-I&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the display apparatus may include a sound generator <b>20</b>, a backlight module <b>90</b>, and a supporting member <b>30</b>. The sound generator <b>20</b> may be on a rear surface of the backlight module <b>90</b>, and may include a coil-type sound generator for generating a sound by means of a current applied to a coil. The inventors of the present disclosure have recognized a problem that a high sound is not generated by the coil-type sound generator <b>20</b>. This will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a sound output characteristic according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a sound output characteristic of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a horizontal axis (x-axis) denotes a frequency in hertz (Hz), and a vertical axis (y-axis) denotes a sound pressure level in decibels (dB).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, it is noted that a sound pressure level is reduced at a range of 2 kHz or more corresponding to a frequency range of a high-pitched sound range. A vibration of a frequency of a high-pitched sound range or less may be transferred to the display panel <b>10</b> through an air layer between the display panel <b>10</b> and the backlight module <b>90</b>. However, the vibration is not transferred to the display panel <b>10</b> by the air layer at a range of 2 kHz or more corresponding to a portion marked with &#x201c;A&#x201d; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, whereby loss of the sound pressure level is generated. If loss of the sound pressure level is generated at the range of 2 kHz or more corresponding to the frequency of a high-pitched sound range, a user may feel that the sound seems to be interrupted or blocked, whereby a problem occurs in that it may be difficult to provide a clear sound quality.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Therefore, the inventors of the present disclosure have conducted experiments being capable of generating a high-pitched sound range. The inventors have recognized that the sound of a high-pitched sound range cannot be generated even when an additional sound generator is configured on the rear surface of the backlight module. Through the various experiments, the inventors have recognized piezoceramics for generating a high-pitched sound. Because the piezoceramics have a fast response speed of several milliseconds (msec), the piezoceramics have an advantage in that a frequency range of vibration is wide. In this case, the piezoceramics may be a piezoelectric element or a piezoelectric sound generator, and may be, but is not limited to, an element having deformation or deformation force if a voltage is applied thereto, for example, piezoelectric effect.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In this respect, the inventors of the present disclosure have conducted several experiments for a piezoelectric type sound generator provided in the display apparatus. The inventors have recognized that it is difficult to generate a high-pitched sound due to several layers constituting the backlight module even though the piezoelectric type sound generator is between the display panel and the backlight module. The inventors have recognized that the sound generator, which should vibrate the display panel to generate high-pitched sound, should be in the display panel. The inventors have recognized, through the experiments, that a sound difference is generated between the display panel and the outside of the display panel, and the sound generator may be outside the display panel. Therefore, the inventors have recognized that the sound generator should be outside the display panel, and not in the area of the display panel, to generate high-pitched sound. Furthermore, it has been found that the sound generator should not be in an area that is formed by several layers. In this respect, the inventors of the present disclosure have invented a new type of display apparatus that may include a sound generator in an area that does not affect an image of the display panel, to generate sound. This new type of display apparatus will be described as follows.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A to <b>3</b>E</figref> illustrate a display apparatus according to another example embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a back view of the display apparatus. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the display apparatus may include a display panel <b>100</b> for displaying an image. The display panel <b>100</b> may include a non-display area NDA and a display area DA. The non-display area NDA may be an area in which an image is not displayed, and may be referred to as a &#x201c;bezel&#x201d; area. The display area DA may be an area where an image is displayed.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The display panel may include a first substrate, a second substrate, and a liquid crystal layer. The first substrate may include a pixel electrode or common electrode for controlling alignment of liquid crystals of the liquid crystal layer, and may include a thin film transistor (TFT) connected with the pixel electrode. The second substrate may include a color filter layer for realizing one or more colors.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The display panel may control light transmittance of the liquid crystal layer by driving the liquid crystal layer in accordance with an electric field formed by data and common voltages applied per pixel, thereby displaying an image. The liquid crystal layer may be driven by various driving modes, such as a twisted nematic (TN) mode, a vertical alignment (VA) mode, an in-plane switching (IPS) mode, a fringe field switching (FFS) mode, etc.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">For example, the first substrate may be a thin film transistor substrate, and may include a plurality of pixels that may be defined by a plurality of gate and data lines crossing each other. Each pixel may include a thin film transistor connected to the gate and data lines, a pixel electrode connected to the thin film transistor, and a common electrode adjoining the pixel electrode, to which a common voltage may be supplied. The common electrode may be on the second substrate in accordance with a driving mode of the liquid crystal layer. A driving circuit portion for driving the display panel and a pad portion connected with the driving circuit portion may be at one side of the first substrate. The second substrate may be a color filter array substrate, and may include a color filter layer. If the display panel is realized in a color filter on TFT (COT) mode or a TFT on color filter (TOC) mode, then the color filter layer may be formed on the first substrate.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">An optical module may be below the display panel, and may irradiate light to the display panel. The display apparatus may display an image on the display panel by controlling transmittance of light emitted from the optical module of the display panel.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The display apparatus may be a display module that may include a display panel and a driving circuit portion for driving the display panel. For example, the driving circuit portion may include an integrated circuit (IC) chip and a flexible printed circuit board (FPCB). The driving circuit portion, such as a driving IC for applying a voltage, may be built in the FPCB. Alternatively, the driving circuit portion may be realized in a chip on film (COF) mode.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The gate and data lines of the display panel may be connected to the flexible circuit board. If an electrical signal is applied from the flexible circuit board, the electrical signal may be transferred to a source electrode and a drain electrode of the thin film transistor. The flexible circuit board may receive an image signal from the outside of the display panel, and may apply a driving signal to each of the gate and data lines of the display panel.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The flexible circuit board may generate gate and data signals for driving the display panel, and a plurality of timing signals for applying the gate and data signals at a proper timing, and may apply the gate and data signals to the gate and data lines of the display panel. An amplifier may be included in the flexible circuit board.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">A polarizing member may be on the upper surfaces of the first and second substrates. A cover window may be on the display module. The cover window may be attached to an entire surface of the display module or to an entire surface of the polarizing member.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">As described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the sound generator may be in the non-display area NDA to generate a high-pitched sound. The non-display area NDA may be a bezel area. A display apparatus, which may widen a size of a display area where an image may be displayed by narrowing the bezel area, may have been developed. For example, the non-display area NDA may be a very narrow area having a width of about 5 mm or less and a thickness of about 1.8 mm or less. The width and thickness are not limited to these examples, and may be varied depending on design of the display apparatus.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">If the coil-type sound generator is in the non-display area, the coil-type sound generator may have a width of about 20 mm, and there may be a spatial restriction in arranging the coil-type sound generator in the non-display area. If the coil-type sound generator is in the non-display area, because the thickness of the non-display area becomes thicker, the bezel area may be increased, whereby a problem occurs in that the thickness of the display apparatus becomes thicker.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In this respect, the inventors of the present disclosure have conducted several experiments for the sound generator that may be in the non-display area, while not increasing the bezel area, and may generate a high-pitched sound. The inventors have recognized, through the several experiments, that the piezoelectric type sound generator may be in the non-display area to generate a high-pitched sound. The inventors have recognized that difficulty in generating a high-pitched sound due to several layers may be solved because the non-display area is an area that is not formed by several layers. This will be described as follows.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, at least one first sound generator <b>1200</b>, which may be at least one coil type sound generator, is in the display area DA, and a second sound generator <b>800</b>, which may be at least one piezoelectric type sound generator, may be in the non-display area NDA. The first sound generator <b>1200</b> may include two or more sound generators, but the number of sound generators is not limited to this number. The second sound generator <b>800</b> may be provided as one or as a plurality.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The second sound generator <b>800</b> may not affect an image of the display panel to generate a high-pitched sound, and may be in the non-display area NDA corresponding to the outside of the display panel. Because the at least one second sound generator <b>800</b> is able to be thin, it may be advantageous in that the second sound generator <b>800</b> may not increase the width of the non-display area NDA.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The second sound generator <b>800</b> may generate sound by using the non-display area NDA or the bezel area as a vibration plate. Therefore, because the second sound generator <b>800</b> may be anywhere in the display area NDA, a degree of freedom for arrangement of the second sound generator <b>800</b> may be improved. Further, because the second sound generator <b>800</b> is not in the display area having an optical module, etc., a sound path may not be blocked by the optical module, whereby sound quality may be improved.

Therefore, the sheet portion and the light guide member may be spaced apart from each other, and a problem of difficulty in process or an increase of the manufacturing cost may be solved. When the second sound generator <b>800</b> is provided, a sound of a high-pitched sound range may be improved. Because the second sound generator <b>800</b> is in the non-display area, the bezel area may not be increased, and a sound pressure level in a frequency domain of a high-pitched sound range may be improved.
