The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some instances, a customer is to receive a service from an agent of an organization during an in-person interaction. For example, the service may have certain characteristics that require a level of security that can only be provided while the customer is at a location of the organization (e.g., because the organization only allows performance of the service in the presence of the customer). In such a case, the agent may provide the service to the customer while the customer and the agent are at the location of the organization, such as at a branch location, a headquarters, and/or other type of physical location that facilitates in-person customer service interactions. The customer may have an account with the organization that is used to receive the service. For example, the account may be a transaction account of a financial institution and/or a membership account of a retail institution. Accordingly, during an in-person interaction, the agent may access the account via an application on an agent device to perform the service for the customer. For example, the customer may provide account information and/or identification information (e.g., a name, an account number, and/or the like) that enables the agent to access the account via the application in order to perform the service.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">However, if the agent is a malicious actor and/or has a desire to engage in fraudulent activity involving the customer's account, the agent can relatively easily receive access to the customer's account information in order to commit fraud from within the organization. More specifically, the agent may keep the customer's account information and/or the agent may perform one or more fraudulent actions during the in-person interaction. In some instances, a monitoring system at the location of the organization and/or within the agent device may be utilized to monitor for and/or detect such fraudulent activity. However, if the fraudulent activity is performed during an in-person interaction with a customer, the fraudulent activity may be presumed to be authorized by the customer, and/or go undetected until certain negative effects of the fraudulent activity cannot be mitigated (e.g., without dedicating relatively large amounts of resources toward mitigating the fraudulent activity).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">To prevent such fraudulent activity, the application and/or the agent device may perform one or more customer authentication processes prior to allowing certain services to be performed via the account using one or more authentication devices. For example, the application may prompt the agent to request the customer to enter a password via the authentication device and/or enable a feature of the customer to be scanned for a biometric analysis via the authentication device. However, such authentication devices and/or authentication processes may be ineffective in preventing fraud because the customer is typically unaware that the agent is performing a fraudulent activity involving the customer's account (e.g., because the customer cannot see a display of the agent device and/or is unfamiliar with the user interface of the application). Furthermore, such authentication devices and/or authentication processes may degrade the customer experience (e.g., because the customer may need to repeatedly perform the authentication processes using the authentication devices for each service and/or for multiple steps of receiving the service).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Some implementations described herein enable, for an in-person interaction between a user (e.g., a customer) and an agent, access to a function of an application based on a characteristic of a user device (e.g., a device associated with the user). For example, the user device may be configured to only allow access to the function of the application (e.g. a user-side version of the application) based on a verification that the user is in-person with an agent. The function may be associated with a service that is to be received by the user and/or performed by the agent via an agent device (e.g., using an agent-side version of the application).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As described herein, the user device may be configured to generate an optical code that can be scanned by an agent device from an output component of the user device (e.g., to verify that the user and the agent are in-person) and receive a notification that the agent device has authenticated the user via the optical code, thereby receiving notice that the user is with the agent (e.g., because the optical code cannot be remotely scanned by the agent device). Based on receiving the notification, the user device may enable the user to access the function to permit the user to request that the agent and/or the agent device perform a service associated with the function via an application session between the user device and the agent device. In some implementations, the agent device is configured to only provide the service based on a request from the user device involving the function. In this way, the user device and/or the agent device may provide enhanced security over previous systems, by ensuring that an authenticated user specifically requested that a service be performed via the application session.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Furthermore, some implementations described herein provide a system that activates or maintains an application session of the application between the user device and the agent device for an in-person interaction between the user and the agent. For example, based on the authentication of the user via the user device and the agent device using the optical code (e.g., to verify that the user and the agent are in-person) and a status of the application session, the system may facilitate the application session between the agent device and the user device to enable a service for an in-person interaction between the user and the agent to be performed via the user device and the agent device. The system may determine and/or monitor the status based on a characteristic of the user device and/or a characteristic of the agent device, such as the user device and/or agent device being at the location of the in-person interaction, the user device being in communication with the agent device, and/or the user device being within a distance threshold of the agent device, among other examples.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In this way, a user device and/or a system may be configured to authenticate a user for an in-person interaction with an agent to permit the agent to perform a service for the user via an application session involving the user device and an agent device of the agent. The user device and/or the system provide enhanced security of in-person interactions over previous techniques based on an in-person authentication of the user device using the agent device and by ensuring that a service that is to be performed by an agent was specifically requested by the user via an established application session between the user device and the agent device.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>E</figref> are diagrams of an example implementation <b>100</b> associated with enabling a function of an application based on a characteristic of a user device. Example implementation <b>100</b> includes a user device associated with a user (User A), an agent device associated with an agent (Agent B), a server device. These devices are described in more detail below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. As described below, example implementation <b>100</b> may involve an in-person interaction between the user and the agent at a service location (Location <b>1</b>) associated with a service provider. The agent may be a representative (e.g., a customer service representative, a manager, and/or an executive) of the service provider, and the service provider may be any entity (e.g., individual or organization) that is configured to provide a service to the user. Accordingly, the agent may be authorized, via the agent device, to perform one or more agent-side operations on behalf of the service provider to provide the service to the user, as described herein. The in-person interaction may involve the user receiving the service of the service provider from the agent. In some implementations, the user may receive the service from the agent at the location via an application session that is established according to one or more examples described herein.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Although example implementation <b>100</b> is described in connection with a service associated with a transaction (e.g., a transaction involving a financial institution) or an agent being a representative of a financial institution (e.g., a bank and/or a credit union), one or more examples described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>E</figref> may similarly apply to other types of services and/or other types of institutions (e.g., shopping or retail services associated with a retail business, storage or inventory services associated with a logistics business, shipping or delivery services associated with a transportation business, among other examples).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, and by reference number <b>105</b>, the user arrives at a service location. For example, the user may arrive at a location of the service provider (e.g., a branch location, a headquarters, and/or other type of physical location associated with the service provider) to receive a service from the service provider (e.g., via the agent). The service may be designated for performance by the service provider only when the user is at a location associated with the service provider (e.g., due to security requirements associated with the service).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The agent may be capable of providing a service at the service location (e.g., within the service location and/or within a threshold distance of the service location) via the agent device. The agent device may include any suitable device for providing a service, such as a user device, a point of sale terminal, and/or a kiosk device, among other examples. The agent device may include an agent-side version of an application. The application may be associated with the service provider and/or configured to enable interactions with customers of the service provider (e.g., via user-side versions of the application on devices of the customers). Accordingly, the agent may log into the application on the agent device (e.g., using credentials associated with the agent). The agent may, via the application, indicate that the agent and/or agent device are available to provide the service at the service location. Additionally, or alternatively, the agent device may automatically determine a location of the agent and/or agent device (e.g., using a location sensor of the agent device, a network connection and/or corresponding location of a network device of the network, and/or the like) and/or determine that the agent and/or the agent device are located at the service location. In this way, the agent device and/or the agent may be associated with the service location to permit the agent to provide a service to the user via an in-person interaction at the service location, as described elsewhere herein.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, and by reference number <b>110</b>, the user device generates an optical code. The optical code may include an optical code that is configured to be scanned from an output component of the user device via a scanner (or image capture device, such as a camera) of the agent device. For example, the optical code may include a one-dimensional barcode (e.g., a parallel line code), a two-dimensional barcode (e.g., quick response (QR) code), and/or an animated or dynamic code. Accordingly, the optical code may be used to verify, once the optical code is scanned by the agent device, that the user and the agent are engaging in an in-person interaction.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The user may be a customer of the service provider. Correspondingly, the user device may include a user-side version of the application. Accordingly, the user may request or instruct the user device to generate the optical code upon arrival at the service location. For example, the user may provide a user input that is associated with creating an application session at the service location via the user device. Additionally, or alternatively, the user may request the user device to generate the optical code based on or in association with indicating, to one or more agents at the location, that the user is at the service location and/or that the user is in line to receive a service via an in-person interaction at the service location. Accordingly, the optical code may be generated to initiate or facilitate an application session of the application that involves the user device. In this way, the user device may generate the optical code in association with activating an application session of the application.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The user device may generate the optical code using a code generator. The code generator may be associated with the application and/or utilize any suitable encryption technique to generate the optical code. The code generator may be locally installed on the user device. Additionally, or alternatively, the code generator may be associated with and/or installed on the server device or another system. In such a case, the user device may request the server device and/or the other system to generate the optical code and receive the optical code from the system. In some implementations, the optical code may be generated based on information associated with the user and/or the user device. For example, such information may include a user identifier (e.g., a user name, an identification number), account information associated with an account of the application (e.g., an account number of an account associated with the service provider and/or user credentials associated with the account and user), a location of the user device (e.g., as indicated by a location sensor of the user device), a network connection of the user device (e.g., a connection to a local area network of the service location), a device identifier, and/or a time associated with the user device generating the optical code. Accordingly, the optical code may be generated as a unique code that is configured specifically for an in-person interaction involving the user at the service location.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, and by reference number <b>115</b>, the user device provides the optical code and/or session information to the server device. For example, the user device, to initiate an application session, may transmit the optical code to the server device to permit the server device to host an application session involving the user device. Additionally, or alternatively, the user device may provide session information associated with an application session, to prompt the server device to open an application session for the user device. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the session information may include an identifier of the user, location information associated with the user device (e.g., an identifier of the service location), and/or a timestamp associated with the optical code and/or a request to initiate the application session. Additionally, or alternatively, the session information may include a session identifier (Session ID) that is generated in association with the optical code.

For example, the server device may open the application session by creating an application session for the user device and/or enabling the user device to join the application session. The server device may be configured to host the application session by facilitating communication between the user device and the agent device (e.g., after the agent device indicates authentication of the user via the optical code). In some implementations, the server device may open the application for a threshold period of time that is based on the generation of the optical code and/or that is based on receiving the session information. For example, the server device may be configured to open and/or maintain the session for a certain duration (e.g., ten minutes, twenty minutes, an hour, or the like) before closing the application session and/or before a timeout occurs. In this way, application sessions that are opened, but never utilized, can timeout and/or be closed. Furthermore, maintaining the application for the threshold period of time may improve security by ensuring that the user that requested the application session via the user device is a same user (e.g., because another user is less likely to gain access to the user device within the threshold time period, relative to the application session remaining open longer than the threshold time period).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some implementations, the service provider may provide various types of in-person services at different locations.

For example, the server device may look-up (e.g., in a mapping or database) which in-person services are available at the service location. In this way, the server device can configure the application session to enable the user to request the available in-person services via in-person functions of the user-side version of the application on the user device and/or may enable the agent to provide one or more of the in-person services via the agent-side version of the application on the agent device.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, and by reference number <b>125</b>, the user device facilitates a scan of the optical code.

More specifically, the authentication request may include and/or identify the session identifier, a user identifier, and/or account information associated with the user to indicate, to the server device, that the agent device has authenticated the user via a scan of the optical code. In some implementations, the agent device may send an authentication request that includes code data and/or an image of the optical code (e.g., to permit the server device to decode the optical code and/or verify that the agent and the user are engaged in an in-person interaction).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, and by reference number <b>140</b>, the server device enables access to the application session.

Additionally, or alternatively, the agent device may maintain the application session based on a communication link with the user device and/or received communications from the user device. For example, the agent device may maintain the application session while an active communication link (e.g., via the application session, the server device, and/or a peer-to-peer link) exists between the agent device and the user device.
