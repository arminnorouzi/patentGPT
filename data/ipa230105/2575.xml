Thus, the polyimide film is being used in a wide range of technologies such as heat-resistant advanced material such as automobile materials, aviation materials, and spacecraft materials, and electronic materials such as insulation coating agents, insulating films, semiconductors, and electrode protective films of TFT-LCD, and recently, the polyimide film is drawing attention as a material for replacing expensive tempered glass used for a cover window of a portable electronic instruments and communication equipment.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The cover window of a portable electronic instrument and communication equipment is for protecting electronic components such as a printed wiring board and a lead frame of a semiconductor integrated circuit, and should have insulation at or above a certain level.

In addition, since generally a coating layer is laminated on a substrate for imparting various physical properties, diffuse reflection of light is caused on a cover window and optical stain occurs to deteriorate visibility, and thus, optical properties such as high display quality and having no mura phenomenon are required.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An embodiment is directed to providing a composition for forming a polyimide film for a cover window which may satisfy performance required for an advanced cover window, and a method for preparing the same.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Specifically, an embodiment is directed to providing a composition for forming a polyimide film for a cover window, for providing a polyimide film for a cover window which may implement an improved yellow index and may have an anti-reflection effect in a wide viewing angle to significantly decrease a mura phenomenon, and a method for preparing the same.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another embodiment is directed to providing a polyimide film for a cover window which has excellent optical properties such as no optical stain and excellent visibility without degradation of colorless and transparent optical properties and has excellent heat resistance and mechanical properties to be used as an optical use of a display device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another embodiment is directed to providing a multilayer structure including the polyimide film.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another embodiment is directed to providing a cover window for a display device including the polyimide film.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Still another embodiment is directed to providing a flexible display device including the polyimide film or the cover window.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one general aspect, a composition for forming a polyimide film for a cover window includes: a polyamic acid or a polyimide including a structural unit derived from a dianhydride and a structural unit derived from a diamine; and a mixed solvent of an amide-based solvent and a hydrocarbon-based solvent, the hydrocarbon-based solvent being included at 10 to 40 wt % with respect to a total weight of the mixed solvent.

In addition, it is not intended to limit the protection scope defined in the claims.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0033">In addition, technical terms and scientific terms used in the present specification have the general meaning understood by a person skilled in the art unless otherwise defined, and description for the known function and configuration obscuring the present invention will be omitted in the following description.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0034">Throughout the present specification, unless explicitly described to the contrary, &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; any constituent elements will be understood to imply further inclusion of other constituent elements rather than the exclusion of any other constituent elements.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0035">Hereinafter, unless otherwise defined in the present specification, it will be understood that when a part such as a layer, a film, a thin film, a region, or a plate is referred to as being &#x201c;on&#x201d; or &#x201c;above&#x201d; another part, it may include not only the case of being &#x201c;directly on&#x201d; the other part but also the case of having an intervening part therebetween.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0036">Hereinafter, unless otherwise defined in the present specification, a &#x201c;combination thereof&#x201d; refers to a mixture or copolymerization of constituents.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0037">Hereinafter, unless otherwise particularly defined in the present specification, the term &#x201c;A and/or B&#x201d; may refer to an embodiment including both A and B or an embodiment selecting one of A and B.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0038">Hereinafter, unless otherwise particularly defined in the present specification, a &#x201c;polymer&#x201d; refers to a molecule which has a relatively high molecular weight and the structure may include multiple repetition of a unit derived from a low molecular weight molecule. In an embodiment, the polymer may be an alternating copolymer, a block copolymer, a random copolymer, a branched copolymer, a crosslinked copolymer, or a copolymer including all of them (for example, a copolymer including more than one monomer). In another embodiment, the polymer may be a homopolymer (for example, a copolymer including one monomer).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0039">Hereinafter, unless otherwise particularly defined in the present specification, a &#x201c;polyamic acid&#x201d; refers to a polymer including a structural unit having an amic acid moiety, and a &#x201c;polyimide&#x201d; may refer to a polymer including a structural unit having an imide moiety.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040">Hereinafter, unless otherwise particularly defined in the present specification, a polyimide film may be a film including a polyimide, specifically, a highly heat-resistant film manufactured by solution polymerization of a dianhydride compound and a diamine compound or a diisocyanate compound to prepare a polyamic acid, which is then cyclized and dehydrated at a high temperature to be imidized.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">Hereinafter, unless otherwise particularly defined in the present specification, a &#x201c;mura phenomenon&#x201d; may be interpreted as including all distortion phenomena by light which may be caused at a certain angle. For example, distortion by light, such as a black out phenomenon in which a screen looks black, a hot spot phenomenon, or a rainbow phenomenon having an iridescent stain in a display device including a polyimide film may be included.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">Conventionally, there have been many attempts to combine or change monomers having various structures for increasing optical properties and mechanical properties while imparting functionality to a polyimide film. However, mechanical properties and optical properties are in a trade-off relationship with each other, and the attempts were bound to produce extremely general results of decreased functionality or deteriorated optical properties even with better mechanical properties. Thus, a new attempt to impart all of excellent mechanical properties, functionality, and optical properties is needed.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">The composition for forming a polyimide film according to an implementation (hereinafter, also referred to as a polyimide film forming composition) may provide a polyimide film having all of improved optical properties, functionality, and mechanical properties, by applying a non-polar solvent which may not be used as a polymerization solvent of a polyamic acid (hereinafter, also referred to as a polyimide precursor) and/or polyimide and has no compatibility with polyimide. Specifically, the composition for forming a polyimide film according to an implementation may provide a polyimide film which has an improved yellow index while having adhesion equal to or higher than a conventional optical adhesive film, and has significantly reduced distortion by light. Accordingly, the polyimide film manufactured from the polyimide film forming composition according to an implementation may be applied to a new substrate material or cover window material which may be applied to a foldable or flexible display device, and the polyimide film may have excellent visibility to minimize the user's eyestrain.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">The composition for forming a polyimide film according to an implementation may include a polyamic acid and/or a polyimide; a polar solvent; and a non-polar solvent. The polar solvent may be a hydrophilic solvent, for example, may have compatibility with a polyamic acid and/or polyimide, and for example, may be an amide-based solvent. In addition, the non-polar solvent may have little compatibility with a polyamic acid and/or polyimide, and for example, may be a hydrocarbon-based solvent.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">Without being bound to a specific theory, by using a mixed solvent of an amide-based solvent and a hydrocarbon-based solvent, an intermolecular interaction between polymers and/or an interaction between a polymer and a solvent may be effectively inhibited, and intermolecular packing density during curing may be significantly decreased, so that both excellent optical properties and mechanical properties to be desired may be improved.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">Thus, the composition for forming a polyimide film according to an implementation may represent intermolecular behavior and interaction which are different from those of a mixed solution in a step of polymerizing a polyamic acid. For example, when in the step of polymerizing a polyamic acid, the hydrocarbon-based solvent is included, it acts as a factor inhibiting polymerization, so that a high molecular weight polyamic acid may not be obtained. However, in the composition for forming a polyimide film according to an implementation, after obtaining a sufficient amount of high molecular weight polyamic acid and/or polyimide, the polyamic acid and/or the polyimide is/are mixed with the hydrocarbon-based solvent, thereby acting as a catalyst which weakens an intermolecular interaction between polymers and/or a strong interaction between a polymer and a solvent and obtaining desired optical properties in later curing.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">A composition for forming a polyimide film for a cover window according to an implementation may include: a polyamic acid or a polyimide including a structural unit derived from a dianhydride and a structural unit derived from a diamine; and a mixed solvent of an amide-based solvent and a hydrocarbon-based solvent, the hydrocarbon-based solvent being included at 10 to 40 wt % with respect to a total weight of the mixed solvent. The structural unit derived from a dianhydride may include a structural unit derived from a compound represented by the following Chemical Formula 1 and a compound represented by the following Chemical Formula 2, and the structural unit derived from a diamine may include a structural unit derived from a compound represented by the following Chemical Formula 3 and a compound represented by the following Chemical Formula 4. Accordingly, a polyimide film for a cover window having improved optical properties by inhibiting a packing density and being made amorphous:</p><p id="p-0050" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-C00003" he="153.75mm" wi="73.32mm" file="US20230002576A1-20230105-C00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0051" num="0048">As described above, since the composition for forming a polyimide film for a cover window according to an implementation uses a mixed solvent of an amide-based solvent and a hydrocarbon-based solvent, specifically, a sufficient amount of high molecular weight polyamic acid and/or polyimide is obtained, and then the crystallinity of polyamic acid and/or polyimide in the solution is adjusted by adding the hydrocarbon-based solvent, thereby improving both excellent optical physical properties and mechanical properties. Here, by using the amide-based solvent and the hydrocarbon-based solvent sequentially, an interaction between the polyamic acid and/or the polyimide acid which is a polyimide precursor and/or the polyimide may be adjusted to a more appropriate range. Here, the adjustment may refer to inhibition.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0049">The amide-based solvent refers to a compound including an amide moiety. The amide-based solvent may be an aromatic or an aliphatic, and for example, may be an aliphatic. In addition, for example, the amide-based solvent may be a cyclic compound or a chain compound, and specifically, may have 2 to 15 carbon atoms, and for example, 3 to 10 carbon atoms.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0050">The amide-based solvent may include a N,N-dialkylamide moiety, and the dialkyl groups may be present independently or be fused with each other to form a ring, or at least one alkyl group of the dialkyl groups is fused with other substituents in the molecule to form a ring, and for example, at least one alkyl group of the dialkyl groups may be fused with an alkyl group connected to carbonyl carbon of an amide moiety to form a ring. Here, the ring may be 4-membered to 7-membered rings, for example, 5-membered to 7-membered rings, and for example, a 5-membered or 6-membered ring.

A non-limiting example thereof may include knife coating, dip coating, roll coating, slot die coating, lip die coating, slide coating, curtain coating, and the like, and the same or different kind of application may be successively applied once or more thereto, of course.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0111">The substrate may be used without limitation as long as it is commonly used in the art, and a non-limiting example thereof includes glass; stainless steel; plastic films such as polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene naphthalate, polypropylene, polyethylene, cellulose triacetate, cellulose diacetate, poly(meth)acrylic acid alkyl ester, poly(meth)acrylic acid ester copolymer, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl alcohol, polycarbonate, polystyrene, cellophane, polyvinylidene chloride copolymer, polyamide, polyimide, vinyl chloride/vinyl acetate copolymer, polytetrafluoroethylene, and polytrifluoroethylene, or the like.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0112">The method for manufacturing a polyimide film for a cover window according to an implementation may further include a standing step of applying the composition for forming a polyimide film for a cover window on the substrate, and then allowing it to stand at normal temperature, if necessary. The optical properties on the film surface may be maintained more stable by the standing step. Without being bound to a certain theory, when a conventional composition for forming a polyimide film for a cover window is subjected to the standing step as such before curing, the solvent absorbs moisture in the air, and the moisture diffuses inside and collides with the polyamic acid and/or the polyimide to cause cloudiness from the film surface and to cause agglomeration, thereby causing coating unevenness. However, the composition for forming a polyimide film for a cover window according to an implementation has no cloudiness and agglomeration even when it is left in the air for a long time, and may secure a film having improved optical properties.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0113">The standing step may be performed at normal temperature and/or in a high humidity condition. Here, the normal temperature may be 40&#xb0; C. or lower, for example, 30&#xb0; C. or lower, for example, 25&#xb0; C. or lower, more specifically, 15&#xb0; C. to 25&#xb0; C., and for example, 20 to 25&#xb0; C. In addition, high humidity may be a relative humidity of 50% or more, for example, 60% or more, for example, 70% or more, and for example, 80% or more.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0114">The standing step may be performed for 1 minute to 3 hours, for example, for 10 minutes to 2 hours, and for example, for 20 minutes to 1 hour.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0115">In the method for manufacturing a polyimide film for a cover window according to an implementation, the polyimide film for a cover window may be manufactured by mixing the polyamic acid solution with one or two or more additives selected from a flame retardant, an adhesive strength improver, inorganic particles, an anti-oxidant, a UV blocking agent, a plasticizer, and the like.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0116">Hereinafter, an example will be described for describing an implementation in detail, but the present invention is not limited to the following examples.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0117">In the following experimentation, the physical properties were measured as follows.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0118">&#x3c;Yellow Index (YI)&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0122" num="0119">A yellow index was measured using a spectrophotometer (Nippon Denshoku, COH-5500) in accordance with the specification of ASTM E313.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">EXAMPLE 1</heading><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Preparation of Composition For Forming Polyimide Film For Cover Window (TFMB (0.9)/DDS (0.1)/BPAF (0.7)/6FDA (0.3))</heading><p id="p-0123" num="0120">An agitator in which a nitrogen stream flowed was filled with 284.5 g of N,N-dimethylpropionamide (DMPA), and 26.9 g of 2,2&#x2032;-bistrifluoromethylbenzidine (2,2&#x2032;-bis(trifluoromethyl)-4,4&#x2032;-biphenyl diamine, TFMB) and 2.32 g of 4,4&#x2032;-diaminodiphenyl sulfone (DDS) were dissolved therein while the temperature of the reactor was maintained at 25&#xb0; C. 30 g of 9,9-bis(3,4-dicarboxyphenyl)fluorene dianhydride (BPAF) and 12.45 g of 2,2-bis-(3,4-dicarboxyphenyl) hexafluoropropane dianhydride (6FDA) were added thereto at 25&#xb0; C., and dissolution and reaction were performed while stirring the solution for 6 hours.
