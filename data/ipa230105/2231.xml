id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure generally relates to methods for the preparation of graphene oxide (GO). More particularly, the present disclosure relates to methods for preparing GO directly from graphene.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The presence of functional groups attached to graphene is known to extend the functionality of this unique two-dimensional (2D) material. GO is an important form of functionalized graphene that disperses in water and other polar solvents. Because of the presence of oxygenated groups, such as carboxyl, hydroxyl, and epoxy, GO can be further functionalized with various organic molecules, making it a versatile chemical functionalization platform with extensive potential for a wide range of important applications, such as water treatment, energy storage, environment, and medicine.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition to the chemical synthesis, the choice of the carbon source used as the starting material plays an important role in the final quality of GO. More specifically, different types of graphite and the reaction conditions can lead to significant modifications in the physical and chemical properties of GO, such as the lateral size of the flake, the number of layers, and disorder. As a result, the final properties of GO are sensitive to the materials and methods of production. The properties of the thus prepared GO enable specific applications. For example, highly oxidized GO flakes with sub-micrometer size are of great interest for biomedical applications, whereas larger GO flakes with lower degrees of oxidation are commonly used in nanocomposites.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Hummers' method is the most widely used approach for preparing GO, and involves the oxidation of graphite using potassium permanganate (KMnO<sub>4</sub>) and sodium nitrate (NaNO<sub>3</sub>), in concentrated sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) solution. Despite its popularity, Hummers' method presents several drawbacks, including long reaction times for oxidation, up to hundreds of hours, and the formation of toxic gasses such as nitrogen dioxide/dinitrogen tetroxide (NO<sub>2</sub>/N204) due to the presence of NaNO<sub>3 </sub>as an intercalant agent. Additionally, Hummer's method not only uses large amounts of concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>and KMnO<sub>4 </sub>to ensure satisfactory oxidation of graphite flakes, but also huge amounts of water are required to remove excess ions after oxidation to guarantee highest degree of purity of the sample. As a result, the process is costly, laborious, energy intensive, generates large amounts of waste, and presents safety and health concerns. Moreover, since the oxidation is not homogeneous&#x2014;because various oxygenated groups are chemically bonded throughout the GO surface, it is extremely difficult to control the degree of oxidation, and some residual graphite is still left unless long periods of sonication are used, to produce just a few layers GO.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Numerous strategies have been developed to address the issues mentioned above. For example, to reduce the oxidation time, stronger oxidizing agents, such as potassium ferrite (K<sub>2</sub>FeO<sub>4</sub>) or electrochemistry approaches have been used. Other strategies exclude the usage of NaNO<sub>3 </sub>in order to avoid the formation of toxic gasses, and to facilitate the disposal of waste due to the absence of Na<sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> ions. However, the elimination of NaNO<sub>3 </sub>usually requires compensatory strategies to maintain the efficiency of Hummers' method. Increasing the amounts of KMnO<sub>4 </sub>and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and the introduction of new components, such as phosphoric acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) to the reaction, or conducting reactions at elevated temperatures (as high as 90&#xb0; C. and above) have also been developed to address the shortcomings of Hummers' method.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is thus a need for improved methods for preparing GO that overcome at least some of the challenges discussed above.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure relates to a rapid and more economic method of preparing GO with a highly controllable degree of oxidation. As described in greater detail below, graphene flakes can be used instead of graphite as the starting material to produce GO with micrometer lateral dimensions and high oxidation degree. The higher surface area of unstacked graphene sheets in comparison with pilled layers of graphite, favors accelerated oxidation reactions, considerably reducing the overall reaction rate. Also, as NaNO<sub>3 </sub>is not required to assist in increasing the interlayer distance among graphene layers in graphite, and therefore the methods described herein are safer and more ecofriendly than conventional modified Hummers' method.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates the method to produce GO where the starting material is graphene flakes instead of graphite flakes as prescribed in the conventional modified Hummers method.

Thus, in certain embodiments, the solution does not comprise a nitrate salt or nitric acid.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Due to the use of graphene, the oxidation quickly proceeds at room temperature or lower. In certain embodiments, the step of contacting the graphene and the oxidant is conducted at a temperature between 2-25&#xb0; C. In certain embodiments, the graphene and the oxidant are contacted at a lower temperature and the reaction is then allowed to warm to the room temperature as the reaction progresses. For example, the graphene and the oxidant can be contacted at a temperature of between 2-4&#xb0; C. and the reaction can then be allowed to warm to 20-25&#xb0; C. In certain embodiments, the step of contacting the graphene and the oxidant occurs at 20-25&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The amount of time the graphene and the oxidant are allowed to remain in contact can depend on desired oxidation state of GO, the choice of reagents and stoichiometry, solvent, number of layers present in the graphene, and reaction temperature, but is typically between 1 minute to 24 hours. In certain embodiments, the graphene and the oxidant are allowed to remain in contact between 5 minutes and 3 hours.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The degree of oxidation of the GO can be adjusted by varying the concentration of graphene in the reaction. More particularly, if the concentration of the graphene is increased, a smaller extension of the basal plane of the graphene would be exposed to oxidizing agents, yielding GO with a lower degree of oxidation. Alternatively, for lower concentrations of graphene, the flakes can have greater mobility in the solvent, such that the oxidizing agents may reach a larger extension of the basal plane of the graphene yielding GO with a higher degree of oxidation. In this sense, the basal plane or the edges of graphene flakes may be adjustably oxidized on demand.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In certain embodiments, method described herein further includes isolating the GO. Isolating the GO may take place by, for example, centrifugation or filtration. In certain embodiments, the methods further include washing the GO after isolating the graphene oxide. For example, in certain embodiments, the GO is washed with one or more portions of a solvent including hydrochloric acid, water, alcohols, or combinations thereof to remove impurities.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In certain embodiments, the methods described herein further comprise the step of reducing the GO to yield reduced or partially reduced graphene oxide.

In contrast, the amount of epoxy (C&#x2014;O) groups quickly increases within the first 30 minutes of the reaction and continues to slowly increase as shown by data collected at 24 hours.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The method described herein can produce GO having an oxidation state in terms of C:O molar ratio between 5:1 to 2:1. In certain embodiments, the method described herein can be produce GO having an oxidation state of in terms of C:O molar ratio of 2:1 or less.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Given that the method described herein utilizes graphene as a starting material, the method does not require the addition of nitric acid or nitrate salts or a sonication step in order to achieve high yields of GO. In certain embodiments, the solution does not contain a nitrate salt, such as sodium nitrate or nitric acid. In certain embodiments, the method does not comprise the use of sonication and/or further comprise a sonication step.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The evolution of the increase of oxygenated groups in the graphene structure as a function of the oxidation time is demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref>. After deconvolution of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra, five main peaks are identified: 284.8 eV (C=C), 285.7 eV (C&#x2014;C), 287.7 eV (C&#x2014;O), 288.8 eV (C=O) and 289.8 (O&#x2014;C=0). After only 5 minutes of oxidation, one can observe a significant relative increase in the oxygen-based groups, indicating that the process of oxidation of graphene sheets is efficient and extremely fast due to the exposure of a higher surface area of graphene. Although not as pronounced, by further increasing the oxidation time, these oxygen-based functional groups continue to increase. However, it is noteworthy that most of the oxidation process occurs in the first minutes (or even shorter time scale) of reaction.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The thickness and lateral size of GO obtained from atomic force microscopy (AFM) images do not change significantly after 5 minutes of reaction, which indicates that most of the modifications occur very quickly, beyond the limit of observation due to restrictions of the experimental setup conditions.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Looking closer at the spectra and comparing the percentages shown in Table 1, changes in the relative quantity of each group are also of note. For example, the ratio between O&#x2014;C=0 and C&#x2014;O groups is greater after 24 hours when compared to 5 minutes, indicating that, after longer periods of oxidation, the graphene structure is saturated with epoxy groups. Comparing the XPS C1s C&#x2014;O peak position with first principles calculations, it is estimated that the C:0 ratio is close to 2:1.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b </i></figref>shows the evolution of the FTIR spectra for graphene and GO obtained directly from graphene as a function of the oxidation time. For GO, the spectra are typical for this oxygenated functionalized graphene structure, in which the resonances around 1054, 1260 and 1418 cm&#x2032; are attributed to the C&#x2014;OH (alkoxy) stretching, C&#x2014;O (epoxy) stretching and O&#x2014;H (hydroxyl) deformation vibrations, respectively. These are compared with first principle calculations, which find C&#x2014;OH bending modes at 1089-1095 cm&#x2032;, the epoxy symmetric stretch at 1254 cm&#x2032;, and C&#x2014;OH hydrogen wag mode at 1509 cm&#x2032;, which may be in the origin of the resonance observed at 1418 cm&#x2032;. The carboxylic acid group appears at 1733 cm&#x2032; with the carbonyl (C=0) stretching, calculated to lie at 1691 cm&#x2032;. The peak at 1620 cm&#x2032; is usually attributed to the non-oxidized domains in the graphene structure, but it can also contain contributions of the adsorbed water molecules. From first-principle calculations, it is found that the hydroxyl at the flake edge also has two modes in this region, calculated to lie at 1596 and 1615 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. These modes are very close in frequency with a graphene vibrational mode and therefore have significant localization in the carbon atoms as well (Table 3).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Specifically, the contribution of the OH from the water molecules has been pointed out at 3200 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and the band at 1620 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>increase with the oxidation time as it has been previously reported. As one can observe, the increase of oxygen-related bands is pronounced after only 5 minutes of oxidation. The relative intensity of the groups' changes is also in agreement with the XPS results.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">As expected, after the oxidation, the degree of disorder of graphene backbone is higher and corroborates the higher relative intensity of the D band a broader G band in the Raman spectra (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). After 5 minutes of oxidation, a significant difference in the relative intensities, FWHM and I<sub>D</sub>/I<sub>G </sub>of the D and G GO modes can be observed (Table 2).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">As the oxidation time increases, a slight increase in the I<sub>D</sub>/I<sub>G </sub>ratio is observed. The 2D band at &#x2dc;2683 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>is related to the number of layers of graphene and their relative orientations. The graphene spectrum is typical for few-layer graphene and this is expected due the sample preparation (dispersion in IPA and drop cast on Si/SiO<sub>2 </sub>substrate), which can result in aggregation. After the oxidation, the sharp 2D band at &#x2dc;2683 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>disappears, and some broad features between 2600 and 3000 cm&#x2032;, typical for GO, can be observed. The SEM images (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) demonstrate the morphology of the structures do not change significantly from 5 minutes to 24 hours of oxidation reaction. Indeed, since graphene has a higher surface area compared to graphite, so that the use of sonication to complete the exfoliation process is not necessary and the structure is preserved from the beginning to the end of the synthesis (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">However, as expected, GO from graphite presents larger sheets (lateral size) when compared to GO from graphene, since the graphene sheets used in this study have small lateral size of the order of 1 &#x3bc;m (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). Importantly, as graphene layers are already unstacked before oxidation, the method disclosed herein advantageously does not require sonication to further separate stacked layers after the introduction of oxygenated functional groups, which prevent extra fractures and defects on the GO structure. Consequently, the original lateral size of graphene flakes is preserved even for highly oxidized structures, as indicated in the size distribution analysis (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The method described herein enables the synthesis of graphene oxide with a controllable degree of oxidation. The route consists of an environmentally friendly modified Hummers method, in which the carbon source is graphene, and not graphite flakes as in the standard processes. For this reason, nitric intercalant agents such as NaNO<sub>3 </sub>and HNO<sub>3 </sub>that are commonly used to expand the graphite structure and provide greater interlayer distance between the sheets, are not required, and, consequently, toxic gasses, such as NO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>are not generated, diminishing several safety and health concerns.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In addition, as graphene has a comparatively larger surface area per volume, the oxygenated groups are rapidly and homogeneously distributed over the graphene lattice, eliminating steps of sonication to further separate the layers. Consequently, the reaction time is reduced by orders of magnitude when compared with conventional methods.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">This application opens up new avenues to explore environmentally friendly production routes as well as novel mild oxidation approaches to expand industrial applicability of GO, such as chemical sensors, solar cells, nanocomposite materials, energy storage, and biomedical applications.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Examples</heading><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Synthesis of Graphene Oxide Obtained Directly from Graphene</heading><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Graphene flakes were supplied by 2D Materials Pte.

Next, 2.25 g of KMnO<sub>4 </sub>were slowly added to the suspension.

To stop the oxidation, 2 mL of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) was added to the system, leading to a color change in the dispersion from purple to yellowish.

current 100 pA was used. For Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), the aqueous suspensions of GO were freeze dried, prepared by KBr disc method and the spectra were obtained in a Bruker equipment. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out in a Bruker Dimension Icon Microscope operated in ScanAsyst tapping mode and scan lines of 512 under ambient conditions. Confocal Raman spectroscopy was performed in a WITec Alpha 300R, with excitation wavelength of 532 nm and a 100x objective.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Computational Methods</heading><p id="p-0091" num="0088">The main different functional groups present in graphene oxide were modelled and their vibrational frequencies from first-principles calculated, for comparison with the FTIR absorption bands. First-principles calculations were based on the framework of DFT, as implemented in Quantum ESPRESSO v. 6.5, with the PBE exchange and correlation functional. Ultra-soft pseudo-potentials were used for carbon and oxygen, while a norm-conserving Troullier-Martins pseudo-potential was used for hydrogen. A plane wave basis set with kinetic energy cutoffs of 40 Ry was employed for the wave functions. The Brillouin zone was sampled using a &#x393;-centered 6&#xd7;6&#xd7;1 Monkhorst-Pack (MP) grid for all calculations. A supercell periodicity of 20 Angstrom in the direction perpendicular to the monolayer was used to avoid spurious interactions between replicas. Both supercell and flake models were used, and the vibrational modes for different functional groups were obtained by diagonalizing the dynamical matrix for a select number of neighboring atoms. The calculated vibration modes of the various functional groups in GO are summarized in Table 3.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00003" num="00003"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 3</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Calculated local vibrational modes (LVMs) of oxygen and hydrogen</entry></row><row><entry>functional groups in graphene.
