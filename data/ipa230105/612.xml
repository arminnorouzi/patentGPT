Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure belongs to the field of medical devices and is specifically relates to a covered stent.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In an existing covered stent, a section of the small wave ring with a smaller wire diameter and a smaller wave height than the wave ring of the main body is provided at its ends in order to ensure increased adherence of its ends to a vessel, and increase in sealing performance after implantation of the covered stent, such that the covered stent will not form type I endoleaks due to the gap between an end of the covered stent and a vessel wall after implantation. However, if a stainless steel sheath or a relatively complicated winding method is used to fix the head of the wire, the relatively small diameter of the wire of the small wave ring is likely to cause a breakage or damage of the braided wire, especially of the metal wire, thus resulting in poor fatigue resistance of the covered stent. Therefore, after the completion of the manufacture of the small wave ring, the wire heads are often simply wound around the wire rod, such that the wave ring forms a stable closed ring structure. However, the simply wound wire heads can easily become loose after the stent is compressed and released, and the loose wire heads can easily tilt upwards, which can cause breakage of the covering film and destroy the stability of the covering film, such that type IV endoleak is easily produced due to the excessive pore size after implantation of the covered stent. In addition, the tilting wire heads can easily catch the covering film on the opposite side, making the deployment of the bare stent incomplete after the implantation of the covered stent (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), resulting in type I endoleak after implantation, and even resulting in displacement of the covered stent under the impact of blood flow, thereby affecting the therapeutic effect of the device, which may even require the doctor to perform other means of intervention during the surgery, causing an increase in surgical risk and the cost burden for patients.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In view of problems above, it is an objective of the present disclosure to solve at least the problem of easily loosened wire heads of the first wave ring in the prior art. The objective is achieved through the following technical solution:</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a covered stent including a first wave ring provided on at least one end of the covered stent, wherein the first wave ring is formed of braided wires by means of braiding, each of the braided wires has wire heads and a wire rod, with the wire heads being located at two ends of the wire rod; and the wire heads of the braided wire are wound around the adjacent wire rod; and the covered stent further includes limiting units, with each of the limiting units being arranged on the wire head and the wire rod adjacent to the wire head, and the limiting unit limiting the range of axial and/or radial movement of the wire head relative to the wire rod.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the limiting unit includes a strip structure provided on the wire head and the wire rod adjacent to the wire head in a spirally wound manner.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the strip structure is made of hot-melt material and is bonded to the wire rod and the wire head by means of heat treatment.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, a plurality of spiral sections is formed after the strip structure is spirally wound around the wire head and the wire rod, wherein at least one spiral section covers an end of the wire head, and the spacing between two spiral sections closest to the end of the wire head is less than the diameter of the wire rod.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the limiting unit includes at least two first projections provided on the wire head and at least one second projection provided on the wire rod adjacent to the wire head, with the second projection being located between the two adjacent first projections; or the limiting unit includes at least one first projection provided on the wire head and at least two second projections provided on the wire rod adjacent to the wire head, with the first projection being located between the two adjacent second projections.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the spacing between the two adjacent first projections is greater than or equal to the length of the second projection and less than or equal to 1.5 times the length of the second projection; and/or the spacing between the two adjacent second projections is greater than or equal to the length of the first projection and less than or equal to 1.5 times the length of the first projection.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the limiting unit includes a structure formed by successively winding a strip material on the wire head and the wire rod in a staggered manner.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, a contact surface between the braided wire and the limiting unit is provided with bumps or dimples, or the contact surface is roughened.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the covered stent further includes a covering unit covering at least an end of the wire head.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The advantages of the present disclosure are that:</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present disclosure provides a covered stent, of which a first wave ring is formed of braided wires by means of braiding, and heads of a braided wire are wound around an adjacent wire rod, and the covered stent also has a limiting unit, which limits the range of axial and/or radial movement of the wire head relative to the wire rod along the wire head. Since the axial movement of the wire heads relative to the wire rods along the wire heads is limited, the wire heads which are wound around the wire rods are not prone to becoming loose, which can enhance the structural stability of the first wave ring and is also conducive to preventing the wire heads from tilting upwardly, thereby protecting the covering film to a certain extent.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The drawings are only for purposes of illustrating the preferred implementations and are not to be construed as limiting the present disclosure.

As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a/an&#x201d;, &#x201c;one&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; may also include plural forms, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

The method steps, processes, and operations described herein are not to be construed as necessarily requiring them to be executed in the particular order described or illustrated, unless the order of execution is explicitly indicated. It should also be understood that additional or alternative steps may be used.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Although the terms first, second, third, etc. may be used herein to describe a plurality of elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms may be used solely to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. The terms such as &#x201c;first&#x201d;, &#x201c;second&#x201d;, and other numerical terms are not used to imply an order or sequence herein unless it is clearly indicated in the context. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the example implementations.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">To facilitate description, spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;inside&#x201d;, &#x201c;outside&#x201d;, &#x201c;medial&#x201d;, &#x201c;lateral&#x201d;, &#x201c;under&#x201d;, &#x201c;below&#x201d;, &#x201c;over&#x201d;, &#x201c;above&#x201d;, may be used herein to describe the relationship of an element or feature relative to another element or feature as illustrated.

Specifically, the wave rings include a first wave ring <b>20</b> provided on at least one end of the covered stent <b>100</b> and a second wave ring <b>30</b> arranged at intervals along the length of the covered stent <b>100</b>, and the first wave ring <b>20</b> is the one closest to the end of the covering film connected to the covering film <b>10</b> on the covered stent <b>100</b>; i.e., if the first wave ring is provided on the proximal end of the covered stent, no other wave rings will be provided on the proximal end of the first wave ring. The first wave ring <b>20</b> of the embodiment includes a double-layer W-shaped wave ring, and the &#x201c;amplitude&#x201d; of the first wave ring <b>20</b> is less than that of the second wave ring <b>30</b>, and the wire diameter of the braided wires of the first wave ring <b>20</b> is also less than that of the second wave ring <b>30</b>. Further, the covering film <b>10</b> may be a material having good biocompatibility, such as PET (Polyethylene terephthalate) material, PTFE (Polytetrafluoroethylene) material, etc.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">It should be understood that, in the present disclosure, the second wave ring is larger than the first wave ring in both wire diameter and amplitude, such that the first wave ring is softer than the second wave ring, and the first wave ring is provided on the end of the covered stent mainly in order to improve the adherence performance of the end of the covered stent, and to prevent the occurrence of endoleak.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">It will be appreciated that in other embodiments, the first wave ring may be provided with one ring or may be provided with multiple rings (i.e., a plurality of first wave rings that are axially arranged); similarly, the first wave ring may be provided with a multi-layer W-shaped wave ring.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the first wave ring <b>20</b> of this embodiment is formed by braiding a single braided wire including wire heads <b>21</b> and a wire rod <b>22</b>, and the wire heads <b>21</b> of the braided wire are wound around the wire rod <b>22</b> adjacent to the wire heads <b>21</b>. It will be appreciated that in other embodiments, the first wave ring may be formed by interweaving two braided wires, in which case the ends of the braided wires may be wound around the wire rods in the same manner as in this embodiment.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the covered stent <b>100</b> further includes a limiting unit <b>40</b>, and each of the limiting unit <b>40</b> is provided on the wire head <b>21</b> of the braided wire and the wire rod <b>22</b> adjacent to the wire head, and the limiting unit <b>40</b> limits the range of axial and radial movement of the wire head <b>21</b> relative to the wire rod <b>22</b>. Since the movement of the wire heads <b>21</b> relative to the wire rods <b>22</b> along the wire heads is limited, the wire heads <b>21</b> wound around the wire rods <b>22</b> are not prone to becoming loose, which can enhance the structural stability of the first wave ring and is also conducive to preventing the wire heads <b>21</b> from tilting upwardly, thereby protecting the covering film <b>10</b> to a certain extent.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further, each of the limiting unit <b>40</b> may be a strip structure, which fixes the wire head <b>21</b> with the wire rod <b>22</b> in a spirally wound manner, and under the spiral winding of the strip component, the wire head <b>21</b> and the wire rod <b>22</b> are in close contact and exert pressure on each other, so that when the wire head <b>21</b> experiences a movement relative to the wire rod <b>22</b>, the wire head <b>21</b> will be simultaneously subjected to a double friction of both the limiting unit <b>40</b> and the wire rod <b>22</b>, such that its axial and radial movement cannot easily occur, thereby preventing the wire head <b>21</b> from becoming loose.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">And further, the strip component may be made of hot-melt material having a good biocompatibility, such as PTFE, and the strip structure made of the hot-melt material is bonded to the wire rod <b>22</b> and the wire head <b>21</b> by means of heat treatment, thereby further reinforcing the wire head <b>21</b> and the wire rod <b>22</b> to ensure that the wire head <b>21</b> does not move axially and radially relative to the wire rod <b>22</b>, which further eliminates the possibility of the wire head <b>21</b> becoming loose.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Still further, the limiting unit <b>40</b> is spirally wound around the wire head <b>21</b> and the wire rod <b>22</b> to form a plurality of spiral sections, wherein one spiral section covers an end of the wire head <b>21</b>, thereby preventing the end of the wire head <b>21</b> from moving in a direction away from the wire rod <b>22</b>, which may result in the end tilting upwardly; thus, the limiting unit prevents the wire head from breaking the covering film <b>10</b>. In addition, in the process of spirally winding the strip structure, the winding is denser at a position closer to the end of the wire head <b>21</b>; i.e., the spacing between the spiral sections becomes smaller. In order to further ensure that the end of the wire head <b>21</b> will not be exposed from the gap between the spiral sections, the spacing L<b>1</b> between the first spiral section and the second spiral section can be made less than the spacing L<b>2</b> between the second spiral section and the third spiral section, and L<b>2</b> can be made less than the diameter D of the wire rod <b>22</b> (i.e., the wire diameter of the braided wire), such that exposure of the end of the wire head <b>21</b> can be strictly avoided.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Embodiment 2</heading><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, another embodiment of the present disclosure provides a covered stent, which is substantially the same as the one in the first embodiment except for the structure of the limiting unit <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows the structure of a first wave ring of the embodiment when wire heads are not wound, and specifically, the limiting unit <b>40</b> includes a plurality of first projections <b>41</b> provided on the wire head <b>21</b> at intervals and a plurality of second projections <b>42</b> provided on the wire rod <b>22</b> at intervals. The first projections <b>41</b> and the second projections <b>42</b> are staggered along the longitudinal direction of the braided wire such that the first projections <b>41</b> and the second projections <b>42</b> can abut against each other when the wire head <b>21</b> has a tendency to move axially along the wire head relative to the wire rod <b>22</b>, thereby increasing the frictional force between the wire head <b>21</b> and the wire rod <b>22</b>, thus avoiding the wire head <b>21</b> moving axially, and further preventing the loosening of the wire head <b>21</b>; the relative positions of the first projections <b>41</b> and the second projections <b>42</b> after winding the wire head and the wire rod can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">It will be appreciated that the present disclosure is not limited to a specific number of the first projections and the second projections, but it should meet the requirement that both ends of at least one of the first projections can be blocked by the second projections. Or both ends of at least one of the second projections can be blocked by the first projections. In other words, the limiting unit includes at least two first projections fixed on the wire head at intervals and at least one second projection fixed on the wire rod adjacent to the wire head, wherein the at least one second projection is located between the two first projections; or the limiting unit includes at least one first projection fixed on the wire head at intervals and at least two second projections fixed on the wire rod adjacent to the wire head, wherein the at least one first projection is located between the two second projections.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">It should be understood that the limiting unit <b>40</b> of the embodiment is provided only on the portion of the braided wire close to the wire head and on the wire rod adjacent to the portion, and need not be provided for all the wire portions where the wire head and the wire rod are wound.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Further, the limiting unit <b>40</b> of the embodiment may have a cylindrical structure, and end surfaces of the cylindrical structure may be relatively easily abutted against each other, thereby serving to increase frictional force between the wire head <b>21</b> and the wire rod <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Further, the spacing L<b>3</b> between two adjacent first projections <b>41</b> is greater than or equal to the length <b>12</b> of the second projection <b>42</b> which refers to the dimension of the second projection <b>42</b> in axial direction of the wire rod, and less than or equal to 1.5 times the length <b>12</b> of the second projection <b>42</b>. If the spacing between the first projections <b>41</b> is too small, the first projections <b>41</b> and the second projections <b>42</b> can only partially abut against or cannot abut against each other, which may prevent the friction between the wire head <b>21</b> and the wire rod <b>22</b> from being increased; instead, if the spacing between the first projections <b>41</b> is too large, when the first wave ring <b>20</b> is subjected to a force, the first projections <b>41</b> will move axially along with the wire head <b>21</b> by a certain distance, so as to abut against the second projections <b>42</b>, thereby increasing the frictional force between the wire head <b>21</b> and the wire rod <b>22</b>, but at this time, the wire head <b>21</b> may have already damaged the covering film <b>10</b> or the covered stent <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Similarly, the spacing L<b>4</b> between two adjacent second projections <b>42</b> is greater than or equal to the length <b>11</b> of the first projection <b>41</b> which refers to the dimension of the first projection <b>41</b> in axial direction of the wire head, and less than or equal to 1.5 times the length <b>11</b> of the first projection <b>41</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Further, the limiting units <b>40</b> of the embodiment are formed by winding a soft material (e.g. PTFE) on the braiding. Since the surface friction of the soft material is relatively high, it is advantageous to increase the frictional force between the wire heads <b>21</b> and the wire rods <b>22</b>. In addition, it is also advantageous to reduce wear between the first projections <b>41</b> and the second projections <b>42</b>. Specifically, the soft material will play a buffering role when the first projections <b>41</b> and the second projections <b>42</b> are brought into contact with each other, and therefore it is possible to prevent wear-out failure due to the material being excessively hard, and it can also improve the service life of the first projections <b>41</b> and the second projections <b>42</b>. It will be appreciated that in other embodiments the limiting units may be made of other materials having a lower stiffness than the braided wires, such as PET. And further, the soft material may be fixed to the braided wires by heat treatment.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Still further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, bumps or dimples are formed on the contact surfaces of the braided wires and the limiting unit <b>40</b> to increase frictional force. Specifically, especially when the first wave ring <b>20</b> is made of metal wires, it is difficult to fix the first projections <b>41</b> when they are disposed on the surface of the metal wires, and the frictional force and the connecting force between the metal wires and the first projections <b>41</b> are small, such that the first projections <b>41</b> are easily displaced from the wire heads <b>21</b>, thereby causing the limiting function to fail. For this reason, bumps or dimples are provided on the contact surfaces of the wire heads <b>21</b> and the first projections <b>41</b>, thereby increasing the contact area between the metal wires and the first projections <b>41</b>, and increasing the frictional force and the connecting force therebetween, to prevent the first projections <b>41</b> from being displaced relative to the wire heads <b>21</b>. Similarly, the contact surfaces of the wire rods <b>22</b> and the second projections <b>42</b> are also provided with bumps or dimples for increasing the frictional force, thereby increasing the contact area between the wire rods <b>22</b> and the second projections <b>42</b>, and increasing the frictional force and connecting force therebetween, to prevent the second projections <b>42</b> from being displaced relative to the wire rods <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In other implementations, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, roughening may also be applied to the surfaces of the braided wires to increase the friction between the braided wires and the first projections <b>41</b> and/or the second projections <b>42</b>. Specifically, the length L<b>5</b> of a surface-treated portion of the braided wire should be less than the length of the corresponding first projections <b>41</b> or the length <b>12</b> of the corresponding second projections <b>42</b>. If the length of the surface-treated portion of the braided wire is too small, the frictional force and the connecting force are not increased, and if the length of the surface-treated portion is too large, a portion of the treated braided wire will be easily exposed, thereby resulting in a decrease in strength and corrosion resistance of the exposed portion, and further reducing the service life of the first wave ring <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>-<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, in other embodiments, the covered stent further includes a covering unit <b>50</b> covering at least an end of the wire head <b>21</b>. Since the covering unit <b>50</b> covers the end of the wire head <b>21</b>, even if the wire head <b>21</b> moves to some extent in the axial or radial direction of the wire head, the end of the wire head <b>21</b> can be prevented from breaking the covering film and from catching the covering film, thereby protecting the covering film and the covered stent.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some specific implementations, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the covering unit <b>50</b> completely covers the area where wire heads <b>21</b> and wire rods <b>22</b> are wound, thereby limiting the range of movement of the wire heads <b>21</b> in the radial direction of the wire rods. The covering unit <b>50</b> may be made of a material having pores smaller than the wire diameter of the braided wire as well as good biocompatibility and fracture-resistance, so as to prevent the ends of the wire heads <b>21</b> from penetrating out of the gaps of the covering unit <b>50</b> or bursting the covering unit <b>50</b>, which may damage the covering film <b>10</b>. In addition, the spacing L<b>6</b> between the edge of the covering unit <b>50</b> and the wire heads <b>21</b> and the spacing L<b>7</b> between the edge of the covering unit <b>50</b> and the wave crest and wave trough of the first wave ring <b>20</b> need to be greater than 0.5 times the wire diameter of the braided wire, such that the covering unit <b>50</b> can cooperate with the fixing structure <b>40</b> to provide a certain axial movement space for the wire heads <b>21</b>, and prevent the wire heads <b>21</b> of the first wave ring <b>20</b> from being tightly bound, which may, after the covered stent <b>100</b> is assembled and compressed, cause stress concentration of the first wave ring <b>20</b>, and then produce micro-cracks affecting the fatigue resistance performance of the first wave ring <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The covering unit <b>50</b> of the embodiment may be fixed on the first wave ring <b>20</b> by heat treatment or may be fixed on the covering film by suture. When suture is adopted, the suture area of the covering unit <b>50</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. The running direction of the suture needle shall be parallel to the axis of the covered stent, and the suture spacing (the distance between two suture points between visible suture lines outside of the covered stent) L<b>8</b> shall be less than the wire diameter of the braided wire, so as to avoid other components of the covered stent from hanging on the suture line of the covering unit <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In other specific implementations, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the covering unit <b>50</b> covers only the end of the wire head <b>21</b>. Since the covered stent is assembled into a delivery sheath before it is delivered to the lesion site of the patient, in order to prevent the covering unit <b>50</b> from affecting the diameter of the delivery sheath required for the assembly of the covered stent (making the diameter of the delivery sheath larger), the covering unit <b>50</b> is disposed only at the end of the wire head <b>21</b>. Specifically, it is also possible to make the distance L<b>9</b> between the edge of the covering unit <b>50</b> and the wire head <b>21</b> greater than or equal to 0.5 times the wire diameter of the braided wire, thereby ensuring that the covering unit <b>50</b> completely covers the end of the wire head <b>21</b> and providing a certain movement space for the wire head <b>21</b> to prevent the stress concentration of the first wave ring <b>20</b> after the covered stent is assembled and compressed due to over-tightening, which may result in a decrease in the fatigue resistance strength of the first wave ring <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In addition, the covering unit <b>50</b> may also be a part of the covering film, and specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, a protrusion segment <b>11</b> may be integrally provided on the covering film <b>10</b>. When the first wave ring <b>20</b> is fixed on the covering film <b>10</b>, the wire head <b>21</b> of the first wave ring <b>20</b> has to be placed in the area covered by the protrusion segment <b>11</b>, and then the protrusion segment <b>11</b> is folded to ensure that the protrusion segment <b>11</b> can completely cover the wire end <b>21</b> or the area where the wire end <b>21</b> and the wire rod <b>22</b> are wound. Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the protrusion segment <b>11</b> for covering the wire head <b>21</b> may be cut independently during the process of manufacturing the covering film <b>10</b>, and since the protrusion segment <b>11</b> has one side connected with the covering film <b>10</b>, there are relatively fewer sides required to be fastened later, thereby reducing the difficulty and time of disposing the covering unit <b>50</b>.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Embodiment 3</heading><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, another embodiment of the present disclosure provides a covered stent, which is substantially the same as the one in the second embodiment except for the structure of the limiting unit <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Specifically, the limiting unit <b>40</b> is a structure formed by successively winding a strip material on the wire head <b>21</b> and the wire rod <b>22</b> in a staggered manner, and the structure is formed by winding the strip material from the beginning to the end, thereby saving time for disposing the limiting unit <b>40</b> and improving disposal efficiency. Also, since the limiting unit <b>40</b> is formed by winding a strip material on the wire head <b>21</b> and the wire rod <b>22</b> successively in a staggered manner, the limiting unit <b>40</b> connects the wire head <b>21</b> and the wire rod <b>22</b> together, thereby limiting the distance between the wire head <b>21</b> and the wire rod <b>22</b>, thus limiting the range of radial movement of the wire head <b>21</b>, facilitating disposal of the smaller limiting unit <b>40</b>, and therefore reducing the diameter of the covered stent <b>100</b> assembled into the sheath.
