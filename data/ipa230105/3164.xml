In this industry, a solution is needed, which is compatible with the layout and the spaces available in the engine compartments of already circulating vehicles. In particular, a relatively compact solution is needed, which has dimensions that can be compared with the spaces already available in the vehicle for the installation of an already existing four-stroke engine, so as to be able to replace this engine with a split-cycle engine in order to improve performances and/or reduce consumptions and polluting emissions, but also limiting, at the same time, the changes to be made to other components of the engine compartment and, more in general, limiting the costs arising from this vehicle installation.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, a split-cycle engine is needed, which can be manufactured by using, as much as possible, the technologies and the knowledge that are already normally used for manufacturing normal four-stroke engines for vehicles and by modifying the different devices, accessories, ducts, components, etc. of the engine itself as little as possible.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, the object of the invention is to provide a split-cycle internal combustion engine, which fulfils the needs discussed above in a simple and economic manner.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the invention, there is provided a split-cycle internal combustion engine as defined in claim <b>1</b>.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The invention will be best understood upon perusal of the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment, which is provided by way of non-limiting example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram showing an engine system provided with a split-cycle internal combustion engine according to the preferred embodiment of the invention;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows, in perspective and with parts removed for greater clarity, the split-cycle engine shown in the diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> are a rear view and a side view, respectively, showing, in a simplified manner and with schematic parts, the split-cycle engine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> are cross sections according to the section lines V-V and VI-VI, respectively, of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">With reference to what is schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, reference number <b>1</b> indicates an engine system designed to be installed in an engine compartment of a vehicle (not shown), in particular a motor vehicle or an agricultural machinery, for driving the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The system <b>1</b> comprises a split-cycle internal combustion engine <b>2</b>; a line <b>3</b> to feed air to the engine <b>2</b>; a line <b>4</b> to convey exhaust gases from the engine <b>2</b> towards an exhaust system or an after-treatment system (not shown); and an injection system <b>5</b> to fed fuel into the engine <b>2</b>.

In particular, the heat exchanger <b>55</b> is arranged downstream of the turbine <b>7</b> and receives air from the compressor <b>12</b> through a proper distributor <b>56</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The heat exchanger <b>55</b> is also called &#x201c;recuperator&#x201d;, as it recuperates energy from the exhaust gases in order to allow the air mass introduced into the expansion cylinders <b>16</b><i>b </i>to reach a higher temperature.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In particular, according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the heat exchanger <b>55</b> is arranged above the cylinder head <b>50</b><i>a </i>and, more in particular, in a position beside the cylinder head <b>50</b><i>b </i>parallel to the direction <b>44</b>. The heat exchanger <b>55</b> is preferably fixed to the sole cylinder head <b>50</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Owing to the above, the advantages of the engine <b>2</b> and of the system <b>1</b> are evident to a person skilled in the art. In particular, the fact of separating and spacing the shaft <b>23</b><i>a </i>of the compressor <b>12</b> from the drive shaft <b>23</b><i>b </i>allows for a greater freedom in the design of the components of the compression section <b>10</b><i>a </i>and for the possibility of cooling the compressor <b>12</b> in a dedicated manner, independently of the expansion cylinders <b>16</b><i>b. </i>More in detail, the fact of placing the compression section <b>10</b><i>a </i>beside the expansion section <b>10</b><i>b </i>along the direction <b>44</b> and the fact of using an inclined, &#x201c;V&#x201d;-shaped configuration between axes <b>42</b><i>a </i>and <b>42</b><i>b </i>leads to an extremely compact solution, with dimensions that are compatible with the spaces available in the engine compartments of the automotive industry, and&#x2014;at the same time&#x2014;allows manufacturers to use technologies and/or production lines that are similar to the ones already used to manufacture current internal combustion engines.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">For example, some preliminary studies were carried out concerning a split-cycle engine having six expansion cylinders, obtained starting from an already existing four-stroke Diesel engine with six cylinders (with a displacement of approximately 9 litres), and assuming that the six expansion cylinders (<b>16</b><i>b</i>) of the split-cycle engine are the same (in terms of dimensions, positions, structure, etc.) as the six cylinders of said four-stroke engine; the latter was modified so as to simply integrate the compression section <b>10</b><i>a </i>beside the six existing cylinders. In particular, a reciprocating volumetric compressor was used with a 150 kW power and a displacement of three litres. With the layout according to the invention it is possible to obtain a power and a torque that are similar to the ones of a &#x201c;traditional&#x201d; Diesel internal combustion engine with a displacement that is 35% greater than the one of the engine that was modified, but with consumptions, a weight, dimensions and/or emissions that are advantageous.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The changes are relatively simple and there are only a few of them to be made. At the same time, in order to manufacture the split-cycle engine, the same, already used production lines can be used.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As far as the other features described above are concerned, the arrangement of the axes <b>42</b><i>a </i>and <b>42</b><i>b </i>helps optimize dimensions; the rear arrangement of the transmission <b>48</b> allows torsional vibrations to be limited; and the fact of manufacturing the engine block <b>43</b> as one single piece allows the portion <b>43</b><i>a </i>to be manufactured in one single operation together with the portion <b>43</b><i>b, </i>by means of the same casting technologies that are normally used to manufacture engine blocks. Furthermore, the arrangement of the compression section <b>10</b><i>a </i>beside the expansion section <b>10</b><i>b </i>allows the heat exchanger <b>55</b> to be placed in an advantageous position, which keeps the layout of the entire system <b>1</b> compact.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Owing to the above, it is evident that engine <b>2</b> can be subjected to changes and variants, without for this reason going beyond the scope of protection set forth in the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The transmission <b>48</b>, which transfers the motion to the shaft <b>23</b><i>a, </i>could be different from the one shown herein, for example it could comprise a chain transmission or a toothed belt transmission if the compressor <b>12</b> is arranged in the area of the front end of the engine <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The system <b>1</b> could have a system to inject a liquid substance into the chambers <b>19</b><i>a </i>of the compressor <b>12</b>; in this way, during the compression, this substance evaporates and absorbs heat thanks to the phase change, so that it prevents the air temperature from exceeding its boiling temperature.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
