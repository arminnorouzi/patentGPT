There are four FGFR proteins (FGFR1-4) that are capable of binding ligands and are involved in the regulation of many physiological processes including tissue development, angiogenesis, wound healing, and metabolic regulation. Upon ligand binding, the receptors undergo dimerization and phosphorylation leading to stimulation of the protein kinase activity and recruitment of many intracellular docking proteins. These interactions facilitate the activation of an array of intracellular signaling pathways including Ras-MAPK, AKT-PI3K, and phospholipase C that are important for cellular growth, proliferation and survival (Reviewed in Eswarakumar et al. Cytokine &#x26; Growth Factor Reviews, 2005, 16, 139-149). Aberrant activation of this pathway either through overexpression of FGF ligands or FGFR or activating mutations in the FGFRs can lead to tumor development, progression, and resistance to conventional cancer therapies. In human cancer, genetic alterations including gene amplification, chromosomal translocations and somatic mutations that lead to ligand-independent receptor activation have been described (Reviewed in Knights and Cook, Pharmacology &#x26; Therapeutics, 2010, 125, 105-117; Turner and Grose, Nature Reviews Cancer, 2010, 10, 116-129). Large scale DNA sequencing of thousands of tumor samples has revealed that FGFR genes are altered in many cancers (Helsten et al. Clin Cancer Res. 2016, 22, 259-267). Some of these activating mutations are identical to germline mutations that lead to skeletal dysplasia syndromes (Gallo et al. Cytokine &#x26; Growth Factor Reviews 2015, 26, 425-449). Mechanisms that lead to aberrant ligand-dependent signaling in human disease include overexpression of FGFs and changes in FGFR splicing that lead to receptors with more promiscuous ligand binding abilities. Therefore, development of inhibitors targeting FGFR may be useful in the clinical treatment of diseases that have elevated FGF or FGFR activity.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">The cancer types in which FGF/FGFRs are implicated include, but are not limited to: carcinomas (e.g., bladder, breast, colorectal, endometrial, gastric, head and neck, kidney, lung, ovarian, prostate); hematopoietic malignancies (e.g., multiple myeloma, acute myelogenous leukemia, and myeloproliferative neoplasms); and other neoplasms (e.g., glioblastoma and sarcomas). In addition to a role in oncogenic neoplasms, FGFR activation has also been implicated in skeletal and chondrocyte disorders including, but not limited to, achrondroplasia and craniosynostosis syndromes.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">There is a continuing need for the development of new drugs for the treatment of cancer, and the FGFR inhibitors described herein help address this need.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0006">The present disclosure is directed to compounds having Formula I:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="35.98mm" wi="59.94mm" file="US20230002384A1-20230105-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0010" num="0000">or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein constituent variables are defined herein.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0007">The present disclosure is further directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0008">The present disclosure is further directed to methods of inhibiting an FGFR enzyme (e.g., an FGFR3 enzyme) comprising contacting the enzyme with a compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0009">The present disclosure is further directed to a method of treating a disease associated with abnormal activity or expression of an FGFR enzyme (e.g., an FGFR3 enzyme), comprising administering a compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, to a patient in need thereof.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0010">The present disclosure is further directed to compounds of Formula (I) for use in treating a disease associated with abnormal activity or expression of an FGFR enzyme (e.g., an FGFR3 enzyme).

Accordingly, the present invention includes FGFR binding assays that contain such labeled or substituted compounds.</p><p id="p-0298" num="0311">The present disclosure further includes isotopically-labeled compounds of the disclosure. An &#x201c;isotopically&#x201d; or &#x201c;radio-labeled&#x201d; compound is a compound of the disclosure where one or more atoms are replaced or substituted by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number typically found in nature (i.e., naturally occurring). Suitable radionuclides that may be incorporated in compounds of the present disclosure include but are not limited to <sup>2</sup>H (also written as D for deuterium), <sup>3</sup>H (also written as T for tritium), <sup>11</sup>C, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>14</sup>C, <sup>13</sup>N, <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>15</sup>O, <sup>17</sup>O, <sup>18</sup>O, <sup>18</sup>F, <sup>35</sup>S, <sup>36</sup>Cl, <sup>82</sup>Br, <sup>75</sup>Br, <sup>76</sup>Br, <sup>77</sup>Br, <sup>123</sup>I, <sup>124</sup>I, <sup>125</sup>I and <sup>131</sup>I. For example, one or more hydrogen atoms in a compound of the present disclosure can be replaced by deuterium atoms (e.g., one or more hydrogen atoms of a C<sub>1-6 </sub>alkyl group of Formula (I) can be optionally substituted with deuterium atoms, such as &#x2014;CD<sub>3 </sub>being substituted for &#x2014;CH<sub>3</sub>).

In some embodiments, the compound includes 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 1-5, or 1-6 deuterium atoms.

For example, a newly synthesized or identified compound (i.e., test compound) which is labeled can be evaluated for its ability to bind an FGFR3 protein by monitoring its concentration variation when contacting with the FGFR3, through tracking of the labeling. For example, a test compound (labeled) can be evaluated for its ability to reduce binding of another compound which is known to bind to a FGFR3 protein (i.e., standard compound). Accordingly, the ability of a test compound to compete with the standard compound for binding to the FGFR3 protein directly correlates to its binding affinity. Conversely, in some other screening assays, the standard compound is labeled and test compounds are unlabeled. Accordingly, the concentration of the labeled standard compound is monitored in order to evaluate the competition between the standard compound and the test compound, and the relative binding affinity of the test compound is thus ascertained.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">Kits</heading><p id="p-0306" num="0319">The present invention also includes pharmaceutical kits useful, for example, in the treatment or prevention of FGFR-associated diseases or disorders, such as cancer and other diseases referred to herein which include one or more containers containing a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the disclosure.
