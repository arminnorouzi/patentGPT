A coating device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure includes: a fiber passage through which a glass fiber passes downward in a vertical direction; a first flow path which is a flow path allowing a primary resin to flow toward the fiber passage and includes a first branch path horizontally dividing the primary resin moving in a horizontal direction; a first temperature controller which is disposed along the first flow path and controls a temperature of the first flow path; a second flow path which is a flow path allowing a secondary resin to flow toward the fiber passage, includes a second branch path horizontally dividing the secondary resin moving in the horizontal direction, and is located below the first flow path; and a second temperature controller which is disposed along the second flow path and controls a temperature of the second flow path.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the coating device, the glass fiber passing through the fiber passage is coated with the primary resin flowing through the first flow path and subjected to the temperature control by the first temperature controller. Further, the glass fiber coated with the primary resin is further coated with the secondary resin flowing through the second flow path and subjected to the temperature control by the second temperature controller. The first flow path and the second flow path are respectively provided with the first branch path and the second branch path which horizontally divide the resin. Therefore, it is possible to form the flow path directed from a plurality of positions in the circumferential direction toward the fiber passage. Thus, it is possible to uniformly adjust the flow of the resin used for coating the glass fiber in the circumferential direction of the glass fiber.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the optical fiber manufacturing apparatus <b>1</b> is an apparatus for manufacturing an optical fiber F having a glass fiber F<b>11</b> including a core and a clad and a coating resin and has a configuration in which a drawing furnace <b>11</b>, a forced cooling device <b>12</b>, an outer diameter measuring device <b>13</b>, a resin coating device <b>100</b>, an uneven thickness measuring device <b>16</b>, a UV furnace <b>17</b>, an outer diameter measuring device <b>18</b>, a guide roller <b>20</b>, a capstan <b>21</b>, and a winding bobbin <b>22</b> are provided in order along the passage path of the glass fiber F<b>11</b> and the optical fiber F.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the optical fiber manufacturing apparatus <b>1</b>, the initial moving direction of the optical fiber F is set to the vertical direction and the moving direction of the optical fiber F is set to the horizontal direction or an inclined direction at the rear stage of the guide roller <b>20</b>. The drawing furnace <b>11</b> draws a preform (glass base material) <b>10</b> containing quartz glass as a main component to form the glass fiber F<b>11</b> including a core and a clad. The drawing furnace <b>11</b> includes heaters which are arranged with the preform <b>10</b> set inside the drawing furnace <b>11</b> interposed therebetween. The heaters may surround the preform <b>10</b>. The end portion of the preform <b>10</b> is melted by the heating of the heaters and drawn to form the glass fiber F<b>11</b>. The drawn glass fiber F<b>11</b> moves downward along the vertical direction.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The forced cooling device <b>12</b> cools the drawn glass fiber F<b>11</b>. The forced cooling device <b>12</b> has a sufficient length along the vertical direction in order to sufficiently cool the glass fiber F<b>11</b>.

In general, the viscosity (Pa&#xb7;s) of the resin depends on the temperature, becomes low as the temperature becomes high, and becomes high as the temperature becomes low. In the optical fiber manufacturing apparatus <b>1</b>, the peripheral surface of the glass fiber F<b>11</b> can be appropriately coated with a resin by adjusting the viscosity of the resin to a predetermined range.

Further, the secondary resin <b>15</b> is required to have hardness and toughness in order to withstand external stress and tends to have a low viscosity. That is, the viscosity of the primary resin <b>14</b> is higher than the viscosity of the secondary resin <b>15</b> at the same temperature condition. In this case, in order to adjust the viscosities of the primary resin <b>14</b> and the secondary resin <b>15</b> in the range suitable for the coating, the temperature of the primary resin <b>14</b> needs to be controlled to a temperature higher than the temperature of the secondary resin <b>15</b>. Therefore, in the resin coating device <b>100</b> as an example, the first temperature is set to be higher than the second temperature.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the resin coating device <b>100</b> as an example, the viscosities of the primary resin <b>14</b> and the secondary resin <b>15</b> when used for coating the glass fiber F<b>11</b> are adjusted from about 0.8 Pa&#xb7;s to 2.0 Pa&#xb7;s.

Additionally, in this case, the viscosity ratio (the viscosity of the secondary resin/the viscosity of the primary resin) between the primary resin <b>14</b> and the secondary resin <b>15</b> may be, for example, about 0.5 to 0.9.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The primary resin <b>14</b> subjected to the temperature control flows into the fiber passage <b>105</b>S through the first flow path <b>151</b>, the first through-hole <b>112</b><i>a, </i>the flow path <b>146</b>, the groove <b>143</b>, and the gap <b>141</b>S.

Accordingly, the flow of the primary resin <b>14</b> in the vicinity of the fiber passage <b>105</b>S becomes uniform in the circumferential direction. Similarly, the secondary resin <b>15</b> flows into the fiber passage <b>105</b>S through the second flow path <b>171</b>, the second through-hole <b>112</b><i>b, </i>the flow path <b>136</b>, the groove <b>133</b>, and the gap <b>131</b>S.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The secondary resin flows from the flow paths <b>136</b> evenly arranged in the circumferential direction into the groove <b>133</b> and the gap <b>131</b>S surrounding the fiber passage <b>105</b>S over the entire area in the circumferential direction. Accordingly, the flow of the secondary resin <b>15</b> in the vicinity of the fiber passage <b>105</b>S becomes uniform in the circumferential direction.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">When the glass fiber F<b>11</b> moving downward in the vertical direction passes through the fiber passage <b>105</b>S, the peripheral surface of the glass fiber F<b>11</b> is first coated with the primary resin <b>14</b>. Then, as the glass fiber F<b>11</b> moves downward, the secondary resin <b>15</b> is further coated on the primary resin <b>14</b> coated on the glass fiber F<b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Next, the uneven thickness measuring device <b>16</b> measures the deviation of the center position of the glass fiber F<b>11</b> with respect to the center position of the optical fiber F. Then, the glass fiber F<b>11</b> coated with the resins <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> moves downward along the vertical direction and passes through the UV furnace <b>17</b>. When the glass fiber F<b>11</b> passes through the UV furnace <b>17</b>, the resins <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> are irradiated with ultraviolet rays to form the optical fiber F. The optical fiber F moves along a predetermined direction via the guide roller <b>20</b>, is taken up by the capstan <b>21</b>, and is sent to the winding bobbin <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the resin coating device <b>100</b> of the above-described optical fiber manufacturing apparatus <b>1</b>, the upstream branch path <b>154</b>, the downstream branch path <b>155</b> (first branch path), the upstream branch path <b>174</b>, and the downstream branch path <b>175</b> (second branch path) which horizontally divides a resin are respectively formed in the first flow path <b>151</b> and the second flow path <b>171</b>. Therefore, it is possible to form a flow path from a plurality of positions in the circumferential direction toward the fiber passage <b>105</b>S. Thus, the flow of the resin used for coating the glass fiber F<b>11</b> can be adjusted to be uniform in the circumferential direction of the glass fiber F<b>11</b>. Further, since the flow path including each branch path branches only in the horizontal direction, it is possible to decrease the size of the resin coating device <b>100</b> in the up and down direction. Accordingly, an increase in the height of the entire optical fiber manufacturing apparatus <b>1</b> is suppressed.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The first flow path <b>151</b> and the first temperature controller <b>160</b> as an example are formed in the first annular body <b>150</b> which is disposed around the fiber passage <b>105</b>S and has an annular shape.
