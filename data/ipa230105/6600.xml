Solar panels have been placed on homes and businesses for localized generation of electricity. Additionally, large sites have been created where rows of solar panels are used for large-scale electricity generation. However, environmental forces, such as wind, act on the solar panels, which can cause damage or even catastrophic failure of the solar panels and the associated mounting hardware and infrastructure.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The subject matter claimed herein is not limited to embodiments that solve any disadvantages or that operate only in environments such as those described. Rather, this background is only provided to illustrate one example technology area where some embodiments described herein may be practiced.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One or more embodiments of the present disclosure may include systems and methods that act to manipulate the positioning of one or more solar panels so as to prevent damage thereto in the presence of adverse conditions, such as wind.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one example embodiment, a method includes obtaining weather information, such as wind speed, from a suitable wind indicator associated with a solar installation or one or more solar panels. The method may include identifying whether the detected wind speed could adversely affect one or more of the solar panels due to, for example, a current position of the panels with respect to current wind conditions. In response, the method may include re-positioning (or maintaining a current position if optimal) one or more of the solar panels so as to reduce forces thereon from the wind. For example, the method may reposition one or more of the panels to be within a range of stow angles that have been determined to be optimal for the given wind condition (such as wind speed and direction).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">One or more embodiments of the present disclosure may include a system that may include one or more rows of solar panels. The solar panels may be operatively connected to one or more actuators, sometimes referred to as &#x201c;solar trackers.&#x201d; The actuators may adjust an orientation of the one or more rows of solar panels by, for example, rotating a torque tube that is operatively attached to a row of panels. Rotation of the torque tube results in a change to the angular orientation of the solar panels connected to it. The system may include a programmable controller that is configured to perform one or more operations related to the operation of the system. For example, operations may include obtaining current weather information, such as wind speed and determining whether the detected wind speed exceeds a predetermined threshold speed for a given orientation of the panels. If the wind speed is greater than a predetermined threshold value (thereby indicating potential damage to the solar panels), the operations may include causing the actuator to reposition (such as by rotation of a torque tube) of the one or more solar panels to be within an acceptable range of stow angles for the given wind condition.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Systems and methods of the current disclosure thereby provide the ability to react to current weather conditions, such as wind, in a manner that reduces the potential for damage to the solar panels of a given system.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general summary and the following detailed description serve as examples and are explanatory and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The appended drawings contain figures of preferred embodiments to further illustrate and clarify the above and other aspects, advantages, and features of the present disclosure.

For example, re-orientation of one or more solar panels to an advantageous position (sometimes referred to as &#x201c;stow&#x201d; or &#x201c;stowed&#x201d; position) may be necessary due to an adverse weather condition. For example, solar panels may be repositioned to prevent rain or snow from accumulating on the solar panels. As another example, solar panels may be repositioned to reduce drag forces caused by wind flow acting on the solar panels. Many existing systems that utilize a stow operation have a binary option where if a weather service or a wind sensor for a solar site senses a certain wind speed, the entire site is tilted to a predetermined stow orientation at a shallow angle (e.g., close to horizontal) to reduce the chance of damage due to wind forces. However, doing so may result in a decrease in production of solar energy, especially if the solar panels are no longer optimally oriented towards the sun due to the shallow stow angle. Additionally or alternatively, stowing the solar panels at a shallow angle may reduce aerodynamic stability of the stowed solar panels because formation of vortices along edges of the stowed solar panels may cause the stowed solar panels to oscillate (a phenomena known as &#x201c;galloping&#x201d;). Thus, the process of stowing solar panels in response to strong winds often includes a tradeoff between reducing drag forces and maintaining aerodynamic stability of the solar panels.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">One or more embodiments of the present disclosure may overcome one or more of these shortcomings by more accurately detecting conditions that warrant stowing (or repositioning) of solar panels and providing more intelligent stow orientations for a given condition.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, one or more sensors may be disposed on a given row or set of rows of panels that are operably connected to the same tracker actuator. The sensor(s) may be configured to monitor relevant forces and/or displacement of the given row or set of rows of panels. For example, the sensor may include a strain gauge (or similar) that monitors the forces imposed on the given row by, for example, wind. Alternatively, or in addition, the sensor(s) may measure rotation of a torque tube to which the solar panels are coupled within a solar tracking system. Alternatively or in addition, a sensor may measure a current velocity of the wind that is imposed on the solar panels.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In response to the conditions detected by the one or more sensors, a remedial action may be taken. For example, the given row of solar panels might be rotated a set number of degrees until a measured force (or wind speed, or any other relevant parameter) drops below a second threshold. Since conditions often vary even in the same solar site, in some embodiments, the remedial response may occur on a row-by-row basis or region by region basis, rather than the entire site.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">To assist in the description of example embodiments, words such as top, bottom, front, rear, right, and left may be used to describe the accompanying figures. It will be appreciated that embodiments can be disposed in other positions, used in a variety of situations, and may perform a number of different functions. In addition, the drawings may be to scale and may illustrate various configurations, arrangements, aspects, and features of the solar tracking systems. It will be appreciated, however, that the present disclosure may include other suitable shapes, sizes, configurations, and arrangements depending, for example, upon the intended use or scale of project. Further, the solar tracking systems may include any suitable number or combination of aspects, features and the like. A detailed description of some example embodiments now follows.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example solar tracking system that may facilitate the stow of solar panels. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the system <b>100</b> may include a programmable controller <b>110</b> in communication with one or more sensors <b>120</b> and an actuator <b>130</b>. The actuator <b>130</b> may be in communication with a row of solar panels <b>140</b> (or multiple rows of solar panels), that are moveably supported by the tracking system via a torque tube <b>150</b> that is capable of rotating, and thereby rotating the solar panels <b>140</b>. The controller <b>110</b> may be configured to provide guidance to the actuator <b>130</b> as to what orientation the solar panels <b>140</b> are to be positioned by rotation of the torque tube <b>150</b>. In these and other embodiments, one or more controllers <b>110</b> may be located on-site and directly or indirectly coupled to the solar panels for which the controllers <b>110</b> control operations. Additionally or alternatively, the controller <b>110</b> may include a controller system located off-site (e.g., at a remotely operated control center) such that the off-site controller system may receive information from the system of solar panels and send one or more control signals to the system of solar panels based on the received information. During ordinary operations, the actuator <b>130</b> may facilitate tracking the location of the sun relative to the solar panels <b>140</b> such that the solar panels <b>140</b> may be generally oriented substantially normal to the sun or substantially normal to the east-west portion of the irradiance of the sun, which may facilitate increased electrical energy generation. As described herein, in some embodiments, the system <b>100</b> may monitor the one or more sensors <b>120</b>, and based on detected conditions, the system <b>100</b> may take some remedial action. For example, the actuator <b>130</b> may move the solar panels to a position better able to resist the drag forces caused by wind flow. As another example, a secondary feature such as damping or braking may be applied, again based on the conditions detected by the sensor.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, the sensor(s) <b>120</b> may be disposed at any of a variety of locations to monitor the forces experienced by the solar panels <b>140</b>. For example, a sensor <b>120</b> may include a strain gauge disposed within or along the edge of the frame <b>160</b> or mounting brackets <b>170</b> for the solar panels <b>140</b>. Although any suitable bracket might be used, one example of an exemplary mounting bracket implementation is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 9,281,778, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As another example, the sensor <b>120</b> may include a torque sensor associated with the torque tube <b>150</b> that is configured to detect forces imposed on the torque tube <b>150</b> (e.g., due to wind forces imposed on solar panels connected thereto). As a further example, the sensor <b>120</b> may include a displacement or stroke monitor in conjunction with a damper <b>180</b> coupled to the solar panels <b>140</b>. In these and other embodiments, the damper <b>180</b> may be used for monitoring purposes and/or may be used to provide damping action to resist and/or mediate the forces applied to the solar panels <b>140</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the damper may be implemented as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 10,771,007, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. As an additional example, the sensor <b>120</b> may include an accelerometer and/or a gyroscope along the edge of the frame <b>160</b> or mounting brackets <b>170</b> for the solar panels <b>140</b> to monitor a physical position, motion, and/or degree of rotation relative to an expected physical position, motion, and/or degree of rotation. As another example, the sensor <b>120</b> may include a laser or other light emitting device oriented along an edge of the solar panels <b>140</b> and/or frames <b>160</b> thereof to detect movement, displacement, contortion, distortion, and/or variations along the surface. As an additional example, the sensor <b>120</b> may include an inclinometer disposed along an edge of the solar panels <b>140</b> and/or frames <b>160</b> thereof to detect an amount of incline experienced by the solar panels <b>140</b>. While various examples of sensors <b>120</b> and/or their locations are identified, it will be appreciated that any sensor <b>120</b> at any location in the system <b>100</b> that facilitates detecting a property related to and/or associated with the forces being applied to the solar panels <b>140</b> may be utilized consistent with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, the data of the sensor <b>120</b> may be monitored over time. For example, the data of the sensor <b>120</b> may be compared to a threshold as an absolute value, to a threshold as a rate of change. In some embodiments, the data of the sensor <b>120</b> may be compared as a difference from normal forces experienced throughout the day when performing solar tracking. For example, the sensor <b>120</b> may include a strain gauge disposed within the frame <b>160</b> of one or more of the solar panels, within one or more of the mounting brackets <b>170</b> supporting the panels and/or the torque tube <b>150</b> to monitor external forces. In these and other embodiments, there may be some baseline amount of strain due to gravity and/or torsional forces due to rotating the tracker to follow the sun. The difference in strain from typical values may facilitate determination of whether or not a remedial action is to be taken.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, the threshold for whether or not a remedial action is to be taken may be based on a threshold value (e.g., a certain amount of strain as an absolute value may trigger a remedial action), a threshold value for a threshold duration of time (e.g., a certain amount of strain is experienced for a set duration of time), and/or a number of times the threshold value is crossed in a given period of time (e.g., a certain amount of strain is experienced at least a set number of times in the given period of time). Any other similar force that may have an adverse effect on the system can also be monitored.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The remedial action may include any of a variety of actions to mitigate the effects of the forces experienced by the solar panels <b>140</b>. For example, the remedial action may include the actuator <b>130</b> rotating the row of solar panels <b>140</b> by some predetermined amount. Such a response may be beneficial at lower wind speeds where vortexes may be forming where changing the orientation may reduce or eliminate the vortexes. As another example, changing the orientation of the panels may shed the load under high wind conditions. In some embodiments, the remedial action may include rotating the row of solar panels <b>140</b> a predetermined set number of degrees or a set distance from its current location to a remedial orientation. For example, the row of solar panels <b>140</b> may be rotated twenty degrees from its current location towards horizontal. In some embodiments, the remedial action may include rotating the row of solar panels <b>140</b> until some predetermined condition is met. For example, if the data of the sensor <b>120</b> is monitored in real time, the solar panels <b>140</b> may be rotated until the data of the sensor <b>120</b> drops below a threshold value.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, after rotating the solar panels <b>140</b>, the system <b>100</b> may wait a predetermined period of time in the remedial orientation, and then may return the solar panels <b>140</b> to their normal tracked orientation tracking the position of the sun. In these and other embodiments, the orientation to which the solar panels <b>140</b> are returned may be different from the orientation out of which they were initially rotated (e.g., due to a tracking algorithm identifying a different orientation at the later time in the day when the solar panels are returned to the tracking orientations).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, after rotating the solar panels <b>140</b>, the system <b>100</b> may remain in the remedial orientation until the data from a given sensor (or sensors) <b>120</b> drops below a threshold value. For example, the system <b>100</b> may hold the solar panels <b>140</b> in the remedial orientation until data from the sensor <b>120</b> indicates that the potentially damaging forces have subsided. After the data from the sensor <b>120</b> has dropped below the threshold value, the system <b>100</b> may return the solar panels <b>140</b> to their normal tracked orientation tracking the position of the sun.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, after rotating the solar panels <b>140</b>, the system <b>100</b> may wait until the tracking algorithm catches up to the remedial orientation. After the orientations of the tracking algorithm reach the remedial orientation, the system <b>100</b> may continue to rotate the solar panels <b>140</b> according to the tracking algorithm to track the sun.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, the remedial action may include invocation of a secondary system in addition to or separately from the rotation of the row of solar panels <b>140</b>. For example, such secondary systems may include a brake system that may clamp or grip the solar panels <b>140</b> to hold them in a fixed position. As another example, the secondary systems may include a damping system that may dampen the motion and/or forces of the solar panels <b>140</b> to minimize any motion or displacement experienced by the solar panels <b>140</b>. In some embodiments, the sensor <b>120</b> may be part of the secondary system (such as a stroke sensor of the damping system).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, the remedial action may include a graded response. For example, if a first amount of force experienced exceeds a first threshold as indicated by data read from the sensor <b>120</b>, the solar panels <b>140</b> may be moved by the actuator <b>130</b> a first amount. If a second amount of force is experienced that exceeds a second threshold higher than the first threshold, the solar panels may be moved a second amount further than the first amount. As another example of a graded response, after a remedial response is triggered, the controller <b>110</b> may determine a response proportional to the readings from the sensor <b>120</b> (e.g., if the threshold is exceeded by 10%, the remedial response may be 10% greater such as rotating by 22&#xb0; instead of) 20&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, the system <b>100</b> may include a set number of stow positions (e.g., horizontal, +/&#x2212;5&#xb0;, +/&#x2212;15&#xb0;, +/&#x2212;30&#xb0;, etc.) as part of the remedial response. For example, the system <b>100</b> may stow the solar panels <b>140</b> to the closest stow position to the tracking algorithm orientation when a remedial response is triggered (e.g., if the tracking algorithm orientation is &#x2212;40&#xb0; and the remedial action is triggered, the solar panels <b>140</b> may be rotated to)&#x2212;30&#xb0;. In these and other embodiments, if the remedial action trigger remains at the closest stow position, the system <b>100</b> may move to the next stow position (e.g., if the force is still above the threshold when at &#x2212;30&#xb0;, the system <b>100</b> may rotate the solar panels <b>140</b> to &#x2212;15&#xb0;, etc.).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, one or more of the stow positions may include ranges of stowing angles. In other words, a given stow position may include a corresponding range of angles within which the solar panels <b>140</b> may be rotated when operating under the remedial response. For example, a given remedial response may include limiting rotation of the solar panels <b>140</b> to within a certain range of angles (such as +/&#x2212;15&#xb0;, +/&#x2212;30&#xb0;, etc.). In these and other embodiments, if the current angle due to tracking is within the range, the remedial action may not disrupt the current position of the solar panels <b>140</b> but may prevent the solar panels <b>140</b> from following the tracking algorithm outside of the range.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Additionally or alternatively, the range of stowing angles permitted for the solar panels <b>140</b> in various stow positions may depend on the wind speed. For example, a first range of given remedial response may include limiting the rotation of the solar panels <b>140</b> to within a first range for a first wind speed threshold and may include further limiting the rotation of the solar panels <b>140</b> to a narrower range for a second wind speed threshold higher than the first wind speed threshold. For example, for the first wind speed threshold (e.g., 35 mph winds) the range may include +/&#x2212;15&#xb0; and for the second wind speed threshold (e.g., 45 mph winds) the range may include +1-7&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Additionally, or alternatively, the range of stowing angles permitted for the solar panels <b>140</b> at a given period of time may depend on the angle of orientation of the solar panels <b>140</b> as determined by a tracking algorithm. For example, a given system of solar panels <b>140</b> may be oriented at 30&#xb0; during a first period of time (e.g., between 9 A.M. and 10 A.M.). Responsive to the given system of solar panels <b>140</b> experiencing wind exceeding a first wind speed threshold (e.g., 35 mph winds), rotation of the solar panels <b>140</b> may be limited to within +/&#x2212;10&#xb0; of the 30&#xb0; orientation as determined by the tracking algorithm. In other words, the solar panels <b>140</b> may rotate between 20&#xb0; and 40&#xb0; in this example. As another example, the given system of solar panels <b>140</b> may experience wind exceeding a second wind speed threshold (e.g., 45 mph winds), which may limit rotation of the solar panels <b>140</b> within +/&#x2212;5&#xb0; of the 30&#xb0; orientation as determined by the tracking algorithm.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, the graded response may include a conclusive response. For example, after a severe force is experienced exceeding a high threshold, the system <b>100</b> may rotate the solar panels <b>140</b> to a conclusive stow position, such as horizontal, +/&#x2212;5&#xb0; from horizontal, or any other &#x201c;safe&#x201d; position. In these and other embodiments, such a stow position may be maintained for an extended time out period, such as the remainder of the day.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, the conclusive response may be triggered by a remedial action being taken a set number of times in a day, or in a given time window. For example, if a remedial action is triggered three times within a two-hour window, the conclusive response may be triggered for the remainder of the day. As another example, if a remedial action is triggered four times within a given day, the conclusive response may be triggered for the remainder of the day. In some embodiments, the conclusive response may be triggered in conjunction with a graded remedial response. For example, if multiple stages of the graded response are triggered in a first remedial action, the triggering of a second remedial action later in the day may trigger the conclusive response.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The actuator <b>130</b> may include any device, system, or component configured to provide motion and/or change the orientation of the solar panels <b>140</b>. For example, the actuator <b>130</b> may include an electric motor, a gas- or diesel-powered motor, and the like.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Modifications, additions, or omissions may be made to the system <b>100</b> without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.

The tracking algorithm <b>200</b> may include a normal tracking algorithm at block <b>210</b> (herein referred to as &#x201c;the normal tracking algorithm <b>210</b>&#x201d; in short) that determines a normal set point of one or more solar panels. In some embodiments, the normal set point of the solar panels may be determined as a function of time such that the normal tracking algorithm <b>210</b> indicates the solar panels should be set at a predetermined angle (or within a predetermined range of angles) at a given point in time. In these and other embodiments, the normal tracking algorithm <b>210</b> may be tailored to a given solar site based on sun coverage experienced by the solar site during a typical day, sun uptime in the geographical location of the solar site, and/or any other &#x201c;normal&#x201d; condition settings.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Additionally, or alternatively, in the illustrated embodiment the tracking algorithm <b>200</b> may include inclinometer sensor data at block <b>220</b> (herein referred to as &#x201c;the inclinometer sensor data <b>220</b>&#x201d; in short) that describes a tip angle of the solar panels and/or wind velocity measurements at block <b>225</b> (herein referred to as &#x201c;the wind velocity measurements <b>225</b>&#x201d; in short). The inclinometer sensor data <b>220</b> may be captured by an inclinometer, which may, for example, be positioned on a tip of a solar tracker associated with one or more of the solar panels. The inclinometer may determine a tip angle of the solar panels to which the solar tracker is coupled. The wind velocity measurements <b>225</b> may include information about a wind speed and a wind direction, for example.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, the normal set point determined by the normal tracking algorithm <b>210</b>, the tip angle described by the inclinometer sensor data <b>220</b>, and/or the wind velocity measurements <b>225</b> may be managed via a data log, denoted at block <b>230</b> (herein referred to as &#x201c;the data log <b>230</b>&#x201d; in short). The data log <b>230</b> may be used to collate and/or otherwise organize the obtained data such that a temporary stow set point may be determined according to the tracking algorithm <b>200</b> at blocks <b>250</b> and <b>255</b> and/or blocks <b>270</b>-<b>274</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">At block <b>240</b>, the tracking algorithm <b>200</b> may calculate a difference, D, between the tip angle described by the inclinometer sensor data <b>220</b> and the normal set point determined by the normal tracking algorithm <b>210</b>. In some embodiments, the difference may be calculated as an absolute value difference between the tip angle and the normal set point such that the difference describes a deviation from normal tracking behavior of the solar panels as defined by the normal tracking algorithm <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The difference may be compared to a threshold value (labeled as Allow in block <b>242</b> and block <b>244</b>). Responsive to determining that the difference is less than or equal to the threshold value (e.g., D&#x2264;Allow as labeled in block <b>242</b>), the tracking algorithm <b>200</b> may proceed to block <b>260</b>, and the normal set point determined by the normal tracking algorithm <b>210</b> may be maintained. In other words, the tracking algorithm <b>200</b> may determine at block <b>242</b> whether the tip angles of the solar panels have deviated from normal tracking behavior relative to the normal set point determined by the normal tracking algorithm <b>210</b>. If the tip angles of the solar panels have not deviated from normal tracking behavior, then the tip angles may be maintained.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Responsive to determining that the difference is greater than the threshold value (e.g., D&#x3e;Allow as labeled in block <b>244</b>), the tracking algorithm <b>200</b> may proceed to block <b>250</b> where an allowable tilt angle range may be determined based on a first lookup table (&#x201c;Lookup Table 1&#x201d; in block <b>250</b>). In some embodiments, the first lookup table may include information describing a relationship between two or more variables. For example, an example embodiment of a first lookup table excerpt <b>300</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> indicates an effect of a wind speed in miles per hour and a wind direction relative to North on an allowable range of tilt angles for a given solar site. As illustrated in the first lookup table excerpt <b>300</b>, the allowable range of tilt angles is +/&#x2212;52&#xb0; when there is no wind, and as the wind speed increases, the allowable range of tilt angles decreases. Furthermore, assuming the solar panels of the solar site are oriented in an East-West direction such that rotation of the solar panels tracks the westward movement of the sun, the allowable range of tilt angles decreases as the wind direction becomes more parallel to the orientation of the solar panels. Determining the relationship between the two or more variables included in the first lookup table is described in further detail in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">At block <b>260</b>, an optimal tilt angle change may be determined according to a second lookup table based on the allowable range of tilt angles determined at block <b>250</b>. For example, a second lookup table <b>400</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> indicates a direction to change the tilt angle of the solar panels based on a current set point and the wind direction relative to North. In other words, the second lookup table <b>400</b> may determine in which direction to change the tilt angle of the solar panels to stow the solar panels within the allowable range of tilt angles determined at block <b>250</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">At block <b>265</b>, a tracker tilt angle of the solar panels may be changed to fall within the constraints of the allowable range of tilt angles. In some embodiments, the tracker tilt angle may be determined according to the first lookup table at block <b>250</b> and/or the second lookup table at block <b>255</b>. The tracker tilt angle may be obtained by the data log <b>230</b> and used as a temporary stow set point for the solar panels. In these and other embodiments, the data log <b>230</b> may send the temporary stow set point to a tracker drive control at block <b>290</b> (herein referred to as &#x201c;the tracker drive control <b>290</b>&#x201d; in short).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Additionally or alternatively, the tracking algorithm <b>200</b> may proceed to block <b>270</b> where the allowable range of tilt angles is determined according to the first lookup table, and a temporary stow set point may be determined at block <b>272</b> and block <b>274</b>. In some embodiments, the tracking algorithm <b>200</b> may first perform computations according to the process beginning at block <b>240</b> to determine the temporary stow set point at block <b>260</b> or block <b>265</b> and then verify the determined temporary stow set point based on the process beginning at block <b>270</b>.

In some embodiments, the tilt angle to which the solar panels are configured to move at block <b>285</b> may be considered the temporary stow set point that is sent to the data log.

The method <b>500</b> may be performed by any suitable system, apparatus, or device. For example, the controller <b>110</b> and/or the actuator <b>130</b> may perform one or more operations associated with the method <b>500</b>. Additionally or alternatively, a computing system, such as computing system <b>1000</b> as described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, may perform one or more of the operations associated with the method <b>500</b>. Although illustrated with discrete blocks, the steps and operations associated with one or more of the blocks of the method <b>500</b> may be divided into additional blocks, combined into fewer blocks, or eliminated, depending on the particular implementation.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The method <b>500</b> may begin at block <b>510</b> where directional drag coefficients of solar panels included in a solar site are determined according to wind tunnel tests. In some embodiments, the wind tunnel tests may include placing a mock solar site in a wind tunnel and determining the drag force experienced by the solar panels of the mock solar site at various wind velocities to calculate the directional drag coefficients of the solar panels and/or of the mock solar site.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Additionally or alternatively, the directional drag coefficients of the solar panels and/or of the mock solar site may be determined by any other methods. For example, the directional drag coefficients may be determined based on software that may simulate wind effects and drag force on modeled solar panels. As another example, software configured to model computational fluid dynamics may be used to analytically determine the effects of wind flow on one or more given solar panels. In these and other embodiments, more than one method may be used to determine the directional drag coefficients. For example, the directional drag coefficients may be independently determined according to the wind tunnel tests and computational fluid dynamics such that the directional drag coefficients determined via one process may be used to corroborate the directional drag coefficients determined via the other process.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">At block <b>520</b>, one or more drag loads (corresponding to the drag forces that affect the solar panels) may be determined. In some embodiments, the drag loads may be calculated according to any applicable design code and based on the directional drag coefficients determined at block <b>510</b>. The applicable design code relating to a given solar site may be determined according to building standards for structural load requirements set by an international, national, regional, or local administration related to the given solar site. For example, a solar site being built in the United States of America may adhere to rules governing structural resistance to wind set in Minimum Design Loads and Associated Criteria for Buildings and Other Structures (ASCE/SEI 7-16), while the same solar site being built in Australia may adhere to rules set in AS/NZS 1170.2. In these and other embodiments, the directional drag coefficients may represent constant values and/or scaling coefficients for input values that facilitate computation of the drag loads affecting the solar panels according to the applicable design code.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">At block <b>530</b>, drag loads on tracker components may be determined. In some embodiments, the directional drag coefficients determined at block <b>510</b> may be applied to the applicable design code used at block <b>520</b> to calculate the drag loads to determine the drag loads on the tracker components.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">At block <b>540</b>, structures of the tracker components may be modeled. In some embodiments, modeling the structures of the tracker components may be facilitated by any modeling methods. For example, finite element analysis (FEA) may be implemented to divide a given tracker component into multiple pieces; the structures of each of the pieces may be analyzed, and the piecewise structures may be summed to determine the structure of the given tracker component. As another example, multi-body dynamics (MBD) may be implemented to determine the structure of the tracker components using a more holistic analytical approach relative to FEA.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Additionally or alternatively, any closed-form structural analysis may be performed to model the structures of the tracker components. In some embodiments, known beam stress, deflection, and/or material strain equations (e.g., equations promulgated by the American Institute of Steel Construction or equations published in Roark Formulas for Stress and Strain) may be used to analytically and mathematically model the structures of the tracker components.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">At block <b>550</b>, stress on the tracker components and/or the solar panels may be calculated.

In some embodiments, a maximum stress threshold for the solar panels and/or the tracker components may be set (e.g., by a human user). The allowable range of tilt angles may be determined based on the maximum stress threshold such that bounds of the allowable range of tilt angles correspond to the maximum stress threshold. For example, the bounds of the allowable range of tilt angles may be set such that the stress experienced by the solar panels and/or the tracker components at a given combination of wind speed, wind direction, and tip angle corresponds to the maximum stress threshold value.

In these and other embodiments, the allowable ranges of tilt angles may represent a maximum tolerable drag force on the solar panels and/or the tracker components because the allowable ranges of tilt angles computed for each cell of the lookup table is associated with the stress experienced by the solar panels and/or the tracker components in which the stress is computed based on a drag force analysis of the solar panels.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Modifications, additions, or omissions may be made to the method <b>500</b> without departing from the scope of the disclosure.

For example, after the first threshold is exceeded as monitored by the sensor <b>620</b><i>e</i>, a remedial action may be undertaken to rotate the fifth row <b>610</b><i>e </i>until the data measured by the sensor <b>620</b><i>e </i>drops below the threshold, which may be further for the fifth row <b>610</b><i>e </i>than for the third row <b>610</b><i>c. </i></p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">By providing row by row control of the remedial actions, the entire system <b>600</b> may be able to operate in a more efficient manner. For example, the first and second rows <b>610</b><i>a </i>and <b>610</b><i>b </i>may not be experiencing the same forces as the rows <b>610</b><i>c</i>-<b>610</b><i>e </i>and so may remain in the orientation that maximizes production.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some embodiments, the system <b>600</b> may provide panel-by-panel control of the remedial actions. For example, the first row <b>610</b><i>a </i>may include five solar panels positioned adjacent to one another to form the first row <b>610</b><i>a</i>. The orientations of the first solar panel, the second solar panel, the third solar panel, the fourth solar panel, and/or the fifth solar panel may be controlled individually for the remedial actions. Panel-by-panel control of the remedial actions for a given row of solar panels may facilitate making more efficient remedial responses to forces experienced by the entire system <b>600</b>. For example, stow angles of individual solar panels of a given row may be decreased gradually towards the middle of the given row such that solar panels on outer positions of the given row are stowed at end-panel stow positions that have the highest stow angles (e.g., steepest orientations) while the solar panels on inner positions of the given row are stowed at shallower stow angles than the end-panel stow positions. These and other remedial actions may facilitate shielding of the solar panels included on the inner positions from environmental effects and/or forces by the solar panels included on the outer positions stowed at the higher stow angles. While the example of individual panels is utilized, it will be appreciated that any number of panels or other portions less than an entire row being separately controlled is also contemplated.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> has been described with reference to individual rows, it will be appreciated that groups of rows may be treated similarly with the same or a similar effect. For example, if the rows <b>610</b><i>a </i>and <b>610</b><i>b </i>were controlled by the same actuator, the rows <b>610</b><i>a </i>and <b>610</b><i>b </i>may be treated as a single unit. As another example, half of the row <b>620</b><i>c </i>may be treated as one independently controlled unit with the other half of the row <b>620</b><i>c </i>being treated independently, each half with its own actuator and/or controller to facilitate control of the unit. Additionally, the rows <b>610</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> may be spaced further apart and/or sized differently and are illustrated merely for the purposes of illustrating the underlying principle.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some embodiments, a site-wide stow response may be coordinated. For example, a peripheral row (or rows) of solar panels <b>610</b><i>a </i>(and/or <b>610</b><i>b</i>) may be stowed at a steep angle, despite the wind forces, such that the internal rows (e.g., the rows <b>610</b><i>c</i>-<b>610</b><i>e</i>) may be shielded from the wind. The peripheral rows <b>610</b><i>a </i>may be built with more robust components and/or increased damping capabilities to better withstand higher drag forces and/or aerodynamic instability (e.g., galloping or wobbling). Such a configuration may permit the majority of rows (e.g., the internal rows) to continue to largely follow the tracking algorithm while being shielded by the peripheral rows. As another example, the peripheral rows may experience the brunt of drag forces and so may tilt to a shallower stow angle (or range of angles) where the brunt of the drag force is experienced, and the internal rows may be able to more broadly follow the tracking algorithm (e.g., the stow range of angles for the internal rows may be a broader range of permitted angles compared to the peripheral rows). In these and other embodiments, individual sensors on individual rows may facilitate monitoring and/or providing an intra-site customized and variable response to wind forces.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates example views <b>700</b> of an example row of solar panels <b>440</b> progressing through an example graded response in stowing the solar panels <b>440</b>, in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the solar panels <b>740</b><i>a </i>may initially be at an orientation of 45&#xb0; from horizontal based on a tracking algorithm.

For example, a combination of a localized or site wind speed sensor and a strain gauge or displacement gauge for a specific row may be used for such determinations. As another example, a precipitation sensor or a severe-weather warning from a news source or weather service may be used in combination with accelerometers or inclinometers on the rows of solar panels.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a flowchart of an example method <b>900</b> of stowing solar panels according to the present disclosure. The method <b>900</b> may be performed by any suitable system, apparatus, or device. For example, the controller <b>110</b> and/or the actuator <b>130</b> may perform one or more operations associated with the method <b>900</b>. Although illustrated with discrete blocks, the steps and operations associated with one or more of the blocks of the method <b>900</b> may be divided into additional blocks, combined into fewer blocks, or eliminated, depending on the particular implementation.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The method <b>900</b> may begin at block <b>910</b>, where weather information including a wind indicator of wind speed greater than a threshold value may be obtained by a system of solar panels (e.g., by a processor, a controller, and/or any other component of the system of solar panels). In some embodiments, the weather information may be collected by sensors included in the system of solar panels. For example, one or more of the solar panels may include strain gauges for measuring forces experienced by the solar panels, inclinometers, torque sensors, displacement and/or stroke monitors, accelerometers, gyroscopes, motion-detection lasers, anemometers, thermal sensors, barometers, and/or any other types of sensors that may capture information from the environment in which the system of solar panels is operating for weather information and/or information regarding operations of the solar panels. Additionally or alternatively, the system of solar panels may be communicatively coupled to one or more weather forecasting services such that the weather information may be obtained based on weather forecasts and/or information from such weather forecasting services.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">At block <b>920</b>, whether the wind associated with the wind indicator is predicted to affect the system of solar panels may be identified. Identifying whether the wind associated with the wind indicator will affect the system of solar panels may include predicting whether the wind will affect a geographic region in which the system of solar panels is located. For example, the wind associated with the wind indicator may not affect the system of solar panels if the weather information indicates the wind will pass by a region near, but not directly over, the system of solar panels. Additionally or alternatively, identifying whether the wind associated with the wind indicator will affect the system of solar panels may include determining the timing with which the wind affects the system of solar panels. For example, the weather information may indicate the wind will affect the system of solar panels at midnight. However, the solar panels may already be rotated to stow positions at that time such that remedial actions responsive to the wind would be unneeded.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">At block <b>930</b>, the rotation of one or more solar panels of the system of solar panels may be limited to within a first or a second range of stow angles responsive to identifying that the wind is predicted to affect the system of solar panels and that the wind speed is greater than the threshold wind speed value. In some embodiments, the rotation of the solar panels may be limited to the first range of stow angles responsive to determining that the wind speed is greater than a first threshold value, while the rotation of the solar panels may be limited to the second range of stow angles responsive to determining that the wind speed is greater than a second threshold value (e.g., a higher wind speed value resulting in a narrower range of stow angles for the second range). In some embodiments, the first range of stow angles may be bound by a first stowing angle and a second stowing angle, and the second range of stow angles may be bound by a third stowing angle and a fourth stowing angle. In these and other embodiments, the third stowing angle and/or the fourth stowing angle may include stowing angles that are between the first stowing angle and the second stowing angle (e.g., if the second threshold is a higher wind speed than the first threshold). Additionally or alternatively, the third stowing angle and/or the fourth stowing angle may include stowing angles that are not between the first stowing angle and the second stowing angle (e.g., if the second threshold is a lower wind speed than the first threshold). Additionally or alternatively, there may be some overlap between the first range of stow angles and the second range of stow angles. In these and other embodiments, an allowable range of tilt angles may be determined according to a tracking algorithm, such as the tracking algorithm <b>200</b> described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, by considering a normal set point of the solar panels, a tip angle of the solar panels, and the wind velocity.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">At block <b>940</b>, updated weather information may be obtained. In some embodiments, the updated weather information may be obtained in the same or a similar way as the weather information obtained at block <b>910</b>. Additionally or alternatively, whether the updated weather information affects the solar panels may be determined (e.g., in the same or a similar way as described at block <b>920</b>).</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">At block <b>950</b>, responsive to determining that the wind speeds fall below the threshold value, rotation of the solar panels may be permitted to operate within a full range of angles of orientation. In some embodiments, the solar panels may be rotated to an angle of orientation according to a tracking algorithm such that the system of solar panels may &#x201c;resume&#x201d; ordinary operations (e.g., operations relating to solar tracking without any high winds according to the normal tracking algorithm <b>210</b>).</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Additionally or alternatively, one or more of the solar panels may be rotated to a fixed stow position responsive to making one or more determinations regarding operations of the system of solar panels at block <b>960</b>. The fixed stow position may include an angle of orientation and/or a range of stowing angles at which the solar panels are most resistant to adverse weather conditions. In these and other embodiments, the angle of orientation and/or the range of stowing angles corresponding to the fixed stow position may or may not consider the energy-generating potential of the solar panels while in the fixed stow position because resisting adverse weather conditions (e.g., high winds) may be considered a more important consideration in situations in which the solar panels are stowed in the fixed stow position.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In some embodiments, the determinations resulting in rotation of the solar panels to the fixed stow position may include determining that the rotation of the solar panels has been previously limited at least a threshold number of times within a given period of time (e.g., the system has responded to an adverse weather event three times previously during a single day). Additionally or alternatively, the determinations resulting in rotation of the solar panels to the fixed stow position may include identifying a wind indicator that may be designated as a severe wind condition (e.g., the weather service has issued a wind weather advisory warning).</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Modifications, additions, or omissions may be made to the method <b>900</b> without departing from the scope of the disclosure.
