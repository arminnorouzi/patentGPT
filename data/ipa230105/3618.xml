A rock sample block <b>906</b> is fixed on the rock sample plate <b>908</b>. The overall installation of the testing platform <b>9</b> provided herein is checked, and then transferred to the pressure chamber. After that, the testing platform is well fixed to prevent generating large vibrations in use. The high-pressure pump <b>1</b> is started to pressurize the pressure chamber <b>10</b>, and stop the pressurization when the value of the pressure gauge <b>2</b> reaches 120 MPa. During the pressurization process, the pressure compensation device <b>910</b> performs pressure compensation on the hydraulic system <b>909</b>, such that the pressure difference between the inside and outside of the entire hydraulic system is basically equal to zero.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the test, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, the jettisoning shaft <b>90327</b> is fixed with the power head spindle <b>90332</b> along an axial direction by the steel ball <b>90323</b> and transmits the force along the axial direction. The lower end of the jettisoning shaft <b>90327</b> is connected to the connecting pipe <b>90308</b> through the cross recessed countersunk head screw <b>90307</b>. A lower end of the connecting pipe <b>90308</b> is threadedly connected with the drill pipe <b>90311</b>. When the drilling is performed under normal circumstances, the rotary motion and torque output by the first hydraulic motor <b>90301</b> are transmitted to the drill pipe <b>90311</b> through the power head spindle <b>90332</b> and the jettisoning shaft <b>90327</b>, so as to achieve the drilling into the rock formation. At the same time, the pressure and temperature variations caused by the drilling process are transmitted to the data acquisition system <b>6</b> through the sensor.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">When the drill pipe <b>90310</b> is required to be jettisoned in the event of an accident, high-pressure hydraulic oil is injected into the annular oil cavity at the lower part of the jettisoning shaft control sleeve <b>90331</b> through the lower oil port of the oil port <b>917</b>, and the oil return in the annular oil cavity on the upper part of the jettisoning shaft control sleeve <b>90331</b>. The jettisoning shaft control sleeve <b>90331</b> is configured to move upwards.

Due to the taper effect of the through hole of the power head spindle <b>90332</b> where the steel ball <b>90323</b> is provided, the steel ball <b>90323</b> is configured to automatically move toward an outer surface of the power head spindle <b>90332</b> due to the taper effect of the through hole on the power head spindle <b>90332</b> where the steel ball <b>90323</b> is located until the steel ball <b>90323</b> fails to withstand the step of the jettisoning shaft <b>90327</b>, such that the jettisoning shaft <b>90327</b> enables free separation, and the jettisoning shaft <b>90327</b> and the drill pipe connected to the jettisoning shaft <b>90327</b> are both jettisoned.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to an embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the piston of the screw-off cylinder <b>90341</b> is cylindrical.

Both ends of the screw-off cylinder <b>90341</b> are enclosed by the cylinder covers. The high-pressure hydraulic oil is allowed to be injected into the screw-off cylinder <b>90341</b> through the oil pipe interface <b>90340</b> to push the piston <b>90319</b> to move in both two directions, thereby driving the pawl <b>90320</b> to move in both directions. When the piston <b>90319</b> moves from top to bottom, the pawl <b>90320</b> enters the power head housing <b>90306</b> and pushes the ratchet wheel <b>90318</b> to rotate counterclockwise. Since the piston <b>90319</b> is configured to provide a relatively strong thrust. Since the piston <b>90319</b> can provide a relatively strong thrust, the power head spindle <b>90332</b>, which is in key connection to the ratchet wheel <b>90318</b>, can obtain a relatively large reversing torque, which is much larger than the reversing torque provided by the hydraulic motor <b>90301</b>, so as to remove the drill pipe that is tightly guarded due to the drilling process.
