The rainfall effect needs water to be regulated uniformly throughout the entire length of the fountain to get the true &#x201c;rainfall&#x201d; effect. The process to build, install, assemble, and test the fountain with rainfall effect is time-consuming, especially if the length of the fountain is of several feet. The rainfall feature also has a high chance of clogging, requiring expensive maintenance and repairs. Overall, the cost and maintenance of known fountains with rainfall effect is high.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Besides the rainfall effects, additional effects such as a user also desires waterfall effects. For both the rainfall effect and waterfall effect, two separate units are needed which are built and made separately. A rainfall fountain functions as a rainfall fountain only. Similarly, a waterfall fountain is limited to a single waterfall effect. It increases the overall cost and results is complex and difficult-to-use water fountain.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, a need is therefore appreciated for a water fountain with interchangeable rainfall and the waterfall effects that is devoid of the drawbacks of the known rainfall and waterfall fountains.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The following presents a simplified summary of one or more embodiments of the present invention to provide a basic understanding of such embodiments.

The disclosed fountain is economical to manufacture and maintain. The rainfall effect can be achieved using the earth's gravity and without having any complex mechanism. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>which shows the fountain <b>100</b> that includes the inner pipe <b>110</b> and the outer pipe <b>120</b>. The holes <b>130</b> in the outer pipe <b>120</b> face downwards while the holes <b>140</b> in the inner pipe <b>110</b> face upwards. The inner pipe can be connected to a water supply <b>150</b> using a watertight connection. The inner pipe can then be inserted into the outer pipe from the open end of the outer pipe, wherein the open ends of the inner pipe and the outer pipe are on the same sides. The holes <b>140</b> of the inner pipe face upwards against the surface of the ground. The holes <b>130</b> in the outer pipe face the ground.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>shows the inner pipe <b>110</b> of the disclosed fountain <b>100</b>. The inner pipe <b>110</b> can have an elongated tubular body made from a water-resistant material, such as PVC. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>c </i></figref>shows an outer pipe <b>120</b> encasing the inner pipe <b>110</b>. Both the inner pipe and outer pipe are creatively modified and installed, allowing the earth's gravity to ensure uniform flow across the entire length of the fountain giving the true effect of &#x201c;rainfall&#x201d; and other features like &#x201c;waterfall&#x201d; from the same installed unit. The outer pipe can also be made from a water-resistant material, such as PVC. In one implementation, both the inner pipe and the outer pipe can be made from the same material or a different one. The outer pipe is larger in diameter than the inner pipe so that the outer pipe can encase the inner pipe.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one implementation, the tubular body of the inner pipe <b>110</b> can be about 10 feet in length and 1.5 inches in diameter. One end of the inner pipe is closed while the other end is open. For example, a plug can be used to close the end of the inner pipe. The other open end can act as an inlet for water. The inner pipe can have a series of holes along its length in a row. The holes are equally spaced from each other. The holes can be made straight and optionally tapered. For example, in a 10 feet pipe, the first and the last hole can be about 9.5 feet apart. In a preferred embodiment, the diameter of the holes can gradually decrease from the first hole up to the last hole, wherein the first hole is adjacent to the open end of the inner pipe. In one implementation, the first hole can be about 10 mm in diameter, and the diameter of the holes can gradually decrease such that the middle hole can be about 5 mm in diameter and the last hole that is adjacent to the closed end of the inner pipe can be about 2 mm in diameter.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The outer pipe <b>120</b> can have a tubular body of a diameter larger than the diameter of the inner pipe <b>110</b>. For example, the outer pipe can be about ten feet in length and about two inches in diameter. One end of the outer pipe can be closed while the other end can be open to receive the inner pipe. Holes can be made in the outer pipe for the desired water effect. For example, for the rainfall effects, evenly spaced holes <b>130</b> can be made along the length of the outer pipe in a row. The width of the holes can be varied for the desired effect. In one implementation, the holes <b>210</b> can be about 1/16 inches in diameter and all the holes can be equal in diameter. For ten feet outer pipe, the first hole and the last hole can be about 9.5 feet apart and the holes can be 0.5 inches apart from each other.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">When water is supplied to the inner pipe, the water in the inner pipe can rise through the holes <b>140</b> against gravity and eventually spill over uniformly across the length of the outer pipe. With the help of gravity, water from the outer pipe can uniformly fall through the evenly spaced holes <b>130</b> across the length of the outer pipe to give a true &#x201c;rainfall&#x201d; effect/feature.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b><i>c </i></figref>which show an exemplary embodiment of the disclosed fountain <b>200</b> that produces a waterfall effect. The fountain <b>200</b> can have an outer pipe <b>210</b>, an inner pipe <b>220</b>, an elongated slot <b>230</b> in the outer pipe, and several holes <b>240</b> in the inner pipe. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b </i></figref>shows the inner pipe <b>220</b> that can be similar to the inner pipe <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b</i></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>c </i></figref>shows the outer pipe <b>210</b> that is similar to the outer pipe <b>120</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>c</i></figref>, except, the outer pipe <b>210</b> has an elongated slot to produce the waterfall effect. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>c </i></figref>shows a single elongated slot that extends along a length of the outer pipe, however, more than one elongated slot in the outer pipe <b>210</b> are within the scope of the present invention. In the fountain <b>200</b>, the elongated slot of the outer pipe faces downwards and the holes in the inner pipe face upwards.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The one implementation, the outer pipe <b>210</b> can be further modified to include both the rainfall effect and the waterfall effect, wherein the outer pipe can be rotated to switch between the rainfall effect and the waterfall effect. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an embodiment the outer pipe <b>300</b> that has multiple holes <b>310</b> arranged in a row for the rainfall effect and an elongated slot <b>320</b> for the waterfall effect. To get the &#x201c;waterfall&#x201d; effect/feature from the same unit, the outer pipe can be rotated about 90 degrees so that the holes <b>310</b> face sidewards and the elongated slot <b>320</b> faces downwards. The water from the inner pipe can fall through the elongated slot of the outer pipe resulting in the waterfall effect. To switch from the waterfall effect to rainfall effect, the outer pipe can again be rotated so that the holes <b>310</b> faces downwards. The inner pipe and the arrangement of the inner pipe and the outer pipe can remain the same as in other embodiments, except the outer pipe can be rotated between two stops.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">While the foregoing written description of the invention enables one of ordinary skill to make and use what is considered presently to be the best mode thereof, those of ordinary skill will understand and appreciate the existence of variations, combinations, and equivalents of the specific embodiment, method, and examples herein.
