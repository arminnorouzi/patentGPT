This group of viruses includes viruses found in nature (e.g., wild-type or native virus), as well as viruses that are engineered from a native virus by gene disruptions or gene additions so as to improve its anti-tumor properties, such as tumor selectivity or preferential replication in tumor cells, host tropism, surface attachment, lysis, and spread. Live replicating OVs have been tested in clinical trials in a variety of human cancers. OVs can induce anti-tumor immune responses, as well as direct lysis of tumor cells (i.e., oncolysis). Common OVs include attenuated strains of Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), Adenovirus (Ad), Measles Virus (MV), Coxsackie virus (CV), Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), and Vaccinia Virus (VV).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Vaccinia virus, the prototypical member of the Orthopoxvirus genus, replicates in the cytoplasm of a host cell. During replication, three morphologically and antigenically distinct forms of the virus are produced: the intracellular mature virions (IMV), the intracellular enveloped virions (IEV), and extracellular virions. A subset of IMV, the first infectious progeny produced, are trafficked to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), where they are enveloped with two additional membranes to produce IEV. IEV are transported through the cytoplasm to the cell periphery, where the outermost membrane fuses with the plasma membrane to release a double membraned form, termed EV. EV that remain on the cell surface are called cell-associated enveloped virion (CEV), while EV that are no longer attached to the cell surface are called extracellular enveloped virion (EEV). IMV is the most abundant infectious form and is thought to be responsible for spread between hosts; the CEV is believed to play a role in cell-to-cell spread; and the EEV is thought to be important for long range dissemination within the host organism.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">VV contains a double-stranded DNA genome of approximately 200 kbp that is predicted to encode more than 200 open reading frames. Seven proteins encoded by the virus, namely, A33, A34, A36, A56, B5, F12, and F13, are unique to enveloped forms (IEV/EEV/CEV) of the virus. Vaccinia virus open reading frames are designated by a capital letter indicating a HindIII restriction endonuclease fragment, a number indicating the position in the HindIII fragment, and a letter (L or R) indicating the direction of transcription, e.g., A34R. The corresponding protein is designated by a capital letter and number, e.g., A34. Specific to the extracellular virion membrane, glycoproteins A33, A34, and B5 are exposed on the surface of EV and have roles during extracellular virion formation and subsequent infection.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure provides a replication-competent, recombinant oncolytic vaccinia virus (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;oncolytic vaccinia virus,&#x201d; or &#x201c;OVV&#x201d;) that comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a variant viral polypeptide, wherein the variant viral polypeptide provides for enhanced virus spreading or enhanced EEV production.

In addition to these terms, others are defined elsewhere in the specification, as necessary. Unless otherwise expressly defined herein, terms of art used in this specification will have their art-recognized meanings.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The term &#x201c;oncolytic&#x201d; vaccinia virus refers to a vaccinia virus that preferentially infects and kills cancer cells, compared to normal (non-cancerous) cells.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The term &#x201c;heterologous&#x201d; refers to a nucleotide or polypeptide sequence that is not found in the native nucleic acid or protein, respectively. For example, in the context of a recombinant vaccinia virus of the present disclosure, a nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a &#x201c;heterologous&#x201d; immunomodulatory polypeptide is a nucleic acid that is not found naturally in vaccinia virus, i.e., the encoded immunomodulatory polypeptide is not encoded by naturally-occurring vaccinia virus.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The terms &#x201c;polynucleotide&#x201d; and &#x201c;nucleic acid,&#x201d; used interchangeably herein, refer to a polymeric form of nucleotides of any length, either ribonucleotides or deoxyribonucleotides. Thus, this term includes, but is not limited to, single-, double-, or multi-stranded DNA or RNA, genomic DNA, cDNA, DNA-RNA hybrids, or a polymer comprising purine and pyrimidine bases or other natural, chemically or biochemically modified, non-natural, or derivatized nucleotide bases.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;treatment,&#x201d; &#x201c;treating,&#x201d; and the like, refer to obtaining a desired pharmacologic and/or physiologic effect. The effect may be prophylactic in terms of completely or partially preventing a disease or symptom thereof and/or may be therapeutic in terms of a partial or complete cure for a disease and/or adverse effect attributable to the disease. &#x201c;Treatment,&#x201d; as used herein, covers any treatment of a disease in a mammal, e.g., in a human, and includes: (a) preventing the disease from occurring in a subject which may be predisposed to the disease but has not yet been diagnosed as having it; (b) inhibiting the disease, i.e., arresting its development; and (c) relieving the disease, i.e., causing regression of the disease.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The terms &#x201c;individual,&#x201d; &#x201c;subject,&#x201d; &#x201c;host,&#x201d; and &#x201c;patient,&#x201d; used interchangeably herein, refer to a mammal, including, but not limited to, murines (e.g., rats, mice), lagomorphs (e.g., rabbits), non-human primates, humans, canines, felines, ungulates (e.g., equines, bovines, ovines, porcines, caprines), etc.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">A &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; or &#x201c;efficacious amount&#x201d; refers to the amount of an agent (e.g., a replication-competent, recombinant oncolytic vaccinia virus of the present disclosure), or combined amounts of two agents (e.g., a replication-competent, recombinant oncolytic vaccinia virus of the present disclosure and a second therapeutic agent), that, when administered to a mammal or other subject for treating a disease, is sufficient to effect such treatment for the disease. The &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; will vary depending on the agent(s), the disease and its severity and the age, weight, etc., of the subject to be treated.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The term &#x201c;variant&#x201d; polypeptide refers to a polypeptide the amino acid sequence of which exhibits at least 90%, but less than 100%, identity with the amino acid sequence of a reference polypeptide; provided said variant has a biological activity as defined herein. The variant maybe arrived at by modification of the amino acid sequence of the reference polypeptide by such modifications as insertion, substitution, or deletion of one or more amino acids. Accordingly, the term &#x201c;variant&#x201d; polypeptide encompasses fragments of a reference polypeptide that comprises a sufficient number of contiguous amino acid residues to confer a desired biological property.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The term &#x201c;substitution&#x201d; refers to the replacement of one amino acid in a polypeptide with a different amino acid.

For example, &#x201c;being deficient&#x201d; may be a result of the deletion in a region consisting of the specified gene region or the deletion in a neighboring gene region comprising the specified gene region. As an example, a mutation and/or truncation and/or deletion of a promoter region that reduces transcription of a gene region can result in deficiency. A gene region can also be rendered deficient through incorporation of a transcriptional termination element such that translation of a polypeptide encoded by the gene region is reduced or eliminated. A gene region can also be rendered deficient through use of a gene-editing enzyme or a gene-editing complex to reduce or eliminate transcription of the gene region. A gene region can also be rendered deficient through use of competitive reverse promoter/polymerase occupancy to reduce or eliminate transcription of the gene region.

Generation of Vaccinia Virus Library Backbones</p><p id="p-0289" num="0288">Backbone viruses were generated to facilitate cloning, reactivation, and construction of multiple libraries into loci of interest within the vaccinia virus genome. Backbone viruses contained the selectable markers herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) and mCherry fusion protein (codon optimized for vaccinia virus expression) under the control of the synthetic early late promoter (pSEL). Donor DNA containing the pSEL-HSV-TK/mCherry cassette flanked by homing endonuclease sites I-Scel and I-Ceul, and unique pairs of Aarl sites in upstream and downstream regions of homology to 1) the A33R/A34R loci, 2) the A56R locus, or 3) the B5R locus were generated via overlapping polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with specific primers for each region (IDT) and Phusion-HF (Thermo Fisher). PCR products were purified using Zymo DNA clean-and-concentrator-5 kit (ZymoResearch) and blunt-cloned into the DNA shuttle vector supplied by the Zero Blunt&#x2122; TOPO&#x2122; PCR Cloning Kit (Thermo Fisher). DNA was sequenced by Elim Biopharmaceuticals (Hayward, Calif.). Viral genomic DNA from Copenhagen vaccinia virus containing a J2R deletion and insertion of firefly luciferase-2A-eGFP driven by the pSEL promoter, was extracted and cut at one of the three loci of interest. The selectable markers replaced each loci of interest: 1) A33R/A34R loci, 2) A56R locus, and 3) the B5R locus of the vaccinia virus genome using viral reactivation. Briefly, VERO-B4 cells (DSMZ) were infected with Shope fibroma virus (SFV; ATCC) for 2 hours at room temperature, washed and allowed to recover at 37&#xb0; C. and 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>for 1 hour. During recovery, transfection mixture containing genomic DNA and donor DNA were mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher) according to manufacturer instructions. The infected cells were transfected with the transfection mixture at 37&#xb0; C. and 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>for 2 days. Functional virus was recovered by serial dilution and plaque isolation from BSC-40 cells (Earl et al. (1998) <i>Curr. Protocol. Mol. Biol. </i>43:16.17.1.). Virus plaques were DNA extracted using QuickExtract (Epicentre/Lucigen) and Sanger sequenced before and after 3 rounds of plaque purification by Elim Biopharmaceuticals. Sequence verified viruses were amplified in HeLa S3 cells (DSMZ), and purified as described below. DNA was extracted (Cotter et al, (2015) <i>Curr. Protocol Mol. Biol. </i>39:14A.3.1.) and summited for whole genome sequencing (WGS) (Seqmatic Hayward, Calif.).

Generation of Vaccinia Virus A33R, A34R, A56R, and B5R DNA Libraries</p><p id="p-0291" num="0290">Libraries containing single amino acid substitutions were generated via PCR. Template DNA containing the Copenhagen vaccinia virus sequences for A33R and A34R (containing a K151E substitution), A56R, or B5R were synthesized (Genescript) for each locus with unique Aarl and Sfil cloning sites inserted upstream of the first gene's promoter and downstream of the last gene's terminator. NNK libraries spanning the length of the genes were designed for A33R, A34R, A56R, and B5R coding sequences. Degenerate NNK-containing primers (IDT) tiled across the coding regions of each protein were used to generate NNK variants for each locus by PCR.</p><p id="p-0292" num="0291">Homology between forward and reverse primers permitted self-assembly of NNK variants for each codon using NEBuilder&#xae; HiFi DNA Assembly (NEB). Assembly reactions were transformed into Endura chemically competent <i>E. coli </i>(Lucigen) and grown on selective agar media (Luria Broth with 100 &#x3bc;g/mL carbenicillin or LB+Carb, Teknova). Colonies were counted and transformations were continued until &#x2dc;20&#xd7; colony forming units (CFUs) per NNK was achieved for each codon in each locus. Colonies were recovered from the plates by flooding and scraping with liquid media LB+Carb (Teknova), aliquoted, and frozen in 30% glycerol. One aliquot for each codon was inoculated into a 96-well plate containing LB+50 &#x3bc;g/mL Carb, shaking overnight at 37&#xb0; C. and 900 rpm; then miniprepped using the Nucleospin 96 Plasmid Transfection-grade Kit (Macherey-Nagel). Minipreps were diluted 1:100 in sterile water; then the donor DNA for each codon was amplified with specific primers (IDT) for A33R/A34R, A56R, and B5R respectively using Phusion-HF (Thermo Fisher). PCR amplicons for each randomized codon were quantified using the AccuClear Ultra High Sensitivity dsDNA quantification kit (Biotium) on a Spectramax M5 plate reader (Molecular Devices) and sequenced by Elim Biopharmaceuticals (Hayward, Calif.). Sequencing results were analyzed in-house using Geneious (Biomatters Ltd.). Verified NNK PCR products were normalized by concentration, pooled and used as donor DNA to recombine into vaccinia virus. Libraries containing randomized regions of interest within the B5R genes were synthesized by Genewiz using a degenerate synthesis process at the defined regions of randomization.

Briefly, VERO-B4 cells (DSMZ) were infected with Shope fibroma virus (SFV, ATCC) and transfected with digested viral genomic DNA and donor DNA. Vaccinia virus viral particles were recovered 24 hours later. Diversity immediately after virus reactivation was estimated by isolating plaques, extracting DNA with Quick Extract (Epicentre/Lucigen), and sequencing PCR amplicons as described above. Viruses from each library were amplified in HeLa S3 cells. Virus seed stocks were analyzed for diversity by amplifying each locus and submitting for amplicon next-generation sequencing (NGS, SeqMatic). Analysis of the diversity present in each locus-specific library was facilitated by the free command-line program VirVarSeq (at https://omictools(dot)com(forward slash)virvarseq-tool)) and post-processing using Microsoft Excel. Amplified viral libraries were purified by sucrose gradient and ultracentrifugation (Cotter et al. (2015) <i>Curr. Protocol Mol. Biol. </i>39:14A.3.1), as described below.

Vaccinia virus containing libraries of viral variants in the appropriate region of interest, in this example A33/A34, B5 and A56 regions, were first engineered through large-scale viral reactivation experiments before being subjected to multiple rounds of selection in particular cell types. The directed evolution process can be adapted to either cancer patient-derived primary cells or immortalized cancer cell-lines. Viral variants can pass through rounds of selection in one or a variety of cell types. Briefly, the process begins with virus capable of replication and release in the supernatant in the first cell type chosen, followed by harvesting after a 24-hour incubation period, amplification and purification (Round 1). The infectious virus obtained from Round 1 is then used to infect either another cell type or the same cell type (Round 2). The execution of Rounds 1-4 is considered 1 Stage of the directed evolution process. Altogether, 3 total Stages were completed. Depending on the cell type being used (cancer patient-derived primary cells or immortalized cancer cell-lines) various multiplicities of infection (MOIs) should be considered.</p><p id="p-0299" num="0297">For multiple rounds of the directed evolution process, sequencing of a representative fraction of the library was performed using a combination of amplicon next-generation sequencing (NGS), Sanger sequencing of individual plaques, and whole genome sequencing (WGS).

Copenhagen vaccinia viruses containing the wild-type A33, A34, and B5 sequences (IGV-007), a K151E substitution in A34 (IGV-006; a known mutation to increase virus spreading and EEV production), and variants containing the combination of a K151E substitution in A34 with I236P, V238R, T240R, and E243G substitutions in B5 (IGV-101), V233D, I236L, V238W, T240Y, and E243R substitutions in B5 (IGV-102), D263V, E268T, E270G, E272P, and E275S substitutions in B5 (IGV-103), an N94T substitution in B5 (IGV-104), an M63R substitution in A33 and an M66T substitution in A34 (IGV-105), N241G, E243S, V247W, D248Y, G250A, and A276F substitutions in B5 (IGV-106), D263A, E270S, E272G, and E275F substitutions in B5 (IGV-107), or N241T, E243V, V247S, G250R, and A276F substitutions in B5 (IGV-108) were generated and manufactured as described in Example 1. The comet assay was performed as described in Example 1. The presence of longer comet tails (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>A-<b>22</b>C</figref>) for the variant vaccinia viruses compared to Copenhagen vaccinia virus containing the wild-type A33, A34, and B5 sequences indicates that better spreading and more of the EEV form of the virus is being produced by the variant vaccinia viruses. The spread of the variants was assessed using the spreading assay described in Example 1. Compared to Copenhagen vaccinia virus containing the wild-type A33, A34, and B5 sequences (IGV-007), the combination of a K151E substitution in A34 and substitutions in A33/A34 or B5 resulted in higher luciferase levels, demonstrating that the variant vaccinia viruses are capable of stronger spread (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>D</figref>). In particular, the combination of a K151E substitution in A34 with V233D, I236L, V238W, T240Y, and E243R substitutions in B5 (IGV-102), an M63R substitution in A33 and an M66T substitution in A34 (IGV-105), N241G, E243S, V247W, D248Y, G250A, and A276F substitutions in B5 (IGV-106), D263A, E270S, E272G, and E275F substitutions in B5 (IGV-107), or N241T, E243V, V247S, G250R, and A276F substitutions in B5 (IGV-108) led to significantly enhanced spread. This study further illustrates that incorporation of mutations to A33, A34, or B5, either alone or in combination leads to enhanced EEV production and enhanced viral spreading in cancer cells.</p><p id="p-0349" num="0347"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>A-<b>22</b>D</figref> provide data on virus spreading and EEV production of additional vaccinia virus variants containing A33/A34 or B5 substitutions. A) Representative images of comets formed following infection of BSC-40 cells demonstrate that variant vaccinia viruses with a combination of substitutions in B5 and the A34 K151E substitution result in longer comet tails, an indication of increased spreading and EEV production, compared to Copenhagen vaccinia virus (IGV-007, left). B) Representative images of comets formed following infection of BSC-40 cells demonstrate that variant vaccinia viruses with a combination of substitutions in A33/A34 or B5 and the A34 K151E substitution result in longer comet tails, an indication of increased spreading and EEV production, compared to Copenhagen vaccinia virus (IGV-007, top left). C) Representative images of comets formed following infection of BSC-40 cells demonstrate that variant vaccinia viruses with a combination of substitutions in B5 and the A34 K151E substitution result in longer comet tails, an indication of increased spreading and EEV production, compared to Copenhagen vaccinia virus (IGV-007, top left). D) U-2 OS cells were infected with vaccinia virus at a MOI of 1 for 1 hour. Twenty-two hours post-infection, supernatant was collected and used to infect a new plate of cells. Luciferase expression level (measured as RLU) was determined 15 hours post-secondary infection. Luciferase expression level of the variants compared to the luciferase expression level of Copenhagen vaccinia virus containing wild-type A33, A34, and B5 sequences (IGV-007) is reported as a fold increase. Higher luciferase levels were observed for all variant combinations, demonstrating that the variant vaccinia viruses are capable of stronger spread.
