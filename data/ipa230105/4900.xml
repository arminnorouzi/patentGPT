While these operations may deplete the battery, the battery may be recharged and subsequently used to operate the components of the electric vehicle. Battery temperature may influence battery recharging. As one example, an elevated battery temperature may allow the battery to be recharged more quickly as compared with a lower battery temperature. Electric vehicles may include systems to modify or &#x201c;precondition&#x201d; the battery temperature for recharging. Conventional systems may modify battery temperature prior to arrival at a charging station. However, in a fleet of electrical vehicles en route to a limited amount of available chargers, preconditioning the battery of a particular vehicle in conventional preconditioning control systems often fails to account for the conditions of the other vehicles of the fleet. This can lead to downtime and inefficiencies at the charging station, for example, wherein a battery of a first vehicle may be unable to begin charging until a preconditioning operation is complete or a vehicle that has preconditioned and is ready to charge has to wait for another vehicle to finish charging first. As such, there is a constant need for systems and techniques to facilitate battery preconditioning in electric vehicles.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Examples of the present invention are directed to systems and methods for coordinating a fleet of vehicles using preconditioning characteristics from vehicles of the fleet.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one example, a method of coordinating a fleet of vehicles is disclosed. The method includes receiving a first preconditioning characteristic of a first battery from a first vehicle of the fleet of vehicles. The method further incudes receiving a second preconditioning characteristic of a second battery from a second vehicle of the fleet of vehicles. The method further includes comparing the first preconditioning characteristic and the second preconditioning characteristic to determine a preconditioning ranking for the first vehicle and the second vehicle. The method further includes determining a queue of the first and second vehicles for a charging station using the preconditioning ranking of the first and second vehicles.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another example, the method may further include transmitting a first command to the first vehicle to initiate preconditioning of the first battery at a first preconditioning start time based on the preconditioning ranking of the first vehicle. The method may further include transmitting a second command to the second vehicle to initiate preconditioning of the second battery at a second preconditioning start time. The second preconditioning start time may be subsequent to the first preconditioning start time of the first battery, based on the preconditioning ranking of the second vehicle relative to the first vehicle. In this regard, the method may further include modifying the second preconditioning start time to correspond to an availability of the charging station after the charging station completes a charging operation for the first battery.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another example, the first preconditioning characteristic may include a preconditioning time of the first battery, an estimated time of arrival of the first vehicle to the charging station, or an estimated charge time of the first battery. In this regard, the first preconditioning characteristic may include the preconditioning time of the first battery, the estimated time of arrival of the first vehicle to the charging station, and the estimated charge time of the first battery such that the method further includes determining the first preconditioning characteristic by summing the estimated charge time with the higher of: (i) the preconditioning time and the estimated time of arrival.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another example, the first or second preconditioning characteristic may be indicative of a minimum amount of time required to recharge the respective first or second battery at the charging station after a preconditioning operation. Accordingly, determining the preconditioning ranking may further include, in response to the first preconditioning characteristic being less than the second preconditioning characteristic, determining the preconditioning ranking of the first vehicle is prioritized over the preconditioning ranking of the second vehicle. Determining the preconditioning ranking may further include, in response to the second preconditioning characteristic being less than the first preconditioning characteristic, determining the preconditioning ranking of the second vehicle is prioritized over the preconditioning ranking of the first vehicle.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another example, determining the queue further may further include prioritizing usage of the charging station for one of the first vehicle or the second vehicle with the prioritized preconditioning ranking. In some cases, the method may further include determining an override priority of the first vehicle and second vehicle. The method may further include determining the queue further comprising prioritizing usage of the charging station for the one of the first vehicle or the second vehicle with a higher override priority, notwithstanding the respective preconditioning ranking of the first and second vehicles.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another example, a system is disclosed. The system includes a plurality of vehicles, one or more vehicles of the plurality of vehicles having a battery. The system includes a charging station configured to charge the battery of the one or more vehicles. The system further includes a fleet management system comprising a non-transitory computer-readable medium encoded with instructions which, when executed by one or more processing elements of the fleet management system, cause the system to determine a preconditioning characteristic of batteries of the one or more vehicles. The instructions may further cause the system to determine a queue for the one or more vehicles for the charging station using the preconditioning characteristic.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another example, the instructions may further cause the system to determine the preconditioning characteristic by receiving information from the one or more vehicles indicative of a minimum amount of time required to recharge the respective batteries at the charging station after a preconditioning operation. In some cases, the information may include a preconditioning time of a respective battery, an estimated time of arrival of a respective vehicle to the charging station, or an estimated charge time of the respective battery.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another example, the instructions may further cause the system to compare a preconditioning characteristic of a first battery of a first vehicle of the one or more vehicles and a preconditioning characteristic of a second battery of a second vehicle of the one or more vehicles to determine a preconditioning ranking for the first vehicle and the second vehicle. In some cases, the instructions may further cause the system to receive an input from an operator indicative of an override priority for the first vehicle and second vehicle. The instructions may further cause the system to determine the queue for the one or more vehicles by prioritizing usage of the charging station for the one of the first vehicle or the second vehicle with a higher override priority, notwithstanding the respective preconditioning ranking of the first and second vehicles.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another example, the instructions further cause the system to initiate preconditioning of the first battery at a first preconditioning start time based on the preconditioning ranking of the first vehicle. The instructions may further cause the system to initiate preconditioning of the second battery at a second preconditioning start time, the second preconditioning start time being subsequent to the first preconditioning start time of the first battery, based on the preconditioning ranking of the second vehicle relative to the first vehicle.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another example, the instructions may further cause the system to share routing factors among the vehicles of the plurality of vehicles and the fleet management system. The routing factors may include traffic information, battery consumption information, and temperature information of a vehicle of the plurality of the vehicles. In this regard, the instructions may further cause the system to determine the preconditioning characteristics based, in part, on the routing factors. The fleet management system may be executed via a server remote from the plurality of vehicles.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another example, a method of coordinating a fleet of vehicles is disclosed. The method includes determining a preconditioning ranking for a first vehicle and a second vehicle by comparing a first preconditioning characteristic of a first battery of the first vehicle and a second preconditioning characteristic of a second battery of the second vehicle. The method further includes determining a queue of the first and second vehicles for a charging station using the preconditioning ranking of the first and second vehicles. The method further includes determining an override priority of the first vehicle and second vehicle. The method further includes updating the queue based on the override priority.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another example, updating the queue may further include prioritizing usage of the charging station for the one of the first vehicle or the second vehicle with a higher override priority, notwithstanding the respective preconditioning ranking of the first and second vehicles. For example, the first or second preconditioning characteristic may be indicative of a minimum amount of time required to recharge the respective first or second battery at the charging station after a preconditioning operation. In this regard, determining the queue for the first and second vehicles may further include prioritizing usage of the charging station for one of the first vehicle or the second vehicle with a lower minimum amount of time required to recharge. In some cases, determining the override priority further comprises applying a set of rules to the queue.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In addition to the exemplary aspects and embodiments described above, further aspects and embodiments will become apparent by reference to the drawings and by study of the following description.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The disclosure will be readily understood by the following detailed description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate like structural elements, and in which:</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> depicts a schematic view of a system including vehicles traveling to a charging station;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> depicts block diagram of a distributed network for use with the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a functional diagram of a fleet management system and a group of vehicles;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts a functional diagram of a preconditioning characteristic tracking module of the fleet management system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts a functional diagram of a vehicle including an electric motor, a battery, and other components;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> depicts a chart representing a preconditioning ranking for the vehicle of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> depicts a chart representing a queue for the charging station of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts a chart representing a preconditioning start time and a charging start time for vehicles of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> depicts a flow diagram for coordinating a fleet of vehicles, according to implementations of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts a flow diagram for coordinating a fleet of vehicles, according to implementations of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> depicts a schematic view of another system including vehicles traveling to a charging station;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref> depicts a schematic view of a mesh network of the vehicles of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> depicts a functional diagram of another vehicle including an electric motor and a battery;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> depicts a flow diagram for controlling battery preconditioning in a vehicle;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> depicts another flow diagram for controlling battery preconditioning in a vehicle;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> depicts a system in which multiple vehicles are en route to charging stations; and</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> depicts an example schematic diagram of a computer system for implementing various techniques in the examples described herein.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The description that follows includes sample systems, methods, and apparatuses that embody various elements of the present disclosure. However, it should be understood that the described disclosure may be practiced in a variety of forms in addition to those described herein.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The following disclosure relates generally to systems and techniques for monitoring, managing, and/or controlling preconditioning of a battery of a vehicle in a fleet of electric vehicles. A &#x201c;fleet&#x201d; of electric vehicles may include substantially any multi-vehicle system. The vehicles of the multi-vehicle system may be vehicles of a fleet, such as a fleet of vehicles for a particular carrier or for delivery services (e.g., a fleet of delivery vehicles for a particular grocery store, a fleet of taxi-type vehicles for ride services, and so on). Additionally or alternatively, the fleet of vehicles may include substantially any grouping of vehicles that may be configured to communicate with one another. As one example, and as described herein, a multi-vehicle system may be defined by a group of vehicles that are within geographic proximity to a charging station. In some cases, a multi-vehicle system may include vehicles of both a fleet in combination with other electric vehicles.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The vehicles of the multi-vehicle system may be electric vehicles that use a battery as an energy source for an electric motor. For example, the vehicles may be plug-in electric vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, and/or vehicle types. Accordingly, the battery may require recharging after a period of use. Battery temperature may influence recharging. For example, the recharging speed, recharging efficiency, and/or total accepted charge may be based, in part, on battery temperature when charging starts, such as upon arrival of the electric vehicle at a charging station and/or other system that is configured to recharge the battery. Modifying the temperature of a battery of an electric vehicle in preparation of battery recharging is often referred to as &#x201c;preconditioning.&#x201d; The battery temperature may be modified or preconditioned in order to cause the battery to exhibit or otherwise move toward a target preconditioning battery temperature. The target preconditioning battery temperature may be a predetermined temperature of the battery at which the battery exhibits desired charging performance, such as exhibiting a desired recharging speed and/or efficiency.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the case of a multi-vehicle systems, multiple vehicles may be en route to a limited amount of available charging stations. Preconditioning the battery of a particular vehicle without consideration of other vehicles of the fleet may produce suboptimal outcomes, including prolonged delays at a charging station and/or excess resource usage. For example, it may necessary for a vehicle to wait at the charging station for a period of time prior to charging (e.g., where the charging station is occupied by another fleet vehicle). Preconditioning the battery too early may expend excess resources as the vehicle maintains the target preconditioning temperature while waiting for the charging station to become available. Likewise, preconditioning the battery too late may cause delays as the vehicle preconditions the battery while the charging station remains unoccupied or otherwise used inefficiently (i.e., charging is slower than would be possible if the battery had been properly preconditioned). Such delays may multiply and cause substantial vehicle downtime that hinders the efficiency of the fleet.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The systems and techniques of the present disclosure may mitigate such hindrances, in part, by allowing for the coordination of battery preconditioning in one or more vehicles of a multi-vehicle system. Broadly, the present disclosure may allow for vehicle prioritization at a charging station (or group of charging stations) and control of battery preconditioning for the vehicles. In one example, use of the charging station may be prioritized for vehicles that are in a state, condition, or configuration in which the vehicle (relative to other vehicles of the system) can return to service most quickly or efficiently. In this regard, factors such as estimated preconditioning time, battery temperature, estimated time to the charging station, and estimated charge time, among other factors, may be compared across vehicles of the multi-vehicle system to determine an initial or &#x201c;indirect&#x201d; prioritization across the vehicles of the system. Additionally or alternatively, the system may allow for the &#x201c;direct&#x201d; prioritization of the vehicles, such as with the use of hardcoded rules and/or manual inputs or routines that are configured to modify the priority of the vehicle at the charging station, notwithstanding the preconditioning factors. Additionally or alternatively, the system may also allow for the modification of vehicle prioritization based on the availability of the charging station(s) at the destination. In some cases, this may also help conserve resources by allowing vehicles to precondition based on the availability of the charging station.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one example, a method is disclosed for ranking vehicles according to preconditioning characteristics of the vehicles or otherwise comparing vehicles of the multi-vehicle system to determine the indirect prioritization. To illustrate, one or more or all vehicles of the multi-vehicle system may have a preconditioning characteristic. As used herein, &#x201c;preconditioning characteristic&#x201d; may broadly refer to any characteristic, data point, factor, sensor reading, configuration, or similar status associated with preconditioning of the battery of the electric vehicle, charging the battery of the electric vehicle, and/or the relationship between the vehicle and a given charging station. In some embodiments, the preconditioning characteristic may refer to any characteristic or factor affecting the time and efficiency of the vehicle to return to service in consideration of the preconditioning of the battery of the vehicle. As described herein, the preconditioning characteristic may include, among other items, an estimated charge time of the battery of the electric vehicle to fully charge, a preconditioning time of the battery, and/or an estimated of arrival time of the vehicle to the charging station. These and other factors may be analyzed in order to determine the preconditioning characteristic for multiple vehicles of the multi-vehicle system. In some cases, the preconditioning characteristic may represent a score or metric that is indicative of the time in which a particular vehicle may return to service in light of the time constraints of preconditioning, travel of the vehicle to the charging station, the vehicle's status and prioritization relative to other vehicles at or approaching the charging station, and the amount of time needed for charging.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Example methods disclosed herein may include comparing the preconditioning characteristic of multiple vehicles of the multi-vehicle system in order to determine a ranking of the vehicles for a given charging station. To illustrate, a computing system, which may operate remote from the vehicles, may receive a first preconditioning characteristic of a first battery from a first vehicle of the fleet of vehicles. The computing system may further receive a second preconditioning characteristic of a second battery from a second vehicle of the fleet of vehicles. The computing system may further compare the first and second preconditioning characteristics to determine a preconditioning ranking for the first vehicle and the second vehicle at the charging station. In the illustrative method, the preconditioning characteristic may be indicative of a minimum amount of time required to recharge the respective first and second battery at the charging station after a preconditioning operation. In this regard, the vehicle with the preconditioning characteristic having the lowest value may be prioritized or have a higher ranking at the charging station than other vehicles.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In another example, methods disclosed herein include determining a queue or charging assignment of vehicles for the charging station using the preconditioning ranking. In one example, the preconditioning ranking (or &#x201c;priority ranking&#x201d;) may correspond to an ordered list of vehicles based on the preconditioning characteristics of the vehicles. The queue of vehicles may therefore correspond to an order of the vehicles for charging at the charging station. In some cases, the queue of vehicles may be the same as the preconditioning ranking of vehicles. In other cases, the systems techniques disclosed herein may allow for the queue to be based on the preconditioning ranking, and updated and modified as needed based on a set of hardcoded rules and/or user inputs. In this regard, the method may include determining an override priority that prioritizes one of the first or second vehicles, and updating the queue based on the override priority. The override priority may allow for the direct prioritization of the vehicles, such as by a manager of a fleet and other criteria the prioritizes a first vehicle over a second (e.g., prioritizing an emergency vehicle at a charging station over a commercial or private vehicle).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The queue may be further updated, according to the methods disclosed herein, based on the status of charging station(s) and vehicles at a given destination. To illustrate, the availability of a charging station may influence the priority of particular assigned vehicles at the station. Where a particular charging station is occupied by a first vehicle, a second vehicle may have a status indicating a longer time to return to service, notwithstanding the preconditioning status of the second vehicle. Further, where a charging station is occupied by a first vehicle, the second vehicle may be restricted from preconditioning too early in order to conserve its system resources. The charging station may be one of multiple charging stations at a charging depot. The queue may therefore be updated to include not only a prioritization or order of the vehicles for charging, but also an assignment of the vehicles at particular charging stations of the charging depot, based on the availability and preconditioning factors, as described herein.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Further, disclosed herein are methods for controlling preconditioning in one or more of the vehicles based in the preconditioning ranking and/or queue. For example, the preconditioning ranking and/or queue may be determined as described generally above. A given vehicle of the multi-vehicle system may initiate a preconditioning operation based on the position of the respective vehicle in the ranking or queue. The preconditioning operation may be based on a time at which the vehicle anticipates initiating charging at the charging station, in light of the ranking or queue. In some cases, the preconditioning operation may occur while the vehicle is en route to the charging station such that the battery of the vehicle reaches a target preconditioning temperature generally around when the charging station is available for charging the given vehicle. Route-based preconditioning and other factors of the vehicle may be used to determine a time at which the vehicle initiates preconditioning such that the battery reaches the target preconditioning temperature at around the time of availability of the charging station. One such route-based preconditioning technique and system is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 17/365,305 (Attorney Docket No. P291816.US.01_511453-10), entitled &#x201c;ROUTE BASED BATTERY PRECONDITIONING SYSTEMS AND METHODS,&#x201d; which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In other cases, the vehicle may begin the preconditioning operation at the charging station, for example, while waiting for the charging station to become available.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As described herein, a non-transitory computer-readable medium may be encoded with instructions which, when executed by one or more processing elements, cause the vehicle or remote system to perform one or more or all of the techniques described herein. The instructions may be elements of a fleet management system. The fleet management system may operate or execute on a server that may be remote from the vehicles.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In other cases, the fleet management system may operate at least partially on individual vehicles of the multi-vehicle system. The fleet management system may therefore facilitate vehicle prioritization and queue formation among vehicles, such as (optionally) without overt prioritization control from a remote server. For example, the vehicles of the multi-vehicle system may be communicatively coupled over a mesh network or other protocol that allows for communications among the vehicles. The mesh network may allow the vehicles to send and receive signals with one another in a dynamic and non-hierarchical manner. In one illustration, a first vehicle of the system may determine a preconditioning characteristic for a first battery of the first vehicle and may broadcast the first preconditioning characteristic across the network. A second vehicle (along with optionally many other vehicles of the multi-vehicle system) may also determine a second preconditioning characteristic and broadcast the second preconditioning characteristic across the network. The first vehicle may receive the second preconditioning characteristic from the second vehicle and compare the second preconditioning characteristic to the first preconditioning characteristic in order to determine the ranking and/or queue, as described herein. The second vehicle may similarly determine the ranking and/or queue by comparing the first preconditioning characteristic received from the first vehicle to the second preconditioning characteristic. In some cases, the first and/or second or other vehicles may communicate the determined rankings or queues with one another and resolve any discrepancies in order to establish a final ranking or queue at the charging station.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Reference will now be made to the accompanying drawings, which assist in illustrating various features of the present disclosure. The following description is presented for purposes of illustration and description. Furthermore, the description is not intended to limit the inventive aspects to the forms disclosed herein. Consequently, variations and modifications commensurate with the following teachings, and skill and knowledge of the relevant art, are within the scope of the present inventive aspects.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> depicts a schematic view of a multi-vehicle system <b>100</b>. The multi-vehicle system <b>100</b> may be a system including one or more fleets of electric vehicles. For example, the multi-vehicle system <b>100</b> may include one or more fleets of electric vehicles from a particular coordinated operation (e.g., a fleet of delivery vehicles, shipping vehicles, taxis, buses, or other public transportation). In this respect, a &#x201c;fleet&#x201d; can refer to multiple vehicles that are co-owned or operated by a single entity or organization. In other cases, the electric vehicles of the multi-vehicle system <b>100</b> may be vehicles of separate fleets and/or individual vehicles that are not necessarily associated with a fleet. For example, a &#x201c;fleet&#x201d; can include multiple vehicles which are owned by multiple parties or entities but that work together via compatible installed software applications or that all enroll in a fleet administration service provided by a single party or entity.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, a first vehicle <b>110</b>, a second vehicle <b>130</b>, and a third vehicle <b>150</b> are shown relative to a charging station <b>104</b>. The charging station <b>104</b> may be or include any appropriate components that are adapted to facilitate the charging of a battery of an electric vehicle. For purposes of illustration, the charging station <b>104</b> is shown as a single charging station in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. In other cases, the charging station <b>104</b> may be one of a group of charging stations in a charging depot or other arrangement in which multiple charging stations are arranged in order to charge one or more vehicles simultaneously (e.g., charging depot <b>1310</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">One or more (e.g., all) of the vehicles of the multi-vehicle system <b>100</b> may be electric vehicles en route to the charging station <b>104</b>.

Each of the vehicle routes <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>c </i>may be associated with an estimated time of arrival of the respective vehicle to the charging station <b>104</b>. Each of the vehicle routes <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>c </i>may also be associated with projected route-based conditions that impact battery temperature and preconditioning, such as route elevation, traffic conditions, route speed, route acceleration profiles change in route elevation, vehicle weight, speed preferences, and so on.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Each of the vehicles <b>110</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>150</b> may also be associated with or have information indicative of a condition of the battery of the respective vehicle.

The vehicle metrics <b>190</b> represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> include a preconditioning time <b>192</b> and a charge time <b>194</b>. The preconditioning time <b>192</b> may include information associated with a predicted time or required duration for the first vehicle <b>110</b> to precondition the first battery <b>114</b> to a target preconditioning temperature. The charge time <b>194</b> may include information associated with a predicted time or required duration for the first battery <b>114</b> to be fully or partially recharged at the charging station <b>104</b> (e.g., the time required to bring the battery charge to a predetermined value, whether that value is a full charge (i.e., 100% SOC) or a partial charge (e.g., 80% SOC)). In other cases, the vehicle metrics <b>190</b> may include additional information, such as battery temperature, route information, vehicle performance data, and so on.

For example, the fleet management system <b>180</b> may operate to determine a prioritization or ranking of the vehicles <b>110</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>150</b> relative to the charging station <b>104</b>. For example, the fleet management system <b>180</b> may receive information from one or more of the vehicles <b>110</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>150</b> related to a preconditioning characteristic, as defined herein, and rank the vehicles <b>110</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>150</b> for charging priority at the charging station <b>104</b> based, in part, on the preconditioning characteristic. The fleet management system <b>180</b> may further operate to determine a queue of the vehicles <b>110</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>150</b> at the charging station <b>104</b>. For example, the fleet management system <b>180</b> may apply a set of hardcoded rules and/or manual user inputs to vary the priority ranking of the vehicles at the charging station <b>104</b>. The fleet management system <b>180</b> may be further configured to analyze the present and future anticipated usage of the charging station <b>104</b> and update the queue accordingly. The fleet management system <b>180</b> may further facilitate one or more preconditioning operations in the respective vehicles <b>110</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>150</b>. As one example, the fleet management system <b>180</b> may issue one or more commands to respective vehicles to initiate a preconditioning operation, based on the priority ranking and/or queue position of the respective vehicle relative to the charging station <b>104</b>. The fleet management system <b>180</b> is shown in the example block diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> as a separate element than the vehicles <b>110</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>150</b>. In other examples, such as those described below in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>12</b></figref>, the fleet management system <b>180</b> may operate at least partially via a computing device of one or more vehicles of the system.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a functional diagram of a fleet management system <b>200</b> is shown. The fleet management system <b>200</b> is presented as an example implementation of the fleet management system <b>180</b> described above. Various functional modules and operations of the fleet management system <b>200</b> are presented in detail below. It will be appreciated that more or fewer modules and operations may be used for a given implementation.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the fleet management system <b>200</b> including a vehicle registration module <b>202</b>. The vehicle registration module may be configured to obtain registration information for one or more vehicles of a multi-vehicle system, such as any of the multi-vehicle systems described herein. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a multi-vehicle system <b>230</b> may include a first vehicle <b>232</b> and a subsequent vehicle <b>234</b> (e.g., up to any whole number &#x201c;n&#x201d; of vehicles). The first vehicle <b>232</b> and the subsequent vehicle <b>234</b> may be vehicles of a fleet of vehicles. The first vehicle <b>232</b> and the subsequent vehicle <b>234</b> may be vehicles en route to a charging station (e.g., charging station <b>104</b>). The fleet management system <b>200</b> is configured to determine a priority ranking and/or queue of the vehicles of the multi-vehicle system <b>230</b> relative to the charging station. In this regard, the vehicle registration module <b>202</b> may receive information from the first vehicle <b>232</b>, the subsequent vehicle <b>234</b>, and/or other vehicles of the system <b>230</b>. The received information may be indicative of an intention of the first vehicle <b>232</b>, subsequent vehicle <b>234</b>, and so on to charge at a particular charging station. The vehicle registration module <b>202</b> may receive information from the vehicles <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> automatically, such as when the vehicles <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> are within proximity to a particular charging station, reach certain milestones along a route, and so on. In other cases, the vehicle registration module <b>202</b> may receive information from the vehicles <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> in response to an input from a user of the vehicle, a remote operator, and/or other prompt that causes the respective vehicle to be registered for potential charging at the identified charging station.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some cases, the vehicle registration module <b>202</b> may receive information from the vehicles <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> indicative of an intention to charge at a particular charging station and other information associated with the vehicles <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> may be known by the fleet management system <b>200</b>. Other information associated with the vehicles <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> may include, without limitation, certain identifying information of the vehicle (e.g., make, model, battery information, and so on), identifying information of an operator of the vehicle (e.g., name, contact information, licensing, and so on), information associated with a load of the vehicle (e.g., weight, type, criticality, and so on), and the like. In other cases, the vehicle registration module <b>202</b> may receive such information from the vehicle <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> as part of a registration operation of the vehicles <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> with the identified charging station. As described herein, such additional information may be used by the fleet management system in order to update a queue for the charging station.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The fleet management system <b>200</b> may further include a preconditioning characteristic tracking module <b>204</b>. The preconditioning characteristic tracking module <b>204</b> may be configured to receive information from one or more of the vehicles of the multi-vehicle system <b>230</b> associated with battery preconditioning information for the vehicles. For example, and as shown with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the preconditioning characteristic tracking module <b>204</b> may include information, such as battery preconditioning time information <b>220</b>, estimated time of arrival information <b>222</b>, estimated charge time information <b>224</b>, and/or other information <b>226</b>. The preconditioning characteristic tracking module <b>204</b> may receive these and other factors in order to determine a preconditioning characteristic for one or more vehicles of the multi-vehicle system <b>230</b>. The preconditioning characteristic may be a score or metric determined for a particular vehicle that is indicative of a preconditioning status of the vehicle. More generally, the score or metric may be indicative of the amount time of time required to return the vehicle to service after charging at the identified charging station and after executing a preconditioning operation that allows the vehicle to charge at the charging station.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The preconditioning characteristic tracking module <b>204</b> may be configured to determine the preconditioning characteristic based on a variety of algorithms, which may be updated at the fleet and/or vehicle level from time to time. In one example, the preconditioning characteristic tracking module <b>204</b> may determine the preconditioning characteristic for a given vehicle by summing a value of the estimated charge time information with the higher of: (i) a value of the battery preconditioning time information <b>220</b>; and (ii) a value of the estimated time of arrival information <b>222</b>. Adding the estimated charge time or time to charge the battery may enhance the accuracy of determining a minimum amount of time for a vehicle to return to service. The value of the estimate time of arrival information <b>222</b> may be measured with respect to a present position of the vehicle relative to the identified charging station along a route. The value of the battery preconditioning time information <b>220</b> and the value of the estimated time of arrival information <b>222</b> may be based on the present and anticipated future state of the battery of the vehicle. Accordingly, with use of this sample algorithm, a relatively lower preconditioning characteristic may be indicative of a lower amount of time for the vehicle to return to service post-charging and post-preconditioning, whereas a relatively higher preconditioning characteristic may be indicative of a higher amount of time for the vehicle to return to service post-charging and post-preconditioning. In other cases, other algorithms may be used, and the preconditioning characteristic may be indicative of other relationships between the vehicle and the charging station, based on information associated with preconditioning the battery of the vehicle. In this regard, the initial ordering (e.g., based on the preconditioning characteristic) may be based on any synthesized calculation of multiple variables (e.g., calculated by a vehicle and transmitted to the management system and/or among the vehicles), a singular statistic (e.g., vehicles with the greatest loads go first), or multiple independent variable unsynthesized calculations (e.g., sent to the management system, and the management system applies a set of weights/algorithms to determine which factors to prioritize). In this regard, the ordering of the vehicles can be done by either the vehicle or the management system, as described herein.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The fleet management system <b>200</b> may further include a preconditioning characteristic comparison module <b>206</b>. The preconditioning characteristic comparison module <b>206</b> may operate to compare preconditioning characteristics from multiple vehicles across the multi-vehicle system <b>230</b>. For example, the preconditioning characteristic comparison module <b>206</b> may compare a first preconditioning characteristic from the first vehicle <b>232</b> and a second preconditioning characteristic from the subsequent vehicle <b>234</b>. In some cases, the preconditioning characteristic comparison module <b>206</b> may be operated to apply a weighting function and/or other metric to the various preconditioning characteristics from the vehicles across the multi-vehicle system <b>230</b>. This may allow the preconditioning characteristic comparison module <b>206</b> to compare values of the preconditioning characteristic that are comparable data points or representative of comparable circumstances across the vehicles or otherwise statistically comparable pieces of information. As one example, the preconditioning characteristic comparison module <b>206</b> may account for differences in vehicle type, battery type, preconditioning equipment of the vehicle, and so on such that comparison of the first and second preconditioning condition is a comparison of like data that may be representative or otherwise adjust for present conditions. In this regard, the preconditioning characteristic comparison module <b>206</b> may also be configured to access multiple data points from the vehicle in order to facilitate the foregoing comparison. As such, each vehicle may calculate a return to service metric or time and/or send raw data (e.g., time to charger, charging time, preconditioning time, and so on) for the preconditioning characteristic comparison module <b>206</b> to apply the weighting functions and compare the data points across a plurality of vehicles.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The fleet management system <b>200</b> may further include a vehicle ranking module <b>208</b>. The vehicle ranking module <b>208</b> may be configured to determine a priority ranking of the vehicles of the multi-vehicle system <b>230</b> relative to an identified charging station. The vehicle ranking module <b>208</b> may rank the vehicles based on an output from the preconditioning characteristic comparison module <b>206</b>. For example, the vehicle ranking module <b>208</b> may order the vehicles of the multi-vehicle system <b>230</b> in a descending or ascending order based on the preconditioning characteristic value. In a case where the preconditioning characteristic is representative of a minimum amount of time required to recharge the battery of a given vehicle, the vehicle ranking module <b>208</b> may sort the vehicles such that a highest priority is assigned to the vehicle having the lowest value of a preconditioning characteristic. In this regard, the vehicle which can return to service the quickest post-charging and post-preconditioning may be prioritized at the charging station. Subsequent vehicles may thus be assigned a lower priority as a result of having a higher value of the preconditioning characteristic, which is indicative of the subsequent vehicle requiring a longer amount of time to return to service post-charging and post-preconditioning.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The fleet management system <b>200</b> may further optionally include a ranking override module <b>210</b>. The ranking override module <b>210</b> may allow the fleet management system <b>200</b> to apply a set of hardcoded rules and/or user input to change a priority of the vehicles relative to the charging station. For example, the vehicle ranking module <b>208</b> may output a prioritized ranking of the vehicles based on preconditioning factors, and the ranking override module <b>210</b> may update or modify the prioritized ranking based on additional factors. As one example, the ranking override module <b>210</b> may include a set of rules that increase the priority of certain vehicle types at the charging station (e.g., an emergency vehicle has a higher priority than a commercial or private-user vehicle). As another example, the ranking override module <b>210</b> may include a set of rules that increase the priority of certain vehicles based on any of a range of other criteria, including route type, load type, delivery criticality type, payment status (e.g., prioritizing higher-paying charging customers or deprioritizing charging customers with poor payment history), and so on. Additionally or alternatively, the ranking override module <b>210</b> may be operable to receive an override priority or override input that increases or decreases a priority of a vehicle at the charging station, notwithstanding preconditioning characteristics. For example, the fleet management system <b>200</b> may be operable to receive an input from a fleet manager that prioritizes a certain vehicle over another at the charging station for business-related reasons or other reasons.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The fleet management system <b>200</b> may further include a queue determination module <b>212</b>. The queue determination module <b>212</b> may operate to set a queue for the identified charging station. For example, the queue determination module <b>212</b> may determine an order of the first vehicle <b>232</b>, the subsequent vehicle <b>234</b> and/or any other vehicles for charging at the identified charging station. The queue determination module <b>212</b> may determine an order of the vehicles based on an output from the vehicle ranking module <b>208</b>. For example, the queue determination module <b>212</b> may set a queue for the charging station based on the preconditioning ranking. The queue determination module <b>212</b> may further determine an order of the vehicles based on an output from the ranking override module <b>210</b>. For example, the queue determination module <b>212</b> may set the queue for the charging station as modified by the override priority determined by the set of hardcoded rules and/or user inputs. The queue determination module <b>212</b> may also operate to determine a queue for multiple charging stations of a charging depot or other common location having multiple charging stations, as described in greater detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. The queue determination module <b>212</b>, in cooperation with communication components of the system described herein, may communicate the queue to the vehicles of the multi-vehicle system <b>230</b>, the charging station, and/or other elements of the system as appropriate for a given application.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The fleet management system <b>200</b> may further include a preconditioning command module <b>214</b>. The preconditioning command module <b>214</b> may be configured to issue one or more commands to the vehicles of the multi-vehicle system <b>230</b> regarding a preconditioning start time. For example, the preconditioning command module <b>214</b> may be operable to cause a transmission of information to the vehicles of the multi-vehicle system <b>230</b> regarding a target preconditioning start time. The target preconditioning start time may be a time at which the vehicle may begin a preconditioning operation such that the battery of the vehicle will have a temperature at or substantially near a target preconditioning temperature at or around the time at which the charging station is available for the charging the vehicle. The target preconditioning start time may be tailored based on the queue determined by the queue determination module <b>212</b>. In one example, a vehicle may be en route to an open charging station, and the target preconditioning time may be a time such that the battery temperature reaches the target preconditioning temperature upon the arrival of the vehicle at the charging station. As another example, a vehicle may be en route to an occupied charging station, and the target preconditioning time may be a time such that the battery temperature reaches the target preconditioning temperature upon the anticipated time at which the charging station become available for charging by the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In one example, the fleet management system <b>200</b> may operate remote from one or more vehicles of a multi-vehicle system.

In the present example, the temperature sensor may be configured to detect a temperature of the battery <b>114</b>. In this regard, the temperature sensor may be used to determine a difference between the temperature of the battery <b>114</b> and one or more target temperatures, such as a target preconditioning temperature (e.g., temperatures <b>614</b>, <b>634</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> further illustrates, schematically, a temperature control unit <b>118</b>.

The preconditioning characteristic axis <b>504</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> may be substantially analogous to the preconditioning axis <b>504</b> described above in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, with the value of the first vehicle preconditioning characteristic <b>510</b>, the second vehicle preconditioning characteristic <b>530</b>, and the third vehicle preconditioning characteristic <b>550</b> plot relative to the axis <b>504</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The fleet management system <b>200</b> may be configured to update the priority ranking (e.g., the ranking shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>) based on a variety of conditions and factors. As one example, the fleet management system <b>200</b> may update the priority ranking based on an override priority. For example, the priority ranking may be updated based on a set of hardcoded rules, user inputs, and/or otherwise updated such that the order of the vehicles in the queue is updated based on additional factors than those considered during the priority ranking, including factors that are not related to battery preconditioning.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, the fleet management system <b>200</b> may operate to apply an override priority in order to update the queue from the priority ranking shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>. To illustrate, the override priority may be associated with a set of rules that change the priority of the third vehicle <b>150</b> in the queue. The set of rules may change the priority of the third vehicle <b>150</b> in the queue notwithstanding the value of the third preconditioning characteristic <b>550</b>. For example, the third vehicle <b>150</b> may be a vehicle associated with the delivery of critical goods. The override priority may thus increase the position of the third vehicle <b>150</b> in the queue so that the third vehicle <b>150</b> may charge at the charging station <b>104</b> prior to the other vehicles. Accordingly, the chart <b>500</b><i>b </i>shows the third preconditioning characteristic <b>550</b> (representative of the third vehicle <b>150</b>) at the value of q<sub>1 </sub>on the axis <b>508</b>, which may represent a first or highest position in a queue for a vehicle to use the charging station <b>104</b>. As another example, the override priority may be associated with a set of rules that change the priority of the first vehicle <b>110</b> in the queue notwithstanding the value of the first preconditioning characteristic <b>510</b>. For example, the first vehicle <b>110</b> may be a vehicle identified by a fleet manager as requiring urgent recharging. The override priority may thus increase the position of the first vehicle <b>110</b> in the queue so that the first vehicle <b>110</b> may charge at the charging station <b>104</b> sooner that the first vehicle <b>110</b> otherwise would, based on the first preconditioning characteristic <b>510</b>. Accordingly, the chart <b>500</b><i>b </i>shows the third precondition characteristic <b>550</b> (representative of the third vehicle <b>150</b>) at the value of q<sub>2 </sub>on the axis <b>508</b>, which may represent a second or next position in the queue. In this regard, the override priority increases the priority of the first vehicle in the queue by one position, but does not necessarily operate to increase the priority of the first vehicle to the top position, i.e., the third vehicle remains in the top position, notwithstanding the override priority applied to the first vehicle. Further, the override priority may not necessarily apply to the second vehicle <b>130</b>, and thus the chart <b>500</b><i>b </i>shows the second precondition characteristic <b>530</b> (representative of the second vehicle <b>130</b>) at the value q<sub>3 </sub>on the axis <b>508</b> may represent a third or next highest priority ranking.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Based on the queue shown in the chart <b>500</b><i>b</i>, the vehicles of the system <b>100</b> may use the charging station <b>104</b> in the following order: the third vehicle <b>150</b>, the first vehicle <b>110</b>, and the second vehicle <b>130</b>. The fleet management system <b>200</b> may update the queue shown in the chart <b>500</b><i>b </i>from time to time. For example, the fleet management system <b>200</b> may send and receive information with the vehicles <b>110</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>150</b> in order to reassess the position in the queue. For example, an override priority for a particular vehicle may change over time, such as where a fleet manager decides a vehicle no longer requires urgent recharging. The priority may also change based on a distance of the vehicle from the charging station. As one example, while the third vehicle of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> may have the highest priority in the queue, the third vehicle may be at a substantial distance from the charging station as compared with other, lower-priority vehicles. In this regard, the systems and techniques described herein may allow lower-priority vehicles the ability to charge (including partial charges) at the charging station, in anticipation of the higher-priority vehicle taking longer to arrive at the charging station than other vehicles. Therefore, rather than a static determination, the chart <b>500</b><i>b </i>may be representative of a queue of the vehicles at a single point in time, which may be updated in light of substantially real time conditions of the multi-vehicle system. Thus, vehicles can be promoted or demoted in the queue from time to time based on changing vehicle, fleet, and/or charging station conditions.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The fleet management system <b>200</b> may also be configured to coordinate battery preconditioning across a fleet of vehicles based on the availability of the charging station. For example, the fleet management system <b>200</b> may be configured to issue one or more commands to vehicles of the fleet to begin a battery preconditioning operation at a time such that the battery will reach a target preconditioning temperature upon arrival at the charging station. In some cases, the vehicle will begin preconditioning en route to the charging station, whereas in other cases the vehicle will precondition while at the charging station, based on an availability of the charging station and a time until that particular vehicle will be able to begin charging. In other cases, the vehicle may precondition both while en route to the charging station and can continue preconditioning at the charging station.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">To illustrate the foregoing, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a chart <b>600</b>. The chart <b>600</b> includes a time axis <b>602</b> and a temperature axis <b>604</b>. The temperature axis <b>604</b> may be indicative of battery temperature for one or more vehicles that is plotted as a function of time on the time axis <b>602</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the chart <b>600</b> shows a temperature curve <b>610</b> of a first battery of a first vehicle during vehicle operation and during a preconditioning operation. The chart <b>600</b> further shows a temperature curve <b>630</b> of a second battery of the second vehicle during vehicle operation and during a preconditioning operation. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the first vehicle and the second vehicle may each be en route to charge at the same charging station. The fleet management system <b>200</b> may operate, among other functions, to coordinate the preconditioning of the second battery such that the second battery reaches a target preconditioning temperature upon the charging station becoming available for charging the second vehicle.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">By way of illustration, the temperature curve <b>610</b> is shown as including a vehicle operation portion <b>610</b><i>a </i>and a preconditioning portion <b>610</b><i>b</i>. The vehicle operation portion <b>610</b><i>a </i>may represent a temperature of the battery during driving operations of the vehicle and prior to the initiation of preconditioning procedures. The precondition portion <b>610</b><i>b </i>may represent a temperature of the battery during a preconditioning operation, which may or may not occur en route to the charging station. At a time t<sub>P1</sub>, the curve <b>610</b> may transition from the vehicle operation portion <b>610</b><i>a </i>to the precondition portion <b>610</b><i>b</i>. For example, the battery of the first vehicle may have a temperature <b>612</b> at the time t<sub>P1 </sub>and the first vehicle may begin to modify the temperature of the battery such that the battery reaches a target preconditioning temperature <b>614</b> at a time t<sub>C1</sub>. The first vehicle may begin to charge at the charging station at the time t<sub>C1</sub>; a total charge time of the first vehicle may be represented by a time t<sub>CT </sub>on the chart <b>600</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The second temperature curve <b>630</b> may also have a vehicle operation portion <b>630</b><i>a </i>and a preconditioning portion <b>630</b><i>b</i>. The fleet management system <b>200</b> may operate to facilitate the preconditioning of the second battery represented by the second temperature curve <b>630</b> such that the second battery has a target preconditioning temperature when the first vehicle has completed charging. For example, the fleet management system <b>200</b> may issue one or more commands to the second vehicle such that the second vehicle initiates a preconditioning operation at a time t<sub>P2</sub>. The second battery has a battery temperature of <b>632</b> at the time t<sub>P2</sub>. The time t<sub>P2 </sub>may be a time at which the second vehicle may precondition the second battery to reach a target preconditioning temperature <b>634</b> when the charging station is available for the charging the second vehicle. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the second vehicle may precondition the second battery such that the second battery has the target preconditioning temperature at a time t<sub>C2</sub>. The time t<sub>C2 </sub>may correspond to a time at which the first vehicle has completed charging the first battery. For example, the time t<sub>C2 </sub>may be equal to the sum of t<sub>C2 </sub>and t<sub>CT</sub>. By modifying the temperature of the battery based on the availability of the charging station, the system may avoid preconditioning the battery too early, which may help conserve energy. The system may also help reduce delays by avoiding preconditioning too late, which could result in a vehicle preconditioning while a charging station remains available for otherwise charging the battery.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">To facilitate the reader's understanding of the various functionalities of the embodiments discussed herein, reference is now made to the flow diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, which illustrate processes <b>700</b> and <b>800</b>, respectively.

In some cases, the fleet management system <b>928</b> may determine the second preconditioning characteristic and broadcast the second preconditioning characteristic to vehicles with the range <b>908</b>, such as the first vehicle <b>910</b>.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">At operation <b>1116</b>, the first preconditioning characteristic and the second preconditioning characteristic are compared to determine a preconditioning ranking for the first vehicle and the second vehicle. For example, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the fleet management system <b>924</b> may compare the first and second preconditioning characteristics. The fleet management system <b>924</b> may compare the first and second preconditioning characteristics in order to determine which of the first and second vehicle requires the least amount of time to recharge the respective vehicles battery at a charging station after a preconditioning operation.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">At operation <b>1120</b>, a queue of the first and second vehicles for the charging station is determined using the preconditioning ranking of the first and second vehicles. For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the fleet management system <b>924</b> may determine a queue for the charging station based on the ranking preconditioning characteristics. In some cases, the fleet management system <b>924</b> may additionally reorder or rearrange the order of the vehicles at the charging station, for example, based on other factors, such as the priority ranking, described herein.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Additionally, the fleet management system <b>924</b> may communicate the determined priority ranking and/or queue to other vehicles of the multi-vehicle system <b>900</b> and/or to the charging station <b>906</b>. For example, the fleet management system <b>924</b> may cause the communications unit <b>926</b> to broadcast a signal to other vehicles regarding the priority ranking or queue, as determined by the first vehicle <b>910</b>. The second vehicle <b>930</b> and/or other vehicles of the multi-vehicle system may also broadcast the determination of the queue, as determined by at least one vehicle, to other vehicles of the network. This exchange of priority rankings and queue determinations may allow vehicles in the multi-vehicle system to validate the determinations and resolve discrepancies therebetween. As an illustration, where two vehicles reach different queue determinations, the queue determinations of other vehicles of the multi-vehicle system may be considered in the aggregate to validate the queue determination of one of the vehicles. The validated queue may then be propagated to other vehicles of the network and/or the charging station <b>906</b>.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, another method of controlling battery preconditioning in a vehicles is disclosed. At operation <b>1204</b>, a preconditioning ranking for the first vehicle and a second vehicles are determined, at a first vehicle, by comparing a first preconditioning characteristic of a first battery of the first vehicle and a second preconditioning characteristic of a second battery of a second vehicle. For example, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>10</b></figref>, the fleet management system <b>924</b> may compare the first and second preconditioning characteristics. The fleet management system <b>924</b> may compare the first and second preconditioning characteristics in order to determine which of the first and second vehicle requires the least amount of time to recharge the respective vehicles battery at a charging station after a preconditioning operation.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">At operation <b>1208</b>, a queue of the first and second vehicles for a charging station is determined using the preconditioning ranking of the first and second vehicles. For example, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>10</b></figref>, the fleet management system <b>924</b> may determine a queue for the charging station based on the ranked preconditioning characteristics. In the example of operation <b>1208</b>, the queue may generally be the same as the priority ranking determined at the operation <b>1204</b> based on the preconditioning characteristics.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">At operation <b>1212</b>, an override priority of the first vehicle and second vehicle is determined. For example, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>10</b></figref>, the fleet management system <b>924</b> may determine an override priority for the queue. In one example, the fleet management system <b>924</b> may determine an override priority based on an input from a user, such as a fleet manager, to increase or decrease the priority of a vehicle within the queue. In other cases, the presence or absence of certain vehicle types may trigger a set of rules that prompt a reordering of vehicles in the queue. At operation <b>1216</b>, the queue is updated based on the override priority. For example, and with reference to FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>10</b>, the fleet management system <b>924</b> may update the queue in order to change the order of vehicles for charging at the charging station based on the override priority.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">The systems and techniques described herein may be used to determine a priority ranking and/or a queue for vehicles of a multi-vehicle system en route to a group of charging stations. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> depicts a multi-vehicle system <b>1300</b> in which multiple vehicles, such as a first vehicle <b>1306</b><i>a </i>and a second vehicle <b>1306</b><i>b</i>, are en route to a charging depot <b>1310</b>. The charging depot <b>1310</b> may include a first charging station <b>1314</b><i>a</i>, a second charging station <b>1314</b><i>b</i>, and a third charging station <b>1314</b><i>c</i>. The systems and techniques described herein may be configured to determine the priority ranking and/or queue based, in part, on an availability of the charging stations <b>1314</b><i>a</i>-<b>1314</b><i>c </i>for charging in addition to the preconditioning characteristics described herein. In this regard, an electric vehicle may initiate preconditioning of a battery of vehicle at a time such that the conclusion of the preconditioning operation substantially coincides with the time at which a charging station becomes available for charging a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">For purpose of illustration, the multi-vehicle system <b>1300</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> as including a roadway network <b>1302</b>, an intersection <b>1303</b>, an environment <b>1304</b>, and traffic <b>1309</b>. The first and second vehicles <b>1306</b><i>a</i>, <b>1306</b><i>b </i>may navigate these and other conditions en route to the charging depot <b>1310</b>. As described herein, a fleet management system, operating remotely and/or partially or fully internally on one of the vehicles, may facilitate the preconditioning of the vehicle's battery at least partially based on these and other factors, referred to herein as route-based preconditioning factors. Additionally, the fleet management system may be configured to determine a priority ranking and/or queue for the vehicles <b>1306</b><i>a</i>, <b>1306</b><i>b </i>based on the preconditioning factors, as described herein. Further, and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the fleet management system may be configured to determine, update, or modify a priority ranking or queue based on the availability of the charging stations <b>1314</b><i>a</i>-<b>1314</b><i>c </i>of the charging depot <b>1310</b>.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">By way of illustration, the first charging station <b>1314</b><i>a </i>is shown charging a charging vehicle <b>1316</b><i>a</i>. A waiting vehicle <b>1316</b><i>b </i>is shown waiting for the first charging station <b>1314</b><i>a </i>to become available for charging. The waiting vehicle <b>1316</b><i>b </i>may be waiting for the first charging station <b>1314</b><i>a </i>(as opposed to charging at the otherwise available third charging station <b>1314</b><i>c</i>) for example due to an override priority, such as one of the first or second vehicles <b>1306</b><i>a</i>, <b>1306</b><i>b </i>having priority at the third charging station <b>1314</b><i>c</i>, based on the systems and techniques described herein. The second charging station <b>1314</b><i>b </i>is shown charging a charging vehicle <b>1318</b><i>a</i>. A waiting spot <b>1318</b><i>b </i>is indicated relative to the second charging station <b>1314</b><i>b </i>at which a vehicle may wait for the second charging station <b>1314</b><i>b </i>to become available. The third charging station <b>1314</b><i>c </i>is shown with a charging spot <b>1320</b><i>a </i>indicated at which a vehicle may park while using the third charging station <b>1314</b><i>a</i>. A waiting spot <b>1320</b><i>b </i>is shown relative to the third charging station <b>1314</b><i>c </i>at which a vehicle may wait for the charging station <b>1314</b><i>c </i>to become available (while the third charging station <b>1314</b><i>c </i>is in use).</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">The fleet managements systems described herein may update the queue based on the availability of the charging stations <b>1314</b><i>a</i>-<b>1314</b><i>c</i>. For example, the fleet management system may assign one of the first or second vehicles <b>1306</b><i>a</i>, <b>1306</b><i>b </i>to the third charging station <b>1314</b><i>c </i>since the third charging station <b>1314</b><i>c </i>in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is not occupied by a charging vehicle. In one instance, the feet management system may analyze a depot travel route or depot path <b>1307</b><i>a </i>of the first vehicle <b>1306</b><i>a </i>to the charging depot <b>1310</b> and a depot path <b>1307</b><i>b </i>of the second vehicle <b>1306</b><i>b </i>to the charging depot <b>1310</b>. The fleet management system may determine which of the first or second vehicles <b>1306</b><i>a</i>, <b>1306</b><i>b </i>may arrive at the charging depot first and may assign this vehicle to an available charging station. Further, the fleet management system may analyze the preconditioning characteristic of the first and second vehicles <b>1306</b><i>a</i>, <b>1306</b><i>b </i>and assign the vehicle to a charging station based on a preconditioning time of the vehicles occurring at a time substantially coinciding with a time of availability of the charging station, as described in greater detail above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">In the multi-charging station system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, assigning vehicles to charging stations based on preconditioning may result in assigning vehicles to an occupied charging station (e.g., a station occupied by at least one vehicle that is charging) even though other charging stations remains available for charging. As an illustration, the first vehicle <b>1306</b><i>a </i>may arrive at the charging depot <b>1310</b> before the second vehicle <b>1306</b><i>b</i>, and therefore, absent consideration of preconditioning, a system may assign the first vehicle to the third charging station <b>1320</b><i>a</i>, as it is available and ready for use in charging a vehicle. The second vehicle <b>1306</b><i>b</i>, which arrives at the charging depot <b>1310</b> at a later time, would then wait for one of the charging stations <b>1314</b><i>a</i>-<b>1314</b><i>c </i>to become available. Prior to making such determination, the fleet management system of the present disclosure may analyze the preconditioning characteristics of the first and second vehicles <b>1306</b><i>a </i>and <b>1306</b><i>b </i>to determine the assignment of the first and second vehicles <b>1306</b><i>a</i>, <b>1306</b><i>b </i>that results in returning the vehicles <b>1306</b><i>a</i>, <b>1306</b><i>b </i>to serve most efficiently, in light of the requirement to precondition the vehicle's battery. For example, the fleet management system may determine that despite the first vehicle <b>1306</b><i>a </i>arriving at the charging depot <b>1310</b> sooner, the first vehicle <b>1306</b><i>a </i>requires a prolonged period of preconditioning before the first vehicle <b>1306</b><i>a </i>can begin charging. As such, rather than assign the first vehicle <b>1306</b><i>a </i>to the third charging station <b>1314</b><i>c</i>, the fleet management system may assign the first vehicle <b>1306</b><i>a </i>to the second charging station <b>1314</b><i>b</i>. In this manner, the first vehicle <b>1306</b><i>a </i>may wait at the waiting spot <b>1318</b><i>b </i>during a preconditioning operation. In some cases, the preconditioning operation of the first vehicle <b>1306</b><i>a </i>may be tuned such that the battery reaches a target preconditioning temperature at a time that substantially coincides with the conclusion of the second charging station <b>1314</b><i>b </i>charging the charging vehicle <b>1318</b><i>a</i>. This assignment of the first vehicle <b>1306</b><i>a </i>and the second charging station <b>1314</b><i>b </i>then leaves the third charging station <b>1314</b><i>c </i>available for charging the later-arriving second vehicle <b>1306</b><i>b</i>, which may already have a substantially preconditioned battery upon arrival at the charging depot <b>1310</b> and thus can use the third charging station <b>1314</b><i>c</i>. In other cases, other arrangements and assignments are possible and contemplated herein.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> depicts an example schematic diagram of a computer system <b>1400</b> for implementing various techniques in the examples described herein.
