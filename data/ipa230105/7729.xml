Therefore, each time the terminal is scheduled to initially transmit data, a drx-InactivityTimer is started or restarted, and the terminal is always in an active state until the timer times out.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For downlink data reception, after downlink data transmission indicated by a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) is received, the terminal starts a downlink HARQ round trip time timer for a corresponding hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) process. If data of the HARQ process fails to be decoded after the downlink HARQ round trip time timer times out, the terminal starts a drx-RetransmissionTimer, enters an active state to monitor the PDCCH, and waits for network scheduled transmission.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For uplink data transmission, after uplink data transmission indicated by the PDCCH is received, the terminal starts an uplink HARQ round trip time timer for a corresponding HARQ process. After the uplink HARQ round trip time timer times out, the terminal starts a drx-RetransmissionTimer, enters an active state to monitor the PDCCH, and waits for network scheduled transmission.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A sidelink is introduced into both long term evolution and new radio, and is used for direct data transmission performed between terminals without going through a network device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In Uu DRX, a base station configures a set of Uu DRX for a terminal and only limits behavior that the terminal monitors the PDCCH, and a transmit end of the PDCCH is one or two base stations establishing a radio resource control (RRC) connection with a UE. However, in sidelink DRX, a UE may need to monitor sidelink control information (SCI) of a plurality of UEs, RRC connection may not be established between the UE and a UE transmitting SCI, and requirements of different terminal types, transmission modes (broadcast, multicast, or unicast), or resource scheduling modes may also be different, and a center scheduling node such as the base station may not exist in the sidelink. Therefore, the existing Uu DRX cannot match with sidelink requirements.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Embodiments of the present application provide a transmission or reception configuration method, applied to a first electronic device.

The touch panel <b>7071</b>, also referred to as a touch screen, may collect a touch operation of the user on or near the touch panel (such as an operation of the user on or near the touch panel <b>7071</b> by using any suitable object or attachment, such as a finger or a stylus). The touch panel <b>7071</b> may include two parts: a touch detection apparatus and a touch controller. The touch detection apparatus detects a touch orientation of the user, detects a signal brought by the touch operation, and transmits the signal to the touch controller. The touch controller receives touch information from the touch detection apparatus, converts the touch information into contact coordinates, then transmits the contact coordinates to the processor <b>710</b>, and receives and executes a command transmitted by the processor <b>710</b>. In addition, the touch panel <b>7071</b> may be implemented by using various types, such as a resistive type, a capacitive type, an infrared type, and a surface acoustic wave type. In addition to the touch panel <b>7071</b>, the user input unit <b>707</b> may further include the another input device <b>7072</b>.
