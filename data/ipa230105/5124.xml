The system may generate text descriptions of the image of service installation work assessing the quality of the work to facilitate searching and summarization. Although service installation is referred to herein, it is contemplated that the CV system may be used for deactivation, repair, or the like services. Utility services may include telecommunication services, electrical services, sewer services, gas services, or other infrastructure services.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">One approach to address a technician's work quality is to ask the technician to take a photo of the finished work (e.g., for buried service wire (BSW) installation, a photo showing the drop wire's connection to the fiber distribution pedestal) so that a manger can review the photo, and coach the technician on work quality issues (also referred herein as job quality). However, just using BSW as an example, there are approximately 1 million of BSW jobs completed by single service provider per year and for each BSW job it requires at least 3 photos taken for assessing the job quality (e.g., one photo showing drop wire's connection with the service terminal, one photo showing the drop wire connection with customer demarcation point, or one photo showing the drop wire path). Humans reviewing the photos may be costly and time-consuming assuming at least 3 million photos generated annually for this example scenario.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The disclosed CV system may help provide a more efficient work quality assessment. Some examples of the work quality issues for assessing a BSW installation may include: i) was the drop wire dug into the ground; ii) was the drop wire dug-in location within a reasonable distance from the service terminal/customer premises; iii) was there an appropriate amount of slack in the drop wire; or iv) was the appropriate amount of materials and debris removed from the work area, among other things.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary system for intelligent CV installation. System <b>100</b> may include network <b>103</b>. Mobile device <b>101</b>, mobile device <b>102</b>, base station <b>111</b>, base station <b>113</b>, or server <b>105</b> may be communicatively connected with each other via network <b>103</b>. Network <b>103</b> may include vRouters, access points, DNS servers, firewalls, or the like virtual or physical entities. Mobile device <b>101</b> or mobile device <b>102</b> may be able to communicate to network <b>103</b> through a wired or wireless connection.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary method for intelligent CV installation. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the method provides for image eligibility assessment. At step <b>121</b>, an image may be received. In an example, image captured by device <b>101</b> (e.g., a photo) may be transmitted to server <b>105</b> for additional processing or processed locally on device <b>101</b>. At step <b>122</b>, an indication of an associated service installation may be received. This may be received in a message with the image of step <b>121</b> or separately. A service installation may be a particular wiring installation for a telecommunication service or other service (e.g., electrical), installation of a heating and air service, an installation of a natural gas service, or installation of sewer service, among other things.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, at step <b>123</b>, objects of interest in the image of step <b>121</b> may be determined, which may be based on the indication of associated service of step <b>122</b>. As can be envisioned, an image may include several different objects, such as grass, rocks, wires of different colors, corner of a home, or different types of utility boxes, among other things. All or some of those objects may be of interest based on the indication of the associated service.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In addition, at step <b>124</b>, based on step <b>123</b>, after determining which objects are of interest then there is a determination of a threshold number (e.g., min or max) and type of objects that need to be shown in order to assess work quality. In an example, there may be a number of objects that should be shown for a utility wiring service, such as all of the following objects: the drop wire, the service terminal, the optical network terminal (ONT) box, the drop guard, the customer premises, etc.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">At step <b>125</b>, a message may be sent to communicate the acceptance or rejection of the image of step <b>121</b> based on the determination in step <b>124</b>. If not enough (or too many) objects of interest are shown, then system may send a rejection alert to a device of a technician at the location (e.g., device <b>101</b>) or any nearby devices to the location of the service (e.g., device <b>102</b>). If the number and type of objects meet the threshold number, then an acceptance alert may be sent to device <b>101</b> of a technician of the location or any nearby devices to the location of the service (e.g., device <b>102</b>).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>-<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> illustrate exemplary methods and systems for intelligent CV assisted installation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrates exemplary system flow. As shown, image <b>131</b> which was accepted in the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, is submitted into an image feature map extraction model <b>132</b>. The output of model <b>132</b> (e.g., a feature map from the image) is provided to text generation model <b>133</b>. The output of model <b>133</b> (e.g., text that describes the work quality) may be provided to work quality rating model <b>134</b>, which may output a work quality score. The disclosed method may occur on one device or be distributed over multiple devices.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> illustrates an exemplary method associated with the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>. At step <b>141</b>, the accepted image <b>131</b> may be received by image feature map extraction model <b>132</b>. At step <b>142</b>, a feature map may be extracted from image <b>131</b>. Image feature map extraction model <b>132</b> may be based on a neural network, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN). At step <b>143</b>, text generation model <b>133</b> may receive the feature map and generate a text that describes the work quality associated with the image. Text generation model <b>133</b> may use a neural network (e.g., recurrent neural network&#x2014;RNN), an attention model, or the like to generate the text that describes the work quality. For example, text may include &#x201c;the drop wire was not dug into the ground&#x201d;, &#x201c;there are obstacles blocking the path of the drop wire&#x201d;, &#x201c;drop wire is too close to the terminal&#x201d;, etc. Feature map is the output of a convolution neural network layer and is a matrix/vector of numbers that is used to represent the characteristics of an image. CNN is used to extract feature map of the input image and uses the feature map as input to feed into the RNN network to predict the sequence of words that can describe the image. There may be two RNNs: i) the &#x201c;LSTM&#x201d;/&#x201c;Text generation model&#x201d; is one RNN used to generate text from CNN feature maps of the image (note that LSTM is a specific type of RNN); and ii) the RNN based regression model is another RNN that may be used to generate work quality score (e.g., a numerical rating of the work quality) from the output text of the last text generation model.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">At step <b>144</b>, a work quality score may be determined based on the text of step <b>143</b>. In an example, a quality score may be between [0,1], with a higher score indicating better work quality. At step <b>145</b>, the work quality (e.g., score and text description) may be communicated back to device <b>101</b> (e.g., technician's device) or device <b>102</b> (e.g., a supervisor). A machine learning model may be trained so that it can predict a desirable score based on the text input using a dataset of human labelled text descriptions. For example, in the training dataset, there may be a text description such as: &#x201c;the wire is not properly buried into the ground&#x201d;, and based on technician's experience, this indicates low quality, so its quality may be rated as 0. So, the machine learning model may learn that this type of description indicates 0 work quality, then it may predict the work quality score for a very similar/same description.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The work quality assessment module may use text mining and topic modeling to continuously track the work quality issues encountered by the technician, and notify the management team when a major work quality issue arises, so that actions may be taken to resolve/improve work quality. In an example, technicians may be coached (e.g., via a sent link to on demand multimedia or live instruction) to avoid this specific work quality issue, or to modify the method to mitigate work quality issues. The input to the work quality assessment module may be a photo of the technician's work scene. The output of the work quality assessment module may be a score or a text description.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The input to the work quality assessment module may be the text and quality score generated from a previous work quality assessment module. This may be used to track the work quality scores and if some anomaly (e.g., a large score decrease) happens, it can raise an alert.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The work quality score may be used to filter the text, such as only keep text descriptions whose quality score is less than 1 (which means the work is problematic). Then Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) or Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) may be used to perform topic modeling on the texts and extract major topics trends in the texts.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">An effect of the disclosed system may include dramatically reducing human labor involved in visual inspection or evaluation of work quality. The system may reduce the evaluation time and increase the efficiency compared with conventional work quality assessment approaches. Although there are systems that may test the immediate functionality of a service (e.g., on or off), the disclosed system may assist in the quality of the install which may in turn help to reduce issues that may be avoided by utilizing proper installation techniques and avoiding repetitive manual assessment work.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The text generation model of work quality assessment module generates a text summarization of work quality issues of the image. The transformation from visual information to text information greatly facilitates users to search and retrieve information about a specific work quality issue</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram of network device <b>300</b> that may be connected to or comprise a component of system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.
