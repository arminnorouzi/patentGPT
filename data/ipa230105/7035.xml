It is not an admission that any of the information provided herein is prior art or relevant to the presently claimed invention, or that any publication specifically or implicitly referenced is prior art.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For many years, computer network administrators have placed a high importance on activity detection, both benign and malicious. Users of well-known public and private computer networks utilise gadgets like desktop computers, laptop computers, tablets, smart phones, browsers, etc. to communicate with one another through connected computers and servers. Interconnected network devices send digital data, often in the form of data packets, along the network.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Malicious actions, however, have the potential to harm the network's users, software, or hardware. Unauthorized access to and subsequent unauthorised use of network resources and data are examples of malicious actions. Network administrators look for patterns of behaviour that are abnormal or otherwise deviate from the expected use pattern of a specific entity, such as an organisation or subset thereof, an individual user, an IP address, a node or group of nodes in the network, etc. in order to identify such activities.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In well-known systems, security appliances are utilised to offer network security. The appliance technique is placing security appliances&#x2014;typically servers or computers outfitted with security measures&#x2014;at one or more points throughout the network. After being set up, the device keeps track on network traffic. The device may perform a variety of tasks, such as detecting viruses, intrusions, illegal access, and unauthorized usage of data. Unfortunately, scaling security appliances to address transient or long-term increases in network traffic is difficult. An increase in network traffic frequently necessitates an equipment switch or an equally time-consuming appliance upgrade from a security vendor. Because they are often set up to solely monitor data that is travelling the connection on which a particular device is situated, appliances also have a tendency to have a restricted understanding of the network. Such an appliance won't be aware of activities taking place on other network segments that are being watched by other appliances or may come under influence of security breach.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another method of securing data networks is using installed software solutions as opposed to security hardware appliances. Anti-virus and anti-malware software are examples of such solutions that are often installed on terminal devices (e.g., desktop and laptop computers, tablets, or smart phones). The installed products keep track of data traveling over the network between the terminal device to look for malware in either inbound or outbound data. Unfortunately, the scalability and network visibility of deployed software solutions are likewise subpar. Installed products typically have rather confined views of the data on the network because they are placed locally on the terminal devices. Additionally, they frequently come pre-installed on hardware that is difficult to change.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Various technological solutions (e.g., digital information infrastructure and method for security designated data and with granular data stores, system, method, and apparatus for providing network security, etc.) are disclosed in patent literature. However, the technological solutions for managing security of a computing environment suffer from various limitations such as inaccuracy in detection of malware, lack of efficient mechanism to combat the detected malware, etc. Thus, there remains a need for further contributions in this area of technology. More specifically, a need exists in the area of technology to manage security of a computing environment.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">All references, including publications, patent applications, and patents, cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each reference were individually and specifically indicated to be incorporated by reference and were set forth in its entirety herein.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention relates generally to cyber security, more particularly, to a cybersecurity system to manage security of a computing environment (CE).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Various objects, features, and advantages of the disclosed subject matter can be more fully appreciated with reference to the following detailed description of the disclosed subject matter when considered in connection with the following drawings, in which like reference numerals identify like elements.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The following paragraphs provide additional support for the claims of the subject application.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an aspect the present disclosure provides a cybersecurity system to manage security of a computing environment (CE), the system comprising: the CE comprising: a master computer, and the multiple connecting nodes, wherein the each of the connecting nodes are communicably coupled with the master computer, wherein the master computer is arranged to: monitor and learn a data traffic of the each of the coupled connecting node to alter a security design to speed up the communications;

Referring now to the invention in more detail, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> there is shown, the CE <b>102</b> comprising multiple connecting nodes <b>104</b>-A<b>1</b>, <b>104</b>-A<b>2</b>, <b>104</b>-A<b>3</b>, . . . , <b>104</b>-AN (hereinafter &#x201c;collectively&#x201d; or &#x201c;individually&#x201d; referred as connecting nodes <b>104</b>-A, coupled connecting nodes <b>104</b>-A or connecting node <b>104</b>-A), a master computer <b>106</b> and other known components of a computer network.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an embodiment, the CE <b>102</b> can be a configuration of numerous connecting nodes <b>104</b>-A used to address a challenge. The CE <b>102</b> can be used to assess a software product's degree of networked, collaborative, or multi-user environment functionality. The CE <b>102</b> can comprise computing mainframes, servers, workstations, data storage devices, plotters, operating systems, and other application software, such as database management systems, etc. For the CE <b>102</b> to operate effectively and securely, the connecting nodes <b>104</b>-A, the master computer <b>106</b>, and other well-known computing environment components may be added.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In an embodiment, the connecting nodes <b>104</b>-A can be arranged to communicate with each other within the CE <b>102</b>, which can also be referred as a virtual private network (VPN). The each connecting node <b>104</b>-A may communicate with one or more instances or servers outside the VPN. Each of the connecting node <b>104</b>-A can be monitored by the master computer <b>106</b>, which may analyse an inbound traffic and outbound traffic to/from each of the connecting node <b>104</b>-A, for managing the security of the CE <b>102</b>. The connecting nodes <b>104</b>-A can be selected from a desktop computer, a laptop, a tablet phone, a mobile phone, etc.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In an embodiment, the master computer <b>106</b> can be arranged to monitor and learn a data traffic to/from each of the connecting node <b>104</b>-A within the CE <b>102</b> to alter a security design to speed up the communications. The master computer <b>106</b> may analyse the data traffic to categorize the each of the connecting node <b>104</b>-A into a first category of node and a second category of node. The first category of node can be assumed to be accessed by a human, wherein the first category of node may receive an input in a first pre-defined duration of time (i.e., time interval between timestamps of the current request and the preceding one) or nature of browse mode (e.g., manual or automatic) or lower frequency of data communication or lower Volume of data in the HTTP response or data access without use of proxy-server or data access from a registered IP address and many more. The second category of node can be assumed to be accessed by a bot (i.e., requested resource is a script/program file), wherein the second category of node may receive the input in a second pre-defined duration of time. The first pre-defined duration of time can be greater than the second pre-defined duration of time, because the humans may can be less responsive than the bots. Bots, often referred to as web robots, WWW robots, or internet robots, can be software programmes that may automate or schedule the completion of repetitive tasks online that would be too boring or time-consuming for a human to accomplish. Bots can be used by search engines to browse the web and carefully categories content from websites, by trading sites to quickly find the best deals, and by some websites and services to give critical information like weather, news, and exchange rates. In an embodiment, the master computer <b>106</b> may deploy a dedicated bot detection engine/functionality, that can be configured to receive traffic data from (master computer <b>106</b>) each of connecting node <b>104</b>-A of CE <b>102</b> and/or between connecting node <b>104</b>-A. In some embodiments, the bot detection engine may perform a pre-processing step to discard datasets. The bot detection engine may analyse traffic data such as requesting a website or request data access (e.g., click next page button, click on image to enlarge) or data entry (e.g., selection of radio button, search query etc.), or change in web setting (e.g., change in volume level, change in resolution, enable/disable auto play etc.) or change in appearance of web content (e.g., change in theme colour, default setting etc.), or interaction with web pop-up (e.g., accept or reject cookies access etc.) and many more activity. The bot detection engine may deploy bot detection technique such as KL/PCA/clustering analysis module, behaviour analysis module, machine learning analysis module or other existing classifiers to classify the all connecting nodes <b>104</b>-A into either first category or second category. Alternatively, the bot detection engine may compare IP address of each of connecting nodes <b>104</b>-A against a list of IP address of bots, to enable categorization into first or second category. Furthermore, the bot detection engine may utilize Captcha (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) or any other known challenge-response testing protocol to categorize computing node <b>104</b>-A into first or second category (i.e., bot). The term &#x201c;bot&#x201d; can be referred to an automated process that may interact with network elements (e.g., server) without human intervention. Bots may be configured to automate tasks that would otherwise be conducted by a human being.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The master computer <b>106</b> may utilize of one or more secured hidden servers (e.g., depicted as external server) to determine a first data communication route (e.g., source of data, other data gateway) to speed up or optimize data traffic for the human and a second data communication route to prevent data traffic above a pre-set limit, for the bot. For example, master computer <b>106</b> may be configured to partition the network into multiple subnets for management, performance, resource allocation, and other purposes. The bot driven connecting nodes <b>104</b>-A and human operated connecting nodes <b>104</b>-A can be assigned to differ subnet to optimize performance of CE <b>102</b>. For example, the master computer <b>106</b> may alter (increase) a network bandwidth (of the CE <b>102</b>) for the first category of node, which can be accessed by humans, thereby speeding up the network speed. Similarly, the master computer <b>106</b> may limit or reduce the network bandwidth for the second category of node, which can be accessed by the bots, thereby prevent data traffic above the pre-set limit.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As illustrated, the master computer <b>106</b> can continuously record inbound traffic and outbound traffic for each of connecting nodes <b>104</b>-A<b>1</b>, connecting nodes <b>104</b>-A<b>2</b>, connecting nodes <b>104</b>-A<b>3</b>, connecting nodes <b>104</b>-A<b>4</b> . . . connecting nodes <b>104</b>-An. The bot detection engine can access historical traffic database, which comprises multiple traffic data-points, wherein the each of data-point is tagged with nature of user (e.g., bot or human user). The bot detection engine can deploy machine learning techniques (e.g., deep learning, artificial inelegance, SVM etc.) to generate one or more pattern detection models. The bot detection engine may split historical traffic database into a training set (&#x2dc;70-75%) and a test set (&#x2dc;25-30%). The training set may be deployed to develop one or more pattern detection models to classify connecting nodes <b>104</b>-A into bot (i.e., second category) or human user (i.e., first user). The test set would be used to determine exactitude (e.g., lower false positive, higher classification rate etc.) of each generated pattern detection models. Based on the exactitude details, a best prediction model can be selected. The best prediction model can used by the bot detection engine to categorize the each connecting nodes <b>104</b>-A into first or second category.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In an embodiment, the learning can be performed by utilizing a machine learning technique, wherein the machine learning technique and keys discovery history enables an Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) AI to control ECC key generation engine to randomly generate a key, wherein ECC focuses on generation of pairs of public and private keys for decryption and encryption of web traffic by utilizing mathematics of elliptic curves. Since, ECC bases its approach to public key cryptographic systems on how elliptic curves are structured algebraically over finite fields, therefore, ECC creates keys that are more difficult, mathematically, to crack. The ECC possess smaller key size, thereby making obvious choice for use. ECC has smaller ciphertexts, keys, and signatures, as well as faster key and signature generation. ECC decrypts and encrypts data at a reasonably quick rate. Due to the two-stage computation of signatures used by ECC, overall latency is lower than the inverse. ECC has robust protocols for authenticated key exchange, and the technology is well supported.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In an embodiment, the master computer <b>106</b> may categorize the bots as the good bots and the bad bots based on the analysis of the data traffic coming towards the connecting nodes <b>104</b>-A. For further sub-categorization of the second category of connecting nodes <b>104</b>-A into bad bot and bad bot, the bot detection engine may tweak the best prediction model by modifying weight to one or more such as origin (e.g., IP address), nature of data access (e.g., video, image, text), nature of webpage (e.g., news article, personal data access, etc.), security of data (e.g., password protected), amount of data access (e.g., 10-100 Mbs, 1-1.5 Gb), frequency of data access (e.g., data traffic) and any other parameters. The tweaked predication model can be used to categorize each of the connecting nodes <b>104</b>-A of second category as the good bots and the bad bots. The good bots did not hamper data, breach security and assist the owner to perform task which would require multiple manual data entry or improve work efficiency and many more. Exemplary good bot can be customer care bot to provide 24/7 client service, chat bot to respond to user and customer questions swiftly at any hour of the day, depending on their degree of training. The bad bot can be created with malice intent such as can set up fictitious social media accounts to bombard customers and businesses with unfavourable or inappropriate remarks, or even to propagate false information, infect complete of part of CE <b>102</b>, theft personal data (e.g., password, finical account details), slower functionality of CE <b>102</b> and many more.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In an embodiment, the good bots can be selected from the search engine crawlers, the commercial crawlers, the feed fetcher bots, and the monitoring bots, which could enhance the abilities of the websites. These bots can be used by search engines to crawl websites, check links, retrieve contend and update their indices. The good bots may ultimately optimize the contents of the websites, without human intervention at a rapid pace.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In an embodiment, the bad bots can be selected from the account takeover bots, the carding and card cracking bots, the spamming bots and the scraping bots, which may harm the personal identifiable information (PII) of the users and may also harm the server of the websites (e.g., illegally scraping your website content and republishing it Sending nuisance mails or spam mails). The account takeover bots may take over a user account without permission from the account owner. When an account is compromised by the bad bots, the account can be abused in a range of ways to extract confidential business or user data, commit financial crime and fraud, spread disinformation, and carry out other nefarious activities. In the carding and card cracking bot attacks, cybercriminals may leverage the firepower of credit card bots to test stolen card data against payment processes to identify valid card details or missing values of stolen payment card information in order to commit carding fraud. The spam bot, or spambot, can be a computer application that spammers employ to send vast quantities of spam messages automatically. The program can be simple, and it usually relies on a list of email addresses collected via email harvesting or scraping.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an embodiment, the master computer <b>106</b> may determine an internet protocol (IP) address of the coupled connecting nodes <b>104</b>-A accessed by the bad bots, so that the indulgence of the bad bots can be minimized or eliminated within the CE <b>102</b>. The master computer <b>106</b> may activate flow logs to identify the IP address of the affected coupled connecting nodes <b>104</b>-A.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In an embodiment, the master computer <b>106</b> can transmit an alert to a system administrator to notify status (e.g., number of bot, nature of bot such as good bot, bad bot) connected bot and details about the coupled connecting nodes <b>104</b>-A, the alert comprising one or more of the following: a visual alert, a sound alert, a text alert, and an email alert. The master computing node <b>106</b> may configure a notification service, which may transmit alert to the coupled connecting nodes <b>104</b>-A or any other computing device.
