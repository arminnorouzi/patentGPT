A person of ordinary skill in the art may know that as the network architectures evolve and a new service scenario emerges, the technical solutions provided in the embodiments of this application are also applicable to a similar technical problem.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">This application may be applied to an existing cellular communications system, for example, systems such as a global system for mobile communications (GSM), a wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) system, and a long term evolution (LTE) system; or is applicable to a 5th generation mobile communications system (5rd-Generation, 5G for short) system, for example, communications systems such as an access network that uses new radio (NR), a cloud radio access network (CRAN), and an LTE access network connected to a 5G core network; or may be extended to a similar wireless communications system, such as a wireless fidelity (Wireless-Fidelity, Wi-Fi for short) system, a worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) system, and another related cellular system in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP); or is applicable to another wireless communications system that uses an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) access technology; and is also applicable to a future wireless communications system.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">For ease of understanding, some terminologies in this application are described below.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">(1) A terminal device, also referred to as user equipment (UE) or a terminal, is a device that provides a user with voice and/or data connectivity, for example, a handheld device, an in-vehicle device, a wearable device, a computing device, or a control device having a wireless connection function or a wireless communication function, or another processing device connected to a wireless modem, and mobile stations (MS) in various forms. Common terminal devices include a mobile phone, a tablet computer (pad), a notebook computer, a palmtop computer, a mobile internet device (MID), and a wearable device such as a smartwatch, a smart band, or a pedometer. For ease of description, in this application, the devices mentioned above are collectively referred to as terminal devices.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">(2) A network device may be, for example, a base station, and is a device that connects a terminal device to a wireless network. The network device includes but is not limited to an evolved NodeB (eNB), a radio network controller (RNC), a NodeB (NB), a base station controller (BSC), a base transceiver station (BTS), a home eNodeB (for example, Home evolved NodeB or Home Node B, HNB for short), a baseband unit (BBU), a new radio NodeB (g NodeB, gNB for short), a transmission reception point (TRP), a transmitting point (TP), a mobile switching center, and the like.

An apparatus that directly communicates with the terminal device through a wireless channel is usually a base station. The base station may include various forms of macro base stations, micro base stations, relay stations, access points, remote radio units (RRU), and the like. Certainly, another network device having a wireless communication function may wirelessly communicate with the terminal device. This is not uniquely limited in this application. In different systems, a device having a function of a base station may have a different name. For example, in an LTE network, the device is referred to as an evolved NodeB (eNB); and in a 3rd generation (3G) network, the device is referred to as a NodeB.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; in this application describes only an association relationship for describing associated objects and represents that three relationships may exist. For example, A and/or B may represent the following three cases: only A exists, both A and B exist, and only B exists. In addition, the character &#x201c;/&#x201d; in this specification generally indicates an &#x201c;or&#x201d; relationship between the associated objects.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The following describes in more detail the solutions provided in the embodiments of this application with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> is a structural diagram of a network according to this application. A terminal device may interact with a primary network device and at least one secondary network device (one secondary network device is used as an example in the figure), and the terminal device includes a first unit and a second unit. The first unit may be a first RRC entity, a first RRC functional unit, or a first RRC unit, and is configured to control an RRC connection between the primary network device and the terminal device. The second unit may be a second RRC entity, a second RRC functional unit, or a second RRC unit, and is configured to control an RRC connection between the secondary network device and the terminal device.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">For example, a core network is an evolved packet core (EPC). The primary network device is an LTE base station (such as an eNB), and a control plane connection and a user plane connection may be established between the primary network device and the EPC for the terminal device. The secondary network device is an NR base station (such as a gNB), and only a user plane connection can be established between the secondary network device and the EPC. The first unit is an LTE RRC entity, and is responsible for managing LTE radio resources. The second unit is an NR RRC entity, and is responsible for managing NR radio resources. In addition, for example, an S1 interface may be used between the core network and the primary network device; an S1 interface may be used between the core network and the secondary network device; and an X2 interface may be used between the primary network device and the secondary network device.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">For another example, a core network is a next generation core (NGC), a 5G core network (5G-CN), or a 5G core (5GC). An example in which the core network is an NGC is used for description below. The primary network device is an LTE base station (such as an eNB), and a control plane connection and a user plane connection may be established between the primary network device and the NGC for the terminal device. The secondary network device is an NR base station (such as a gNB), and only a user plane connection can be established between the secondary network device and the NGC. The first unit is an LTE RRC entity, and is responsible for LTE radio resources. The second unit is an NR RRC entity, and is responsible for managing NR radio resources. In addition, for example, a next generation (NG) interface may be used between the core network and the primary network device; an NG interface may be used between the core network and the secondary network device; and an Xn interface (namely, a next generation interface) may be used between the primary network device and the secondary network device.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">For another example, a core network is an NGC, a 5G-CN, or a 5GC.

The following mainly provides description for a case in which the standards of the primary network device and the secondary network device are different. For example, the primary network device is an LTE base station, and the secondary network device is an NR base station; or the primary network device is an NR base station, and the secondary network device is an LTE base station. In addition, for ease of description, in this application, the first unit has a same standard as the primary network device, and the second unit has a same standard as the secondary network device. For example, when the primary network device is an NR base station, and the secondary network device is an LTE base station, the first unit is responsible for managing NR radio resources, for example, the first unit is an NR RRC entity; and the second unit is responsible for managing LTE radio resources, for example, the second unit is an LTE RRC entity. For another example, when the primary network device is an LTE base station, and the secondary network device is an NR base station, the first unit is responsible for managing LTE radio resources, for example, the first unit is an LTE RRC entity; and the second unit is responsible for managing NR radio resources, for example, the second unit is an NR RRC entity.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The terminal device may obtain radio resources from both an air interface of the primary network device and an air interface of the secondary network device to transmit data, thereby obtaining a gain of a transmission rate.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In this application, the first unit and the second unit are responsible for configurations in their respective standards, and do not understand each other's configuration.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The primary network device and the secondary network device are independent of each other. From a perspective of a network side, the primary network device and the secondary network device each have RRC and may generate a complete RRC message. In a scenario shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>, an RRC message (carrying an RRC configuration of the secondary network device) generated by the secondary network device is sent to the primary network device; and the primary network device uses the RRC message of the secondary network device as a container, adds the container to an RRC message of the primary network device, and sends the RRC message of the primary network device to the terminal device. In other words, the terminal device receives the RRC message of the primary network device from the primary network device, the RRC message includes an RRC configuration of the primary network device and the RRC configuration of the secondary network device, and the RRC configuration of the secondary network device in the RRC message of the primary network device is sent by the secondary network device to the primary network device by using the RRC message of the secondary network device.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In an RRC configuration manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>, which is also referred to as joint configuration in this application, the secondary network device sends the RRC configuration of the secondary network device to the primary network device, and the primary network device then sends the RRC configuration of the secondary network device to the terminal device; in addition, the primary network device may further send the RRC configuration of the primary network device to the terminal device. In other words, in the joint configuration scenario, the RRC configuration of the secondary network device needs to be sent to the terminal device by using the primary network device.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> is a structural diagram of another network according to this application.

For capability coordination of band combination, an optional solution is to maintain a band combination list. For example, as shown in Table 1, the first column is an index, the second column is a band combination that can be used by the first primary network device, and the third column is a band combination that can be used by the secondary network device when the first primary network device uses the band combination in the second column. Such a combination exists because a same radio frequency chain of a terminal device may be used in different bands, and the same radio frequency chain cannot be simultaneously used by the first primary network device and the secondary network device.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">A network side can obtain information in Table 1 from a capability of the terminal device.

In a capability coordination process, the first primary network device selects a band combination, and sends a corresponding index to the secondary network device. Therefore, the secondary network device may know a band combination that can be used by the secondary network device, thereby ensuring that a final configuration does not exceed the capability of the terminal device.
