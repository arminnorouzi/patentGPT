diseases by implanting cells engineered to produce a therapeutic substance capable of treating such diseases has exciting potential to improve the health of patients with such diseases. To fully achieve this potential, the implanted cells must be protected from the patient's immune response, so that they remain viable, and the implanted cells must also be capable of producing therapeutic levels of the desired therapeutic substance for several weeks, months or even longer. One approach for delivering such cellular therapies is to encapsulate the engineered cells into semi-permeable devices (e.g., hydrogel capsules), with the objective that the device structure isolates the cells from host immune system cells, while allowing entry of nutrients for the cells and exit of the produced therapeutic substances. In some cases, these semi-permeable devices (e.g., hydrogel capsules) may be modified with various substances, including small molecule compounds. A need exists to improve methods of evaluating these semi-permeable devices (e.g., hydrogel capsules), for example, by quantifying the concentration of the small molecule compounds bound to the devices, which can affect the long term stability of the devices and their ability to evade the host foreign body response (FBR) when implanted into a subject.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure provides, at least in part, methods for evaluating a polymer composition comprising a polymer modified with a small molecule compound. In an embodiment, the evaluating comprises determining the concentration of the small molecule compound within the polymer composition. The polymer compositions may be used to prepare semi-permeable devices (e.g., hydrogel capsules) that comprise at least one compartment encapsulating a plurality of cells capable of expressing a therapeutic agent, which may be released from the device, e.g., upon implantation in a subject. In an embodiment, certain small molecule compounds bound to the modified polymer are capable of mitigating the host foreign body response (FBR) of the polymer composition and/or semi-permeable device. For example, polymer compositions and semi-permeable devices comprising certain small molecule compounds have exhibited a lower host FBR compared with the host FBR induced by polymer compositions and semi-permeable device that do not contain said small molecule compounds.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Without wishing to be bound by theory, the concentration of certain small molecule compounds (e.g., afibrotic compounds) within polymer compositions used to prepare a semi-permeable device can have a significant impact on the ability of the composition and/or device to mitigate the host FBR. As such, it may be useful to determine the concentration of the small molecule compound contained within the polymer compositions in order to, for example, modulate the FBR as needed. However, current methods for quantifying the concentration of certain small molecules are not ideal for use in evaluating the polymer compositions described herein. The methods described below are designed to circumvent these obstacles and provide the concentration of certain small molecule compounds of a modified polymer within a polymer composition in a reliable manner.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one aspect, the present disclosure features a method of evaluating a polymer composition comprising a polymer modified with a small molecule compound, the method comprising subjecting the polymer composition to reaction conditions that allow for release of the small molecule compound from the modified polymer. The method may further comprise acquiring a value of the concentration of the small molecule compound bound to the modified polymer. In an embodiment, the polymer in the modified polymer is a polysaccharide. In an embodiment, the polysaccharide is an alginate (e.g., having an average molecular weight of 75 kD to 150 kD and/or a guluronate to mannuronate (G:M) ratio of greater than or equal to 1.5).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The small molecule compound may be covalently bound or non-covalently bound to the polymer (e.g., alginate) in the modified polymer.

Exemplary separation steps include filtration or chromatography (e.g., size-exclusion chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, reversed-phase chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, or hydrophobic interaction chromatography). In an embodiment, acquiring a value for the concentration of a small molecule compound comprises determining the area of a chromatogram peak for the small molecule compound. In an embodiment, acquiring the concentration of a value for the concentration of a small molecule compound entails comparison to a standard (e.g., a small molecule compound, e.g. a compound of Formula (I)). The concentration of a small molecule compound bound to a modified polymer may range, for example from 0.5% and 10% (w/w) modified polymer, e.g., between about 0.5% and 5%, 1% and 5%, 1% and 4%, or 1 and 3% (w/w) modified polymer.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0007">In an embodiment, the method further comprises acquiring the concentration of unconjugated small molecule compound (i.e., &#x201c;free&#x201d; small molecule compound) in the polymer composition.

In an embodiment, the CBP is capable of mimicking at least one activity of a ligand for a cell-adhesion molecule (CAM) or other cell-surface molecule that mediates cell-matrix junctions or cell-cell junctions or other receptor-mediated signaling. The CBP may be less than 50, 40 30, 25, 20, 15 or 10 amino acids in length. In an embodiment, the CBP is between 3 and 12 amino acids in length, 4 and 10 amino acids in length, or is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 8, 9 or 10 amino acids in length.

In an embodiment, non-degradative methods of evaluating may include determining the overall concentration of the modified polymer in the sample, determining the concentration of the small molecule compound bound to the modified polymer in the sample, identifying a physical parameter (e.g., chemical formula, molecular weight, or atomic composition) of the small molecule compound bound to the modified polymer in the sample, or querying the polymer composition for certain impurities. In an embodiment, evaluating the polymer composition (e.g., in a non-degradative manner) comprises acquiring a value of the refractive index of the polymer composition, e.g., in a solid or liquid sample.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0223">In order to use a refractive index to evaluate a polymer composition, e.g., described herein, the polymer composition may be dissolved in an aqueous medium, e.g., saline or other buffer (e.g., HEPES, sodium phosphate, Tris, or PBS). The refractive index of the polymer composition may be compared to a control sample, for example, comprising only the aqueous medium and not the polymer composition. In an embodiment, all samples are analyzed at the same wavelength of light and temperature.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0224">In an embodiment, a specific refractive index increment value for each sample is determined (i.e., a &#x201c;dn/dc value&#x201d;). The specific refractive index increment is related to the amount by which the refractive index of a polymer composition changes with respect to another parameter, e.g., the amount of a small molecule compound in the composition (e.g., conjugated small molecule compound or unconjugated small molecule compound). In an embodiment, specific refractive index increment is provided as any dimension, e.g., g/mol or (1/% w/w). For example, for a polymer composition comprising a small molecule compound-modified alginate (e.g., a compound of Formula (I), e.g., Compound 101), a specific refractive index increment may be determined for each of the small molecule compound and a representative component of the alginate, such as a guluronic acid moiety. Exemplary methods are provided herein in Example 5.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0225">The refractive index (nD) of a polymer composition may be between 1.3300 and 1.3400, e.g., at a specific temperature or temperature range (e.g., between about 2-8&#xb0; C., or about 22-28&#xb0; C.). For example, the refractive index of a polymer composition described herein may be between 1.3310 and 1.3400, e.g., 1.3320 and 1.3400, 1.3330 and 1.3400, 1.3340 and 1.3400, 1.3360 and 1.3400, 1.3370 and 1.3400, and 1.3380 and 1.3400. In an embodiment, the refractive index of a polymer composition is between 1.3350 and 1.3400.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">ENUMERATED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0253" num="0000"><ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0226">1.

num="0435">Capsules encapsulating RPE cells as single cells. Immediately before encapsulation, single ARPE-19 cells, engineered to express a therapeutic protein were centrifuged at 1,400 r.p.m. for 1 min and washed with calcium-free Krebs-Henseleit (KH) Buffer (4.7 mM KCl, 25 mM HEPES, 1.2 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>&#xd7;7H<sub>2</sub>O, 135 mM NaCl, pH&#x2248;7.4, &#x2248;290 mOsm). After washing, the cells were centrifuged again and all of the supernatant was aspirated. In some experiments, the cell pellet was then resuspended in the 70:30 CM-LMW-Alg:U-HMW-Alg solution (control capsules) or one of the modified alginate solutions described in Table 4 of Example 1 at the desired density of suspended single cells per ml alginate solution.</p><p id="p-0402" num="0436">Prior to fabrication of one-compartment and two-compartment hydrogel capsules, buffers and alginate solutions were sterilized by filtration through a 0.2-&#x3bc;m filter using aseptic processes. For fabrication of one-compartment hydrogel capsules of about 1.5 mm diameter encapsulating cells, the desired number of cells were suspended in the desired alginate solution (e.g., the 70:30 CM-LMW-Alg:U-HMW-Alg solution used in Control capsules or one of the experimental alginate solutions described in Example 1) the resulting cell suspension was loaded into a syringe and capped with an 18-gauge blunt tipped needle (SAI Infusion Technologies). The syringe was placed onto a syringe pump oriented vertically above a dish containing a cross-linking solution. A high voltage power generator was connected to the needle and grounded to the biosafety cabinet. The syringe pump and power generator were turned on to extrude the alginate solution through the needle with a flow-rate of 0.16 mL/min or 10 mL/hr and adjusting the voltage in a range of 5-9 kV until there was a droplet rate of 12 droplets per 10 seconds.</p><p id="p-0403" num="0437">To prepare devices configured as two-compartment hydrogel millicapsules of about 1.5 mm diameter, an electrostatic droplet generator was set up as follows: an ES series 0-100-kV, 20-watt high-voltage power generator (EQ series, Matsusada, NC, USA) was connected to the top and bottom of a coaxial needle (inner lumen of 22G, outer lumen of 18G, Ram&#xe9;-Hart Instrument Co., Succasunna, N.J., USA). The inner lumen was attached to a first BD disposable 5-ml syringe with BD Luer-Lok&#x2122; tip (BD (Cat. No. 309646), Franklin Lakes, N.J., USA), which was connected to a syringe pump (Pump 11 Pico Plus, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, Mass., USA) that was oriented vertically. The outer lumen was connected via a luer coupling to a second 5-ml Luer-lock syringe which was connected to a second syringe pump (Pump 11 Pico Plus) that was oriented horizontally. To encapsulate cells only in the first (inner) compartment, a first alginate solution (70:30 CM-Alg-101:UM-Alg solution (as a control) or one of the experimental alginate solutions described in Example 1) comprising the cells (as single cell suspension) was placed in the first syringe and a second cell-free alginate solution comprising an afibrotic compound (e.g., a mixture of CM-LMW-Alg-101 and an U-HMW-Alg) was placed in the second syringe. For control 2-compartment hydrogel capsules in the Examples below, the second (outer) compartment was formed using the 70:30 CM-LMW-Alg-101:U-HMW-Alg solution. The two syringe pumps move the first and second alginate solutions from the syringes through both lumens of the coaxial needle and single droplets containing both alginate solutions are extruded from the needle into a glass dish containing a cross-linking solution. The settings of each Pico Plus syringe pump were 12.06 mm diameter and the flow rates of each pump were adjusted to achieve a flow rate ratio of 1:1 for the two alginate solutions. Thus, with the total flow rate set at 10 ml/h, the flow rate for each alginate solution was about 5 mL/h.</p><p id="p-0404" num="0438">For fabrication of both the two-compartment and one-compartment millicapsules, after extrusion of the desired volumes of alginate solutions, the alginate droplets were crosslinked for five minutes in a cross-linking solution which contained 25 mM HEPES, 20 mM BaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2M mannitol, and poloxamer 188. Capsules that had fallen to the bottom of the crosslinking vessel were collected by pipetting into a conical tube. After the capsules settled in the tube, the crosslinking buffer was removed, and capsules were washed. Capsules without cells were washed four times with HEPES buffer (NaCl 15.428 g, KCl 0.70 g, MgCl<sub>2</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O 0.488 g, 50 ml of HEPES (1 M) buffer solution (Gibco, Life Technologies, California, USA) in 2 liters of deionized water) and stored at 4&#xb0; C. until use. Capsules encapsulating cells were washed four times in HEPES buffer, two times in 0.9% saline, and two times in culture media and stored in an incubator at 37&#xb0; C.</p><heading id="h-0018" level="1">EQUIVALENTS AND SCOPE</heading><p id="p-0405" num="0439">This application refers to various issued patents, published patent applications, journal articles, and other publications, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
