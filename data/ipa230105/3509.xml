To measure the inner surface shape of the workpiece using such a shape measurement device, it is necessary to align the rotation axis and a central axis of the workpiece.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Patent Literature 1 discloses a technique for bringing a probe (contactor) of a detector into contact with an inner peripheral surface of a cylindrical workpiece placed on a rotating table, and thereby measuring an inner surface shape of the inner peripheral surface of the workpiece. In the technique described in Patent Literature 1, to align a rotation axis and a central axis of the workpiece, the probe of the detector is brought into contact with an outer peripheral surface of the workpiece in advance, runout of the workpiece is observed at a low magnification with the rotating table rotating, and the placement position of the workpiece is adjusted so that the runout decreases.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2006-145344</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In measuring the inner surface shape of a small hole in a workpiece using a shape measurement device as described above, relative position adjustment between the probe and the rotation axis (probe alignment) is important. Specifically, if the rotation axis and the central axis of the workpiece are aligned as in Patent Literature 1 described above, there is a problem in which any relative positional deviation between the probe and the rotation axis may cause the probe to collide with a part other than the small hole of the workpiece when the probe is inserted into the small hole.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Such a problem can be solved by a worker inserting the probe into the small hole of the workpiece while checking with an observation microscope, but the skill of the worker is required. In this case, automation is difficult, and an operation error may cause the probe to collide with a part other than the small hole of the workpiece.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention has been made in view of such circumstances, and an object of the present invention is to provide an inner surface shape measurement device capable of accurately and easily aligning a probe, and an alignment method for the inner surface shape measurement device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, such a shape measurement device is required to perform a work of magnification calibration for the probe to associate an output signal from the probe with an actual calibrated displacement amount. Typically, magnification calibration uses a calibration instrument such as a block gauge or a flick master, but there is a concern in which a collision of the probe with the calibration instrument may damage the probe. The problem is more serious especially when the minimum working distance between the probe and the workpiece is small and the measurement range is small. Against this, there may be a countermeasure such that the operator operates it while visually checking the vicinity of the probe end position with a microscope or the like to avoid the collision. However, in that case, skill is required for the operator, and any human error may damage the probe.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention has been made in view of such circumstances, and another object of the present invention is to provide a magnification calibration method for an inner surface shape measurement device and an inner surface shape measurement device capable of easily and reliably performing magnification calibration of a probe without depending on skill of an operator.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The inventions below are provided to achieve the above object.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">An inner surface shape measurement device according to a first aspect of the present invention is an inner surface shape measurement device for measuring an inner surface shape of a small hole formed in a workpiece, and includes: a workpiece rotation unit configured to rotate the workpiece around a rotation axis; a probe, having an elongated shape that can be inserted into the small hole of the workpiece, the probe configured to detect the inner surface shape of the small hole; an adjustment unit capable of adjusting posture of the probe; an acquisition unit configured to be rotatable integrally with the workpiece rotation unit, the acquisition unit configured to acquire probe posture information from at least three circumferential positions on a rotation trajectory centered on the rotation axis; and a controller configured to adjust posture of the probe, using the adjustment unit, based on the probe posture information acquired by the acquisition unit.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The inner surface shape measurement device according to a second aspect of the present invention is configured according to the first aspect in which the controller adjusts posture of the probe using the adjustment unit so as to eliminate a relative deviation between the probe and the rotation axis.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The inner surface shape measurement device according to a third aspect of the present invention is configured according to the first aspect or the second aspect in which the acquisition unit acquires the probe posture information from four circumferential positions spaced apart from each other by 90 degrees on the rotation trajectory.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The inner surface shape measurement device according to a fourth aspect of the present invention is configured according to any one of the first aspect to the third aspect in which the acquisition unit includes a camera configured to image the probe.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The inner surface shape measurement device according to a fifth aspect of the present invention is configured according to the fourth aspect, and further includes a surface-emitting lighting unit, the surface-emitting lighting unit being configured to be rotatable integrally with the workpiece rotation unit and being capable of surface emission from a position facing the camera toward the probe.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">An alignment method for an inner surface shape measurement device according to a sixth aspect of the present invention is an alignment method for an inner surface shape measurement device for measuring an inner surface shape of a small hole formed in a workpiece, in which the inner surface shape measurement device has: a workpiece rotation unit configured to rotate the workpiece around a rotation axis; a probe, having an elongated shape that can be inserted into the small hole of the workpiece, the configured to detect the inner surface shape of the small hole.

The displacement detector <b>126</b> has a long and thin probe <b>130</b> that can be inserted into the small hole H of the workpiece W. The probe <b>130</b> detects the shape of the inner surface (surface to be measured) of the small hole H of the workpiece W in a state of being inserted into the small hole H of the workpiece W. The probe <b>130</b> to be used is preferably a non-contact probe that detects the inner surface shape without contacting the inner surface of the small hole H of the workpiece W.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0193">The non-contact probe is not particularly limited as long as it can detect the inner surface shape without contacting the inner surface of the small hole H of the workpiece W. The non-contact probe to be used may be probes to which various techniques are applied, for example: a laser interferometer; a white interferometer; an SD-OCT (Spectral Domain-Optical Coherence Tomography); and an SS-OCT (Swept Source-Optical Coherence Tomography).</p><p id="p-0199" num="0194">Note that the probe <b>130</b> is not limited to a non-contact probe, and may be a contact probe. The contact probe has a contactor that can contact the inner surface of the small hole H of the workpiece W. The contact probe detects the displacement of the contactor when it comes into contact with the inner surface of the small hole H of the workpiece W, and thereby detects the inner surface shape. The contact probe to be used may be probes to which various techniques are applied, for example: a LVDT (Linear Variable Differential Transformer); an interferometer; an optical triangulation method; and a thin film strain measurement. Further, a method may be applied in which the method uses the following fact: when the contactor of the contact probe is vibrated at the resonance frequency, a contact changes the resonance point.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0195">Generally, the non-contact probe is more suitable for reducing the diameter than the contact probe.

Here, the linear-motion-movement amount Dy corresponds to the distance in the direction along the movement axis in the Y direction in the probe linear-and-tilting-motion mechanism <b>128</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0239" num="0234">In addition, the relative deviation detector <b>156</b> can use known image processing such as edge extraction, to calculate the probe central axes C<b>1</b> to C<b>4</b>, the midlines ML<b>1</b> and ML<b>2</b>, the linear-motion-movement amounts Dx and Dy, and the tilting-motion-movement amounts &#x3b8; and &#x3d5; from the respective composite images <b>102</b>A and <b>102</b>B.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0235">In this way, when the relative deviation detector <b>156</b> detects the relative deviation between the probe <b>130</b> and the rotation axis C independently in each direction based on the image taken by the camera <b>132</b> at each imaging position (step S<b>26</b>), the probe posture controller <b>158</b> controls the probe linear-and-tilting-motion mechanism <b>128</b> based on the result detected by the relative deviation detector <b>156</b>. Specifically, the probe posture controller <b>158</b> controls the probe linear-and-tilting-motion mechanism <b>128</b> to: move the probe <b>130</b> by the linear-motion-movement amount Dx in the X direction, and move it by the linear-motion-movement amount Dy in the Y direction; and tilt the probe <b>130</b> by the tilting-motion-movement amount &#x3d5; around the X direction, and tilt it by the tilting-motion-movement amount &#x3b8; around the Y direction (step S<b>28</b>, an example of &#x201c;adjustment step&#x201d;). Further, the direction (orientation) in which the probe linear-and-tilting-motion mechanism <b>128</b> is moved or tilted is determined according to which probe is used as the reference probe in the composite image <b>102</b>A or <b>102</b>B illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0236">As described above, the probe posture controller <b>158</b> controls the probe linear-and-tilting-motion mechanism <b>128</b> to change the posture of the probe <b>130</b> based on the result detected by the relative deviation detector <b>156</b>. This eliminates the relative deviation between the probe <b>130</b> and the rotation axis C in the three-dimensional space. This is the end of this flowchart.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0237">&#x3c;Effect&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0243" num="0238">The probe alignment in the present embodiment makes it possible to detect the relative deviation between the probe <b>130</b> and the rotation axis C independently in each direction (X direction and Y direction), based on the four images <b>100</b>A to <b>100</b>D in which the camera <b>132</b> images the probe <b>130</b> at four imaging positions P<b>1</b> to P<b>4</b> spaced from each other by 90 degrees on the rotation trajectory K of the camera <b>132</b> centered on the rotation axis C of the rotating body <b>116</b>. This allows the probe linear-and-tilting-motion mechanism <b>128</b> to control the posture (position and tilt) of the probe <b>130</b> independently in each direction. This also can eliminate the relative deviation between the probe <b>130</b> and the rotation axis C with higher accuracy. Therefore, for example, if the small hole H of the workpiece W is an extremely small diameter hole having an inner diameter of about 140 &#x3bc;m and the probe <b>130</b> is an extremely small diameter probe having an outer diameter of about 80 &#x3bc;m, probe alignment can be performed accurately and easily. This prevents the probe <b>130</b> from colliding with a portion of the workpiece W other than the small hole H, and makes it possible to measure the inner surface shape of the small hole H stably and reliably.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0239">In addition, according to the probe alignment of the present embodiment, the images are taken from a plurality of different directions using the camera <b>132</b>, which rotates and moves integrally with the rotating body <b>116</b>. The images are relatively compared, and thereby the position of the rotation axis C (rotation center) is detected which is the movement target of the probe <b>130</b>. Therefore, if the camera <b>132</b> is attached to the camera bracket <b>134</b>, for example, with a positional deviation in a predetermined direction, creating a deviation in the relative positional relationship between the camera <b>132</b> and the rotation axis C, the relative position adjustment between the probe <b>130</b> and the rotation axis C can be performed with high accuracy, and no accuracy is required in attaching the camera <b>132</b>.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0240">Further, in the probe alignment of the present embodiment, the image is taken while the relative position between the camera <b>132</b> and the probe <b>130</b> is changed in the circumferential direction around the rotation axis C. Therefore, if the position of the rotation axis C is unclear or the rotation axis C tilts, the relative position adjustment between the probe <b>130</b> and the rotation axis C can be performed accurately from the images taken by the camera <b>132</b> at the respective imaging positions P<b>1</b> to P<b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0241">&#x3c;Modification&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0247" num="0242">In the probe alignment of the present embodiment, based on the four images <b>100</b>A to <b>100</b>D in which the camera <b>132</b> images the probe <b>130</b> at four imaging positions P<b>1</b> to P<b>4</b> spaced from each other by 90 degrees on the rotation trajectory K of the camera <b>132</b> centered on the rotation axis C of the rotating body <b>116</b>, the relative deviation between the probe <b>130</b> and the rotation axis C is detected independently in the respective directions. However, the present invention is not limited to this. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>, the probe <b>130</b> may be imaged by the camera <b>132</b> from at least three imaging positions on the rotation trajectory K of the camera <b>132</b> around the rotation axis C of the rotating body <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0243">In other words, if the relative deviation between the probe <b>130</b> and the rotation axis C can be detected independently in the respective directions, the probe <b>130</b> may be imaged by the camera <b>132</b> from at least three directions around the rotation axis C. In this case, the images taken by the camera <b>132</b> at the respective imaging positions should be relatively compared using the relationship with the positional information (rotation angle, radius of rotation, etc.) related to the respective imaging positions. This makes it possible to detect the relative deviation between the probe <b>130</b> and the rotation axis C independently in each direction. This then allows the probe linear-and-tilting-motion mechanism <b>128</b> to independently control the posture of the probe <b>130</b> in the respective directions, based on the detected relative deviation. This can eliminate the relative deviation between the probe <b>130</b> and the rotation axis C.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0244">Further, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref>, the camera <b>132</b> may continuously image the probe <b>130</b> at regular imaging intervals while the camera <b>132</b> is rotated by rotational movement of the rotating body <b>116</b>. In this case, many images can be used, so that probe alignment can be performed with high accuracy. Further, the probe <b>130</b> is continuously imaged while the camera <b>132</b> rotates and moves, so that the range in which the camera <b>132</b> rotates and moves can be limited to a partial range.

In the region with a length of d<sub>1 </sub>ranging from the upper surface <b>420</b>A, the concentricity can be increased between the cylindrical surface <b>420</b>C<b>1</b> and the rotation axis C.
