The semiconductor processing chamber <b>100</b> may include a chamber <b>110</b>, a chuck voltage supplier <b>120</b>, a first radio frequency (RF) power supplier <b>130</b>, a second RF power supplier <b>140</b>, and a gas inlet unit <b>150</b>. The semiconductor processing chamber <b>100</b> may include additional components not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. For example, the chuck voltage supplier <b>120</b>, the RF power supplier <b>130</b> or the second RF power supplier <b>140</b> may be implemented by a voltage generator or a power supply.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The chamber <b>110</b> may include a chamber housing <b>111</b>, an electrostatic chuck (ESC) <b>112</b>, an internal electrode <b>113</b> formed inside the electrostatic chuck <b>112</b>, an upper electrode <b>114</b>, and a gas inlet <b>115</b>. The internal electrode <b>113</b> and the upper electrode <b>114</b> may be implemented with a conductor. A wafer W, a target of a semiconductor process, may be seated on the electrostatic chuck <b>112</b>. In an embodiment, a ceramic coating layer is formed in a region of the electrostatic chuck <b>112</b> in direct contact with the wafer W. The ceramic coating layer may be formed of aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), aluminum nitride (AlN), silicon carbide (SiC), or the like, and may have a thickness of about 1 mm. However, a material and a thickness of the ceramic coating layer may be variously modified according to example embodiments.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an example embodiment, the wafer W may be fixed to the electrostatic chuck <b>112</b> while seated on the electrostatic chuck <b>112</b> by a voltage supplied by the chuck voltage supplier <b>120</b>. For example, the chuck voltage supplier <b>120</b> may supply a constant voltage to the electrostatic chuck <b>112</b>, and the constant voltage may have a magnitude of several hundreds to several thousands of volts. The chuck voltage supplier <b>120</b> may be connected to an electrode (e.g., a conductor) inside the electrostatic chuck <b>112</b> to supply the constant voltage, and the electrode inside the electrostatic chuck <b>112</b> may be located to face substantially an entire surface of the wafer W.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Reactive gas may be introduced through the gas inlet <b>150</b> to begin the semiconductor process. The first RF power supplier <b>130</b> may supply first RF power to the internal electrode <b>113</b> formed in the electrostatic chuck <b>112</b>, and the second RF power supplier <b>140</b> may supply second RF power to the electrostatic chuck <b>112</b> and the upper electrode <b>114</b> located above the wafer W.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Each of the first RF power supplier <b>130</b> and the second RF power supplier <b>140</b> may include a high frequency power source for supplying bias power. Plasma <b>150</b> including radicals <b>151</b> and ions <b>152</b> of the reactive gas may be generated by the first RF power and the second RF power, and the reactive gas may be activated by the plasma <b>150</b> to increase the reactivity. For example, when the semiconductor process device <b>100</b> is an etching device, radicals <b>151</b> and ions <b>152</b> of the reactive gas may be concentrated on the wafer W by the first RF power supplied from the first RF power supplier <b>130</b> to the internal electrode <b>113</b>. At least a portion of a semiconductor substrate or layers included in the wafer W may be dry-etched by radicals <b>151</b> and ions <b>152</b> of the reactive gas.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A self-bias voltage may be generated above the wafer W by the first RF power and the second RF power supplied to the internal electrode <b>113</b> and the upper electrode <b>114</b>, respectively. In an example embodiment, the first RF power supplied to the internal electrode <b>113</b> may be several thousand to several tens of thousands of watts, and as a result, a self-bias voltage of minus several thousand volts may be formed above the wafer W.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As described above, the electrostatic chuck <b>112</b> may include a ceramic coating layer in direct contact with the wafer W. In an embodiment, the ceramic coating layer is formed of a ceramic dielectric. When the semiconductor process for the wafer W is finished, the wafer W may be carried out externally by a load lock chamber connected to the chamber <b>110</b>, and a new wafer W for performing a semiconductor process may be transferred to the chamber <b>110</b>. The electrostatic chuck <b>112</b> may be exposed to the inside of the chamber <b>110</b> while the wafer W is replaced. Accordingly, the electrostatic chuck <b>112</b> may be damaged by radicals <b>151</b> and ions <b>152</b> included in the plasma <b>150</b> formed above the electrostatic chuck <b>112</b>. For example, the ceramic coating layer of the electrostatic chuck <b>112</b> exposed to the plasma <b>150</b> while replacing the wafer W may be damaged by the radicals <b>151</b> and the ions <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Meanwhile, a lower surface of the wafer W may be in direct contact with a plurality of convex portions formed on the electrostatic chuck <b>112</b>, and a space between the plurality of convex portions and the lower surface of the wafer W may be filled with gas for cooling. For example, the gas for cooling may be helium (He) gas. While the semiconductor process is performed, a chuck voltage of hundreds to thousands of volts may be supplied to the electrostatic chuck <b>112</b>, and a self-bias voltage of minus several thousand volts may be generated on an upper surface of the wafer W. Due to such a voltage difference, an unintentional discharge may occur in the helium gas injected for the purpose of cooling the wafer W, and the electrostatic chuck <b>112</b> may be damaged due to such a discharge. For example, a crack may occur in the ceramic coating layer of the electrostatic chuck <b>112</b> while the helium gas is discharged.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The wafer W may not be properly fixed on the electrostatic chuck <b>112</b> when the electrostatic chuck <b>112</b> is damaged. An operation of the semiconductor processing chamber <b>100</b> may be stopped to determine whether the electrostatic chuck <b>112</b> is damaged. The electrostatic chuck <b>112</b> may be carried out externally to determine whether the electrostatic chuck <b>112</b> is damaged. However, manufacturing time is increased since the operation of the semiconductor processing chamber <b>100</b> is stopped, and it may take a large amount of time to inspect damage to the electrostatic chuck <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an example embodiment of the present inventive concept, by detecting damage to the electrostatic chuck <b>112</b> as a voltage change, it may be determined whether replacement of the electrostatic chuck <b>112</b> is necessary in real time without stoppages in an operation of the semiconductor processing chamber <b>100</b>. Accordingly, it is possible to increase a yield of the semiconductor process by minimizing stoppages in the operation of the semiconductor processing chamber <b>100</b>, monitoring a state of the electrostatic chuck <b>112</b> in real time, and replacing the electrostatic chuck <b>112</b> at an appropriate time, when replacement is required.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>5</b></figref> are diagrams illustrating an operation of a semiconductor processing system according to an example embodiment of the present inventive concept.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a semiconductor processing system <b>200</b> according to an example embodiment of the present inventive concept may include an electrostatic chuck <b>210</b> on which a first wafer W<b>1</b> is seated, a first power supplier <b>220</b> supplying first RF power to an internal electrode <b>213</b> of the electrostatic chuck <b>210</b>, a voltage measuring device <b>230</b>, and a control device <b>240</b>. The electrostatic chuck <b>210</b> may include a plate <b>211</b>, an internal electrode <b>213</b> inside the plate <b>211</b>, and a ceramic coating layer <b>215</b> in contact with the first wafer W<b>1</b> above the plate <b>211</b>.
