The surgical assistance robot associates an operation input to the arm unit with a position-posture relationship to enable an intuitive operation of the arm unit to be realized.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the surgical assistance robot, to associate the operation input to the arm unit with the position-posture relationship, a detection device for detecting the rotation position (rotation angle) of the arm unit is required. To this end, in recent years, there has been a demand for a rotation function in which the total rotation angle exceeds 360 degrees, for example, plus/minus 270 degrees with respect to the initial position.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">However, the detection of a rotation position exceeding 360 degrees requires, for example, a configuration using a multi-encoder or a configuration in which a single-turn encoder is combined with a zero-point limit switch, and the detection device and peripheral mechanisms are therefore complicated, leading to an increased size. Furthermore, if the rotation exceeds 360 degrees, the wire harness around the detection device is greatly twisted, which may cause a problem such as disconnection. On the other hand, when a stopper mechanism for restricting the rotation amount of the wire harness is provided, there is a problem in that the size is further increased and the weight is also increased.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">It is an aspect to provide a rotation position detection unit capable of detecting the rotation position of an insertion member that is to be inserted into the patient's body and can rotate 360 degrees or more in a simple and compact configuration in a medical robot that holds the insertion member in a rotatable manner.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A rotation position detection unit according to some embodiments may be provided in a medical robot in which an insertion member is held in a rotatable manner. The rotation position detection unit may detect a rotation position of the insertion member and may comprise a motor; a drive-side pulley that is connected to the motor and rotationally driven by the motor around a drive shaft of the motor; a driven-side pulley that rotates around a first axis of rotation; a transmission belt that transmits rotational drive of the drive-side pulley to the driven-side pulley; a rotary encoder that is connected to the first axis of rotation and detects a rotation angle of the driven-side pulley; and a controller that controls drive of the motor and to which a detection result by the rotary encoder is input. The insertion member may rotate in association with rotation of the drive-side pulley. The diameter of the drive-side pulley may be smaller than the diameter of the driven-side pulley. The controller may calculate the rotation position of the insertion member based on the rotation angle of the driven-side pulley and a pulley ratio obtained by dividing the diameter of the drive-side pulley by the diameter of the driven-side pulley.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, the rotation position detection unit may comprise an intermediate pulley that rotates around a second axis of rotation. In some embodiments, the insertion member may be connected to the second axis of rotation and rotates around the second axis of rotation. In some embodiments, the transmission belt may comprise a first transmission belt that connects the drive-side pulley and the intermediate pulley and transmits the rotational drive of the drive-side pulley to the intermediate pulley; and a second transmission belt that connects the intermediate pulley and the driven-side pulley and transmits the rotational drive of the intermediate pulley to the driven-side pulley. In some embodiments, the diameter of the intermediate pulley may be smaller than the diameter of the driven-side pulley.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, the diameter of the drive-side pulley and the diameter of the intermediate pulley may be identical.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, the pulley ratio may be set such that a rotation range of the driven-side pulley is less than 360 degrees even when a rotation range of the insertion member exceeds 360 degrees.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, the motor may be arranged on the insertion member side of the rotary encoder.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, the drive shaft and the first axis of rotation may be arranged so as to be located coaxially.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, the rotation position detection unit may comprise a restriction member that restricts a rotation range of the driven-side pulley.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, the rotary encoder may include a plate that faces the driven-side pulley in a direction along the first axis of rotation, and the restriction member may comprise a protrusion that is provided so as to extend toward the plate side in the driven-side pulley; and a restriction portion that is provided so as to extend toward the driven-side pulley side in the plate and arranged at a predetermined position on a trajectory of the protrusion that moves in association with rotation of the driven-side pulley.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to the rotation position detection unit of various embodiments, it is possible to detect the rotation position of an insertion member that is to be inserted into the patient's body and the insertion member can rotate 360 degrees or more in a simple and compact configuration in a medical robot that holds the insertion member in a rotatable manner.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Hereinafter, the rotation position detection unit according to various embodiments will be described in detail with reference to the drawings. An example in which the rotation position detection unit is applied to a medical robot will be described, but embodiments are not limited to this.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In each figure, X-Y-Z coordinates are illustrated as reference coordinates.

That is, the central axis Ad (first axis of rotation) is located coaxially with the drive axis of the motor <b>32</b>. The first pulley <b>41</b> is approximately disk-shaped, and its outer peripheral surface is formed with grooves having a constant pitch in the circumferential direction. The drive shaft <b>32</b><i>a </i>of the motor <b>32</b> extends along the front-rear direction (X1-X2 direction) and is arranged so as to be parallel to the above axis of rotation Am.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The first pulley <b>41</b> is connected to a second pulley <b>42</b> as the intermediate pulley via a first transmission belt <b>51</b>, and the second pulley <b>42</b> is connected to a third pulley <b>43</b> as the driven-side pulley via a second transmission belt <b>52</b>.

The diameter L1 of the first pulley <b>41</b> and the second pulley <b>42</b> is set smaller than a diameter L2 of the third pulley <b>43</b>. Therefore, while the pulley ratio obtained by dividing the diameter of the first pulley <b>41</b> by the diameter of the second pulley <b>42</b> is 1, the pulley ratio obtained by dividing the diameter of the first pulley <b>41</b> by the diameter of the third pulley <b>43</b> is smaller than 1.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The second pulley <b>42</b> is arranged above the first pulley <b>41</b> so as to be rotatable around the above axis of rotation Am.

The rotation angle of the second pulley <b>42</b> is the same as the rotation angle of the first pulley <b>41</b> because the first pulley <b>41</b> and the second pulley <b>42</b> have the same diameter L1.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The third pulley <b>43</b> is arranged behind the first pulley <b>41</b> so as to be rotatable around the above central axis Ad.

The rotation angle of the third pulley <b>43</b> is smaller than the rotation angle of the first pulley <b>41</b> and the second pulley <b>42</b> because the diameter L1 of the first pulley <b>41</b> and the second pulley <b>42</b> is smaller than the diameter L2 of the third pulley <b>43</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">By setting the same diameter L1 of the first pulley <b>41</b> and the second pulley <b>42</b>, the rotation angles can be the same, and it is therefore easy to perform the rotation control of the insertion member.

The motor <b>32</b> is a heavier component than the encoder <b>70</b>, and therefore if the motor <b>32</b> and the insertion member can be brought close to each other, this configuration will contribute to a reduced size of the holding body <b>10</b>.

In such a configuration, the light receiving element receives the light which is emitted from the light source and reflected by the reflecting surface, and on the basis of the light receiving result and the control signal given to the light source, the rotation direction and rotation position (angle position) of the rotating plate <b>73</b><i>b </i>and the third pulley <b>43</b>, which rotates with the rotating plate <b>73</b><i>b</i>, can be detected.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Here, various types of rotary encoders can be used, but the use of an absolute encoder allows for the detection of an absolute angle position; therefore, if the absolute angle position when the power of the robot is turned off is stored in a storage device in the controller <b>31</b>, initialization is not required at the next power-on, and quick detection work can thus be possible.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the restriction plate <b>71</b> has a front surface <b>71</b><i>a</i>, which faces a rear surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>of the third pulley <b>43</b> in the X1-X2 direction along the central axis Ad.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the front surface <b>71</b><i>a </i>of the restriction plate <b>71</b> is provided with a restriction portion <b>71</b><i>b </i>that is provided so as to extend toward the third pulley <b>43</b> side.
