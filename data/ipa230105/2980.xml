More specifically, the present disclosure relates to a monitoring system configured to determine a productivity of the paving machine based at least in part on predicting paving mat defects.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A paving machine, such as an asphalt paver, is a self-propelled construction machine designed to receive, convey, distribute, profile, and partially compact paving material. The paving machine accepts heated paving material (e.g., asphalt) into a receiving hopper at a front of the paving machine. The heated asphalt material in the hopper is conveyed to a rear of the paving machine by conveyors positioned at a base of the hopper. The asphalt material is then distributed across a width of the paving machine, for example, using two opposing screws or augers. Finally, a screed assembly located at the rear of the paving machine profiles and compacts the asphalt material into an asphalt surface, which is often referred to as a &#x201c;mat&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Due to the nature of the paving material, the dynamic nature of the environment in which the mat is formed, and the complexity of the paving machine and other machines in the paving process, it can be difficult to produce a high quality and consistent mat. For example, if a component of the paving machine is malfunctioning, or a setting of the paving machine is incorrect or unsuitable for current environment conditions, the resulting mat may have one or more defects. Extended delays or stoppages of the paving machine during operation can also cause defects in the resulting mat. In some cases, such defects can decrease the longevity and reliability of the paved surface, and can ultimately lead to costly and time-consuming repairs being required.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An example system for controlling a paving process and determining a quality of a paving operation is described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,930,092 (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;the '092 reference&#x201d;). In particular, the '092 reference describes that information is gathered at a paver, and that such information includes paver operating status, asphalt temperature values, screed width and slope, and so forth. The '092 reference describes that a central server aggregates the data, and provides real time actionable production and paving process control in the form of feedback. For example, the '092 reference describes a real time display of the quality metrics to proactively process adjustments, coordination, and control. However, the system described in the '092 reference is not configured to monitor various paving machine configurations, operating parameters, worksite conditions, and other information in order to predict the eventual occurrence of a defect before such a defect occurs. Further, the system described in the '092 reference is not configured to predict an expected type of mat defect corresponding to the gathered information. As a result, while the system described in the '092 reference may be capable of aggregating various machine and operational data, the system is not configured to assist an operator with operating a paving machine in a way that reduces the likelihood of a mat defect being created.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Example embodiments of the present disclosure are directed toward overcoming the deficiencies described above.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an aspect of the present disclosure, a method, comprising: receiving sensor data associated with preparing a paving mat; determining, based at least in part on paving defect prediction criteria associated with preparing paving mats, first criteria associated with a first type of paving mat defect; determining, based at least in part on the paving defect prediction criteria, second criteria associated with a second type of paving mat defect different from the first type of paving mat defect; determining, based at least in part on the sensor data, whether the first criteria associated with the first type of paving mat defect is satisfied; determining, based at least in part on the sensor data, whether the second criteria associated with the second type of paving mat defect is satisfied; determining, based at least in part on whether the first criteria is satisfied or whether the second criteria is satisfied, that at least one of the first type of paving mat defect or the second type of paving mat defect is present in the paving mat; generating a notification indicating the at least one of the first type of paving mat defect or the second type of paving mat defect; and causing the notification to be displayed.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another aspect of the present disclosure, a system, comprising: one or more sensing devices; and a system controller in communication with a controller of the sensing device, the system controller being configured to: receive, from the one or more sensing devices, sensor data associated with a paving operation; determine criteria associated with a paving mat defect during the paving operation, the criteria including a first speed of a machine performing the paving operation, and a first paving material feed status of paving material at the machine; determine, based at least in part on the sensor data, a second speed of the machine and a second paving material feed status; determine that the second speed satisfies the first speed; determine that the second paving material feed status is the same as the first paving material feed status; and determine, based at least in part on the second speed satisfying the first speed and the second paving material feed status being the same as the first paving material feed status, that the criteria is satisfied.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In yet another aspect of the present disclosure, A method, comprising: receiving, from a first sensor of a paving machine, first sensor data; receiving, from a second sensor of the paving machine, second sensor data; determining criteria of a paving mat defect associated with a paving mat prepared by the paving machine; determining, based at least in part on the first sensor data, whether a first portion of the criteria is satisfied; determining, based at least in part on the second sensor data, whether a second portion of the criteria is satisfied, the second portion being different than the first portion; and determining that the paving mat contains the paving mat defect based at least in part on the first portion of the criteria being satisfied and the second portion of the criteria being satisfied.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The detailed description is described with reference to the accompanying figures.

The one or more computing device(s) <b>102</b> include a monitoring component <b>106</b> configured to determine and/or predict defects in a paving mat <b>108</b> and generate indications associated with the defects. Additional details of the monitoring component <b>106</b> are discussed herein with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. However, generally, the monitoring component <b>106</b> receives sensor data generated by a plurality of sensor(s) of the paving machine <b>100</b> for use in predicting defects within the paving mat <b>108</b>. In some instances, the one or more computing device(s) <b>102</b> are configured to determine commands that, when executed by the paving machine <b>100</b>, a crew member at a worksite with the paving machine <b>100</b>, and so forth, at least partially remedy the defect. While the following detailed description describes examples in connection with the paving machine <b>100</b>, it should be appreciated that the description applies equally to the use of the present disclosure in other machines as well.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The paving machine <b>100</b> includes a tractor portion <b>110</b> supported on a set of ground-engaging elements <b>112</b>. The tractor portion <b>110</b> includes a tractor frame <b>114</b>, as well as a power source for driving the ground-engaging elements <b>112</b>. Although the ground-engaging elements <b>112</b> are illustrated as continuous tracks, it is contemplated that the ground-engaging elements <b>112</b> may be any other type of ground engaging elements as well, such as wheels. In some instances, the power source is an internal combustion engine operating on fossil or hybrid fuels, or in other instances is an electrically operated drive powered by alternate energy sources.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The paving machine <b>100</b> includes a hopper <b>116</b> for storing paving material <b>118</b>. The paving machine <b>100</b> also includes a conveyor system <b>120</b> for conveying the paving material <b>118</b> from the hopper <b>116</b> to other downstream components of the paving machine <b>100</b>. For example, the paving machine <b>100</b> includes an auger assembly <b>122</b> which receives the paving material <b>118</b> supplied via the conveyor system <b>120</b>, and which distributes the paving material <b>118</b> on a ground surface <b>124</b>. In some instances, the auger assembly <b>122</b> includes at least one main auger. In some instances, the auger assembly <b>122</b> includes a main auger, and an auger extension coupled to the main auger via an auger bearing or other coupling component. Additionally, in some instances, the auger assembly <b>122</b> includes a main auger and an additional auger disposed opposite the main auger. In such examples, the main auger and the additional auger are configured to distribute the paving material <b>118</b> across substantially an entire width of the paving machine <b>100</b>. The auger assembly <b>122</b> may also include a chamber for receiving the paving material <b>118</b> via the conveyor system <b>120</b> for distribution by the auger(s).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The paving machine <b>100</b> is shown including a tow arm <b>126</b> which couples a height adjustable screed assembly <b>128</b> to the tractor portion <b>110</b> so as to spread and compact the paving material <b>118</b> into the paving mat <b>108</b> on the ground surface <b>124</b>. The tow arm <b>126</b> is actuated by a hydraulic actuator, an electric actuator (not shown), and/or any other type of actuator as per application requirements. During a finishing pull, the tractor portion <b>110</b> pulls the screed assembly <b>128</b> to spread the paving material <b>118</b>. During a finishing pull, the hopper <b>116</b> may or may not be activated to funnel the paving material <b>118</b> to the conveyor system <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">An operator station <b>130</b> couples to the tractor portion <b>110</b>. The operator station <b>130</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes a console <b>132</b> and other levers or controls (not shown) for operating the paving machine <b>100</b>. For example, the console <b>132</b> includes a control interface <b>134</b> for controlling various functions of the paving machine <b>100</b>. The control interface <b>134</b> represents an analog, digital, and/or touchscreen display, and displays, for example, predicted defects in the paving mat <b>108</b> as determined by the monitoring component <b>106</b>. The control interface <b>134</b> may also display indications (e.g., map) of the predicted defects, or determined defects, in the paving mat <b>108</b>. However, the control interface <b>134</b> additionally, or alternatively, is configured to display commands that when executed by the paving machine <b>100</b>, remedy defects of paving mat <b>108</b>. The control interface <b>134</b> supports other functions as well, including for example, sharing various operating data with one or more other machines (not shown) operating in conjunction with the paving machine <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The paving machine <b>100</b> is shown including a communication device <b>136</b> which, in some instances, couples to a roof of the operator station <b>130</b>. The communication device <b>136</b> is capable of determining a location of the paving machine <b>100</b>, and includes a component of a global positioning system (GPS). For example, the communication device <b>136</b> may comprise a GPS receiver, transmitter, transceiver, and/or other such device, and the communication device <b>136</b> is in communication with one or more GPS satellites (not shown) to determine a location of the paving machine <b>100</b> continuously, substantially continuously, or at various time intervals. Alternatively or additionally, in some instances the communication device <b>136</b> communicates with a ground-based location station, virtual reference station (VRS), global navigation satellite system, or other survey coordinate system to determine the location of the paving machine <b>100</b>.

The temperature sensors <b>138</b>, <b>140</b>, and <b>142</b> comprise mechanical, electrical, electro-mechanical, electronic, infrared, or any other type of a temperature sensor known in the art. In some examples, one or more of the temperature sensors <b>138</b>, <b>140</b>, and <b>142</b> include an air purge device or other such device (not shown) to prevent debris from forming on the temperature sensor. In such instances, the air purge device receives purged air from an air source storing pressurized air to prevent any dirt, debris, etc. which sticks to the temperature sensors <b>138</b>, <b>140</b>, and <b>142</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The temperature sensors <b>138</b>, <b>140</b>, and <b>142</b> provide signals (e.g., data) to the monitor component <b>106</b> for use in predicting defects in the paving mat <b>108</b>. In some instances, the paving machine <b>100</b> includes a controller <b>144</b> that receives the signals from the temperature sensors <b>138</b>, <b>140</b>, and <b>142</b> and transmits the signals to the computing device(s) <b>102</b>, and ultimately, the monitoring component <b>106</b>.

For example, a temperature sensor is positioned measure a temperature of hydraulic oil within the paving machine <b>100</b>, or within components of the paving machine <b>100</b> (e.g., actuators for the screed assembly, pumps, etc.). One or more temperature sensors may also measure engine temperature. Additionally, the paving machine <b>100</b> includes a temperature sensor to measure a temperature of the paving material <b>118</b> at the screed assembly <b>128</b>. In some instances, a sensor is disposed to measure whether the screed assembly <b>128</b> is heating the paving material <b>118</b>. As discussed herein, the temperature sensors are used to measure a temperature of the paving material <b>118</b>, the ground surface <b>124</b>, and so forth for predicting paving mat defects (e.g., too cold, too hot, etc.)</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The paving machine <b>100</b> includes a LIDAR sensor <b>146</b> and/or a RADAR sensor <b>148</b>. While depicted as residing on a roof of the operator station <b>130</b>, in other examples, the LIDAR sensor <b>146</b> and/or the RADAR sensor <b>148</b> are positioned at any location on the paving machine <b>100</b>, or another location proximate the paving machine <b>100</b> at which the sensors capture sensor data of the paving mat <b>108</b>. Additionally, while one LIDAR sensor <b>146</b> and one RADAR sensor <b>148</b> are shown, any number of LIDAR sensors and/or RADAR sensors may be incorporated into and/or proximate the paving machine <b>100</b>. In examples, the LIDAR sensor <b>146</b> measures distance to a target (e.g., the paving mat <b>108</b>) by illuminating the target with laser light and measuring the reflected light with a sensor. The LIDAR sensor <b>146</b> uses differences in laser return times and wavelengths to make digital 3D representations of the target. For instance, the LIDAR sensor <b>146</b> generates a signal including information indicative of a 3D representation of the target.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Additionally, in some instances, the RADAR sensor <b>148</b> uses radio waves to determine the range, angle, or velocity of a target (e.g., the paving mat <b>108</b>). The RADAR sensor <b>148</b> generates a signal that includes information such as range, angle, and/or velocity of the target. It is contemplated that the paving machine <b>100</b> includes various other sensors to measure various other parameters related to the paving machine <b>100</b>, the paving mat <b>108</b>, and/or the worksite. The LIDAR sensor <b>146</b> and/or the RADAR sensor <b>148</b> provide the respective signals (e.g., by way of the controller <b>144</b>) including information indicative of the environment of the worksite to the monitoring component <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The paving machine <b>100</b> includes a screed float sensor <b>150</b> positioned on the tow arm <b>126</b>. The screed float sensor <b>150</b> detects whether the screed assembly <b>128</b> is &#x201c;floating&#x201d; relative to the paving machine <b>100</b>. For example, in some instances, a height of the screed assembly <b>128</b> above the ground surface <b>124</b> is set in position (e.g., bonded), whereas in other instances, the height of the screed assembly <b>128</b> above the ground surface may be free to float up and down on the ground surface <b>124</b>. As the paving machine <b>100</b> traverses over the ground surface <b>124</b>, the screed assembly <b>128</b> vertically translates to climb higher through a pile of the paving material <b>118</b> to increase the amount of paving material <b>118</b> extruded behind the screed assembly <b>128</b>. Conversely, vertically lowering the screed assembly <b>128</b> will reduce the amount of paving material <b>118</b> extruded. As such, in instances where the screed assembly <b>128</b> floats, the paving machine <b>100</b> may traverse uneven grounds while the screed assembly <b>128</b> floats over the paving material <b>118</b>, leading to a smooth paving mat <b>108</b>. The screed float sensor <b>150</b> may be located elsewhere on the paving machine <b>100</b>, such as the screed assembly <b>128</b>. Moreover, in some instances, the screed float sensor <b>150</b> represents a switch of the paving machine that provides an indication of whether the screed assembly <b>128</b> is floating or not (e.g., control circuitry).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A screed height sensor <b>152</b> measures a height of the screed assembly <b>128</b> above the ground surface <b>124</b>.

In some instances the speed sensor <b>154</b> measures a ground speed of the paving machine <b>100</b>. The speed sensor <b>154</b> may include a wheel encoder (e.g., via the ground-engaging elements <b>112</b>), tachometer, radar, LIDAR, or any other type of sensor for measuring speed. In some instances, the speed of the paving machine <b>100</b> may be determined via the communication device <b>136</b>. The speed of the paving machine <b>100</b> may also be determined via optical or magnetic sensors disposed in the engine or the transmission of the paving machine <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The paving machine <b>100</b> includes a material feed sensor <b>156</b> for determining whether the paving material <b>118</b> is being conveyed. For example, the material feed sensor <b>156</b> measures, or may be used to determine, whether the conveyor system <b>120</b> is actuated for conveying the paving material <b>118</b> from the hopper <b>116</b> to the auger assembly <b>122</b>.

In some instances, the material feed sensor <b>156</b> includes a mechanical paddle-type, a sonic sensor, or other type of sensor. In examples, the material feed sensor <b>156</b> generates a signal that indicates a distance of the material feed sensor <b>156</b> from the paving material <b>118</b> at an outboard end of an auger of the auger assembly <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some instances, a material feed status of the paving machine <b>100</b> may be determined using a state of feeder pumps. For example, the paving machine <b>100</b> may include feeder pumps that supply liquids (e.g., oil, tar, etc.) during the paving operation. If the feeder pumps are off, the material feed status may be off, whereas if the feeder pumps are on, the material feed status may be autonomous. The feeder pumps may also be in manual mode for knowing whether the material feed status is manual.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">A hopper activation sensor <b>158</b> measures whether the hopper <b>116</b> is activated (e.g., activating sides of the hopper <b>116</b> to funnel the paving material <b>118</b> to the conveyor system <b>120</b>). Further, sensor(s) measure whether the engine is powered on or powered off, whether a key or ignition switch is activated or deactivated, and/or a propel mode of the paving machine <b>100</b>, such as whether the paving machine <b>100</b> is maneuvering, whether the paving machine <b>100</b> is depositing the paving material <b>118</b> (e.g., paving), and so forth. Additionally, the paving machine <b>100</b> includes camera(s) that image the paving mat <b>108</b> and/or an environment at the worksite.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As introduced above, the paving machine <b>100</b> includes the controller <b>144</b>.

The modules control various circuitry of the paving machine <b>100</b> which causes various components of the paving machine <b>100</b> to activate, deactivate, or operate according to certain parameters. For example, the modules control whether the hopper <b>116</b> is activated, whether the screed heat is on, whether the screed assembly <b>128</b> is floating, and so forth. As such, the modules are utilized to determine the statuses of various components of the paving machine <b>100</b>, such as whether the components are activated or a certain state of activation.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The paving machine <b>100</b> therefore includes a plurality of sensors for generating data associated with a paving operation.

In some instances, the temperature sensor(s) include the paving material temperature sensor <b>138</b> (e.g., the temperature sensor <b>138</b>) that measures a temperature of the paving material <b>118</b> at the auger assembly <b>122</b>, the ground temperature sensor <b>140</b> (e.g., the temperature sensor <b>140</b>) that measures a temperature of the ground surface <b>124</b>, the ambient temperature sensor <b>142</b> (e.g., the temperature sensor <b>142</b>) that measures an ambient temperature at a worksite associated with the paving machine <b>100</b>, a hydraulic oil temperature sensor <b>200</b> that measures a temperature of hydraulic fluid within the paving machine <b>100</b>, or within components of the paving machine <b>100</b> (e.g., hydraulic actuators, lines, pumps, etc.), and/or an engine temperature sensor <b>202</b> that measures a temperature of an engine of the paving machine <b>100</b>. The various temperature sensor(s) include, for example, thermocouples, resistance temperature detectors (RTDs), thermistors, or semiconductor based integrated circuits (IC).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The paving machine <b>100</b> further includes the LIDAR sensor <b>146</b> and the RADAR sensor <b>148</b>. The LIDAR sensor <b>146</b> measures a distance to a target (e.g., the paving mat <b>108</b>) by illuminating the target with laser light and measuring the reflected light with a sensor. The RADAR sensor <b>148</b> uses radio waves to determine the range, angle, or velocity of a target (e.g., the paving mat <b>108</b>).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The paving machine <b>100</b> includes the screed float sensor <b>150</b> that measures whether the screed assembly <b>128</b> is floating, or is free to float. In some instances, whether the screed assembly <b>128</b> is floating may be based on switches (e.g., circuitry) of the paving machine <b>100</b> being activated and/or whether the screed assembly <b>128</b> is bonded, locked, or otherwise fixed in position. In such instances, the screed assembly <b>128</b> may be fixed in height. For example, an operator of the paving machine <b>100</b> may actuate switches that function or control the screed assembly <b>128</b> to float. In such instances, an indication of such is used to determine that the screed assembly <b>128</b> is floating.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The speed sensor <b>154</b> measures a ground speed of the paving machine <b>100</b> at the worksite. The material feed sensor <b>156</b> is included to measure whether the conveyor system <b>120</b> is supplying paving material <b>118</b> to the auger assembly <b>122</b>. In some instances, the material feed sensor <b>156</b> provides indications of whether the conveyor system <b>120</b> is operational or non-operational. When operational, the conveyor system <b>120</b> conveys the paving material <b>118</b> from the hopper <b>116</b> to the auger assembly <b>122</b>, whether autonomously or manually. For example, the conveyor system <b>120</b> may autonomously convey the paving material <b>118</b> according to a certain rate, based on a speed of the paving machine <b>100</b>, a width or depth of the paving mat <b>108</b>, a temperature of the paving material <b>118</b>, and so forth. Here, the conveyor system <b>120</b> autonomously provides the paving material <b>118</b> based on sensed conditions at the worksite (e.g., speed, temperature, screed height, etc.). Comparatively, an operator of the paving machine <b>100</b> may manually control the conveyor system <b>120</b> for providing the paving material <b>118</b> to the auger assembly <b>122</b> (e.g., via the control interface <b>134</b>). By way of example, the operator may adjust a speed of the conveyor system <b>120</b> to increase or decrease the amount of paving material <b>118</b> conveyed to the auger assembly <b>122</b>. In instances where the conveyor system <b>120</b> is non-operational, the conveyor system <b>120</b> is powered down so as to not supply the paving material <b>118</b> to the auger assembly <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some instances, the material feed sensor <b>156</b> communicatively couples to motors of the conveyor system <b>120</b> for determining whether the conveyor system <b>120</b> is supplying the paving material <b>118</b>. The material feed sensor <b>156</b> may also represent an ultrasonic sensor that measures the supply of the paving material <b>118</b>.

In some instances, the screed heat sensor <b>206</b> represents a temperature sensor, or a switch that determines whether heating elements within the screed assembly <b>128</b> are heating the paving material <b>118</b>. For example, the paving machine <b>100</b> may include a heating system <b>218</b> coupled to, thermally connected to, and/or otherwise associated with the screed assembly <b>128</b>. The heating system <b>218</b> includes, for example, one or more electronic heat plates, heat coils, or other components configured to increase the temperature of the screed assembly <b>128</b> (or a screed plate) to a desired operating temperature. In some instances, the heating system <b>218</b> includes an electronic heat plate operably connected to a battery, generator, and/or other source of electronic power. In such instances, the electronic heat plate is activated by directing electronic power thereto, and the heat plate is controlled to obtain and/or maintain a desired temperature during operation. Controlling the heat plate and/or other components of the heating system <b>218</b> in this manner causes a commensurate increase in a temperature of the screed assembly <b>128</b>, and maintains a desired temperature during operation.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">A hopper activation sensor <b>158</b> measure whether the hopper <b>116</b> of the paving machine <b>100</b> is activated. For example, as a haul truck deposits the paving material <b>118</b> into the hopper <b>116</b>, the hopper <b>116</b> may be deactivated. In the deactivated state, the hopper <b>116</b> includes a width that is substantially equal to the width of the haul truck depositing the paving material <b>118</b>. However, as the paving material <b>118</b> is supplied by the conveyor system <b>120</b> to the auger assembly <b>122</b>, the amount of the paving material <b>118</b> in the hopper <b>116</b> lessens. At this point, to channel the paving material <b>118</b> towards or into the conveyor system <b>120</b>, sides of the hopper <b>116</b> tip or fold inwards, towards the conveyor system <b>120</b>. This causes the paving material <b>118</b> to fall towards the conveyor system <b>120</b>, thereby allowing the paving material <b>118</b> to be conveyed to the auger assembly <b>122</b>. In some instances, the hopper activation sensor <b>158</b> communicatively couples to actuators of the hopper <b>116</b> for measuring whether the actuators are extended (e.g., hopper activated) or retracted (e.g., hopper deactivated). For example, the hopper activation sensor <b>158</b> may represent a displacement sensor (e.g., radar, LIDAR, photoemitter, proximity sensor, etc.) that detects whether actuators of the hopper <b>116</b> are displaced.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The paving machine <b>100</b> includes an ignition sensor <b>214</b> that measures whether an ignition of the paving machine <b>100</b> is powered on or powered off. In some instances, the ignition sensor <b>214</b> measures &#x201c;key on&#x201d; and &#x201c;key off&#x201d; events (e.g., whether a key of the paving machine <b>100</b> is turned &#x201c;on&#x201d; or &#x201c;off&#x201d;). An engine sensor <b>216</b> serves to measure whether an engine of the paving machine <b>100</b> is powered on or powered off. The communication device <b>136</b> measures a location of the paving machine <b>100</b>. The communication device <b>136</b> is connected to and/or otherwise in communication with one or more satellites <b>210</b> or other GPS components configured to assist the communication device <b>136</b> in determining the location of the paving machine <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The controller <b>144</b> is configured to receive respective signals from the sensor(s). For example, the controller <b>144</b> receives one or more signals from the communication device <b>136</b> including information indicating a location of the paving machine <b>100</b>, one or more signals from the hopper activation sensor <b>158</b> indicating an activation of the hopper <b>116</b>, one or more signals from the material feed sensor <b>156</b> indicating an operational status of the conveyor system <b>120</b> (e.g., auto feed, manual feed, off), one or more signals from screed heat sensor <b>206</b> indicating whether the heating system <b>218</b> is heating the paving material <b>118</b>, and so forth. The paving machine <b>100</b> stores various information received from the sensor(s) within memory <b>212</b>. For example, the memory <b>212</b> is shown storing or having access to sensor data <b>220</b>, which is generated by the various sensor(s) of the paving machine <b>100</b>. The sensor data <b>220</b>, as discussed herein, is usable to determine defects in the paving mat <b>108</b>. That is, the sensor data <b>220</b> generated by the various sensor(s) of the paving machine <b>100</b>, or components thereof, is usable to determine defects in the paving mat <b>108</b>. For example, the sensor data <b>220</b> may indicate a status of the paving machine <b>100</b> (e.g., configurations), or a status of components of the paving machine <b>100</b>, operational parameters of the paving machine <b>100</b> (e.g., material feed), and/or worksite conditions (e.g., temperature).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The memory <b>212</b> is further shown storing or having access to mode data <b>222</b>, which in some instances, indicates a mode of the paving machine <b>100</b>. Modes include, for example, paving, maneuvering, or traveling. Paving indicates that the paving machine <b>100</b> is paving by depositing the paving material <b>118</b>. Maneuvering mode allows the paving machine <b>100</b> to counter-rotate (e.g., for a track machine) or turn sharper (e.g., for a wheeled machine). During maneuvering, the conveyor system <b>120</b> (as well as screed vibrational systems) are disabled. The maneuvering mode may be useful when moving around a job site when not paving, when the paving machine <b>100</b> backs up, or maneuvers into tight spaces to start paving. Travel mode allows the paving machine <b>100</b> to travel at higher ground speeds, and also disables functions of the paving machine <b>100</b> other than drive and steering. Travel mode may be utilized when going back to the start of the paving mat <b>108</b> for a second pass on a long paving pass, or sometimes traveling to another job site. In some instances, the modes are associated with a propulsion of the paving machine (e.g., via the ground-engaging elements <b>112</b>) or a status of a transmission (e.g., in gear, parked, etc.).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The computing device(s) <b>102</b> comprise, for example, one or more servers, laptop computers, or other computers located at a paving material plant remote from the worksite at which the paving machine <b>100</b> is being used. In such examples, the communication device <b>136</b> is connected to and/or otherwise in communication with the computing device(s) <b>102</b> via the network <b>104</b>. The network <b>104</b> may be a local area network (&#x201c;LAN&#x201d;), a larger network such as a wide area network (&#x201c;WAN&#x201d;), or a collection of networks, such as the Internet.

However, the paving machine <b>100</b> additionally or alternatively communicatively couple to additional electronic devices such as tablets, mobile phones, laptop computers, and/or other mobile devices. Such mobile devices are located at the worksite or, alternatively, one or more such mobile devices are located at the paving material plant described above, or at another location remote from the worksite. In such instances, the communication device <b>136</b> is connected to and/or otherwise in communication with such mobile devices via the network <b>104</b>.

For example, depending on the types of defects, operators of the paving machine <b>100</b> are trained to avoid doing those actions that cause particular types of mat defects.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some instances, the types of mat defects include, for example, (1) a waiting mat defect, (2) an auger chamber fill mat defect, (3) a paving finishing pull mat defect, (4) a material feed manual override while paving mat defect, and (5) a hopper activation mat defect. In some instances, each of the aforementioned defects are associated with respective criteria <b>224</b> that leads to paving mat defects. In some instances, more than one of the criteria <b>224</b> associated with the paving mat defects is satisfied at the same time and/or at the same location. That is, more than one paving mat defect may be predicted. Moreover, each of the aforementioned defects may include multiple subcategories, for further defining the defect or operating parameters that lead to the defect. The monitoring component <b>106</b> is configured to receive the sensor data <b>220</b> and compare the sensor data <b>220</b> to the criteria <b>224</b> for use in determining whether a defect is predicted and/or the cause of defect.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The first defect, waiting mat defect, may be caused in instances where the screed assembly <b>128</b> is floating (screed float on), the material feed is off (e.g., paving material <b>118</b> is not being supplied to the auger assembly <b>122</b>), and the paving machine <b>100</b> is not moving (e.g., stationary). Indications of such may be provided by the screed float sensor <b>150</b>, the material feed sensor <b>156</b>, and the speed sensor <b>154</b>, respectively. A waiting mat defect occurs in instances where the paving material <b>118</b> is cooled while the paving machine <b>100</b> is stationary. Upon resuming paving, for example, the cooled paving material <b>118</b> mixes with other paving material <b>118</b> and when deposited, leads to a defect in the paving mat <b>108</b>. For example, the cooled paving material <b>118</b> may not properly mix with the other paving material <b>118</b>, creating an inconsistent paving mat <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The second defect, an auger chamber fill mat defect, may be caused in multiple instances. For example, the auger chamber fill mat defect may be caused where the material feed is auto, the screed assembly <b>128</b> is floating, a temperature of the hydraulic oil is greater than a threshold (e.g., 35&#xb0; C.), the paving machine <b>100</b> is in pave mode, the screed heat is off, and the paving machine <b>100</b> is not moving (e.g., stationary). In another instance, the auger chamber fill mat defect is caused where the screed assembly <b>128</b> is floating, the material feed is manual, a temperature of the hydraulic oil is greater than a threshold (e.g., 35&#xb0; C.), the paving machine <b>100</b> is in pave mode or maneuver mode, and the paving machine <b>100</b> is not moving (e.g., stationary). Still in some instances, the auger chamber fill mat defect may be caused where the screed assembly <b>128</b> is floating, the paving machine <b>100</b> is in pave mode, the screed heat is on, and the material feed is either auto or manual. Indications of such may be provided by the transmission, the screed float sensor <b>150</b>, the screed heat sensor <b>206</b>, the hydraulic oil temperature sensor <b>200</b>, the material feed sensor <b>156</b>, and the speed sensor <b>154</b>. Filling the auger chamber while the paving machine <b>100</b> is not moving may cause segregation within the paving material <b>118</b>. For example, the paving material <b>118</b> may continue to be supplied to the auger assembly <b>122</b>, mixing the paving material <b>118</b>, but being as the paving machine <b>100</b> is not moving, clumps of the paving material <b>118</b> form. When the paving machine <b>100</b> starts paving again, the collection of large aggregates do not compact well and allow air voids to form. These air voids can eventually fill with water and cause damage during freeze/thaw cycles.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The third defect, a paving finishing pull mat defect, may be caused where the hopper <b>116</b> is not activated, the screed float is off, the material feed is automatic, the paving machine <b>100</b> is in pave mode, and the paving machine <b>100</b> is moving. Indications of such may be provided by the transmission, the screed float sensor <b>150</b>, the material feed sensor <b>156</b>, the hopper activation sensor <b>158</b>, and the speed sensor <b>154</b>. With the paving finishing pull, the screed assembly <b>128</b> is no longer in float and the weight of the assembly <b>128</b> is being carried by the paving machine <b>100</b> instead of being transferred to the paving mat <b>108</b>, or the paving material <b>118</b>. Because this weight transfer is not taking place, the paving material <b>118</b> in the area of this defect is not being pre-compacted. The height of the paving material <b>118</b> surface is the same, but the density of the paving material <b>118</b> is less because of lack of pre-compaction. When a compactor compacts this paving material <b>118</b>, a depression is created in the paving mat <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The fourth defect, material feed manual override while paving mat defect, may be caused in instances where the material feed is manual, the paving machine <b>100</b> is in pave mode, the hopper <b>116</b> is not activated, and the paving machine <b>100</b> is moving. Indications of such may be provided by the material feed sensor <b>156</b>, the transmission, the hopper activation sensor <b>158</b>, and the speed sensor <b>154</b>. In some instances, the material feed manual override while paving mat defect may be caused regardless of whether the screed heat is on or off, and/or whether the screed float is on or off. In this manner, if the paving machine <b>100</b> is paving, moving, and the material feed is manual, the monitoring component <b>106</b> predicts a defect. Such defect may be, for example, a result of an inconsistent or insufficient amount of paving material being supplied to the auger assembly <b>122</b>. This may cause bumps in the paving mat <b>108</b> (e.g., uneven surface).</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The fifth defect, hopper activation mat defect, may be caused in multiple instances where the hopper <b>116</b> is activated. For example, the hopper activation mat defect may be caused in instances where the paving machine <b>100</b> is in pave mode, the paving machine <b>100</b> is moving, the hopper <b>116</b> is activated, and except for when the material feed is off and the screed float is off. Indications of such may be provided by the material feed sensor <b>156</b>, the speed sensor <b>154</b>, the hopper activation sensor <b>158</b>, the screed float sensor <b>150</b>, and the screed heat sensor <b>206</b>. Here, activating the hopper <b>116</b> results in cooled paving material mixing with other paving material. As a result, the colder paving material may not mix properly with the paving material, causing an inconsistent density in the paving mat <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The monitoring component <b>106</b> is therefore configured to receive the sensor data <b>220</b> from the controller <b>144</b> and map the sensor data <b>220</b> (or information associated therewith) to the criteria <b>224</b> in the defect database <b>226</b> to determine whether a defect is predicted, as well as the type or cause of the defect. In some instances, the computing device(s) <b>102</b> have a comparison component <b>228</b> that compares the sensor data <b>220</b> to the criteria <b>224</b> for determining whether a defect is predicted, and if predicted, the type of defect. In instances where the monitoring component <b>106</b> predicts a defect, a location of the predicted defect is recorded, as well as the type of defect, such as within the defect database <b>226</b> as defect locations <b>230</b>. In some instances, the locations of the defects are determined, at least in part, by the communication device <b>136</b> (or associated sensor data). That is, after the monitoring component <b>106</b> predicts a defect, that defect is stored in association with a location of the paving machine <b>100</b>. Such location information is used for one or more post-paving operations for inspecting the paving mat <b>108</b>. Additionally, or alternatively, the monitoring component <b>106</b> generates and provides notifications <b>232</b> that indicate the locations of the defects, as well as the type of defect, along a route the paving machine <b>100</b> travels. This allows operators of the paving machine <b>100</b> to observe the defects (e.g., via the control interface <b>134</b>) in real-time for assessing a quality of the paving mat <b>108</b> and/or a productivity of the paving machine <b>100</b>. In doing so, the operator of the paving machine <b>100</b> may make adjustments to reduce the number of defects and/or the notifications <b>232</b> may be used for training purposes, such as how to properly operate the paving machine <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some examples, the computing device(s) <b>102</b> may include one or more machine-learned model(s) <b>208</b> that are configured to perform tasks related to defect identification using the sensor data <b>220</b>, a defect type identification, and so forth. For instance, the monitoring component <b>106</b> may utilize a machine-learned model(s) <b>208</b> to predict paving mat defects. In some instances, as part of predicting the paving mat defects, the machine-learned model(s) <b>208</b> associates the sensor data <b>220</b> with determining paving mat defects (e.g., ambient temperature, speed of the paving machine, screed assembly height, and so forth). Example machine-learned model(s) <b>208</b> may include a regression algorithm (e.g., ordinary least squares regression (OLSR), linear regression, logistic regression, stepwise regression, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS)), a decision tree algorithm (e.g., classification and regression tree (CART), iterative dichotomiser 3 (ID3), Chi-squared automatic interaction detection (CHAID), decision stump, conditional decision trees), or other machine-learning algorithm to determine which remedies apply to which defects, an order of how to apply different remedies to resolve a defect, which remedies to apply in combination to resolve a defect, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some instances, the machine-learned model(s) <b>208</b> are part of a neural network, which is a biologically inspired algorithm which passes input data through a series of connected layers to produce an output. Each layer in a neural network can also comprise another neural network, or can comprise any number of layers (whether convolutional or not). As can be understood in the context of this disclosure, a neural network can utilize machine learning, which can refer to a broad class of such algorithms in which an output is generated based on learned parameters. Further, although discussed in the context of neural networks, any type of machine learning can be used consistent with this disclosure. Beyond those just described, machine learning algorithms can include, but are not limited to, instance-based algorithms (e.g., ridge regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), elastic net, least-angle regression (LARS)), Bayesian algorithms (e.g., na&#xef;ve Bayes, Gaussian na&#xef;ve Bayes, multinomial na&#xef;ve Bayes, average one-dependence estimators (AODE), Bayesian belief network (BNN), Bayesian networks), clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means, k-medians, expectation maximization (EM), hierarchical clustering), association rule learning algorithms (e.g., perceptron, back-propagation, hopfield network, Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN)), deep learning algorithms (e.g., Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM), Deep Belief Networks (DBN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Stacked Auto-Encoders), Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms (e.g., Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Principal Component Regression (PCR), Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Sammon Mapping, Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), Projection Pursuit, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Mixture Discriminant Analysis (MDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA)), Ensemble Algorithms (e.g., Boosting, Bootstrapped Aggregation (Bagging), AdaBoost, Stacked Generalization (blending), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT), Random Forest), SVM (support vector machine), supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, etc. Additional examples of architectures include neural networks such as ResNet50, ResNet101, VGG, DenseNet, PointNet, and the like.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">It is to be understood that the monitoring component <b>106</b>, or more generally the computing device(s) <b>102</b>, continuously receive the sensor data <b>220</b> for use in predicting defects in the paving mat <b>108</b> throughout a paving operation at a worksite. Moreover, the monitoring component <b>106</b> may utilize multiple instances of the sensor data <b>220</b> to identify a paving mat defect. In other words, the monitoring component <b>106</b> receives the sensor data <b>220</b> from different types of sensors. Additionally, or alternatively, the monitoring component <b>106</b> may rely on multiple instances of a same type of sensor data <b>220</b> to predict a paving mat defect.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some instances, the monitoring component <b>106</b> stores the sensor data <b>220</b> received from the sensors of the paving machine <b>100</b> in association with identified paving mat defects and known defect types in the defect database <b>226</b>. In this way, the defect database <b>226</b> grows to accommodate sensor data received in different conditions, at different times of day, using different paving materials, and so forth, and thus the monitoring component <b>106</b> becomes more accurate at identifying paving mat defects. The monitoring component <b>106</b>, the defect database <b>226</b>, the comparison component <b>228</b>, and the machine-learned models are shown residing in memory <b>204</b> of the computing device(s) <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The paving machine <b>100</b> includes additional components not specifically mentioned. For example, the paving machine <b>100</b> may include hydraulic components such as one or more hydraulic pumps, oil pumps, coolant pumps, and/or other hydraulic components configured to provide desired functionality to the paving machine <b>100</b>. Such hydraulic components include one or more hydraulic cylinders, hydraulic actuators, propulsion pumps, one or more pumps connected to the auger assembly <b>122</b>, one or more pumps connected to the conveyor system <b>120</b>, one or more tamper bar pumps, one or more fan pumps, and/or one or more additional pumps connected to a moveable component of the paving machine <b>100</b>. In any of the examples described herein, the hydraulic pump, oil pump, coolant pump, and/or any of the other hydraulic components couple to, are driven by, and/or otherwise connected to a power source of the paving machine <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Although shown as residing at the computing device(s) <b>102</b>, the monitoring component <b>106</b> as well as other data, components, and so forth stored in the memory <b>204</b> may be stored locally at the paving machine <b>100</b>. In such instances, the paving machine <b>100</b> may include the monitoring component <b>106</b>, as well as the defect database <b>226</b>, for example, stored in memory for determining the defects in the paving mat <b>108</b>. In such instances, processing may occur locally at the paving machine <b>100</b>. However, processing may be divided between the paving machine <b>100</b> and the computing device(s) <b>102</b> based on demand, load, and computation capacity.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Additionally, although not shown, the paving machine <b>100</b> may include one or more modules, such as an engine module, machine module, or a transmission module for determining operational statuses of the various components of the paving machine <b>100</b>. The modules serve to control various circuitry of the paving machine <b>100</b> which causes various components of the paving machine <b>100</b> to activate. For example, the modules control whether the hopper <b>116</b> is activated, whether the screed heat is on, whether the screed assembly <b>128</b> is floating, whether the transmission is in park, drive mode, etc., how the paving material <b>118</b> is supplied, and so forth. As an example, the modules provide indications of statuses of the components based on whether voltages or current are being supplied to such components, or commands transmitted to the components that control their respective operations. In other words, the modules are utilized to determine the statuses of various components of the paving machine <b>100</b>, such as whether the components are activated or a certain state of activation.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Furthermore, the paving machine <b>100</b> and/or the computing device(s) <b>102</b> may communicatively couple to additional device(s) via the network <b>104</b>. For example, a paving material plant may generate ticketing data that indicates paving material prepared for the paving operation. The ticketing data indicates a weight of the paving material, a time the paving material was prepared, a temperature of the paving material, and so forth. Such information may be utilized by the monitoring component <b>106</b> to determine the productivity of the paving operation. Moreover, the monitoring component <b>106</b> may receive data from haul trucks that transport the paving material from the paving material plant to a worksite. Such information includes, for example, a location of the haul trucks and/or a speed of the haul trucks. Using this information, the monitoring component <b>106</b> may predict paving mat defects.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The paving machine <b>100</b> therefore include a plurality of sensor(s) for generating sensor data to be used by the computing device(s) <b>102</b>, or components thereof, for predicting defects in the paving mat <b>108</b>. The computing device(s) <b>102</b> are configured to compare the sensor data against criteria <b>224</b> associated with the defects for predicting an occurrence of the defect. In instances were defects are predicted, notifications of such are provided, or displayed, on the control interface <b>134</b> of the paving machine <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an illustration of an example user interface <b>300</b> generated by the controller <b>144</b> of the paving machine <b>100</b> for presenting the paving mat defects as determined by the monitoring component <b>106</b>. The user interface <b>300</b> may be presented on the control interface <b>134</b> at the paving machine <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The user interface <b>300</b> includes, for example, a map <b>302</b> illustrating at least part of an example travel path <b>304</b> of the paving machine <b>100</b>. In some instances, the map <b>302</b> provided by the user interface <b>300</b> includes one or more images, icons, markers, identifiers, and/or other visual indicia associated with the worksite, a route taken along the travel path <b>304</b> by the paving machine <b>100</b>, a location <b>306</b> of the paving machine <b>100</b>, and so forth. The user interface <b>300</b> also presents indicia of various predicted paving mat defects. For example, in instances where the monitoring component <b>106</b> predicts a defect in the paving mat <b>108</b>, the controller <b>144</b> receives the notification <b>232</b> of such and displays, on the control interface <b>134</b>, the indicia. In some instances, the indicia of the defect is displayed along the travel path <b>304</b> at a location in which the paving mat defect is located. This allows an operator of the paving machine <b>100</b>, for example, to visually observe where along the travel path <b>304</b> the defects are predicted.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some instances, the indicia is selected (e.g., clicked, highlighted, etc.) for providing information as to a type of the defect in the paving mat <b>108</b>. For example, the operator may hover over or select an indicia <b>308</b> associated with a defect in the paving mat <b>108</b>. Therein, the user interface <b>300</b> displays the type of defect and/or the location of the defect within a portion <b>310</b> of the user interface <b>300</b>. In some instances, the user interface <b>300</b> also displays a time at which the defect occurred, a speed of the paving machine <b>100</b>, a temperature of the paving material <b>118</b>, and/or other information associated with the defect.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some instances, the indicia of the defects are color coordinated or include different representations to allow the operator to filter or visually observe the types of defects. For example, a first indicia for a hopper activation while waiting defect includes a first color, a second indicia for a hopper activation during auger chamber fill includes a second color, and so forth. In some instances, the user interface <b>300</b> presents the operator with filtering menus (e.g., drop-down menus) for sorting the defects by type, frequency, location, occurrence, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The control interface <b>134</b> therefore presents user interfaces that visually depict a paving operation, locations of the defects, and characteristics of the defects, such as type. This allows operators of the paving machine <b>100</b> to alter setting(s) of the paving machine <b>100</b>. Additionally, displaying the defects allows for the observation of a productivity of the paving machine <b>100</b>, which in some instances, is used to further determine paving mat defects and/or for training purposes.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref> illustrate various processes related to predicting defects within the paving mat <b>108</b>. The processes described herein are illustrated as collections of blocks in logical flow diagrams, which represent a sequence of operations, some or all of which may be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination thereof. In the context of software, the blocks may represent computer-executable instructions stored on one or more computer-readable media that, when executed by one or more processors, program the processors to perform the recited operations. Generally, computer-executable instructions include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures and the like that perform particular functions or implement particular data types. The order in which the blocks are described should not be construed as a limitation, unless specifically noted. Any number of the described blocks may be combined in any order and/or in parallel to implement the process, or alternative processes, and not all of the blocks need be executed. For discussion purposes, the processes are described with reference to the environments, architectures and systems described in the examples herein, such as, for example those described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, although the processes may be implemented in a wide variety of other environments, architectures and systems.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an example process <b>400</b> for determining defects within the paving mat <b>108</b>. In some instances, the process <b>400</b> is performed by the computing device(s) <b>102</b> or components thereof, such as the monitoring component <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">At <b>402</b>, the monitoring component <b>106</b> receives information associated with a machine preparing a paving mat. For example, the monitoring component <b>106</b> receives, from the controller <b>144</b>, the sensor data <b>220</b> via the network <b>104</b>. The sensor data <b>220</b> is generated by various sensors of the paving machine <b>100</b> (as discussed above), and the controller <b>144</b> transmits the sensor data <b>220</b> automatically and/or according to predetermined schedules, intervals, requests, and so forth. By way of example, the sensor data <b>220</b> may indicate whether the paving machine <b>100</b> is in pave mode, whether the hopper <b>116</b> of the paving machine <b>100</b> is activated, whether the screed assembly <b>128</b> is floating, and so forth. Generally, the sensor data <b>220</b> indicates a status of the paving machine <b>100</b> (e.g., configurations), or a status of components of the paving machine <b>100</b>, operational parameters of the paving machine <b>100</b> (e.g., material feed), and/or worksite conditions (e.g., temperature).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">At <b>404</b>, the monitoring component <b>106</b> determines criteria associated with paving mat defects. The monitoring component <b>106</b> determines the criteria <b>224</b> via accessing the defect database <b>226</b>. As discussed above, the criteria <b>224</b> is associated with respective defects in the paving mat <b>108</b>. Thus, to know whether defects are in the paving mat <b>108</b>, the monitoring component <b>106</b> accesses the criteria <b>224</b> for use in comparison against the information to determine whether one or more defects are present in the paving mat <b>108</b>. In some instances, the criteria <b>224</b> is associated with whether the hopper <b>116</b> is activated, whether the screed assembly <b>128</b> is floating, whether the ground-engaging elements <b>112</b> are moving, whether the auger assembly <b>122</b> is actuated, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">At <b>406</b>, the monitoring component <b>106</b> determines whether the information satisfies the criteria. For example, the monitoring component <b>106</b> may compare the information received from the controller <b>144</b> of the paving machine <b>100</b> (at <b>402</b>) to determine whether the information satisfies (e.g., matches) the criteria <b>224</b>. In some instances, this involves the monitoring component <b>106</b> processing, in parallel or sequentially, the sensor data <b>220</b> and comparing the sensor data <b>220</b> to the criteria <b>224</b> associated with each of the paving mat defects. As discussed herein, such processing may be performed in real-time for providing substantially instantaneous feedback for informing the operation of potential defects in the paving mat <b>108</b>. This allows the operator to adjust a configuration or settings of the paving machine <b>100</b> to reduce the defects in the paving mat <b>108</b> and increase productivity. In some instances, more than one paving mat defect may be predicted to occur, whether at the same time, the same location, or both. For example, a waiting mat defect and an auger chamber fill mat defect may occur at the same location, at different times, whereas a hopper activation mat defect and a paving finishing pull mat defect may occur at the same location and at the same time.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">As a brief example, the criteria <b>224</b> for a waiting mat defect includes criteria of: (1) screed float on, (2) material feed off, and (3) stationary (e.g., not moving). The monitoring component <b>106</b>, via the sensor data <b>220</b>, may determine whether the sensor data <b>220</b> indicates whether the screed float is on, whether the material feed is off, and whether the paving machine <b>100</b> is stationary. If all of these criteria are satisfied, the monitoring component <b>106</b> determines that the information satisfies the criteria <b>224</b> for the waiting mat defect.

Such systems and methods are used to achieve improved paving and compacting performance by predicting mat defects earlier and with greater accuracy. Additionally, such systems and methods are used to improve efficiencies by not having to rely upon paving operators who are inexperienced with the variety of defects that occur and how to resolve such defects. For example, the system and methods may determine a type of defect associated with the paving mat <b>108</b>. This allows for the specific type of defect to be determined, and as such, the cause of the defects in the paving mat <b>108</b> may be determined.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0100">As part of this process, each of the defects are associated with criteria, or conditions that when satisfied, result in a predicted defect. Sensor data generated by a plurality of sensors at the paving machine are continuously monitored by a monitoring component <b>106</b> to determine whether data represented within the sensor data satisfies the criteria. Example criteria include, for example, a speed of the paving machine <b>100</b>, whether a screed assembly <b>128</b> is floating, whether a hopper <b>116</b> is activated, how the paving material <b>118</b> is fed to the screed assembly <b>128</b>, and so forth.

For example, indicating the type of defect allows operators to take corrective actions, such as changing a setting of the paving machine <b>100</b>, to remedy the detected defect.
