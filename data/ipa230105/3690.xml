The Total Focusing Method (TFM) is a synthetic aperture beam forming technique that has been under active development in the NDT industry over the past decade. Common applications of these techniques are to find flaws in manufactured materials such as welds.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Single-element (non-phased array) probes, known technically as monolithic probes, emit a beam in a fixed direction. To test a large volume of material, a conventional probe must be physically moved or turned to sweep the scan beam through the area of interest.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In contrast, the beam from a PAUT probe can be moved electronically, without moving the probe, and can be swept through a wide volume of material at high speed. The beam is controllable because a PAUT probe is made up of multiple small elements, each of which can be pulsed individually at a computer-calculated timing, forming incidence angles. The term phased refers to the timing, and the term array refers to the multiple elements. A beam can be defined by a corresponding aperture; where the aperture can be defined by a portion or all of the elements of the PAUT probe.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">During typical inspections of welds, multiple ultrasound beams are generated to define a single aperture or multiple apertures corresponding to various incidence angles. Acoustic scatterings from acoustic transmissions can be used to generate an image showing reflections (or diffractions) of the ultrasonic waves that are associated to defects within the scanned area in the test object. For weld inspection, the region of interest, or the scanned area, generally encompasses the weld and its surrounding area. For cases where the aperture is fixed and only the angles are changed, the images are called a sectoral scan or S-scan. For cases where the angle is fixed and only the aperture is moved, the images are called a linear scan or E-scan.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an international code &#x201c;2010 ASME Boiler &#x26; Pressure Vessel Code, 2010 Edition, Section V&#x2014;Nondestructive Examination&#x201d; (Herein after as &#x201c;codes&#x201d;), the definition of the inspection scan plan associated to weld inspection relies on the combination of a) instrumentation configuration including probe, wedge, and acquisition unit; b) acoustic setting, including, aperture size and position, focalization setting, beams angle, gating parameters and c) probe manipulation guideline, including probe to weld distance, maximum inspection speed.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">OVERVIEW</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some implementations, a method is provided for conducting an ultrasonic-based inspection, such as providing assistance and automation to an ultrasonic scan plan and setup generation. The systems and methods perform operations comprising: receiving a plurality of scan plan parameters associated with generating an image of at least one flaw within a specimen based on acoustic echo data obtained using full matrix capture (FMC); applying the plurality of scan plan parameters to an acoustic model, the acoustic model configured to determine a two-way pressure or stress response of a plurality of inspection modes based on specular reflection and diffraction phenomena; generating, by the acoustic model based on the plurality of scan plan parameters, an acoustic region of influence (AROI) comprising an acoustic amplitude sensitivity map for a first inspection mode amongst the plurality of inspection modes; and generating, for display, a first image comprising the AROI associated with the first inspection mode for capturing or inspecting the image of the at least one flaw.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The disclosure is generally discussed with a specific application to TFM and/or FMC acquisition schemes. Similar techniques can be applied to other types of image acquisitions and/or other types of imaging, such as acqusition in plane waves (e.g., limited amount of massive insonifaction in transmission, and many elementary receptions) that do not result in TFM using the elementary A-Scans.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The above overview is intended to provide an overview of subject matter of the present patent application.

These implementations, which are also referred to herein as &#x201c;examples,&#x201d; are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the disclosure, and it is to be understood that the implementations may be combined, or that other implementations may be utilized and that structural, logical and electrical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. The following detailed description is, therefore, not be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present disclosure is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">By applying appropriate transmission and reception delays to A-scan data collected in a Full Matrix Capture (FMC) dataset, TFM can electronically focus on every location within an inspection region. Since every point is electronically focused, TFM can provide better resolution compared to conventional phased array ultrasound inspection techniques. In addition, by calculating and applying the time of flights of multiple acoustic modes, multi-mode TFM can be performed which can provide additional information about the specimen being inspected. Despite these advantages, TFM also has limitations governed by physical laws. An inspection area may have poor sensitivity due to the effects of interface interaction, beam forming limitations and propagation path attenuation. Owing to the complexity of multi-mode TFM imaging, inspectors spend a great deal of time and resources trying to define an optimal scan plan that maximizes the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and probability of detection.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In addition, for inspection in pulse echo, the existing practice is based on simple ray tracing with direct evaluation of the perpendicularity of the so-called beams with the bevel. Whereas this is suitable for pulse-echo, similar simplistic models and techniques cannot be equally or easily applied to acoustic imaging that relies on more complex acoustic (such as that permitted by TFM).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Also, a recurring problem associated to weld inspection using phased array ultrasonic scans and TFM is that the combination of parameters that define the scan plan gets extremely complicated. Particularly, all the parameters in the scan plan could have vast range of selections which need to be tailored to the particular specimen under consideration and the particular flaw being targeted. It is extremely difficult to have an individual trained in such a broad range of expertise as in phased array systems, phased array probes and wedges and in weld structure and flaws. In a typical scenario, a scan plan for TFM is created by setting the attributes for the various parameters according to the specimen and flaw under consideration. The scan plan is then executed by performing an inspection of the specimen using a probe based on the scan plan parameters. The inspection of the specimen produces an image of the flaw which is then analyzed. If any one of the parameters in the scan plan is not initially accurately set, the entire inspection may be flawed and may need to be re-performed using a different set of scan plan parameters. This introduces various inefficiencies, wastes time and resources associated with performing TFM based inspections. Accordingly, there remains a challenge to configure an optimal scan plan with ranges of parameters for all the factors listed above.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The present disclosure includes various techniques to improve and enhance the way in which scan plans are conducted including how the scan plans are created, executed for inspecting a specimen, and the way in which results of inspections performed according to a given scan plan are evaluated. Specifically, the present disclosure provides an acoustic model that is configured to determine a two-way pressure response of a plurality of inspection modes based on specular reflection and diffraction phenomena. A trained individual can input a plurality of scan plan parameters into the acoustic model. The output of the acoustic model includes an acoustic region of influence (AROI) image that represents an amplitude sensitivity map for one or more inspection modes in relation with a target flaw. The trained individual can analyze the AROI and make one or more adjustments to ensure that the results of the scan plan accurately capture the flaw of interest. Once the scan plan parameters are set based on the output of the acoustic model, an inspector can execute the scan plan and perform an inspection of the specimen.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some cases, the inspector is provided with a portable tool or portable probe that itself implements or has access to the acoustic model. The inspector can input the scan plan parameters and/or adjust the scan plan parameters of the portable tool or portable probe and is presented with a simulated output of the AROI. This way, the inspector can, in real-time, view and/or make adjustments to the scan plan as the inspector is executing the scan plan to perform the inspection of the specimen.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some cases, an analysis of an executed scan plan can include a comparison of the inspection images with one or more images of the output of the acoustic model. For example, the SNR of an inspection image can be evaluated independently and the AROI map output by the acoustic model can help explain why the SNR is good or poor and possibly suggest a different mode or parameters for a subsequent inspection if the SNR is inadequate or fails to satisfy one or more criteria.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some cases, a collection of simulated images, each associated with a different set of scan plan parameters (e.g., different inspection modes) can be aggregated and combined into a single image. This enables a user to determine scan plan parameters that result in the maximum SNR. In some implementations, an automated system is provided that automatically generates a scan plan or suggests or selects one or more parameters of the scan plan for a TFM inspection based on one or more scan plan parameters that are input. To automatically generate the one or more parameters of the scan plan, the acoustic model solves an optimization problem that considers various scan plan parameters and flaw types.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the present disclosure, herein referred to as a scan plan generator <b>100</b>, is comprised of: applicative guidelines <b>110</b>, a PAUT NDT or TFM technical expertise <b>115</b>, flaw information <b>120</b>, and an automated optimization process <b>130</b>.

This is achieved by integrating PAUT NDT or TFM technical expertise <b>115</b> and the decomposition of code requirements <b>5</b> into a set of applicative guidelines <b>110</b>, which encompass the typical aspects covered for the vast majority of inspections. Alternatively, special case inspections that go beyond the scope defined by applicative guidelines <b>110</b> can still be addressed through a direct instrument configuration <b>54</b> that corresponds to existing practice which necessitates direct involvement of the experienced NDT or TFM engineer for the scan plan generation.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Herein all components of the scan plan generator <b>100</b> are types of electronic memories and/or processing device, which can be discrete components or part of an integral device.

Automated optimization process <b>130</b> collaborates with (or is integrated into) the acoustic model AROI generator <b>14</b> to find a suitable solution for the application of the flaw information <b>120</b> on component geometry <b>12</b> to be specifically inspected.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Illustrative aspects of PAUT NDT or TFM technical expertise <b>115</b> that are set by the NDT or TFM engineer in flaw information <b>120</b> for generating scan plan <b>50</b> further include: a beam focalization information, a beam aperture information, a probe and wedge selection information, a preferred scanning method information, a range of refraction angles information, and an optimization rules and levels of priority information.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Probe and wedge selection is affected by the part's external diameter (OD), the wall thickness (WT), and by the weld orientation and geometry relative to the pipe. For example, a first geometry can be a girth weld between two pipes (typically defined in the art as an AOD inspection), a second geometry can be a longitudinal weld along the pipe axis (defined in the art as an COD inspection), a third geometry can be a complex weld at the junction of two pipes. For a given flaw in flaw information <b>120</b>, the NDT or TFM engineer can maintain a table that associates probe and wedge selection with different wall thicknesses (WT) and external diameters (OD), and flaw type (e.g., side drill holes or flat bottom holes). The table can provide default values corresponding to the recommended practice for most applications.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Another aspect defining the TFM technical expertise is preferred scanning method technical expertise. TFM scanning methods include FMC, plane wave imaging, and virtual source imaging. PAUT scanning methods include the sectoral scan, or S-scan (defined by a preferred S-scanning method technical expertise <b>115</b>), where the aperture is kept at a fixed position and the refraction angle is swept through a range of angles. Another PPAUT scanning method is the linear scan, or E-scan (defined by a preferred E-scanning method technical expertise <b>115</b>), where the beam refraction angle is kept fixed and scanning is made by lateral movement of the selected probe aperture. Other scanning methods (inspection modes) include pulse echo mode, double-skip mode, or self-tandem mode. Within each of these scanning methods additional parameters, such as the wave sets can be selected. In some cases, certain pule echo scanning methods are replaced in TFM by one or more of longitudinal-longitudinal (LL), TT, and transverse-transverse-transverse-transverse (TTTT) wave sets and the self-tandem mode includes TTT, transverse-longitudinal-transverse (TLT), longitudinal-longitudinal-transverse (LLT), longitudinal-longitudinal-longitudinal (LLL), longitudinal-transverse-transverse (LTT), and transverse-transverse-longitudinal (TTL) wave sets. A given TFM scan plan includes a selection of one of these scanning methods and the specific wave set of the selected scanning method.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The NDT or TFM technical expertise can define optimization rules and/or levels of priority. Levels of priority between optimization rules deal with interferences between these rules. More specifically, for weld inspection with pulse echo PAUT or TFM, there are typically four different optimization rules. The first optimization rule is to reduce the number of separate probe passes that are required to cover an inspection area. The second optimization rule is to reduce the angular range be generated by the PAUT or TFM probe. The third optimization rule is to minimize the distance between the probe and the weld (ideally down to the minimum distance not leading to mechanical interferences, information that should be found in the definition of component geometry <b>12</b>). The fourth optimization rule is to reduce the total number of beams that maximizes scan productivity, such as using FMC to partially fill a matrix including only required information to improve productivity. Based on these optimization rules and/or levels of priority, the acoustic model AROI generator <b>14</b> can process a set of inputs and solve an optimization problem to automatically generate and recommend a set of scan plan parameters that are determined to maximize the SNR of the flaw within a specimen. A fifth optimization rule for TFM is to reduce the number of pixels to process in order to increase productivity. A sixth optimization rule for TFM is to select which mode to process and where in the image the mode should process.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The acoustic model AROI generator <b>14</b> is developed using a combination of optics and acoustics models. Specifically, certain optical beam propagation models are adapted for application to acoustic signals and information. Similar equations of motion for optics (e.g., wave propagation equations) are used to generate the acoustic model with consideration of boundary conditions of a specimen. The main components of the AROI model include: wave propagation both in transmission and reception; interface interactions (transmission through interfaces and reflection from interfaces); flaw scattering (general diffraction approach); and application to phased-array systems. The acoustic model AROI generator <b>14</b> may include a ray-based acoustic model that calculates the two-way pressure response of pulse echo, self-tandem, and/or double-skip TFM inspection modes.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some implementations, since the transmission and reception beams employed in phased array imaging typically have a well-defined propagation direction, in the acoustic model in the acoustic model AROI generator <b>14</b> makes use of the paraxial Fourier optics to describe the propagation of the acoustic beams.

In general, the AROI map differs for directional and non-directional flaw scatterers. NDT examples of non-directional scatterers include slag and porosity in welds; examples of directional scatterers include lack of fusion in welds and various cracks. The acoustic model implemented by the generator <b>14</b> takes into account the effects of transmission and reflection coefficients, geometric beam spread and material attenuation. In addition, the acoustic model also uses the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld integral to model the far-field scattering response for a Flat Bottom Hole (FBH) which may be used to simulate directional flaws.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0048">The acoustic model AROI generator <b>14</b> presents to the user the AROI to the user to identify to the user a simulated result or image of an inspection of the specimen based on the input parameters. For example, the acoustic model AROI generator <b>14</b> may receive input from the user that specifies parameters for a scan plan including pulse-echo TT mode. In such cases, the acoustic model AROI generator <b>14</b> outputs a simulated image of the inspection that is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The user can analyze the simulated results (e.g., the image shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) and modify one or more parameters of the scan plan.

For example, the user can modify the inspection mode to specify a second inspection mode and one or more parameters of the second inspection mode. The acoustic model AROI generator <b>14</b> can then generate, in real-time, a simulated inspection image of the revised parameters of the scan plan.

These images may be presented simultaneously (e.g., when an option is input to instruct the acoustic model AROI generator <b>14</b> to generate simultaneously two or more different simulated outputs for two or more inspection modes) or sequentially when the user selects a different inspection mode after seeing the results of a particular inspection mode.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0054">In some implementations, the acoustic model AROI generator <b>14</b> automatically recommends one or more parameters of a scan plan based on flaw information <b>120</b>.

The flaw information <b>120</b> may include a database that associates a plurality of weld flaws with an expected position in the specimen of each of a plurality of weld flaws. Specifically, the acoustic model AROI generator <b>14</b> receives input from a user that defines a flaw and one or more parameters of a scan plan. In some cases, the user does not specify the inspection mode for the scan plan. In response, the acoustic model AROI generator <b>14</b> accesses the flaw information <b>120</b> to determine a given weld flaw that matches the user defined flaw.

The acoustic model AROI generator <b>14</b> recommends or presents to the user for each of a plurality of inspection modes, one or more parameters to use in a scan plan (e.g., the probe and wedge selection, a probe placement, and/or acoustic parameters). Specifically, the acoustic model AROI generator <b>14</b> presents a display that lists various inspection modes and that provides for each inspection mode one or more parameters that are recommended to use for that particular inspection mode.

Specifically, for a given acoustic mode, the AROI map can show the locations within the TFM imaging area where one would expect to obtain good SNR. Consequently, a user can use the AROI to intelligently combine a multitude of acoustic modes to obtain good SNR over a large portion of the TFM imaging area. To generate a multi-mode image, a criterium (e.g., a threshold) that defines for a given acoustic mode where the SNR is deemed sufficient is received (e.g., from the user and/or from storage). For example, a &#x2212;6 dB drop (relative to the maximum amplitude) threshold can be used. As an example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the acoustic model AROI generator <b>14</b> can obtain a first simulated image <b>710</b> corresponding to a first inspection mode (e.g., a self-tandem TLT inspection mode).

If the difference exceeds the threshold that is provided for the first inspection mode, the acoustic model AROI generator <b>14</b> removes that portion from a first multi-mode image <b>720</b> that is generated.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0062">The acoustic model AROI generator <b>14</b> adds the first multi-mode image <b>720</b> to a composite multi-mode image <b>730</b> and assigns a given color to the first multi-mode image <b>720</b> in the composite multi-mode image <b>730</b> (e.g., a composite multi-mode AROI coverage map). The first multi-mode image <b>720</b> in the composite multi-mode image <b>730</b> represents the coverage of the mode associated with the first multi-mode image <b>720</b>. Next, the acoustic model AROI generator <b>14</b> obtains a second simulated image corresponding to a second inspection mode (e.g., a self-tandem TTT inspection mode). The acoustic model AROI generator <b>14</b> can identify the maximum amplitude in the second simulated image and compare remaining amplitudes that are shown in the second simulated image to obtain a difference. The acoustic model AROI generator <b>14</b> retrieves the threshold associated with the TTT or second inspection mode (which may be different from the threshold associated with the first inspection mode). If the difference exceeds the threshold that is provided for the second inspection mode, the acoustic model AROI generator <b>14</b> removes that portion from a second multi-mode image that is generated. The acoustic model AROI generator <b>14</b> adds the second multi-mode image <b>734</b> to a composite multi-mode image <b>730</b> (or composite multi-mode coverage map) and assigns a second color to the second multi-mode image <b>734</b> in the composite multi-mode image <b>730</b>. The second multi-mode image <b>734</b> in the composite multi-mode image <b>730</b> represents the coverage of the mode associated with the second multi-mode image <b>734</b>. Any number of additional multi-mode images can be generated and combined into the composite multi-mode image <b>730</b>, each being assigned a different color or distinguishing visual attribute in the composite multi-mode image <b>730</b>. In this way, the composite multi-mode coverage map illustrates the coverage of one mode relative to another mode.

Specifically, by combining multiple cut-off criteria from a plurality of acoustic inspection modes, the acoustic model AROI generator <b>14</b> or user can determine which acoustic mode(s) should be used to reconstruct each pixel within a composite multi-mode TFM image. In some cases, the acoustic model AROI generator <b>14</b> automatically identifies the area of the composite image with the greatest overlap and identifies which acoustic mode contributes the greatest amount of amplitude to that area. In some cases, the acoustic model AROI generator <b>14</b> can then automatically recommend the acoustic mode as a scan plan parameter for a user to use that contributes the greatest amount of amplitude to the area of overlap in the composite image <b>730</b>.
