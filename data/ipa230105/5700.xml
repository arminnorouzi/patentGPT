As shown, ion implantation system <b>100</b> includes ion source <b>102</b> and extraction manipulator <b>104</b> for generating ribbon beam <b>105</b>. Extraction manipulator <b>104</b> extracts ribbon beam <b>105</b> from ion source <b>102</b> and directs ribbon beam <b>105</b> into magnetic analyzer <b>108</b> where ribbon beam <b>105</b> is filtered by mass, charge, and/or energy. Ribbon beam <b>105</b> is further directed through multipole magnets <b>110</b>, electrode assembly <b>106</b>, and multipole magnets <b>114</b> to adjust the energy, shape, direction, angle, and/or uniformity of ribbon beam <b>105</b>. In particular, electrode assembly <b>106</b> is configured to adjust the energy of ribbon beam <b>105</b>, remove neutral species from ribbon beam <b>105</b>, and/or adjust the size, shape, and uniformity of ribbon beam <b>105</b>. Multipole magnets <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> are configured to adjust the uniformity, center angle, and/or divergence angle of ribbon beam <b>105</b>. Variable aperture assembly <b>112</b> is positioned between multipole magnets <b>110</b> and magnetic analyzer <b>108</b>. Variable aperture assembly <b>112</b> is configured to adjust the ion current of ribbon beam <b>105</b>. Ion implantation system <b>100</b> further includes wafer chuck <b>118</b> within processing chamber <b>130</b>, which is configured to position wafer <b>116</b> in the path of ribbon beam <b>105</b>, thereby causing implantation of ions into wafer <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Ion implantation system <b>100</b> further includes controller <b>132</b> which includes memory <b>134</b> (which optionally includes one or more computer-readable storage mediums), processor(s) <b>136</b>, and input/output (I/O) interface <b>138</b>.

The angle between each pair of adjacent beamlets is a ribbon beam angle of ribbon beam <b>105</b>.

While being deflected, the ions in ribbon beam <b>105</b> are filtered according to energy and mass-to-charge ratio such that only ions having a desired energy and mass-to-charge ratio may pass through magnetic analyzer <b>108</b> toward wafer <b>116</b>. In some examples, magnetic analyzer <b>108</b> directs ribbon beam <b>105</b> along a linear path from opening <b>113</b> to electrode assembly <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, ribbon beam <b>105</b> is directed through variable aperture assembly <b>112</b> and multipole magnets <b>110</b> between magnetic analyzer <b>108</b> and electrode assembly <b>106</b>. Variable aperture assembly <b>112</b> includes two or more movable plates that define variable aperture <b>115</b>. The movable plates are configured to adjust the size and shape of the variable aperture <b>115</b>, which defines the size and shape of ribbon beam <b>105</b> exiting variable aperture assembly <b>112</b>.

Electrical energy is supplied to the array of coils to generate magnetic fields for each coil of the array of coils to create several different magnetic forces that act on ribbon beam <b>105</b> in different directions. Thus, the magnetic fields generated by the array of coils may adjust the size, shape, angle, and/or uniformity of ribbon beam <b>105</b> at the same time. For example, a suitable magnetic field can be generated by multipole magnets <b>110</b> to control the size, current density, and shape of the ribbon beam <b>105</b> simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Electrode assembly <b>106</b> is configured to accelerate and/or decelerate an ribbon beam to control the energy of the ribbon beam. In particular, electrode assembly <b>106</b> includes multiple electrodes for manipulating the ribbon beam as the ribbon beam travels through electrode assembly <b>106</b>. The ribbon beam can thus enter opening <b>117</b> at an initial energy and exit opening <b>119</b> at a final energy different from the initial energy. In some examples, as discussed further below, dipole magnets <b>140</b> may be placed within electrode assembly <b>106</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Dipole magnets <b>140</b> can be placed within electrode assembly <b>106</b> before the bend of ribbon beam <b>105</b> or after the bend of ribbon beam <b>105</b>. Accordingly, dipole magnets <b>140</b> interact with ribbon beam <b>105</b> before the acceleration or deceleration of ribbon beam <b>105</b> by electrode assembly <b>106</b> or after the acceleration or deceleration of ribbon beam <b>105</b> by electrode assembly <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, ribbon beam <b>105</b> exits opening <b>119</b> of electrode assembly <b>106</b> and is directed through multipole magnets <b>114</b>.

Further, in some examples, multipole magnets <b>114</b> are configured to steer ribbon beam <b>105</b> to strike the surface of wafer <b>116</b> in a particular location or to allow for other positional adjustments of ribbon beam <b>105</b>.

In some examples, wafer chuck <b>118</b> is configured to translate in one or more directions. For example, wafer chuck <b>118</b> can be configured to move wafer <b>116</b> with respect to ribbon beam <b>105</b> to scan ribbon beam <b>105</b> across wafer <b>116</b>. In some examples, wafer chuck <b>118</b> is configured to rotate wafer <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">It should be recognized that wafer <b>116</b> may comprise any suitable substrate used in the manufacturing of semiconductor devices, solar panels, or flat-panel displays. In examples where wafer <b>116</b> comprises a semiconductor substrate (e.g., silicon, germanium, gallium arsenide, etc.), wafer <b>116</b> may include semiconductor devices at least partially formed thereon.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, ion implantation system <b>100</b> further includes one or more dipole magnets <b>140</b> at various locations along the path of ribbon beam <b>105</b>. Dipole magnets <b>140</b> are configured to adjust one or more ribbon beam angles of ribbon beam <b>105</b>. As ribbon beam <b>105</b> travels through the various components of ion implantation system <b>100</b> as described herein, individual beamlets of ribbon beam <b>105</b> may drift (e.g., due to magnetic fields created by some of the components) causing one or more of the ribbon beam angles of ribbon beam <b>105</b> to change. Accordingly, ribbon beam angles of ribbon beam <b>105</b> may be corrected at various points in ion implantation system <b>100</b> as described below. Additionally, in some examples, the ribbon beam angles of ribbon beam <b>105</b> may be adjusted to prior to entering or after exiting one of the other components of ion implantation system <b>100</b> so that ribbon beam angle <b>105</b> is correctly manipulated by the component.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, dipole magnets <b>140</b> create a single magnetic field <b>202</b> to influence one or more of the ribbon beam angles of ribbon beam <b>105</b> with a single magnetic force. In particular, dipole magnets <b>140</b> include a single coil or a single broken coil (e.g., a coil with two halves) that create magnetic field <b>202</b>. Accordingly, dipole magnets <b>140</b> create a magnetic force that affects the individual beamlets of ribbon beam <b>105</b> in a single direction. This allows for fine adjustments to be made in a specific direction to adjust or correct the ribbon beam angles of ribbon beam <b>105</b> without affecting other characteristics of ribbon beam <b>105</b> like overall shape or direction. In this way, dipole magnets <b>140</b> allow for corrections to ribbon beam <b>105</b> that would be otherwise difficult to perform with conventional multipole magnets like multipole magnets <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> of ion implantation system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The strength of magnetic field <b>202</b> is based on the size of gap <b>204</b> between the two halves of the dipole magnet <b>206</b> and <b>208</b> and the currents <b>210</b> and <b>212</b> applied to the dipole magnet. In particular, the strength of magnetic field <b>202</b> is inversely proportional to the size of gap <b>204</b> between half <b>206</b> and half <b>208</b> of dipole magnet <b>140</b>. Accordingly, the strength of magnetic field <b>202</b> may be increased by decreasing the size of gap <b>204</b>. Similarly, the strength of magnetic field <b>202</b> may be decreased by increasing the size of gap <b>204</b>. Thus, in some examples, the size of gap <b>204</b> is a tunable gap that may be adjusted to increase or decrease the strength of magnetic field <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some examples, the size of gap <b>204</b> is a predetermined size.

When both currents <b>210</b> and <b>212</b> are increased or decreased equally the strength of magnetic field <b>202</b> is adjusted symmetrically, so that the strength of magnetic field <b>202</b> remains consistent. However, in some examples, currents <b>210</b> and <b>212</b> may be adjusted differently (e.g., current <b>210</b> is increased and current <b>212</b> is not) in order to adjust the strength of magnetic field <b>202</b> asymmetrically. For example, when current <b>210</b> is increased and current <b>212</b> is not, the strength of the top half of magnetic field <b>202</b> will increase while the strength of the bottom half of the magnetic field <b>202</b> will stay the same. In this way the magnetic field <b>202</b> may be adjusted based on the composition of ribbon beam <b>105</b> so that dipole magnet <b>140</b> adjusts one or more ribbon beam angles of ribbon beam <b>105</b> correctly.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In particular, the strength of magnetic field <b>202</b> should be higher when the energy of the ribbon beam <b>105</b> is higher and/or ribbon beam <b>105</b> is comprised of heavier ions.

Further, in some cases the energy of ribbon beam <b>105</b> and/or the distribution of ions in ribbon beam <b>105</b> is not uniform across ribbon beam <b>105</b>.

Using dipole magnet <b>302</b> to decrease the ribbon beam angles <b>304</b> of ribbon beam <b>105</b> after exiting magnetic analyzer <b>108</b> can decrease the spread of ribbon beam <b>105</b> and thus reduce the possibility of one or more beamlets of ribbon beam <b>105</b> contacting an unwanted portion of ion implantation system <b>100</b>.

This causes beamlets <b>706</b> and <b>708</b> to be parallel and thus travel the desired path. Wedge-shaped dipole magnet <b>702</b> is configured to create asymmetrical magnetic field <b>704</b> by having outside edges of its legs longer than the inside edges of its legs. This results in a wedge-shape along the edge of each half of the dipole magnet that causes the force created by magnetic field <b>704</b> to be stronger at the edges of dipole magnet <b>702</b> and weaker at the center of dipole magnet <b>702</b>. This will cause larger corrections on beamlet <b>706</b> and other beamlets on the edges of ribbon beam <b>105</b> and smaller corrections on beamlet <b>708</b> and other beamlets near the center of ribbon beam <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Wedge-shaped dipole magnets may be long type dipole magnets as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> or short type dipole magnets in various examples. Selection of the wedge-shape may include similar considerations as selection of a short type or long type dipole magnet including the amount of correction needed for the ribbon beam angle, other magnetic fields affecting ribbon beam <b>105</b>, the beamlets of ribbon beam <b>105</b> expected to be affected, the position of the dipole magnet in ion implantation system <b>100</b>, the energy of ribbon beam <b>105</b>, the mass of ribbon beam <b>105</b>, and the type of ion used in ribbon beam <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some examples, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, one or more of dipole magnets <b>140</b> has multiple coils with individual adjustable coil currents like dipole magnet <b>802</b>. Dipole magnet <b>802</b> works in a substantially similar manner to the various dipole magnets discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>7</b></figref>. However, because dipole magnet <b>802</b> has multiple coils and each coil has an individual adjustable coil current, dipole magnet <b>802</b> may create various magnetic fields that each interact with distinct beamlets of ribbon beam <b>105</b> to make corrections to various beam angles of ribbon beam <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In particular dipole magnet <b>802</b> includes coils <b>804</b>, <b>806</b>, <b>808</b>, <b>810</b>, <b>812</b>, and <b>814</b>. Each of coils <b>804</b>, <b>806</b>, <b>808</b>, has an associated coil current <b>816</b>, <b>818</b>, and <b>820</b>, with the paired coils <b>810</b>, <b>812</b>, and <b>814</b> having the same associated coil current in the opposite polarity. Accordingly, a first magnetic field <b>822</b> is created by coils <b>804</b> and <b>814</b> based on coil current <b>816</b>, a second magnetic field <b>824</b> is created by coils <b>806</b> and <b>812</b> based on coil current <b>818</b>, and a third magnetic field <b>826</b> is created by coils <b>808</b> and <b>810</b> based on coil current <b>820</b>. Each of magnetic fields <b>822</b>, <b>824</b>, and <b>826</b> can be changed independently by varying coil currents <b>816</b>, <b>818</b>, and <b>820</b>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Additionally, each of magnetic fields <b>822</b>, <b>824</b>, and <b>826</b> affect the beamlets of ribbon beam <b>105</b> causing the beamlets to move closer together (e.g., converge), farther apart (e.g., diverge), or stay substantially parallel based on the strengths of magnetic fields <b>822</b>, <b>824</b>, and <b>826</b> and coil currents <b>816</b>, <b>818</b>, and <b>820</b>. However, because each of magnetic fields <b>822</b>, <b>824</b>, and <b>826</b> cover different areas of ribbon beam <b>105</b>, adjustments to individual beamlets and beam angles can be achieved with greater precision than when one magnetic field is applied to the entirety of ribbon beam <b>105</b>. In this way, some beamlets of ribbon beam <b>105</b> may be influenced by one of the magnetic fields to converge, while other beamlets of ribbon beam <b>105</b> may be influenced by a different magnetic field to diverge.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">For example, when coil current <b>816</b> and coil current <b>818</b> are equal coils <b>804</b> and <b>806</b> create magnetic fields <b>822</b> and <b>824</b> with substantially similar strengths and forces that act in the same direction, keeping beamlet <b>830</b> and beamlet <b>832</b> substantially parallel. At the same time, coil current <b>820</b> is substantially higher than coil current <b>818</b>, creating a stronger magnetic field which causes beamlet <b>834</b> to converge towards beamlet <b>832</b>, reducing beam angle <b>833</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">As another example, when coil current <b>816</b> is higher than coil current <b>818</b> and coil current <b>818</b> is higher than coil current <b>820</b>, magnetic fields <b>822</b>, <b>824</b>, and <b>826</b> each act to push beamlets <b>830</b>, <b>832</b>, and <b>834</b> towards the center of ribbon beam <b>105</b>. This has the effect of reducing beam angles <b>831</b> and <b>833</b> and correcting a divergence of beamlets <b>830</b>, <b>832</b>, and <b>834</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As another example, when coil current <b>816</b> is lower than coil current <b>818</b>, magnetic fields <b>822</b> and <b>824</b> interact to cause beamlet <b>840</b> to diverge and move away from the center of ribbon beam <b>105</b>. Accordingly, beam angle <b>839</b> between beamlets <b>838</b> and <b>840</b> increases. At the same time, coil current <b>818</b> and coil current <b>820</b> are the same, causing magnetic fields <b>824</b> and <b>826</b> to interact and cause beamlets <b>836</b> and <b>838</b> to remain substantially parallel.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Accordingly, in some examples, dipole magnet <b>140</b> includes at least two coils and a first current is applied to a first coil of the at least two coils and a second current is applied to a second coil of the at least two coils. In some examples, the first current and the second current are equal. In some examples, the first current is greater than the second current. In some examples, the second current is greater than the first current.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some examples, dipole magnet <b>140</b> includes three coils, four coils, five coils, six coils, seven coils, etc. Accordingly, dipole magnet <b>140</b> can include any number of coils, each of the coils having a respective current applied to it. Thus, in some examples, a third current, a fourth current, a fifth current, etc. are applied to the various coils of dipole magnet <b>140</b> to create several different magnetic fields which each interact with beamlets of ribbon beam <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">It will further be recognized that the strength coil currents <b>816</b>, <b>818</b>, and <b>820</b> and accordingly magnetic fields <b>822</b>, <b>824</b>, and <b>826</b> can be used in any combination including the examples discussed above and other combinations that were not discussed. In this way, any combination of converging, diverging, and maintain beam angles of beamlets of ribbon beam <b>105</b> may be achieved by combining different magnitudes and polarities of magnetic fields <b>822</b>, <b>824</b>, and <b>826</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates graph <b>900</b> of the effect the current has on a beam angle of ribbon beam <b>105</b> based on the distance between the beam angle and the center of ribbon beam <b>105</b>. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates that as coil currents <b>816</b>, <b>818</b>, and <b>820</b> are adjusted they will have different effects on beam angles located far away from the center of ribbon beam <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">For example, when coil current <b>816</b> is 25 A, coil current <b>818</b> is 12.5 A and coil current <b>820</b> is 5 A, the magnetic fields <b>822</b>, <b>824</b>, and <b>826</b>, have a large effect on the beam angle far away from the center of ribbon beam <b>105</b>, causing the beam angles to become less divergent. As another example, when coil current <b>816</b> is 75 A, coil current <b>818</b> is 37.5 A, and coil current <b>820</b> is 15 A, the magnetic fields <b>822</b>, <b>824</b>, and <b>826</b>, also have a large effect on the beam angle far away from the center of ribbon beam <b>105</b> causing the beam angle to become more convergent.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">As another example, when coil current <b>816</b> is 45 A, coil current <b>818</b> is 22.5 A, and coil current <b>820</b> is 9 A, the magnetic fields <b>822</b>, <b>824</b>, and <b>826</b>, have a relatively small effect on the beam angle at all distances from the center of ribbon beam <b>105</b>. While the beam angles farthest away from the center of ribbon beam <b>105</b> will still become more convergent or less divergent based on the effects of the magnetic fields <b>822</b>, <b>824</b>, and <b>826</b>, the adjustments are much smaller than the adjustments made in the previous two examples.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Further, under certain circumstances, such as those discussed above, the beam angle can be reduced to less than 0.5 degrees and thus cause the beamlets to become substantially parallel along the entirety of ribbon beam <b>105</b>. In particular, as seen in graph <b>900</b>, when coil current <b>816</b> is between 40 A and 50 A, coil current <b>818</b> is between 20 A and 30 A, and coil current <b>820</b> is between 5 A and 10 A, the beam angle is reduced to less than 0.5 degrees up to 200 mm away from the center of ribbon beam <b>105</b>. This causes the individual beamlets of ribbon beam <b>105</b> to be substantially parallel and travel in a parallel manner. As discussed above, this can help the efficacy of ribbon beam <b>105</b> as it impacts a wafer as well as reduce the amount of contamination that occurs to the rest of ion implantation system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some examples, ion implantation system <b>100</b> includes a single dipole magnet <b>140</b>. For example, ion implantation system <b>100</b> may include a long type dipole magnet within processing chamber <b>130</b> just before wafer <b>116</b>. This long type dipole magnet adjusts one or more ribbon beam angles of ribbon beam <b>105</b> so that the beamlets of ribbon beam <b>105</b> are substantially parallel when implanting wafer <b>116</b> and thus implant the correct amount of ions.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">As another example, ion implantation system <b>100</b> may include a wedge-shaped long type dipole magnet after ion source <b>102</b> and before magnetic analyzer <b>108</b>. This wedge-shaped long type magnet adjusts one or more ribbon beam angles of ribbon beam <b>105</b> so that the beamlets of ribbon beam <b>105</b> are parallel from the beginning of ribbon beam <b>105</b>'s path through ion implantation system <b>100</b>. The parallelism of the beamlets of ribbon beam <b>105</b> may carry throughout ion implantation system <b>100</b> to when ribbon beam <b>105</b> contacts wafer <b>216</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">As another example, ion implantation system <b>100</b> may include a short type dipole magnet after multipole magnets <b>110</b> and before electrode assembly <b>106</b> configured to decrease the ribbon beam angle between two beamlets of ribbon beam <b>105</b>. This short type dipole magnet adjusts the two diverging beamlets such that the ribbon beam angle between the two beamlets is zero and thus the beamlets are parallel. The dipole magnet corrects these beamlets of ribbon beam <b>105</b> so that they travel a path parallel to the other beamlets of ribbon beam <b>105</b> and will not impact one of the components of ion implantation system <b>100</b> like electrode assembly <b>106</b>. In some examples, the beamlets may diverge because of residual effects of the magnetic fields created by multipole magnets <b>110</b> or other magnets present in ion implantation system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some examples, ion implantation system <b>100</b> includes multiple dipole magnets <b>140</b> in different locations. For example, ion implantation system <b>100</b> may include a first long type dipole magnet configured to increase one or more ribbon beam angles between beamlets of ribbon beam <b>105</b> before magnetic analyzer <b>108</b> and a second long type dipole magnet configured to decrease one or more ribbon beam angles between beamlets of ribbon beam <b>105</b> after magnetic analyzer <b>108</b>. The first long type dipole magnet increases the ribbon beam angles of ribbon beam <b>105</b> causing ribbon beam <b>105</b> to expand for processing within magnetic analyzer <b>108</b>. The second long type dipole magnet decreases the ribbon beam angles of ribbon beam <b>105</b> causing ribbon beam <b>105</b> to contract when traveling to the next component of ion implantation system <b>100</b> to avoid impacting other portions of ion implantation system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">As another example, ion implantation system <b>100</b> may include the first long type dipole magnet and second long type dipole magnet discussed above in the same locations which perform the same function. Additionally, ion implantation system <b>100</b> may include a third long type dipole magnet within processing chamber <b>130</b> just before wafer <b>116</b>. This third long type dipole magnet adjusts one or more ribbon beam angles of ribbon beam <b>105</b> so that the beamlets of ribbon beam <b>105</b> are substantially parallel when implanting wafer <b>116</b> and thus implant the correct amount of ions.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">As another example, ion implantation system <b>100</b> may include a first long type dipole magnet after ion source <b>102</b> and before magnetic analyzer <b>108</b> and a second long type dipole magnet within processing chamber <b>130</b> just before wafer <b>116</b>. Both the first and the second long type dipole magnet may be configured to adjust the ribbon beam angles between beamlets of ribbon beam <b>105</b> so that the beamlets are substantially parallel. By having magnets configured to accomplish the same goal at multiple points within ion implantation system <b>100</b> the system can account for any changes to the paths of the beamlets that may occur in between. This increases consistency of the ion implantation process as the beamlets of ribbon beam <b>105</b> may be kept substantially parallel throughout the process.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some examples, electrode assembly <b>106</b> is a single bend beamline assembly <b>1006</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. Accordingly, in some examples, dipole magnet <b>140</b> is placed within single bend beamline assembly <b>1006</b> outside of focusing electrodes <b>1004</b> placed just after bending and acceleration electrodes <b>1002</b>. In particular, as ribbon beam <b>105</b> enters electrode assembly <b>1006</b> ribbon beam <b>105</b> passes through several sets of electrodes to bend ribbon beam <b>105</b> as well as accelerate or decelerate ribbon beam <b>105</b>, depending on the current application of ion implantation system <b>100</b>. As discussed above, in some examples, dipole magnet <b>140</b> can be placed before the bending and acceleration electrodes <b>1002</b> to ensure that the beamlets of ribbon beam <b>105</b> are substantially parallel.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">However, dipole magnet <b>140</b> can also be placed after the bending and acceleration electrodes <b>1002</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. In this implementation, dipole magnet <b>140</b> is placed outside of focusing electrodes <b>1004</b>. In some examples, dipole magnet <b>140</b> is placed outside of the only pair of focusing electrodes <b>1004</b>. In other examples, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, dipole magnet <b>140</b> is placed outside of a first pair of focusing electrodes <b>1004</b> and before a second (or more) pair of focusing electrodes <b>1008</b>. Placing the dipole magnet <b>140</b> outside of focusing electrodes <b>1004</b> can provide several benefits, including preventing dipole magnet <b>140</b> from taking up space alongside the path of ribbon beam <b>105</b>. In this way, space can be conserved for other components to interact with ribbon beam <b>105</b>, while still allowing dipole magnet <b>140</b> to act on the individual beamlets of ribbon beam <b>105</b> and increase or decrease the beam angle, as described above.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Additionally, by placing dipole magnet <b>140</b> after bending and acceleration electrodes <b>1002</b>, dipole magnet <b>140</b> can cause adequate changes to the beam angles of ribbon beam <b>105</b> with a smaller amount of coil current. This allows dipole magnet <b>140</b> to be more effective against low energy ion beam divergence that is caused by space charge blow-up. Further, this position of dipole magnet <b>140</b> allows for any corrections to changes that happen during interaction between ribbon beam <b>105</b> and bending and acceleration electrodes <b>1002</b>, such as causing the beamlets to diverge, converge, or become substantially nonparallel.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Moreover, placing dipole magnet <b>140</b> after outside of focusing electrodes <b>1004</b> instead of after focusing electrodes <b>1008</b>, the electromagnetic field created by dipole magnet <b>140</b> will interact less with electron showers placed after focusing electrodes <b>1008</b> before ribbon beam <b>105</b> interacts with the wafer. Thus, dipole magnet <b>140</b> will not suppress the electron shower and cause ribbon beam <b>105</b> to be less effective when implanting the wafer. Moreover, ferromagnetic material can be inserted into focusing electrodes <b>1008</b> to further terminate the magnetic field created by dipole magnet <b>140</b> and reduce contamination to the electron shower.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">It should be appreciated that the examples discussed before are exemplary and that ion implantation system <b>100</b> can include any number of dipole magnets <b>140</b> in the various configurations discussed above to adjust the ribbon beam angles of ribbon beam <b>105</b> and thus ribbon beam <b>105</b> as needed throughout the process of implanting ions in wafer <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In some examples, ion implantation system <b>100</b> optionally includes one or more quadrupole magnets <b>142</b> in addition to or instead of dipole magnets <b>140</b>. In some examples, quadrupole magnets <b>142</b> are quadrupole magnet <b>1102</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. Quadrupole magnet <b>1102</b> includes coil <b>1104</b> which creates magnetic field <b>1106</b> and coil <b>1108</b> which creates magnetic field <b>1110</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, magnetic fields <b>1106</b> and <b>1110</b> intersect so that both magnetic fields <b>1106</b> and <b>1110</b> apply different magnetic forces to ribbon beam <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The forces applied by magnetic fields <b>1106</b> and <b>1110</b> cause the beamlets of ribbon beam <b>105</b> to converge or diverge depending on the polarity of coils <b>1104</b> and <b>1108</b>. In particular, as describe above with respect to dipole magnet <b>140</b>, quadrupole magnet <b>1102</b> may be configured to create magnetic fields <b>1106</b> and <b>1110</b> which cause beamlets <b>1112</b> and <b>1114</b> to separate and move further from the center of ribbon beam <b>105</b>. Accordingly, when quadrupole magnet <b>1102</b> is configured in this way ribbon beam angle <b>1116</b> increases.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Similarly, quadrupole magnet <b>1102</b> may be configured to create magnetic fields <b>1106</b> and <b>1110</b> which cause beamlets <b>1112</b> and <b>1114</b> to move closer together towards the center of ribbon beam <b>105</b>. Accordingly, when quadrupole magnet <b>1102</b> is configured in this way ribbon beam angle <b>1116</b> decreases. In some examples, quadrupole magnet <b>1102</b> is configured to create magnetic fields <b>1106</b> and <b>1110</b> which cause beamlets <b>1112</b> and <b>1114</b> to separate or more closer together to cause beamlets <b>1112</b> and <b>1114</b> to become substantially parallel. Accordingly, when quadrupole magnet <b>1102</b> is configured in this way ribbon beam angle <b>1116</b> can increase or decrease to become zero, coinciding with beamlets <b>1112</b> and <b>1114</b> becoming substantially parallel.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In addition to affecting the spread of beamlets <b>1112</b> and <b>1114</b>, magnetic fields <b>1106</b> and <b>1110</b> also cause the beamlets of ribbon beam <b>105</b> stretch and become wider due to the magnetic forces created by the intersecting magnetic fields. In this way, in addition to the ability to adjust ribbon beam angle <b>1116</b> and other ribbon beam angles of ribbon beam <b>105</b>, quadrupole magnet <b>1102</b> can also affect the overall shape and width of ribbon beam <b>105</b>. Thus, quadrupole magnet <b>1102</b> can increase or decrease the exposure of wafer <b>116</b> or other components of ion implantation system <b>100</b> to the beamlets and charged ions of ribbon beam <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, similarly to dipole magnets <b>140</b>, quadrupole magnets <b>142</b> may be placed in any location along the path of ribbon beam <b>105</b>. Thus, quadrupole magnets <b>142</b> may be placed before components like magnetic analyzer <b>108</b> to cause the beamlets of ribbon beam <b>105</b> to diverge and increase the exposure of the beamlets to the magnetic field of magnetic analyzer <b>108</b>. Quadrupole magnets <b>142</b> may also be placed after components like magnetic analyzer <b>108</b> to cause the beamlets of ribbon beam <b>105</b> to converge and take a clear path through ion implantation system <b>100</b> to avoid collision with other components of ion implantation system <b>100</b>. Further, quadrupole magnets <b>142</b> can be placed between multipole magnets <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> and before wafer <b>116</b> to cause the beamlets of ribbon beam <b>105</b> to become substantially parallel and thus ensure the correct exposure of wafer <b>116</b> to the ions of ribbon beam <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">It will further be appreciated that ion implantation system <b>100</b> can include any combination of quadrupole magnets <b>142</b> and dipole magnets <b>140</b> at various locations within ion implantation system <b>100</b>.

As another example, ion implantation system <b>100</b> may include a dipole magnet <b>140</b> before magnetic analyzer <b>108</b> to cause the beamlets of ribbon beam <b>105</b> to diverge, a quadrupole magnet <b>142</b> after magnetic analyzer <b>108</b> to cause the beamlets of ribbon beam <b>105</b> to converge, a dipole magnet <b>140</b> before multiple magnet <b>114</b> to cause the beamlets to become parallel, and a quadrupole magnet <b>142</b> before the wafer to correct and beamlets that are no longer parallel.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Further, it should be appreciated that suitable variations and modifications may be made to ion implantation system <b>100</b>. For example, ion implantation system <b>100</b> can include additional components such as additional electrodes and magnets for manipulating ribbon beam <b>105</b>. As another example, ion implantation system <b>100</b> can include more than one variable aperture assembly for controlling the current of ribbon beam <b>105</b>. Note, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, all of the components of ion implantation system <b>100</b> are positioned outside of the processing chamber of ion implantation system <b>100</b> (e.g., processing chamber <b>130</b>) except wafer <b>116</b>, wafer chuck <b>118</b>, and dipole magnets <b>140</b> (which are positioned within an interior of the processing chamber). In some examples, components of ion implantation system <b>100</b> that are outside of ion implantation system <b>100</b>'s processing chamber are coupled to an exterior surface of processing chamber <b>130</b>. In some examples, components of ion implantation system <b>100</b> that are outside of ion implantation system <b>100</b>'s processing chamber are positioned near the processing chamber but are not coupled to the processing chamber. In any case, the components of ion implantation system <b>100</b> that are positioned outside of ion implantation system <b>100</b>'s processing chamber are positioned and configured in such a way that allows ribbon beam <b>105</b> to enter processing chamber <b>130</b> while maintaining an interior of processing chamber <b>130</b> at a high vacuum.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">As mentioned above, ion implantation system <b>100</b> further includes controller <b>132</b>.

Further, although controller <b>132</b> is illustrated as a single controller in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, one of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that controller <b>132</b> can include any number of controllers necessary to perform the controller <b>132</b> processes and functions disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">As shown, controller <b>132</b> includes memory <b>134</b>, processor(s) <b>136</b>, and input/output (I/O) interface <b>138</b>.
