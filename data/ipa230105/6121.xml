2021, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a concrete composite, an electrical circuit comprising the concrete composite, a method of generating a potential difference, a method of making a concrete composite, and a wall, a floor, a post or a building comprising a concrete composite.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Thermoelectric effects are well known. The Seebeck effect is a form of thermoelectric effect which appears when a temperature difference between two different electrical conductors or semiconductors produces a voltage difference between the two substances. When heat is applied to one of the two conductors or semiconductors, the heated electrons tend to flow from the hottest conductor or semiconductor to the coldest. If the pair is connected through an electrical circuit, direct current (DC) flows through that circuit. The voltages produced by the Seebeck effect are small, usually a few microvolts (millionths of a volt) per temperature difference at the junction. If the temperature difference is large enough, some Seebeck devices can produce millivolts (thousandths of a volt).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thermoelectric materials which show the Seebeck effect, such as tetrahedrite, are known. The conversion efficiency of this type of material is often expressed as the dimensionless figure of merit: ZT, where T is the absolute temperature and Z is related to the material properties as ZT=S<sup>2 </sup>&#x3c3;T/K, where S is a high thermal power or Seebeck coefficient, &#x3c3; is electrical conductivity and &#x3ba; is thermal conductivity. To improve the efficiency of thermoelectric materials, ZT should be maximized. This means that more electric potential is produced for a given temperature difference.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are increasing demands for electricity, particularly electricity use in buildings. It is desirable for buildings to become more self-sufficient in producing energy, and existing solutions such as utilising solar power and heat pumps are known to provide part of an electricity supply to a building, such as a heating or hot water system.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is a need to produce electricity in an environmentally friendly way. There is a need for construction to be energy efficient. There is a need for buildings to become more self-sufficient in generating electricity for use. There is a need to utilise construction materials to generate electricity. There is a need to recycle waste materials from mining. There is a need to reduce the amount of binder used in making concrete, particularly the amount of Portland cement or clinker used.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to seek to alleviate the above identified problems.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a concrete composite comprising concrete and a thermoelectric material, wherein the thermoelectric material comprises a complex sulphide mineral, wherein the composite comprises at least 20 wt % concrete.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a second aspect of the invention, there is provided an electrical circuit comprising the concrete composite according to the first aspect of the invention and a pair of electrical conductors.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of generating a potential difference, comprising providing a concrete composite according to the first aspect of the invention, providing a temperature difference between a first side of the composite and a second side of the composite and connecting the composite via a pair of electrical conductors to an electrical circuit.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a fourth aspect of the invention, there is provided a wall, a floor, a post or a building comprising the concrete composite according to the first aspect of the invention.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a fifth aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of making a concrete composite, comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0013">a. providing aggregate;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0014">b. providing a binder;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0015">c. providing a thermoelectric material, wherein the thermoelectric material comprises a complex sulphide mineral;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0016">d. mixing the aggregate, the binder and the thermoelectric material to form a mixture; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0017">e. forming the mixture into the composite, wherein the composite comprises at least 20 wt % concrete.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0014" num="0018">In a sixth aspect of the invention, there is provided the use of a composite according to the first aspect of the invention to generate electricity.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0019">The present invention relates to a concrete composite comprising concrete and a thermoelectric material, wherein the thermoelectric material comprises a complex sulphide mineral, wherein the composite comprises at least 20 wt % concrete.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0020">The composite allows electricity to be produced in an environmentally friendly way by utilising the temperature difference across the composite and the environment the substrate is in.

A paste was prepared using cement and water in a ratio of 2:1. The cement was mixed with the tetrahedrite particles through a ball mill with a capacity of 500 grams for 10 minutes to ensure incorporation of the particles. Once mixed, the mixture was introduced into an orbital mixing container and the water was added to reach the desired water/cement ratio of 0.5. Finally, the paste was emptied into a metal mold to obtain specimens of 1 cm&#xd7;5 cm with a thickness of 5 mm of the mixture and the excess paste was removed. The mold was placed in a container with water, which was removed from the mold on the second day, and it was allowed to cure for 2 weeks, and it was finally dried for 2 days prior to the tests.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0078">The conductivity test was carried out by placing the samples longitudinally making contact in a 1 cm square section with the plates at the ends, leaving a 3 cm long section free between both plates.

In the upper area of the composite materials, the positive and negative sensors of a digital multimeter were fixed with thermal paste to evaluate their thermoelectric response. The conductivity results obtained from this test are shown in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, the tetrahedrite dosage in each sample was 0.5% w/w, 1% w/w or 2% w/w.
