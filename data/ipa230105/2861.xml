Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a nickel-based superalloy for diffusion bonding (particularly, an alloy derived from a parent material of a solid solution strengthened nickel-based superalloy) and a method for diffusion bonding using the same.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Discussion of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Bonding is classified into liquid-phase bonding and solid-phase bonding according to whether two materials to be bonded (a metal, a ceramic, a polymer, etc.) are phase-transformed from a solid phase to a liquid phase during bonding. As one method of solid-phase diffusion, diffusion bonding is a technique for bonding materials using a diffusion phenomenon of atoms. Accordingly, it is known that a diffusion-bonded material has mechanical performance and microstructures at an interface and near the interface at the same levels as those of a parent material.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The prior art focuses on presenting optimal conditions by regulating variables (temperature, compressive load, environment, surface condition, post heat treatment) used for diffusion bonding. The diffusion bonding method according to the prior art is extremely limited in grain boundary movement due to secondary phase formation at an interface. This is a phenomenon in which an oxide is formed at an interface due to aluminum (Al) and titanium (Ti) intentionally included in a solid solution strengthened nickel-based superalloy to improve oxidation/corrosion resistance and ensure excellent high temperature strength, and has a problem of weak integrity of the interface under a high temperature operating condition.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, to address the formation of planar grains at an interface, the prior art showed that it is possible to form spherical grains similar to a parent material at the interface by promoting interdiffusion due to composition differences of elements by inserting an intermediate insert (Ni, Ni&#x2014;Cr foil, etc.) before diffusion bonding or applying the main component (Ni, etc.) of a parent material to a surface using various deposition methods. However, this may increase costs due to an additional process, and it is still difficult to apply it to a high temperature apparatus with a complicated shape. In addition, the prior art may be a method of addressing the formation of planar grains at the interface, but basically, there is a problem of secondary phases remaining at the interface.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">PRIOR ART</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">[Patent Document]</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Korean Patent Publication No. 10-1527112 (Jun. 2, 2015).</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is directed to providing a nickel-based superalloy for diffusion bonding of a nickel-based superalloy, which includes a surface depletion layer in a state in which an aluminum (Al) or titanium (Ti) content is depleted to inhibit or reduce the secondary phase formation by Al or Ti at the interface between the nickel-based superalloys, wherein the surface depletion layer is formed to a depth of 50 &#x3bc;m or less from a surface for diffusion bonding.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, technical problems to be solved in the present invention are not limited to the above-described problems, and other problems which are not described herein will be fully understood by those of ordinary skill in the art from the following descriptions.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention provides a nickel-based superalloy for diffusion bonding, which includes a surface depletion layer in a state in which an Al or Ti content is depleted, wherein the surface depletion layer is formed to a depth of 50 &#x3bc;m or less from a surface for diffusion bonding.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition, the present invention provides a method for diffusion bonding of a nickel-based superalloy, which includes: (a) pre-oxidizing a parent material of a nickel-based superalloy to form an outer oxide film and an inner oxide; (b) removing the formed outer oxide film and an inner oxide-containing layer; and (c) preparing a diffusion-bonded nickel-based superalloy material by performing diffusion bonding on the nickel-based superalloy from which the formed outer oxide film and inner oxide-containing layer are removed.

In this regard, the &#x201c;pre-oxidation,&#x201d; &#x201c;outer oxide film&#x201d; and &#x201c;inner oxide&#x201d; will be described later</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The nickel-based superalloy parent material preferably uses a solid solution strengthened nickel-based superalloy parent material having a low Al or Ti content to effectively form a surface depletion layer in which an Al or Ti content is depleted in the nickel-based superalloy, but the present invention is not limited thereto. Meanwhile, the use of a precipitate-strengthened nickel-based superalloy parent material having a relatively high Al or Ti content has a limit in effectively forming a surface depletion layer only through pre-oxidation. In the present invention, as the nickel-based superalloy parent material, Alloy 617 was used.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Here, since Al or Ti is used to form an inner oxide in the nickel-based superalloy parent material, the nickel-based superalloy includes a surface depletion layer in which an Al or Ti content is depleted, compared to the nickel-based superalloy parent material. Meanwhile, since chromium (Cr) is used to form an outer oxide film in the nickel-based superalloy parent material, the nickel-based superalloy may include a surface depletion layer in which a chromium (Cr) content is also depleted compared to the nickel-based superalloy parent material.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Accordingly, although the entire composition of the nickel-based superalloy has a low Al or Ti content compared to the nickel-based superalloy parent material, and may also have a low Cr content, the entire composition of the nickel-based superalloy is as follows in detail.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Specifically, the nickel-based superalloy may include 20.0 to 24.0 wt % of Cr; 10.0 to 15.0 wt % of Co; 8.0 to 10.0 wt % of Mo; 0.8 to 1.5 wt % of aluminum (Al); 0.6 wt % or less of Ti; and the remainder of Ni.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Hereinafter, the role and effect of each element will be described:</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">(1) Chromium (Cr)</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Cr is an element for increasing high temperature oxidation resistance, and a preferable Cr content is 20.0 to 24.0 wt %.

In other words, when the surface depletion layer is divided into an upper surface depletion layer and a lower surface depletion layer based on the halfway point of the depth of the surface depletion layer, the upper surface depletion layer has a higher degree of depletion of Al or Ti content compared to the lower surface depletion layer, but the present invention is not limited thereto. Therefore, as the diffusion bonding progresses on the surface of the surface depletion layer, planar grains formed at the interface may be formed into spherical grains through the diffusion according to composition differences of elements. Thus, the surface depletion layer may have the same levels of mechanical properties as those of a parent material at room temperature and high temperature.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">Method for Diffusion Bonding of Nickel-Based Superalloy</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">The present invention provides a method for diffusion bonding of a nickel-based superalloy, which includes: (a) forming an outer oxide film and an inner oxide by pre-oxidizing a nickel-based superalloy parent material; (b) removing the formed outer oxide film and an inner oxide-containing layer; and (c) preparing a diffusion-bonded nickel-based superalloy material by performing diffusion bonding on the nickel-based superalloy from which the outer oxide film and inner oxide-containing layer are removed, and in Step (c), the nickel-based superalloy includes a surface depletion layer in a state in which an Al or Ti content is depleted, and the surface depletion layer is formed to a depth of 50 &#x3bc;m or less from a surface for diffusion bonding.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">First, the method for diffusion bonding for a nickel-based superalloy according to the present invention includes forming an outer oxide film and an inner oxide by pre-oxidizing a nickel-based superalloy parent material (Step (a)) and removing the formed outer oxide film and inner oxide-containing layer (Step (b)).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">The pre-oxidation refers to oxidation under a high temperature condition for forming an outer oxide film and an inner oxide in the nickel-based superalloy parent material, and may be performed under atmospheric conditions including oxygen at 600 to 1,200&#xb0; C. for 0.1 to 500 hours, and preferably at 700 to 1,050&#xb0; C. for 10 to 500 hours, but the present invention is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">The &#x201c;outer oxide film&#x201d; used herein refers to an oxide film formed by reaction with the external environment through pre-oxidation on the surface of the nickel-based superalloy parent material, may include chromium oxide, and specifically, a nickel oxide (NiO) layer, a nickel-chromium composite oxide (NiO&#x2014;Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) layer and a chromium oxide (Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) layer may be sequentially formed based on the external environment through a reaction between oxygen provided from the external environment and nickel (Ni) and chromium (Cr).

Here, the outer oxide film and the inner oxide may be removed through various known methods such as mechanical polishing.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">The method for diffusion bonding of a nickel-based superalloy according to the present invention includes preparing a diffusion-bonded nickel-based superalloy material by performing diffusion bonding on the nickel-based superalloy from which the diffusion bonding on the outer oxide film and inner oxide-containing layer are removed (Step (c)).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">The nickel-based superalloy from which the outer oxide film and inner oxide-containing layer are removed, which is subjected to the diffusion bonding, includes a surface depletion layer in a state in which an Al or Ti content is depleted, and the surface depletion layer may be formed to a depth of 50 &#x3bc;m or less from the surface for diffusion bonding, which has been described above, and thus duplicated descriptions will be omitted.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">As the surface depletion layer is closer to the surface of diffusion bonding, it may have a gradient in which the degree of depletion of Al or Ti content increases, and as the diffusion bonding progresses on the surface of the surface depletion layer, planar grains formed at the interface may be effectively formed into spherical grains through diffusion according to composition differences of elements. In addition, during the diffusion bonding, the secondary phase formation by Al or Ti at the interface between the nickel-based superalloys is inhibited or reduced, and intermetallic bonds may also be formed. Therefore, the same levels of mechanical properties as those of the parent material may be maintained at room temperature and high temperature.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">Specifically, the diffusion bonding may be performed under a vacuum condition at 1,000 to 1,200&#xb0; C. under a compressive load of 10 to 20 MPa for 1 to 5 hours.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">Selectively, the method for diffusion bonding of a nickel-based superalloy according to the present invention may further include thermally treating the formed diffusion-bonded nickel-based superalloy material at 1,000 to 1,200&#xb0; C. for 1 to 100 hours (Step (d)).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">Through the thermal treatment, planar grains remaining at the interface may be additionally formed into spherical grains by additional diffusion of atoms. In addition, after the thermal treatment, cooling to 10 to 30&#xb0; C. may be performed through furnace cooling, air cooling or quenching.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">In addition, the present invention may provide a plate heat exchanger manufactured using the method for diffusion bonding of a nickel-based superalloy.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">As described above, the present invention relates to a nickel-based superalloy including a surface depletion layer in a state in which an Al or Ti content is depleted (particularly, an alloy derived from a solid solution strengthened nickel-based superalloy parent material) and a method for diffusion bonding using the same. Because of the surface depletion layer, it is possible to move a planar grain boundary formed at the interface through diffusion according to composition differences of elements during diffusion bonding, and the secondary phase formation by Al or Ti at the interface may be effectively inhibited or reduced, thereby forming intermetallic bonds. Thus, since the diffusion-bonded nickel-based superalloy material prepared according to the present invention maintains the same level of stress as that of the parent material at room temperature and high temperature, and particularly, has excellent strain at the parent material level at a high temperature of approximately 700&#xb0; C. or more, it can be applied to the plate heat exchanger industry.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057">To increase the efficiency of a high temperature apparatus used in various industries (chemical, petrochemical, nuclear power and power generation fields), higher temperature and pressure conditions are required, and thus stainless steel currently used in the plate heat exchanger industry is expected to be replaced with a solid solution strengthened nickel-based superalloy in the near future. In addition, in the global heat exchanger market in 2016, the traditional shell &#x26; tube heat exchanger still accounted for the largest share, that is, 3.35 billion dollars, but in the trend of downsizing, lightening and modularization of a high temperature apparatus, plate-frame heat exchangers (3 billion dollars in 2016) are pursuing at a high annual growth rate of 7.11% on average. Comprehensively considering these points, the present invention is expected to activate the stagnant domestic manufacturing field according to this trend of the times and contribute to the export of products and technology through innovation.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">Hereinafter, to help in understanding the present invention, exemplary examples will be suggested.
