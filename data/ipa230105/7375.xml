The Sonos Wireless Home Sound System enables people to experience music from many sources via one or more networked playback devices. Through a software control application installed on a controller (e.g., smartphone, tablet, computer, voice input device), one can play what she wants in any room having a networked playback device. Media content (e.g., songs, podcasts, video sound) can be streamed to playback devices such that each room with a playback device can play back corresponding different media content. In addition, rooms can be grouped together for synchronous playback of the same media content, and/or the same media content can be heard in all rooms synchronously.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Features, embodiments, and advantages of the presently disclosed technology may be better understood with regard to the following description, appended claims, and accompanying drawings, as listed below.

Overview</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Most transducers used within speakers or audio devices include standard components, such as an input source (e.g., from an amplifier), first and second terminals connected to the input source, and a voice coil connected to the first and second terminals via respective first and second leads. Electrical signals provided from the input source to the voice coil generate a magnetic field, thereby causing the voice coil to move and displace a diaphragm attached thereto to produce audible sound. Despite this intended effect, transducers often have deficiencies that generate undesirable noise or electromagnetic interference (EMI) signals, which can thereby make the listener's experience less than optimal and/or result in undesirable levels of electromagnetic radiation. For example, in traditional transducers, the first lead connected to the first terminal extends from a first side of the voice coil, and the second lead connected to the second terminal extends from a second, opposing side of the voice coil. Disposing the first and second ends of the voice coil on opposing sides is preferred for balance purposes, e.g., to ensure the voice coil is not tilted or askew and thereby does not generate undesirable noise. Additionally, the first and second terminals are preferably disposed adjacent one another, e.g., on the same side of the voice coil, as increasing the distance between the first and second terminals may also generate undesirable EMI. In such a configuration, the first lead extends from the first side of the voice coil to the first terminal, and the second lead extends from the second, opposing side of the voice coil to the second terminal, which is adjacent the first terminal. Due to the second lead extending from the second side of the voice coil to the second terminal along one, and only one, side of the voice coil, the second lead in operation can introduce EMI, which is generally undesired for any transducer or corresponding device. For some devices, such EMI can be filtered downstream, e.g., via a filter incorporated with the amplifier. However, as the footprint of devices continues to decrease to meet consumer demand, the ability to include downstream filters or shielding has become more difficult for manufacturers. Additionally, as a result of less downstream filtering or shielding, complying with relevant national, regional and/or international standards for electromagnetic radiation has also become more difficult.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Embodiments of the disclosed technology address at least some of the above described issues associated with transducers, and generally relate to improved transducers, e.g., for use in audio devices. As explained in more detail elsewhere herein, some embodiments of the disclosed technology relate to a transducer or audio device that includes a voice coil, first and second terminals disposed adjacent a first side of the voice coil, a first conductor extending from the first side of the voice coil to the first terminal, and a second conductor extending from a second, opposing side of the voice coil to the second terminal via first and second conductive pathways. The first and second conductive pathways can extend toward the second terminal along opposing sides of the voice coil in a manner that produces little or no net EMI from the corresponding conductors.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">While some examples described herein may refer to functions performed by given actors such as &#x201c;users,&#x201d; &#x201c;listeners,&#x201d; and/or other entities, it should be understood that this is for purposes of explanation only. The claims should not be interpreted to require action by any such example actor unless explicitly required by the language of the claims themselves.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the Figures, identical reference numbers identify generally similar, and/or identical, elements.

The media playback system <b>100</b> comprises one or more playback devices <b>110</b> (identified individually as playback devices <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>), one or more network microphone devices (&#x201c;NMDs&#x201d;), <b>120</b> (identified individually as NMDs <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>), and one or more control devices <b>130</b> (identified individually as control devices <b>130</b><i>a </i>and <b>130</b><i>b</i>).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As used herein the term &#x201c;playback device&#x201d; can generally refer to a network device configured to receive, process, and output data of a media playback system. For example, a playback device can be a network device that receives and processes audio content. In some embodiments, a playback device includes one or more transducers or speakers powered by one or more amplifiers. In other embodiments, however, a playback device includes one of (or neither of) the speaker and the amplifier. For instance, a playback device can comprise one or more amplifiers configured to drive one or more speakers external to the playback device via a corresponding wire or cable.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Moreover, as used herein the term NMD (i.e., a &#x201c;network microphone device&#x201d;) can generally refer to a network device that is configured for audio detection. In some embodiments, an NMD is a stand-alone device configured primarily for audio detection. In other embodiments, an NMD is incorporated into a playback device (or vice versa).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The term &#x201c;control device&#x201d; can generally refer to a network device configured to perform functions relevant to facilitating user access, control, and/or configuration of the media playback system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Each of the playback devices <b>110</b> is configured to receive audio signals or data from one or more media sources (e.g., one or more remote servers, one or more local devices) and play back the received audio signals or data as sound.

In response to the received spoken word commands and/or user input, the media playback system <b>100</b> can play back audio via one or more of the playback devices <b>110</b>. In certain embodiments, the playback devices <b>110</b> are configured to commence playback of media content in response to a trigger. For instance, one or more of the playback devices <b>110</b> can be configured to play back a morning playlist upon detection of an associated trigger condition (e.g., presence of a user in a kitchen, detection of a coffee machine operation). In some embodiments, for example, the media playback system <b>100</b> is configured to play back audio from a first playback device (e.g., the playback device <b>110</b><i>a</i>) in synchrony with a second playback device (e.g., the playback device <b>110</b><i>b</i>).

The transducer <b>300</b> can correspond to any one of the transducers <b>114</b>, <b>214</b> described elsewhere herein. The transducer <b>300</b> can include standard audio device components, such as a diaphragm <b>302</b>, a basket <b>304</b>, a suspension <b>306</b> connecting the basket <b>304</b> to the diaphragm <b>302</b>, a dust cap <b>308</b>, a tubular member <b>310</b> (e.g., former or a plastic material), a voice coil <b>320</b> helically wound around the tubular member <b>310</b> and configured to move the diaphragm via a magnetic field, a magnet <b>312</b> disposed around the voice coil <b>320</b>, and a spider <b>314</b> attached to the basket <b>304</b> and which maintains tension on the voice coil <b>320</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the basket <b>304</b> can be disposed around a periphery of the transducer <b>300</b> and generally support the other components of the transducer <b>300</b>. The tubular member <b>310</b> may be disposed on and/or around a pole piece (not shown) which directs the magnetic field of the voice coil <b>320</b> to produce a desired audio. The transducer <b>300</b> can also include a first conductor <b>325</b> that electrically couples the voice coil <b>320</b> to a first terminal <b>340</b><i>a </i>(e.g., a negative terminal), and a second conductor <b>330</b> that electrically couples the voice coil <b>320</b> to a second terminal <b>340</b><i>b </i>(e.g., a positive terminal).</p><p id="p-0075" num="0070">In some transducers, including those designed particularly for audio devices, the first conductor <b>325</b> connected to the first terminal <b>340</b><i>a </i>extends from a first end of the voice coil <b>320</b>, and the second conductor <b>330</b> connected to the second terminal <b>340</b><i>b </i>extends from a second, opposing end of the voice coil <b>320</b>. As explained elsewhere herein, disposing the first and second ends of the voice coil <b>320</b> at opposing sides of the voice coil <b>320</b> is often preferred for balance purposes. That is, disposing both ends of the voice coil <b>320</b> on the same side would cause the voice coil <b>320</b> to be unbalanced, e.g., due to the weight of (i) the first and second conductors <b>325</b>, <b>330</b> connected to the voice coil <b>320</b>, and/or (ii) the adhesive used to terminate the first and second conductors <b>325</b>, <b>330</b> to the voice coil <b>320</b>. This unbalance may result in the voice coil <b>320</b> tilting or otherwise becoming askew, thereby causing less desirable performance (e.g., audio output). Additionally, and as explained elsewhere herein, the first and second terminals <b>340</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>are preferably disposed adjacent one another, e.g., on the same side of the voice coil <b>320</b>. For example, the first and second terminals <b>340</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>can be spaced apart from one another by less than approximately 15 degrees, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, 90 degrees, 120 degrees or 180 degrees, or any increment therebetween (e.g., 45 degrees) with respect to a center of the voice coil <b>320</b>. If the first and second terminals <b>340</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>were separated from one another, the input leads connected to such terminals may effectively form an antenna and contribute noise and/or undesirable EMI signals. In view of the above, in some transducers, the first conductor <b>325</b> extends from the first side of the voice coil <b>320</b> to the first terminal <b>340</b><i>a </i>(also on the first side), and the second conductor <b>330</b> extends from the second, opposing side of the voice coil <b>320</b> to the second terminal, which is also disposed on the first side of the voice coil <b>320</b>. In operation and as previously described, the second conductor <b>330</b> in such embodiments introduces EMI, which is generally undesirable for any transducer or corresponding audio device. For some devices, such EMI can be filtered downstream, e.g., via a filter incorporated with the amplifier. However, as devices continue to decrease in size, the ability to include downstream filters or shielding is more difficult.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0071">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the first and second conductors <b>325</b>, <b>330</b> are wires, which can be made from tinsel or any other suitable material(s) (e.g., material(s) having a relatively high mechanical flexibility).

As noted previously, an input source can be electrically coupled to the first and second terminals <b>340</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>. In operation, the current can flow (i) from the second terminal <b>340</b><i>b </i>to the junction <b>432</b> via the second and third portions <b>435</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>(i.e., the first and second conductive pathways, respectively), (ii) from the junction <b>432</b> to the first end <b>410</b> via the first portion <b>430</b>, (iii) from the first end <b>410</b> to the second end <b>405</b>, and (iv) from the second end <b>405</b> to the first terminal <b>340</b><i>a </i>via the first conductor <b>325</b>. In some embodiments, the current can flow in an opposite direction to that previously described. In such and other embodiments, current (e.g., a first current) can flow between the second terminal <b>340</b><i>b </i>and the junction <b>432</b> (via the second and third portions <b>435</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>) in a first general direction, and current (e.g., a second current) can flow between the junction <b>432</b> and the first terminal <b>340</b><i>a </i>(via the first portion <b>430</b>, voice coil <b>320</b>, and first conductor <b>325</b>) in a second general direction that is opposite the first general direction. In doing so, the electromagnetic field produced via the first current can cancel (e.g., destructively interfere with) all or at least a portion of the electromagnetic field produced via the second current. That is, the electromagnetic field produced via the first current traveling from the second terminal <b>340</b><i>b </i>to the junction <b>432</b> via the second and third portions <b>435</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>can cancel or reduce all or at least a portion of the electromagnetic field produced via the second current traveling from the junction <b>432</b> to the first terminal <b>340</b><i>a </i>via the first portion <b>430</b>, voice coil <b>320</b>, and first conductor <b>325</b>. In doing so, less or no EMI may be produced via the transducer <b>400</b> or corresponding audio device, relative to other transducers that do not include such an arrangement. Accordingly, embodiments of the disclosed technology address or at least mitigate the deficiencies of other transducers, in which EMI is introduced via one of the conductors extending along only one side of the voice coil. Reducing or eliminating the EMI can also remove the need to include downstream filters and/or shielding components, which would be needed with conventional transducers to reduce the EMI. Eliminating the need for downstream filtering and/or shielding can decrease manufacturing costs for the transducers and corresponding devices, and enable the devices to have a smaller footprint without sacrificing audio quality. In some embodiments, operating the transducer <b>300</b> with the second and third portions <b>435</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, as described herein, can reduce emission of electromagnetic radiation by at least 5-10 decibels relative to other transducers that do not include the second and third portions <b>435</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>.-</p><p id="p-0081" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flow diagram of a method <b>500</b> of operating a transducer or audio device configured in accordance with embodiments of the disclosed technology. The method <b>500</b> can include providing a transducer (e.g., the transducer <b>300</b> or <b>400</b>) or audio device comprising a coil (e.g. the voice coil <b>320</b>), a first terminal (e.g., the first terminal <b>340</b><i>a</i>), a second terminal (e.g., the second terminal <b>340</b><i>b</i>) adjacent the first terminal, a first conductor (e.g., the first conductor <b>325</b>) extending from a first end (e.g., the first end <b>405</b>) of the voice coil to the first terminal, and a second conductor (e.g., the second conductor <b>330</b>) extending from a second end (e.g., the second end <b>410</b>) of the voice coil to the second terminal (process portion <b>502</b>). The method <b>500</b> further comprises flowing current between the first terminal and the coil via the first conductor (process portion <b>504</b>), and flowing current between the second terminal and the coil via the second conductor along first and second conductive pathways (e.g., the second and third portions <b>435</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, respectively) that extend toward the second terminal via opposing sides of the coil (process portion <b>506</b>). In some embodiments, the first and second conductive pathways may be symmetric or mirrored reflections of one another about an axis (e.g., the axis (A)) extending through the voice coil and/or the portion of the second conductor extending directly from the voice coil. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments flowing current between the second terminal and the coil can include (i) flowing a first current between the second terminal and the coil via the first conductive pathway, and (ii) flowing a second current, equal in magnitude to the first current, between the second terminal and the coil via the second conductive pathway. The first current flowing through the first conductive pathway may generate a first electromagnetic field having a substantially equal magnitude to that of a second electromagnetic field generated by the second current flowing through the second conductive pathway.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0077">In some embodiments, current can flow (i) from the second terminal to the junction via the second and third portions (i.e., the first and second conductive pathways, respectively), (ii) from the junction to the first end via the first portion, (iii) from the first end to the second end, and (iv) from the second end to the first terminal via the first conductor. In some embodiments, the current can flow in an opposite direction to that previously described. In such and other embodiments, current (e.g., a first current) can flow between the second terminal and the junction (via the second and third portions) in a first general direction, and current (e.g., a second current) can flow between the junction and the first terminal (via the first portion, voice coil, and first conductor) in a second general direction that is opposite the first general direction. In doing so, the electromagnetic field (e.g., a first electromagnetic field) produced via the first current can cancel (e.g., destructively interfere with) all or at least a portion of the electromagnetic field (e.g., a second electromagnetic field) produced via the second current. Stated differently, the first electromagnetic field effectively can cancel out all or at least a portion of the second electromagnetic field such that no or a limited amount of EMI is produced via the transducer and/or audio device. Operating the transducer and/or audio device in such a manner can result in better sound quality for a listener, and reduce emission of electromagnetic radiation from the transducer and/or audio device. Reducing such emissions can help ensure the corresponding device is below the relevant national, regional and/or international standards electromagnetic radiation.
