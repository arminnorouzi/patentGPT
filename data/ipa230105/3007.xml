The first sealing member <b>322</b>, the second sealing member <b>323</b>, the plugging block <b>31</b>, and the sliding rod <b>32</b> jointly achieve a watertight effect. The outer sidewall of the sliding rod <b>32</b> at the left side of the sliding fork <b>321</b> may further be provided with a stopper <b>324</b>. The stopper <b>324</b> is used for limiting the position when the sliding rod <b>32</b> moves leftward. Under a condition where the sliding rod <b>32</b> moves toward a left side to separate the sliding fork <b>321</b> with the fixed rod <b>33</b>, the open end of the plugging block <b>31</b> is then sealed by the first sealing member <b>322</b>, and at the same time the side waterway <b>222</b> is unblocked and opened. Under a condition where the sliding rod <b>32</b> moves toward the right side to insert the fixed rod <b>33</b> into the sliding fork <b>321</b>, the first sealing member <b>322</b> moves accordingly and an entrance of the side waterway <b>222</b> is then sealed, and at the same time the middle waterway <b>221</b> is unblocked and opened. The water flows out from a through hole on a sidewall of the plugging block <b>31</b> located between the first sealing member <b>322</b> and the second sealing member <b>323</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further, the lower connecting portion <b>23</b> of the waterway separation body <b>2</b> includes a middle water outlet <b>233</b> and a peripheral water outlet <b>234</b>. The middle water outlet <b>233</b> communicates with the middle waterway <b>221</b>, and the peripheral water outlet <b>234</b> communicates with the side waterway <b>222</b>. The water outlet panel <b>4</b> is made of a light-transmitting material. The water outlet surface of the water outlet panel <b>4</b> is arc-shaped and concaved.
