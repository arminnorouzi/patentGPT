One example of a patient safety check is a Q15 safety check, standing for a safety check that is done every 15 minutes. Safety checks may also be done at various different intervals, such as every 30 minutes, 60 minutes, etc. Current procedures have staff visibly watch a patient and then document observations of the patient via a written form. Observations may require a staff member to be within so many feet of a patient, confirm signs of life, patient location, etc. Observation forms may be stored for a long time. Audits regarding compliance to a safety check protocol are proven via these written forms. Compliance with safe check protocols, however, can only measure historical compliance. New systems that can ensure near real-time compliance or lack thereof of safety protocols are needed.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a system diagram of a system for showing systemic certainty of event convergence in accordance with respective examples.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example event convergence application in accordance with respective examples.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a flow diagram of a process for systemic certainty of event convergence in accordance with respective examples.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an example computing device that can be used in conjunction with the technologies described herein.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Ensuring compliance with patient safety protocols, such as Q15 protocols, results in patients receiving excellent care. These protocols are designed for the protection of patients. Accordingly, facilities that are not in compliance with safety protocols risk increased institutional risk; unhappy patients and employees; reduced quality of care; and potential loss of time and money. Various disclosed embodiments herein describe systems that help ensure compliance and identify out of compliance activity in an unobtrusive and time sensitive manner. Other protocols that use a schedule to check performance of a task may also benefit from the disclosed embodiments. For example, minors that travel alone have mandatory touch bases whose compliance can be monitored with disclosed embodiments. In addition, procedures for monitoring equipment or locations may benefit from the disclosed embodiments.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a system diagram of a system <b>100</b> for showing systemic certainty of event convergence in accordance with respective examples. The illustrated system <b>100</b> may be for an office building such as a doctor's office. Within the office, a number of beacon transmitters <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B, <b>120</b>, and <b>130</b> are installed at fixed locations within the office. The beacon transmitters transmit a beacon that includes an identifier. The identifier is mapped to the location where the beacon transmitter is installed. Accordingly, the beacon transmitter <b>120</b> transmits a beacon that identifies a room <b>124</b>. Another beacon <b>130</b> transmits a beacon that identifies a room <b>138</b>. The range of beacon transmitters may be configured based on the location where a beacon transmitter is installed. For example, range <b>132</b> of the beacon transmitter <b>130</b> may be large enough to encompass the majority or relevant portions of the room <b>138</b>. Other beacon transmitters, such as the beacon transmitter <b>120</b>, may have smaller ranges to take into account the size of the room <b>124</b> where the beacon transmitter <b>120</b> is installed.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Multiple beacon transmitters may be used in conjunction to identify a larger area. For example, beacon transmitters <b>110</b>A and <b>110</b>B combined cover a waiting room <b>118</b>. In one example, the beacon transmitters <b>110</b>A and <b>110</b>B may transmit the same identifier that identifies the waiting room <b>118</b>. In another example, the beacon transmitters <b>110</b>A and <b>110</b>B transmit different identifiers, each of which is associated with the waiting room <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Individuals and objects may move around the office. In an example, patients may be provided with a wearable that includes a beacon transmitter. The wearable may be a bracelet, a fob, a card, etc. The wearable transmits a beacon that includes an identifier that identifies a patient. Accordingly, patients <b>114</b>A, <b>114</b>B, and <b>114</b>C each have a wearable. These wearables transmit a beacon with a unique identifier. The unique identifier is used to identify patient <b>114</b>A from other patients, staff, objects, etc.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Staff may use a device that includes an application that receives beacons from both beacon transmitters and wearables. For example, a staff member <b>112</b> may carry a tablet with the application running. The application may receive beacons from the patients <b>114</b>A, <b>114</b>B, and <b>114</b>C as the staff member walks around the waiting room <b>118</b>. In addition, the application on the device may receive the beacons from the beacon transmitters <b>110</b>A and <b>110</b>B. With the various received beacons, convergence between the staff member <b>112</b> and the patients <b>114</b>A, <b>114</b>B, and <b>114</b>C within the waiting room can be determined.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one example, the application asks the staff member which patients are being observed. The application may determine from received beacons which patients are nearby. Patient information, such as name, previous location, picture, etc., may be accessed by the device. For example, the device may query a remote database for this information. Alternatively, the device may have some or all of this information stored locally. The application may display this information for the staff member <b>112</b> to select which patients are being observed. A log of the observation for each observed patient may be stored on the device. The device may also transmit the log to a remote server that collects observation logs from multiple devices.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one example, staff log into the application by providing credentials as known in the art. Once logged in, the application associates all logs generated with by the application with the logged in staff member. For example, the staff member's login id or other identifier is provided within an observation log. In another example, a staff member also wears a wearable that transmits an identifier associated with the staff In this example, the device receives the beacon associated with the staff along with the location beacon and patient beacon. The device identifies the staff for observation logs based on the beacon associated with the staff. For example, the device may determine a received beacon identifier is associated with a staff member. The staff member's identifier may then be provided within the observation logs. In an example, the device may receive multiple beacons associated with staff members. In an example, the beacon with the strongest received power from the multiple beacons is determined to be the staff member using the device. In addition, the device may keep a history of received staff beacons. The staff beacon that has remained constant for more than a predetermined amount of time, e.g., 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc., is determined to be the staff using the device. This example accounts for staff members that pass one another in the office or stop and talk. As another example, the staff beacon combined with the login information is used to verify which staff member is observing patients. This example, also provides a way to check if another staff member or another individual has picked up the device. In this example, the device may provide an indication that the user of the device is not the logged in staff member. The device may automatically log out the staff member and ask for new credentials.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an example, a staff member <b>134</b> uses a device. The device identifies the staff member <b>134</b> via login credentials, staff member beacon identifier, or a combination of both. An application on the device may provide the staff member <b>134</b> with a list of patients that need to be observed. For example, the application may indicate that patient <b>136</b> located in room <b>138</b> needs to be visited. As the staff member enters the room <b>138</b> and comes within proximity of the patient wearable, the device receives the patient beacon associated with the patient <b>136</b>. In one example, the distance between the device and the patient <b>136</b> is determined. For example, using the received signal strength of the patient beacon at the device may be used to estimate the distance between the device and the patient. An application may restrict the ability to generate an observation log until the device comes within a predetermined distance of the patient <b>136</b>. In addition, an average distance and time the device was within the vicinity of the patient may be determined and included as part of an observation log.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The device also receives a location beacon from the beacon transmitter <b>130</b>. The device or application running on the device, may then determine that the staff member <b>134</b> has converged with the patient <b>136</b> in the room <b>130</b>. An observation log may then be created indicating the staff member <b>134</b>, the room <b>130</b>, and the patient <b>136</b>. The application may also ask for information from the staff member <b>134</b> regarding the patient <b>136</b>. For example, how the patient <b>136</b> looks, behavior of the patient <b>136</b>, etc., This information may be included in the observation.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In addition, the room <b>130</b> may include monitoring equipment (not shown) that monitors the patient <b>136</b>. For example, a heart rate and oxygen level monitor may monitor the patient <b>136</b>. In an example, the equipment may also include an associated beacon transmitter that transmits an identifier associated with the equipment. This identifier of equipment may be received by the device and included within the observation log. Observation logs may also include a timestamp. In one example, a remote device that receives the observation log may query the equipment or data store of data from the equipment to determine the data at the relevant time for the patient. For example, the remote device may use the equipment identifier to identify which equipment to query and the timestamp to determine the relevant time. In another example, the device may receive this information directly from the equipment or queries the equipment for the information. This equipment data may then be incorporated into the observation log sent to the remote device.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A patient <b>122</b> may be waiting in a room <b>124</b>. When the patient <b>122</b> was led to the room <b>124</b>, a staff member's device logged the location of the patient <b>122</b> being in room <b>124</b>. For example, the staff member's device would have received the patient's beacon as well as the location beacon associated with room <b>124</b> from the beacon transmitter <b>124</b>. If the remote sever does not receive information regarding the location of the patient <b>122</b> for a period of time, an alert may be transmitted to staff. For example, if the facility is doing Q15 status checks, the remote server may indicate that after 10 minutes of not receiving observation log data associated with the patient <b>122</b>, the remote server may alert staff that the patient <b>122</b> needs an observation within the next five minutes. The remote server may send alerts to all staff devices, to the staff assigned to the patient <b>122</b>, or to staff that are located near room <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">To determine compliance with a time based protocol, a remote server may log the initial interaction with a patient. For example, when a patient arrives at a facility and checks into the facility, a patient wearable is assigned to the patient. An entry system associates the identifier of the patient wearable with the patient. An entry timestamp may be logged as part of an initial observation log. The initial observation log may be entered manually to start a compliance timer associated with the patient. The initial observation may also indicate a location within the facility where the patient is assigned. For example, the patient may be assigned to a waiting room, such as the waiting room <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As the patient waits in the waiting room <b>118</b>, the staff member <b>112</b> observes the patient and supplies an observation log of the patient to a remote server. The remote server may reset or restart the compliance timer associated with the patient. In an example, the patient may be the patient <b>122</b> that has been moved to the room <b>124</b> and is waiting to be seen. As the staff of the facility may be overworked or understaffed, the patient <b>122</b> may be waiting for 10 minutes without being observed. The remote server may keep a list of all patients within the facility, with each patient having an associated timer. The timers may be monitored by the remote server. As there may be different observation intervals, patient timers may be associated with a time interval, such as 15 minutes. The remote server may monitor the timers to determine if any timer is close to the interval or is about to expire. For example, for Q15 observations, timers that count up from the last observation issues an alert when the timer reaches 10 minutes. Other thresholds such as 12 minutes, 13 minutes, etc., may be used. These thresholds can also be used in combination with one another.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As an example, the patient <b>122</b> in the room <b>124</b> has an associated observation timer. When this observation timer reaches 10 minutes or if counting down reaches 5 minutes, an alert is generated. The alert may include an indication of the room <b>124</b> and the patient <b>122</b>. The alert may be sent to all staff members of staff members associated with the patient <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">If the patient <b>122</b> is not observed before the timer expires or reaches its compliance threshold, an alert may be created and sent to staff regarding an out of compliance event. This information may be logged. The remote server may also provide additional logging or alerting based on an out of compliance event. Eventually, the patient <b>122</b> is observed. Based on the timestamp associated with this observation, a total amount of time that the facility was out of compliance may be determined. From the information received by the remote server from various staff members, a compliance dashboard may be created. The dashboard may include how many out of compliance events there were, how much time the facility was in compliance, time spent out of compliance, etc.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As an additional safety feature, if the patient <b>122</b> leaves the room <b>124</b>, the remote server may provide an alert. For example, the remote server may determine the patient <b>122</b> is to be within the room <b>124</b> through previous observation reports or directly from staff. Beacon readers may be installed in the facility or readers from staff devices may detect the patient beacon as the patient <b>122</b> wanders out of the room <b>124</b>. The remote server may check the allowed areas for the patient <b>122</b> and determine that the patient <b>122</b> has entered into unallowed areas. Alerts may be generated for the staff indicating that the patient <b>122</b> has entered a restricted area.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example event convergence application <b>200</b> in accordance with respective examples. The application <b>200</b> may run on a staff device and receives beacons from nearby patients. The application may retrieve patient information for each nearby patient, e.g., <b>210</b> and <b>212</b>. The information may include the patient's name, a patient image, and relevant information. This information may be displayed within the application <b>200</b>. A staff member may select one or more patients <b>212</b>. The staff member may provide additional observational information for each selected patient <b>212</b>. When the information is confirmed, the application submits an observation log for each selected patient <b>212</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a flow diagram of a process <b>300</b> for systemic certainty of event convergence in accordance with respective examples. At <b>310</b>, a device receives a first beacon that is transmitted from a beacon transmitter. The beacon transmitter is installed at a fixed location and does not typically move locations. Accordingly, the first beacon may be thought of as a location beacon. The location beacon includes information that identifies the first location. At <b>320</b>, the location is identified from the beacon information. In an example, a remote server determines the location. In other examples, the device that receives the first beacon identifies the location. At <b>330</b>, a second beacon is received at the device. The second beacon is transmitted from a beacon transmitter. In an example, the second beacon is transmitted from a wearable device worn by a patient of a medical facility. At <b>340</b>, the object, such as a patient, associated with the second beacon is determined. When the beacon corresponds with a patient, the beacon can be considered a patient beacon. Similar with determining the location, either the device that receives the second beacon or a remote server may determine the object from information contained within the second beacon.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">At <b>350</b>, a current convergence time of the device and the object is determined based on the receiving the first and second beacon. In an example, the convergence time may be the later of the timestamps associated with the receipt of the beacons. In another example, the convergence time is either the receipt time of the first beacon or the receipt time of the second beacon. At <b>360</b>, a previous convergence time associated with the object is determined. The previous convergence time may be the last time when the object was within the vicinity of a staff device or was observed.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">At <b>370</b>, an out of compliance event based on the current convergence time and the previous convergence time is determined. For example, an out of compliance event may be determined when the amount of time between the current convergence time and the last observation of a patient is longer than a predetermined threshold. At <b>380</b>, an alert is generated based on the out of compliance event. The alert may be sent to staff members associated with the object or patient. The alert may be a message displayed in an application, sent as a text message, sent over a PA system.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In addition to receiving one object beacon, the device may receive multiple beacons. The multiple beacons may include multiple patient beacons. From these patient beacons, a number of patients may be identified. An observation regarding each of the number of patients may be logged. For example, a list of nearby patients may be displayed on the device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> provides such an example. Images for the patients may be determined. In an example, a remote server determines the images. In another example, the device includes patient images. These images are retrieved by the device and displayed on the device.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an example, the device receives login credentials from the user of the device. For example, the user may be a staff member. The login credentials may be a username and password, bio security data, etc. The login credentials are verified. Once verified, the staff member's identification may be included in observation data. In another example, the staff member is also wearing a beacon transmitter that transmits information that identifies the staff member. The device may receive this information. The device may identify the staff member from the information from the staff member's beacon transmitter. In another example, the login credentials combined with the staff member's beacon information may be combined to verify the user of the device. Observation information may include the staff member's beacon information and indication that the staff member is successfully logged in.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In another example, a staff member is provided with a list of locations that are to be visited by the staff member. In addition, the staff member may be provided with a list of patients that are supposed to be located in each of the list of locations. The list of patients may include an image of each of the patients. The staff may use the images to quickly identify the patients.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some examples, observing a patient may include collecting patient data. In an example, the patient data may include taking a picture of the patient. Facial recognition may be employed to analyze the image to identify the patient within the image. This image analysis make act as a confirmation that the patient was actually visited by a staff member using the device that provided an observation log. In another example, the device may collect a video of the patient. The video of the patient may be analyzed to determine the patient is breathing. This breathing indication may be included in the observation data sent from the device. In an example, the video is captured using an infrared camera that allows breathing determination analysis to be done during the evening. In another example, a thermal camera is used to detect the movement of warm breath from the patient.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In another example, video recorded from a camera, such as a camera that is part of a CCTV system, is accessed. For example, the convergence time along with the location of a convergence may be used to query a camera that records an area within the location. The location may be used to identify the appropriate camera or cameras. The convergence time may be used to determine which portion of recorded video from the cameras is relevant to the convergence. A portion of the video covering a portion or all of the convergence may be retrieved. The portion of the video may be stored as further proof of the convergence. In addition, the staff member, the patient, or both of the convergence may be identified in the portion of the video.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In another example, a remote server or a device may determine that a patient has not been observed for more than a predetermined amount of time, e.g., 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, etc. Based on this determination, one or more staff members assigned to the patient may be identified. An alert that indicates the patient, the patient's last known location, and time of last observation may be sent to the assigned staff members. Staff members may then go an observe the patient based on receiving the alert. Such an alert helps achieve compliance or minimize out of compliance with a safety protocol.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The amount of time a staff member or a patient stays within an area may also be determined and logged. For example, when a staff members visits a room a timer can be started. Once the staff member leaves the room, the timer may be stopped and included as a total time observed data point in an observation log. The amount of time may be used in determining a facility being in or out of compliance. A device may determine a staff member has entered a room when the strongest received location beacon is different from the previous strongest received location beacon. To ensure that rapid change of location does not occur, the strongest received location beacon may have to be received multiple times to be considered a change in location. In another example, certain beacons are indicated as a location where the amount of time spent near the location beacon is to be recorded. For example, a hand washing station may include an associated beacon transmitter. The device may receive the beacon and determine the beacon is from a hand washing station and that the amount of time spent at the hand washing station should be recorded. Accordingly, a timer is started. Once the staff member leaves the vicinity of the hand washing station, the timer is stopped and may be included in an observation report or separate data message sent to the remote server. In one example, the distance between the staff member and the hand washing station may be determined from the received signal strength indicator of the received beacon. From the RSSI the distance between the beacon transmitter and the device may be determined. Once this distance is greater than a predetermined threshold, the device is considered to have moved out of the vicinity of the beacon transmitter. In one example, the threshold is based on the beacon identifier.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In another example, the system may be used to determine a plausibility of an event. For example, if a person says they were assaulted by someone the system may be used to verify that the two individuals were near one another during the relevant period of time. If the logged data shows that the individuals were not near one another or that they were near one another for a brief period of time may indicate that the assault did not happen. Conversely, if the two individuals were close to one another the assault is more plausible. In addition, the logged data may be used to determine other individuals who may have witnessed the assault.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The described systems may be used in various different facilities other than health facilities. For example, schools, prisons, office buildings, etc., may all have location beacon transmitters installed. The location beacon transmitters combined with wearable transmitters worn be individuals or objects within those locations allow the benefits of the described systems to be realized.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The above examples illustrate a system of monitoring convergences between staff and patients. The convergences are measured, identified, and logged with minimal input from the staff and potentially no input from patients. As the disclosed examples do not rely on users entering data, but rather collecting data from the monitored environment, the fallibility of users is reduced if not wholly eliminated. Logs of the convergences may then be used to show a systemic certainty of compliance with a safety protocol. Any out of compliance events can also be identified. Using the out of compliance events, staff may receive additional training or additional resources may be provided. In addition with real time alerting of out of compliance events, the amount of time a facility is out of compliance with a safety protocol can be minimized. The disclosed system, therefore, helps ensure greater patient safety and well being and reduced costs of facilities for being out of compliance.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In another example, the event may be an event that needs to be verified. For example, the event may be an alleged assault or may be an allegation that someone was in a restricted area. As another example, the event may be an alleged theft. To verify an event, the individuals involved with the event are identified. For example, an event may occur on a cruise ship. The individuals may be identified via the ship's passenger list. In addition, an identifier may be determined for each individual associated with the event. The identifier may be associated with a beacon transmitter that is worn by an individual. Receipt of beacons from the beacon transmitter may be used to determine the location of an individual.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Once the individuals have been identified, a location service may be queried to determine the location of each individual over a period of time. The period of time may be the time period of time with the time of the event at the center of the time period. For example, if an event occurred at 5:15 pm, the time period may be 4:15 through 6:15 pm. The location of each individual during this time period may be determined. In addition, the convergence on the individuals during this time may be determined. The convergence is based on determining the beacon transmitters of individuals involved with the event where proximate to one another. In an example, proximate may be individuals that are within 5 feet, 10 feet, 25 feet, etc., of one another. In another example, proximate may mean that the individuals were within the same room.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Integration with video systems may also be done to provide relevant video. For example, the location of each individual during the time period may be used to determine which camera or cameras an individual should be seen on during the time period. The relevant video feed from the camera or cameras may be retrieved for each individual. In this example, a video feed that may be compiled from videos from different cameras may be generated for each individual. The video feed may then been reviewed to determine if an event occurred. In an example, an individual may take their beacon transmitter off before the event occurs. Even in this example, if one person is using a beacon transmitter, relevant location data and video data may be retrieved. In an example, facial recognition software may be used on the video feed to further identify individuals within the video feed.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an example computing device that can be used in conjunction with the technologies described herein.
