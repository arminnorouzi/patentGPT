One type of wireless base station is a so-called CBSD (Citizen Broadband Radio Service Device). Such a device uses a wireless channel allocated from a CBRS (Citizens Band Radio Service) band to support communications with one or more mobile communication devices.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Typically, a so-called SAS (Spectrum Access Service) in a CBRS network allocates one or more wireless channels to a CBSD (such as a wireless base station) to support communications with respective user equipment such as one or more mobile communication devices. Each base station can be configured to communicate with the SAS to receive notification of the one or more wireless channels allocated for its use. Controlled allocation of wireless channels by the spectrum access system helps to prevent interference and increase spectrum use.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are multiple different types of wireless channels in a conventional CBRS band. For example, portions of CBRS band include so-called Priority Access License (PAL) wireless channels, General Authorized Access (GAA) wireless channels, or a combination of both.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, PAL wireless channels are licensed wireless channels in which a corresponding licensee (such as an entity paying for use of the wireless channel) is provided some protection of use of one or more allocated wireless channels from the CBRS band. For example, when no incumbent user (e.g., Government authority) requires use of the channels, the licensed entities are able to freely use the PAL wireless channels in respective one or more predetermined geographical regions without interference by other users (such as lower priority GAA users). General authorized access (GAA) users are able to use the band without a license when and where available.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Subsequent to allocation, a respective wireless base station then uses the allocated channels to provide one or more communication devices access to a remote network such as the Internet.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Note further that, according to conventional techniques, a portion of spectrum comprising 10 MHz channels are available in areas (such as counties) in the 3550-3650 MHz frequency range in the CBRS band. Up to 7 licenses will be awarded in each county. Each entity can buy rights for up to 4 licenses. The exact frequency range associated with a respective license is not guaranteed because it can change due to incumbent activity. In certain instances, a spectrum access system (SAS) will determine a primary and a secondary channel allocation for so-called PAL users.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It may be further noted that there are certain rules (such as &#xa7; 96.25) that a SAS must follow in order to allocate channels to corresponding PAL users. For example, Part 96 Rules: (b)(1)(i). Contiguous geographic areas: A SAS must assign geographically contiguous PALs held by the same Priority Access Licensee to the same channels in each geographic area, to the extent feasible. The SAS may temporarily reassign individual PALs held by the same Priority Access Licensee to different channels, so that geographical contiguity is temporarily not maintained, to the extent necessary to protect Incumbent Users or if necessary to perform its required functions under subpart F of this part, (b)(2)(i). Contiguous channels: A SAS must assign multiple channels held by the same Priority Access Licensee to contiguous channels in the same License Area, to the extent feasible.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In certain instances, the SAS may temporarily reassign individual PALs to non-contiguous channels to the extent necessary to protect Incumbent users or, if necessary, to perform its required functions under subpart F.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">All PAL channels are not necessarily created equal. For example, some PAL channels may be subject to incumbent protection (e.g., co-channel FSS in 3625-3650 MHz). Band edge channels in the CBRS spectrum may require reduced UE transmission power to meet Federal Communication Commission (FCC) Out of Band Emission (OOBE) requirements.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">There are deficiencies associated with allocation of wireless channels in wireless network environment. For example, as previously discussed, PAL wireless channels are auctioned to highest bidders. Unfortunately, one or more wireless channel assigned to a respective entity may not be the most desirable wireless channels within an available spectrum of wireless channels for a particular entity.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Embodiments herein provide novel ways of supporting improved allocation of wireless communications to one or more communication devices in a network environment.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">More specifically, a wireless network environment includes one or more communication management resources that controls allocation of wireless channels in a network environment. A communication management resource initially assigns a first wireless channel for use by first wireless communication equipment in a network environment. In response to receiving a request to swap the first wireless channel for a different wireless channel, the communication management resource allocates (assigns) a second wireless channel as a swap for the first wireless channel. The communication management resource then notifies the first wireless communication equipment to use the second wireless channel as a substitute to the first wireless channel.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A swap request can be received from any suitable resource. In one nonlimiting example embodiment, the communication management resource receives the swap request from the first wireless communication equipment. Additionally, or alternatively, the communication management resource receives the swap request from a wireless network service provider overseeing operation of the first wireless communication equipment.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In still further example embodiments, the communication management resource provides the first wireless communication equipment an evaluation timeframe in which to evaluate use of the second wireless channel in a particular region. This ensures that the allocated second wireless channel (substitute channel) performs at a satisfactory level to the wireless network service provider giving up the first wireless channel.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment, in response to receiving input indicating to cancel the requested swap as a result of evaluating the second wireless channel, the communication management resource revokes use of the second wireless channel and provides notice to the first wireless communication equipment to use the first wireless channel again.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Alternatively, in response to receiving input indicating to accept the swap as a result of evaluating the second wireless channel, the communication management resource provides notice to the first wireless communication equipment to continue use of the first wireless channel.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In further example embodiments, the communication management resource initially assigns, prior to the swap, the second wireless channel for use by second wireless communication equipment in the network environment. In response to receiving a request to swap the second wireless channel for a different wireless channel, the communication management resource allocates the first wireless channel to the second wireless communication equipment as a swap for the second wireless channel. The communication management resource notifies the second wireless communication equipment to use the first wireless channel as a substitute to the second wireless channel.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In yet further example embodiments, the first wireless communication equipment is operated by a first wireless network service provider granted a license to the first wireless channel; and the second wireless communication equipment is operated by a second wireless network service provider granted a license to the second wireless channel.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Further embodiments herein include, via the communication management resource, identifying a geographical region in which the first wireless channel is initially assigned for use by the first wireless communication equipment. The communication management resource uses geographical region information at least in part to map the first request (to swap the first wireless channel with the second wireless channel) to a second swap request, the second swap request requesting a swap of the second wireless channel with a different wireless channel in the same geographical region.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As previously discussed, a swap request can be configured to include criteria indicating desired attributes of a wireless channel desired by the entity requesting the swap. In one embodiment, a respective swap request specifies frequency (magnitude) attributes of the different wireless channel being requested for use. In such an instance, in one embodiment, the request to swap the first wireless channel indicates a desire to swap the first wireless channel with a wireless channel of a higher carrier frequency than the original assigned first wireless channel. To satisfy the request, the communication management resource allocates the second wireless channel, which has a higher carrier frequency than the first wireless channel.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Yet further embodiments herein include, via the communication management resource, transmitting a wireless communication over a wireless communication link to the first wireless communication equipment. The wireless communication notifies the first wireless communication equipment to use the second wireless channel as a substitute wireless channel.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Any of one or more communication management resources (such as allocation management resources) as discussed herein can be configured to keep track of a pool of candidate wireless network service providers and corresponding respective requests associated with a possible wireless channel swap. For example, in one embodiment, a communication management resource determines a set of candidate wireless channels in which to swap the first wireless channel based on a location in which the first wireless channel is licensed for use by the first wireless communication equipment. The communication management resource selects the second wireless channel from the set as a swap for the first wireless channel.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As previously discussed, each swap request can be accompanied by criteria indicating attributes of a desired wireless channel. For example, in one embodiment, the communication management resource receives a first swap request from a first wireless network service provider to swap a first wireless channel for a different wireless channel. The first swap request specifies desired attributes of the different wireless channel requested by the first wireless network service provider. Prior to performing the requested swap, the communication management resource receives a second swap request from a second wireless network service provider to swap a second wireless channel for a different wireless channel. The second swap request specifies desired attributes of the different wireless channel desired by the second wireless network service provider. The communication management resource compares the received swap criteria associated with the first swap request and the second swap request to determine whether to perform the swap. Execution of the swap depends on satisfying criteria associated with each of the respective swap requests.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Additional details of supporting wireless channel swaps are further discussed herein.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Embodiments herein are useful over conventional techniques. For example, swapping of wireless channels on an as-needed basis provides better use of the respective limited available wireless spectrum because each of the different wireless network service providers are able to swap undesirable wireless channels for more desirable wireless channels.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Note that any of the resources as discussed herein can include one or more computerized devices, communication management resources, communication devices, servers, base stations, wireless communication equipment, communication management systems, controllers, workstations, user equipment, handheld or laptop computers, or the like to carry out and/or support any or all of the method operations disclosed herein.
