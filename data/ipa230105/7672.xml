The Rel-16 NR design has some limitations. For example, the supported periodicity for DL SPS in Rel-16 NR: {1, . . . , 640} milliseconds for a Near Radio (NR) system at 15 KHz subcarrier spacing, and {&#xbd;, 1, 3/2, . . . , 640} milliseconds at 30 KHz subcarrier spacing, etc. The supported periodicities for the UL CG in the Rel-16 NR can include multiple of 1 millisecond for 15 KHz up to 640 milliseconds, 2 symbols ( 1/7 milliseconds), 7 symbols (0.5 milliseconds) and multiple of &#xbd; millisecond for 30 KHz up to 640 milliseconds, 2 symbols ( 1/14 milliseconds), 7 symbols (0.25 milliseconds).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), traffic can be generated with a frequency of 1200 Hz (i.e. 1200 packets/second). As the traffic generation may be from an installed system with decades of use, it can be difficult to modify the traffic generation periodicity to match NR timing (e.g., 100 Hz). For Augmented Reality (AR) or Virtual Reality (VR) applications, service, audio, and video streams can be generated at cadences which are not integer multiples of the NR basic timing (e.g., video stream generation at 60 or 120 frames per seconds). The existing solution in NR to address the problem is to use over-provision.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, with the current NR solution (i.e., overprovisioning), a number of problems can be identified. Using the DL SPS as an example, even though the network does not send any traffic to the user equipment (UE) at some occasions (e.g., occasions from SPS1/SPS2/SPS3 not overlapping with the actual TSN traffic (e.g., see blocks A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>), the UE may not have information that the network does not send such traffic. As a result, the UE may perform unnecessary channel estimation on the Demodulation Reference Signal (DMRS) symbols and/or check the calculated log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) to determine whether there is an actual transmission from the network or not. In other words, UE power consumption can be significant due to the DL processing to determine the presence of an actual transmission or not. In addition, the UE needs to generate Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARD) feedback and transmit over the configured Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH) resource for the transmission occurrence that is not associated with any actual transmission. This process can incur unnecessary UE power consumption. In terms of system operations, it is wasteful for the UE to send unnecessary feedback over the PUCCH, which can consume system resources and lead to UL interference.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, there is a need for an enhanced mechanism for the UE and the base station (BS) that takes into account at least some of the issues discussed above, as well as other possible issues.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A method and apparatus that can support data transmission traffic with non-integer periodicity in wireless communication is described.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect of the disclosure, embodiments of the present disclosure provide a baseband processor configured to perform the processes as described below. In some embodiments, a baseband processor of a wireless user equipment (UE) can be configured to perform operations. The baseband processor may receive a configuration for a downlink (DL) Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) or an uplink (UL) Configured Grant (CG). The configuration may include an indication of non-integer periodicity of the DL SPS or the UL CG. Additionally, the baseband processor may determine an occurrence of the DL SPS or the UL CG based on the received configuration for the DL SPS or the UL CG to determine a periodicity of a packet generation. Further, the baseband processor may transmit or receive data based on the configuration for the DL SPS or the UL CG.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the indication of non-integer periodicity of the DL SPS or the UL CG can further include a first positive integer and a second positive integer indicating periodicity of the DL SPS and the UL CG. The operations to determine the occurrence of the DL SPS or the UL CG can include rounding a term including a ratio of the first positive integer and the second positive integer using a predefined rounding function. The predefined rounding function includes a round, a ceiling, or a floor operation.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the indication of non-integer periodicity of the DL SPS or the UL CG can further include an indication to a frequency of the DL SPS or the UL CG. The configuration can further include an initial offset in slots or symbols. The initial offset in slots or symbols may be associated with a slot index of a slot or a symbol in which an initial DL SPS or UL CG appears.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the occurrence of the DL SPS or the UL CG can be further determined based on a System Frame Number (SFN) of a first reception of a Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) through DL SPS or a first transmission of Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) through UL CG and a start time of a slot of the first reception of the PDSCH or the first transmission of the PDSCH. In some other embodiments, the occurrence of the DL SPS or the UL CG can be further determined based on a number of slots in a frame.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the occurrence of the DL SPS or the UL CG can be further determined based on a number of symbols per slot and a start time of a symbol of the first reception of the PDSCH or the first transmission of the PUSCH. The occurrence of the UL CG can be further determined based on a time reference of the SFN, and a time domain offset. The UL CG is a type 1.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the occurrence of the DL SPS or the UL CG can be further determined based on a hyperframe index. The hyperframe index can be determined based on the first positive and second positive integers. The occurrence of the DL SPS can be further determined based on the number of symbols per slot.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, the operations to determine the occurrence of the DL SPS or the UL CG can further include receiving a jitter window parameter defining a jitter window around a nominal traffic arrival time. A reception occasion can occur within the jitter window. The nominal traffic time can be determined based on a running index and the first and second positive integers.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the reception occasion can be expanded on one side or both sides of the reception occasion to include symbols not considered by any of the reception occasion. The symbols may include gap symbols between reception occasions, trailing symbols, or preceding symbols for a reception occasion. A reference reception occasion can indicate a nominal reception occasion in which the nominal traffic arrival time appears. The jitter window can be determined based on the jitter window parameter and the reference reception occasion.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the jitter window parameter can be received via a Downlink Control Information (DCI), a Medium Access Control (MAC) Control Element (CE) or an RRC signaling. of the DL SPS or the UL CG can further include receiving data scheduled through DL SPS or transmitting data through U CG in a window defined by the jitter window.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another aspect of the disclosure, embodiments of the present disclosure also provide a UE configured to perform the processes as described above.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a further aspect of the disclosure, embodiments of the present disclosure also provide a base station configured to perform the processes as described above.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention is illustrated by way of example and not limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like references indicate similar elements.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example wireless communication system according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a base station (BS) in communication with a plurality of user equipment (UE) device, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an example block diagram of a UE, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an example block diagram of a BS, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an example block diagram of cellular communication circuitry, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an illustration of some embodiments of overprovisioning of resource with multiple SPS, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> is an illustration of some embodiments of how an initial offset can be determined for a downlink (DL), according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> is an illustration of some embodiments of how an initial offset can be determined for an uplink (UL) CG, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a flow chart illustrating a process of determining a periodicity at a UE based on a configuration of the DL SPS or the UL CG, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a flow chart illustrating a process of configuring a UE with DL SPS or UL CG at a BS, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is an illustration of some embodiments of a hyperframe with slots having the DL SPS, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is an illustration of some embodiments of a symbol level alignment, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref> is an illustration of some embodiments of a jitter window concept, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref> is an illustration of some embodiments of nominal reception occasion concept based on a jitter window, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>C</figref> is an illustration of some embodiments of a jitter window for packet arrival at 750 Hz with a SCS of 15 KHz, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is an illustration of some embodiments of reducing PDSCH detection load through jitter window for three DL SPS configurations, according to some embodiments.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A method and apparatus of a device for use in wireless communication is described.

As PDCCH monitoring can consume UE power, the Rel-15/Rel-16 design leads to UE power consumption even if there is no traffic to the UE. Consequently, incurring PDCCH monitoring for the actual traffic, and adaption of PDCCH monitoring according traffic change in terms of periodicity and offset in a periodicity can limit PDCCH monitoring to essential processing needed for the actual traffic, for example, in DL for SPS PDSCH, and in UL for CG PUSCH. Also the PDCCH monitoring is configured through RRC signaling in NR Rel-15/16 design, which may not be nimble enough to adapt to traffic change. To address those issues, in one embodiment, adaptation through MAC CE can be used, for example, a search space can be turned on/activated/configured or turned off/de-activated/de-configured by a MAC CE. Alternatively or in addition, signaling concerning monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset and/or duration and/or monitoringSymbolsWithinSlot can be provided in the MAC CE. monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset can be represented by M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2 </sub>and signaling for offset through RRC signaling or with MAC CE. Some essential signaling for network operation can still be indicated by PDCCH monitored at search space(s) as configured by RRC with monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset and/or duration and/or monitoringSymbolsWithinSlot in the information element (IE). In one embodiment, for a proposed search space linked to a DL SPS, monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset and duration can be omitted in the RRC configured of the search space, instead, and the monitoring occasions of PDCCH is provided by the DL SPS configuration such as its periodicity (e.g., with &#x201c;periodicity&#x201d; or M<sub>1</sub>/M<sub>2 </sub>and the jitter window design).

There are two types (i.e., Type 1 CG and Type 2 CG) of CGs in NR. In Type 1 CG, every transmission parameter such as periodicity, offset, Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) level, etc. can be configured by RRC signaling. In Type 2 CG, some transmission parameters can be configured through RRC signaling, and other transmission parameters can be provided by a dynamic signaling through an activation DCI of a CG configuration. In NR Rel-15, at most a single CG can be supported on a cell. In NR Rel-16, up to 12 CG configurations are supported over a BWP in a cell, hence the support of CG is much stronger in Rel-16. Due to similarity between the DL SPS and the UL CG Type 2 (part of transmission parameters come from RRC signaling, the rest come from dynamic signaling with an activation DCI), the examples for the DL SPS can be replicated for the UL CG Type 2.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> illustrates embodiments how an initial offset is determined for an uplink (UL) CG <b>720</b>.

For example, a jitter window [g(k)&#x2212;J<sub>1</sub>, g(k)+J<sub>2</sub>] can be defined where J<sub>1 </sub>and J<sub>2 </sub>are two parameters to set the jitter window (or &#x201c;filter window&#x201d;). Then, the network can configure J<sub>1 </sub>and J<sub>2 </sub>according to the jitter mechanism. For example J<sub>1</sub>=J<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0148">In some embodiments, g&#x2032;(k)=g(k)&#x2212;J<sub>1 </sub>and g&#x2033;(k)=g(k)+J<sub>2 </sub>can be defined to define a window. The UE expects one SPS transmission from the network from the window defined by g&#x2032;(k) and g&#x2033;(k). In some other embodiments, the UE can expect one or more SPS transmissions from the network from the window defined by g&#x2032;(k) and g&#x2033;(k). For video traffic, for reference frame (I-frame), the payload can be large, but for P-frame as temporal correlation is exploited, the payload can be relatively small. Hence, it is desirable for the gNB to have the flexibility to transmit one or more PDSCHs within the jitter window.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0149">The configuration, adaptation of J<sub>1 </sub>and J<sub>2 </sub>can follow that for I<sub>shift</sub>, M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2 </sub>as discussed above. For example, gNB may adjust J<sub>1 </sub>and J<sub>2 </sub>with an activation DCI and/or MAC CE according to the expected video frame size's variation. The &#x201c;jitter window&#x201d; or &#x201c;filter window&#x201d; (through J<sub>1 </sub>and J<sub>2</sub>) can be considered for each DL SPS configuration, each UL CG configuration separately or jointly.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0150"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref> illustrates embodiments of jitter window concept. Since 16 bits can be used for an RNTI configuration, it can be assumed that M<sub>1 </sub>and M<sub>2 </sub>can take up to 16 bits also. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>, if the TSN traffic periodicity is so &#x201c;odd&#x201d;, even with M<sub>1 </sub>and M<sub>2 </sub>from all possible combinations from 1 to 2{circumflex over (&#x2003;)}-16-1, there still be a slight difference between M<sub>1</sub>/M<sub>2 </sub>and the TSN traffic periodicity <b>1204</b>-<b>1208</b>. As a result, as the running index k increases, there will be increasingly a large offset between the TSN traffic <b>1204</b>-<b>1208</b> and the jitter window <b>1210</b>-<b>1214</b>. The TSN packet arrival may be outside of the jitter window.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0151">In this example, semi-static signaling and/or dynamic signaling can be used to adjust the reception window. With a dynamic signaling, I<sub>shift </sub>can be determined according to an activation DCI indicated in the receiver timing for the SPS. As for the CG,I<sub>shift </sub>can be determined according to an activation DCI indicated in the transmitter timing. In this example, I<sub>shift </sub>can be signaled using RRC signaling. For increased signaling robustness, MAC CE based solution can be also considered. For example, I<sub>shift </sub>can be carried in a MAC CE.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0152">As discussed, over-provision and multiple SPS configuration solutions causes unnecessary UE power consumption because the UE does not know in advance how many SPS transmissions it should expect from frequency DL SPS occasions or multiple SPS occasions. Because the jitter window can be configured so that the occasions in which the UE needs to inspect potential DL SPS transmissions are significantly reduced, UE power consumption can be reduced. In addition, the HARQ feedback overhead can be reduced because there is a single DL SPS transmission within the jitter window.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0153">With J<sub>1 </sub>and J<sub>2</sub>, the jitter window size is given by J<sub>1</sub>+J<sub>2</sub>+1. Since at most there is one transmission from the gNB in some embodiments, there can be two mutually exclusive cases for reception at a slot (detected a DL PS and successfully decoded it, detected a DL PS and failed to decode it) within the window defined by g&#x2032;(k) and g&#x2033;(k), so 2&#xd7;(J<sub>1</sub>+J<sub>2</sub>+1) code states are needed. Note such cases are also mutually exclusive across slots within the window. Further, if the UE fails to detect any transmission in any slot in the jitter window, then one additional code state can be included so the total number of code states for HARQ feedback is 2&#xd7;(U<sub>1</sub>+J<sub>2</sub>+1)+1. Therefore [log<sub>2 </sub>(2&#xd7;(J<sub>1</sub>+J<sub>2</sub>+1)+1)] bits are used. This compares favorably with the overhead with existing solutions. Note for existing solutions, the feedback overhead can be more than J<sub>1</sub>+J<sub>2</sub>+1 bits because the UE is not aware of the jitter window.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0154">Jitter in packet arrival can be introduced by various nodes in a network connecting the application server to the UE client. A simplistic solution would be to configure frequent DL SPS reception to combat traffic jitter, however this solution may result in a very high UE power consumption. To minimize the occasions where the UE needs to detect SPS PDSCH, a jitter window around the nominal traffic arrival time can be introduced. As a result, the UE may expect a DL SPS transmission within the jitter window. Accordingly, the UE does not need to detect DL SPS PDSCH outside the jitter window. A nominal traffic arrival time can be represented by t<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>, t<sub>3</sub>, . . . in milliseconds. Then, the jitter window for a packet k can be represented by [&#x2212;j<sub>1</sub>+t<sub>k</sub>, j<sub>2</sub>+t<sub>k</sub>], where t<sub>k </sub>is given by N&#xd7;M<sub>1</sub>/M<sub>2</sub>. Reception occasions for a DL SPS PDSCHs can be defined within the jitter window [&#x2212;j<sub>1</sub>+t<sub>k</sub>, j<sub>2</sub>+t<sub>k</sub>].</p><p id="p-0165" num="0155">For some traffic, DL SPS reception occasions in separate slots can be adequate. Therefore, identifying reception occasions from different slots included in the jitter window can be sufficient. For some other traffic including multiple reception occasions within a slot, an inter-reception occasion time, for example, &#x394;T is necessary, so the reception occasions within the jitter window can be determined using &#x2212;j<sub>1</sub>+t<sub>k</sub>&#x2264;f&#xb7;&#x394;T+t<sub>k</sub>&#x2264;j<sub>2</sub>+t<sub>k</sub>. For example, with j<sub>1</sub>=&#x394;T, j<sub>2</sub>=2&#xb7;&#x394;T, f=0, &#x2212;1, 1, 2 and 4 reception occasions can be identified.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0156">Alternatively, multiple reception occasions within a slot can be supported by multiple starting symbols within a slot. Therefore, a number of starting symbols of reception occasions within a slot are signaled to the UE through RRC signaling and/or MAC CE. The reception occasions can be of the same duration or different durations. As for the case they are of the same duration, the duration can be derived from L which represents the number of OFDM symbols in PDSCH from the first PDSCH at activation. Note it is also possible to deduce the number of reception occasions in a slot from the starting symbol and duration of the first PDSCH, for example, the allowed starting symbols can be found from intersection of {0, 1, 2 . . . , 13} and {S, S+L, S-L, S+2&#xd7;L, S&#x2212;2&#xd7;L, . . . } where S is the symbol index of the starting symbol in the first PDSCH. Gaps can be also created between two adjacent reception occasions with the starting symbols given by the intersection of {0, 1, 2 . . . , 13} and {S, S+L&#x2032;, S&#x2212;L&#x2032;, S+2&#xd7;L&#x2032;, S&#x2212;2&#xd7;L&#x2032;, . . . } where L&#x2032;=L+number of OFDM symbols in a gap for normal Cyclic Prefix(CP), and by the intersection of {0, 1, 2 . . . , 11} and {S, S+L&#x2032;, S&#x2212;L&#x2032;, S+2&#xd7;L&#x2032;, S&#x2212;2&#xd7;L&#x2032;, . . . } where L&#x2032;=L+number of OFDM symbols in a gap for extended CP.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0157">A reception occasion can be expanded on one side or both sides of the reception occasion to include symbols not considered by any reception occasion. This will allow the derivation of the reception occasions within the jitter window more easily. The symbols not considered by any reception occasion may include gap symbols between reception occasions, trailing symbols, or preceding symbols for a reception occasion.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0158"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a nominal reception occasion concept.

The jitter window can be defined with J<sub>1 </sub>reception occasions prior to the &#x201c;reference reception occasion&#x201d; and J<sub>2 </sub>reception occasions after the reference reception occasion.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0159"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>C</figref> illustrates some embodiments of a jitter window for packet arrival at 750 Hz with a SCS of 15 KHz.

Each of the three jitter windows covers two symbols.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0160">Assuming there is a single reception occasion in a slot, when M<sub>1</sub>/M<sub>2 </sub>in milliseconds is used, the following change (marked in italic) is made to determine occasions where DL SPS grants occur.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0161">After a downlink assignment is configured for an SPS, the MAC entity shall consider sequentially that downlink assignment(s) occurs between the slot for which: (numberOfSlotsPerFrame&#xd7;1024&#xd7;d+numberOfSlotsPerFrame&#xd7;SFN+slot number in the frame)=[(numberOfSlotsPerFrame&#xd7;SFN<sub>start time</sub>+slot<sub>start time</sub>)+ceil((&#x2212;j<sub>1</sub>+N&#xd7;M<sub>1</sub>/M<sub>2</sub>)&#xd7;numberOfSlotsPerFrame/10)] modulo (D&#xd7;1024&#xd7;numberOfSlotsPerFrame) and the slot for which: (numberOfSlotsPerFrame&#xd7;1024&#xd7;d+numberOfSlotsPerFrame&#xd7;SFN+slot number in the frame)=[(numberOfSlotsPerFrame&#xd7;SFN<sub>start time</sub>+slot<sub>start time</sub>)+ceil((j<sub>2</sub>+N&#xd7;M<sub>1</sub>/M<sub>2</sub>)&#xd7;numberOfSlotsPerFrame/10)] modulo (D&#xd7;1024&#xd7;numberOfSlotsPerFrame) where SFN<sub>start time </sub>and slot<sub>start time </sub>are the SFN and slot, respectively, of the first transmission of PDSCH where the configured downlink assignment was (re-)initialized. In case of unaligned SFN across carriers in a cell group, the SFN of the concerned Serving Cell is used to calculate the occurrences of configured downlink assignments. d is zero at DL SPS (re)-initialization, and d is incremented by 1 for every 1024 radio frames. Note for the very first DL SPS PDSCH at activation, the jitter window is not applicable as it is not necessary on the UE to find when to expect the DL SPS PDSCH, as the very DL DPS PDSCH at activation is treated a DG (dynamic grant) for HARQ feedback point of view. Therefore, no special handling is needed.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0162">In some embodiments, assuming a single transport block for each DL PDSCH (if two transport blocks are supported the design can be extended accordingly), one HARQ feedback bit is generated for each DL SPS PDSCH occasion within a jitter window. For Type 1 HARQ codebook design, the HARQ codebook is populated with HARQ feedback for DL SPS PDSCH within the jitter window. For SPS only HARQ codebook construction, in Rel-16 it was agreed that HARQ-ACK bit order for SPS PDSCH reception without a corresponding PDCCH is determined. In ascending order of DL slot per {SPS configuration index, serving cell index}, and then in ascending order of SPS configuration index per {serving cell index}, and then in ascending order of serving cell index.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0163">Because DL SPS PDSCHs within the jitter window belong to a single SPS configuration, the same design principle from Release 16 can be applied. Note however there can be multiple DL SPS transmission occasions within a jitter window. Thus, their respective HARQ bits are included in the feedback for a given SPS configuration index.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0164">Because Type 2 HARQ codebook design leverages the design for SPS only HARQ design, Type 2 HARQ codebook design for jitter window can be also supported. With the introduction of jitter window, if one or more DL SPS PDSCH are allowed within a jitter window as described above, the network can adapt the rate of data transmission with DL SPS at regular time epochs, e.g., at one epoch, the network needs to send to the UE with multiple DL SPS PDSCH carrying the reference frame or I-frame from a video encoder such as H.264 as the I-frame is of a large size, at another the network needs to send the UE with a single DL SPS PDSCH carrying P-frame or B-frame from video encoder such as H.264 as the P-frame/B-frame is of a small size. The jitter window design to allow rate adaptation of data transmission can be also used for UL CG, similar to DL SPS. In some other embodiments, at most a single DL SPS PDSCH can be expected within a jitter window. In these embodiments, efficient encoding scheme can be considered for SPS PDSCH only HARQ codebook design. For example, for a SPS configuration a jitter window [&#x2212;J<sub>1</sub>, J<sub>2</sub>] can be configured. In some embodiments, a single HARQ feedback bit can be generated for all reception occasions in the jitter window as a single DL SPS PDSCH is expected. The HARQ feedback time is according to the last reception occasion inside the jitter window (or reception occasion J<sub>2 </sub>if the reference reception occasion is reception occasion 0). In some other embodiments, because there is at most one transmission from the gNB, for each of the J<sub>1</sub>+J<sub>2</sub>+1 reception occasions, two mutually exclusive cases for a reception at a reception occasion can be considered. For example, one case can include the UE detects the DL SPS and the UE successfully decodes the DL SPS. The other case can include the UE detects the DL SPS but the UE fails to decode it. Note such cases are also mutually exclusive across reception occasions within the jitter window. Further, if the UE fails to detect any transmission in any reception occasion in the jitter window, one additional code state can be included so the total number of code states for HARQ feedback is 2(J<sub>1</sub>+J<sub>2</sub>+1)+1, which consumes &#x250c;log 2(2&#xb7;(J<sub>1</sub>+J<sub>2</sub>+1)+1)&#x2510; bits.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0165">In some embodiments, the fraction number to represent a periodicity can be applied to Frequency Division Duplex (FDD). For Time Division Duplex (TDD), the configured DL SPS transmission may collide with semi-static SFI UL symbol(s). In these embodiments, the DL SPS transmission may be deferred so the DL SPS transmission does not overlap with semi-static SFI UL symbol(s). Such a shift can be to towards an earlier slot or a later slot depending on the latency requirement. In some other embodiments, a solution similar to PUSCH repetition type B can be used for downlink and uplink (With PUSCH repetition Type B, segmentation of a nominal PUSCH can be used to handle situations such as cross slot boundary, colliding with UL symbol(s)).</p><p id="p-0176" num="0166"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is an illustration of some embodiments of 3 DL SPS configurations (each with a periodicity of 1 millisecond) are configured for a UE following the Rel-16 NR design. For example, modifying the configuration of DL SPS/UL CG to support traffic with non-integer periodicity with the NR design can be considered. In one example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, 3 DL SPS (e.g., <b>1302</b>-<b>1306</b>) configurations (each with a periodicity of 1 millisecond) are configured for a UE following the Rel-16 NR design. However, I<sub>shift</sub>, M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>, J<sub>1 </sub>and J<sub>2 </sub>can be introduced to define the &#x201c;filter window&#x201d; or &#x201c;jitter window&#x201d; (e.g., <b>1308</b>-<b>1302</b>). Only slots falling within the filter window or the jitter window <b>1308</b>-<b>1312</b> may contain SPS PDSCH for the current configuration.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0167">The jitter window (e.g., <b>1308</b>) can be used to limit the occasions where a UE needs to monitor DL SPS reception and generate HARQ feedback accordingly. For example, the jitter window can be used to filter out occasions where the UE does not expect DL SPS PDSCH. The jitter window can be also called a &#x201c;filter window&#x201d;. The filter window can be configured per SPS configuration, or it can be configured jointly among multiple SPS configurations. In terms of signaling aspect, a number of options can be considered. In some embodiments, the signaling can be performed via a RRC configuration. In some other embodiments, MAC CE signaling can be also considered. For example, the MAC CE can include the SPS configuration indexes to indicate the filter window to a UE. In some other embodiments, dynamic signaling can also be used. For multiple SPS configurations that are linked to the same filtering window, one SPS configuration can be selected as the master SPS configuration. The filtering window configured with the master SPS configuration can be applied. The master SPS configuration can be selected via an SPS Configuration Index, for example, among linked SPS configurations. The one with the lowest SPS configuration Index can be selected as the master SPS configuration.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0168">For example, SPS configurations with indexes {1, 3, 5} can be linked through RRC signaling for filtering window configuration. SPS 1 can be configured with a filtering window with {M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>, J<sub>1</sub>, J<sub>2</sub>}, and SPS 3 can be configured with a filtering window {M&#x2032;<sub>1</sub>, M&#x2032;<sub>2</sub>, J&#x2032;<sub>1</sub>, J&#x2032;<sub>2</sub>}. If all three SPS configurations are activated, the filtering window setup for SPS 1 can be applied (i.e. {M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>, J<sub>1</sub>, J<sub>2</sub>}). If only SPS 3 and SPS 5 are activated, then the filtering window setup for SPS 3 can be applied (i.e. M&#x2032;<sub>1</sub>, M&#x2032;<sub>2</sub>, J&#x2032;<sub>1</sub>, J&#x2032;<sub>2</sub>}), {SFN<sub>start time </sub>and slot<sub>start time</sub>} or {SFN<sub>start time </sub>and slot<sub>start time</sub>, symbol<sub>start time</sub>} can be determined according to the master SP configuration (e.g., the SPS configuration with the lowest index within a set of linked SPS configurations). In some embodiments, one set of configuration such as {M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>, J<sub>1</sub>, J<sub>2</sub>} can be configured for multiple SPS configurations, {SFN<sub>start time </sub>and slot<sub>start time</sub>} or {SFN<sub>start time </sub>and slot<sub>start time</sub>, symbol<sub>start time</sub>} can be determined according to the master SP configuration (e.g., the SPS configuration with the lowest index within a set of linked SPS configurations).</p><p id="p-0179" num="0169">In some embodiments, the configuration of {M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>, J<sub>1</sub>, J<sub>2</sub>} or {M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>} applies to the jitter window, and a separate periodicity configuration is applied to DL SPS or UL CG. For a given DL SPS configuration, a UE is not required to receive DL SPS outside the intersection of jitter windows derived in part according to {M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>, J<sub>1</sub>, J<sub>2</sub>} and DL SPS reception occasions derived in part according to the configured periodicity (e.g., 1 millisecond or 10 milliseconds). For a given DL SPS configuration, a UE is not allowed to transmit UL CG outside the intersection of jitter windows derived in part according to {M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>, J<sub>1</sub>, J<sub>2</sub>} and CG transmission occasions derived in part according to the configured periodicity (e.g. 1 millisecond or 10 milliseconds). When one or multiple DL SPS configurations are linked to the same jitter window configuration, HARQ feedback overhead can be reduced as the UE generate HARQ feedback for DL SPS from a DL SPS configuration only for those DL SPS reception occasions within its associated jitter windows. If only one DL SPS reception or at most one DL SPS reception among all DL SPS receptions from all DL SPS configurations associated/linked with a jitter window configuration is expected, the HARQ feedback overhead can be further reduced.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0170">In some other embodiments, the ratios of a first positive and second positive numbers M<sub>1</sub>/M<sub>2 </sub>(e.g., 25/3, 50/3, etc.) can be specified.
