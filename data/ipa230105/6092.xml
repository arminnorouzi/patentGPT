id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">Described are light emitting diode (LED) devices including a combination of electroluminescent quantum wells and photo-luminescent active regions in the same wafer. A first group of QWs with shortest emission wavelength is placed between the p- and n-layers of a p-n junction. Other groups of QWs with longer wavelengths are placed outside the p-n junction in a part of the LED structure where electrical injection of minority carriers does not occur. Electroluminescence emitted by the first group of QWs is absorbed by other group(s) and re-emitted as longer wavelength light. The color of an individual die made on the wafer can be controlled by either etching away unwanted groups of longer-wavelength QWs at the position of that die, or keeping them intact. Wavelength-selective mirrors that increase down conversion efficiency may be selectively applied to die where longer wavelength emission is desired. The use of tunnel junction contacts facilitates integration of wavelength selective mirrors to external surfaces of the die and avoids problems of conductivity type conversion on etched p-GaN layers.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="157.31mm" wi="158.75mm" file="US20230006093A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image"

LEDs combine a P-type semiconductor with an N-type semiconductor. LEDs commonly use a III-group compound semiconductor. A III-group compound semiconductor provides stable operation at a higher temperature than devices that use other semiconductors. The III-group compound is typically formed on a substrate formed of sapphire or silicon carbide (SiC).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typically, color LED displays are manufactured by picking LEDs from separate blue, green and red emitting wafers and then aligning them in alternating close proximity on the display. This method is difficult to apply for high resolution displays which require micron-sized LED pixels. As the die size decreases to satisfy resolution requirements, larger and larger numbers of die must be transferred at each pick and place operation to populate a display of given dimensions. Manufacturing LED displays would be greatly simplified if LEDs of the three primary colors could be fabricated at controlled positions within the same semiconductor wafer.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, there is a need for LED devices where LEDs of different colors are in the same wafer.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments of the disclosure are directed to LED devices and methods for manufacturing LED devices.

The disclosure is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or being carried out in various ways.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The term &#x201c;substrate&#x201d; as used herein according to one or more embodiments refers to a structure, intermediate or final, having a surface, or portion of a surface, upon which a process acts. In addition, reference to a substrate in some embodiments also refers to only a portion of the substrate, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Further, reference to depositing on a substrate according to some embodiments includes depositing on a bare substrate or on a substrate with one or more layers, films, features or materials deposited or formed thereon.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one or more embodiments, the &#x201c;substrate&#x201d; means any substrate or material surface formed on a substrate upon which film processing is performed during a fabrication process. In exemplary embodiments, a substrate surface on which processing is performed includes materials such as silicon, silicon oxide, silicon on insulator (SOI), strained silicon, amorphous silicon, doped silicon, carbon doped silicon oxides, germanium, gallium arsenide, glass, sapphire, and any other suitable materials such as metals, metal nitrides, III-nitrides (e.g., GaN, AN, InN and other alloys), metal alloys, and other conductive materials, depending on the application. Substrates include, without limitation, light emitting diode (LED) devices. Substrates in some embodiments are exposed to a pretreatment process to polish, etch, reduce, oxidize, hydroxylate, anneal, UV cure, e-beam cure and/or bake the substrate surface. In addition to film processing directly on the surface of the substrate itself, in some embodiments, any of the film processing steps disclosed is also performed on an underlayer formed on the substrate, and the term &#x201c;substrate surface&#x201d; is intended to include such underlayer as the context indicates. Thus for example, where a film/layer or partial film/layer has been deposited onto a substrate surface, the exposed surface of the newly deposited film/layer becomes the substrate surface.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The term &#x201c;wafer&#x201d; and &#x201c;substrate&#x201d; will be used interchangeably in the instant disclosure. Thus, as used herein, a wafer serves as the substrate for the formation of the LED devices described herein.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Embodiments described herein describe LED devices and methods for forming LED devices. In particular, the present disclosure describes LED devices and methods to produce LED devices which advantageously have two or more groups of quantum wells (QWs) grown in the same epitaxial wafer. In one or more embodiments, only a first group of QWs with shortest emission wavelength is placed between the p- and n-layers of a p-n junction. Other groups of QWs with longer wavelengths are placed outside the p-n junction in a part of the LED structure where electrical injection of minority carriers does not occur. Electroluminescence emitted by the first group of QWs is absorbed by other group(s) and re-emitted as longer wavelength light. The color of an individual die made on the wafer can be controlled by either etching away unwanted groups of longer-wavelength QWs at the position of that die, or keeping them intact as will be discussed below. In one or more embodiments, wavelength-selective mirrors that increase down conversion efficiency may be selectively applied to the die where longer wavelength emission is desired. In one or more embodiments, the use of tunnel junction contacts facilitates integration of wavelength selective mirrors to external surfaces of the die and avoids problems of conductivity type conversion on etched p-GaN layers. The use of tunnel junction contacts further relaxes requirements on the conductivity type of the PL-emitting QW group(s) and allows them to be grown at the end of the epitaxy run minimizing the thermal load placed on said QWs by growing other layers of the LED structure.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In one or more embodiments, monolithically integrating LEDs of different colors in the same wafer provides advantages compared to a making displays in the conventional method using three wafers of different colors. In one or more embodiments, the number of separate epitaxy recipes which must be manufactured to produce source die for uLED displays is advantageously reduced compared to existing methods, reducing cost and complexity in the epi manufacturing stage. Existing methods require production of separate blue, green, and red recipes.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one or more embodiments, the number of pick and place operations required to populate a display is reduced, since arrays of pixels can be transferred together, instead of only one color type pixel at a time. Fewer pick and place operations will advantageously lead to cost and throughput improvements at the display assembly stage.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Some embodiments eliminate entirely the need for pick and place and instead allow whole wafer-level transfer of pixels onto a display since one wafer can contain all 3 required colors. The entire processed wafer or a large piece of it could be incorporated directly into the display.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one or more embodiments, because the color conversion layers are already built-in to the wafer during epitaxial growth, separate post-epitaxy processing steps to add color conversion materials are not required. Fundamental technical difficulties associated with (for example) accurately coating color-converting quantum dots into micron-sized spaces are, thus, avoided. Additionally, in one or more embodiments, the efficiency of green or red-emitting LEDs can potentially be higher than that of conventional LEDs of the same color, particularly for high drive current densities.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one or more embodiments, the growth of only one tunnel junction and one p-GaN layer to produce three colors is required. Accordingly, the epitaxial growth is less complex versus other epitaxial growth methods utilizing tunnel junctions to produce LEDs of different colors on the same wafer.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The embodiments of the disclosure are described by way of the Figures, which illustrate devices (e.g. transistors) and processes for forming devices in accordance with one or more embodiments of the disclosure.

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a LED device <b>100</b> is manufactured containing two or more groups of quantum wells of different emission wavelengths in the same wafer. In one or more embodiments, a first group of quantum wells (with shortest emission wavelength) is located between a p-type layer and a first n-type layer which forms a p-n junction with the p-type layer. In one or more embodiments, a tunnel junction connects the p-layer of the p-n junction with a second n-type layer at a different position in the epitaxy stack versus the first n-type layer. In one or more embodiments, second and third groups of quantum wells with longer emission wavelengths are located within the second n-type layer placed between them and the p-n junction. In one or more embodiments, a tunnel junction connects the p-layer of the p-n junction with the second n-type layer.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In one or more embodiments, the first part of the epitaxy involves the growth of a nucleation layer <b>122</b>, a defect reduction layer <b>120</b>, and an n-type layer <b>118</b> and may be the same as in a conventional LED growth run using a sapphire or other applicable growth substrate <b>102</b>.

In one or more embodiments, the substrate <b>102</b> comprises one or more of sapphire, silicon carbide, silica (Si), quartz, magnesium oxide (MgO), zinc oxide (ZnO), spinel, and the like. In one or more embodiments, the substrate <b>102</b> is a transparent substrate. In specific embodiments, the substrate <b>102</b> comprises sapphire. In one or more embodiments, the substrate <b>102</b> is not patterned prior to formation of the LEDs. Thus, in some embodiments, the substrate is <b>102</b> not patterned and can be considered to be flat or substantially flat. In other embodiments, the substrate <b>102</b> is a patterned substrate.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In one or more embodiments, the n-type layer <b>118</b> may comprise any Group III-V semiconductors, including binary, ternary, and quaternary alloys of gallium (Ga), aluminum (Al), indium (In), and nitrogen (N), also referred to as III-nitride materials. Thus, in some embodiments, the n-type layer <b>118</b> comprises one or more of gallium nitride (GaN), aluminum nitride (AlN), indium nitride (InN), gallium aluminum nitride (GaAlN), gallium indium nitride (GaInN), aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN), aluminum indium nitride (AlInN), indium gallium nitride (InGaN), indium aluminum nitride (InAlN), and the like. In a specific embodiment, the n-type layer <b>118</b> comprises gallium nitride (GaN). In one or more embodiments, the n-type layer <b>118</b> is doped with n-type dopants, such as silicon (Si) or germanium (Ge). The n-type layer <b>118</b> may have a dopant concentration significant enough to carry an electric current laterally through the layer.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In one or more embodiments, the layers of III-nitride material which form the first LED, the second LED and the third LED are deposited by one or more of sputter deposition, atomic layer deposition (ALD), metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD), and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">&#x201c;Sputter deposition&#x201d; as used herein refers to a physical vapor deposition (PVD) method of thin film deposition by sputtering. In sputter deposition, a material, e.g. a III-nitride, is ejected from a target that is a source onto a substrate. The technique is based on ion bombardment of a source material, the target. Ion bombardment results in a vapor due to a purely physical process, i.e., the sputtering of the target material.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">As used according to some embodiments herein, &#x201c;atomic layer deposition&#x201d; (ALD) or &#x201c;cyclical deposition&#x201d; refers to a vapor phase technique used to deposit thin films on a substrate surface. The process of ALD involves the surface of a substrate, or a portion of substrate, being exposed to alternating precursors, i.e. two or more reactive compounds, to deposit a layer of material on the substrate surface. When the substrate is exposed to the alternating precursors, the precursors are introduced sequentially or simultaneously. The precursors are introduced into a reaction zone of a processing chamber, and the substrate, or portion of the substrate, is exposed separately to the precursors.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">As used herein according to some embodiments, &#x201c;chemical vapor deposition&#x201d; refers to a process in which films of materials are deposited from the vapor phase by decomposition of chemicals on a substrate surface. In CVD, a substrate surface is exposed to precursors and/or co-reagents simultaneous or substantially simultaneously. A particular subset of CVD processes commonly used in LED manufacturing use metalorganic precursor chemical and are referred to as MOCVD or metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE). As used herein, &#x201c;substantially simultaneously&#x201d; refers to either co-flow or where there is overlap for a majority of exposures of the precursors.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">As used herein according to some embodiments, &#x201c;plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD)&#x201d; refers to a technique for depositing thin films on a substrate. In some examples of PEALD processes relative to thermal ALD processes, a material may be formed from the same chemical precursors, but at a higher deposition rate and a lower temperature. In a PEALD process, in general, a reactant gas and a reactant plasma are sequentially introduced into a process chamber having a substrate in the chamber. The first reactant gas is pulsed in the process chamber and is adsorbed onto the substrate surface. Thereafter, the reactant plasma is pulsed into the process chamber and reacts with the first reactant gas to form a deposition material, e.g. a thin film on a substrate. Similarly to a thermal ALD process, a purge step may be conducted between the deliveries of each of the reactants.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">As used herein according to one or more embodiments, &#x201c;plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD)&#x201d; refers to a technique for depositing thin films on a substrate. In a PECVD process, a source material, which is in gas or liquid phase, such as a gas-phase III-nitride material or a vapor of a liquid-phase III-nitride material that have been entrained in a carrier gas, is introduced into a PECVD chamber. A plasma-initiated gas is also introduced into the chamber. The creation of plasma in the chamber creates excited radicals. The excited radicals are chemically bound to the surface of a substrate positioned in the chamber, forming the desired film thereon.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In one or more embodiments, a LED device <b>100</b> is manufactured by placing the substrate <b>102</b> in a metalorganic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE) reactor so that the LED device layers are grown epitaxially.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In one or more embodiments, a nucleation layer <b>122</b> is formed on the substrate <b>102</b> prior to the defect reduction layer <b>120</b>.
