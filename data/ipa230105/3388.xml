id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a flame control device of the type generally used for igniting and/or detecting a flame on a burner, in particular a gas fireplace.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNOLOGICAL BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The device according to the invention is particularly, although not exclusively, applied in the field of flame circuits, i.e., of the electronics usually used for controlling combustion in gas burners, in particular fireplaces. Controlling the opening/closing of gas delivery valves, generating the ignition spark, detecting the flame are examples of operations performed by such a type of circuits.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Flame circuits are generally supplied by the network voltage by means of specific AC/DC converters. In case of the absence of voltage, the burner is not capable of operating. To overcome this drawback, it is known to use common or rechargeable battery systems capable of buffering the temporary absence of network voltage.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The main drawback of said systems is the decreased autonomy and the need to replace the batteries once they are depleted.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">On the other hand, very efficient devices are available today, referred to as USB power banks, i.e., buffer batteries which can be interfaced through a USB port, conventionally used to supply smartphones and other portable devices when the main battery is depleted or being depleted.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">These devices have the feature of delivering power to the assisted device only as long as an absorption exceeding an expected value is detected. The delivery of power is interrupted below such a threshold, and a power save mode which can only be manually reset is activated.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For these reasons, USB power banks on the market are not adapted to supplying low consumption devices such as flame circuits because they do not have sufficient absorption to activate the power bank and avoid the power save mode, with subsequent switching OFF.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is a remedy for using these devices in low absorption systems to add a constant/passive load (bleeder) to simulate the minimum load required by the external backup device. On the other hand, this results in a useless expenditure of energy which limits the autonomy of the device.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is the object of the present invention to provide a flame control device for burners, in particular fireplaces, which is also capable of operating in the absence of a power grid in an efficient and practical manner.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention achieves the object with a flame control device for managing the operation of a gas burner apparatus, comprising:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0011">an input prepared to receive a supply signal,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0012">an output intended to be connected to said gas burner apparatus,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0013">a control unit connected to said input to be supplied by the supply signal and to said output to control the operation of said burner by means of at least one output signal,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0014">a load configured to be controlled by the control unit so as to absorb power in a varying manner over time when said input is supplied by the supply signal.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0012" num="0015">By virtue of this, the device can be supplied by means of a USB power bank, or in any case with any buffer device capable of delivering energy only when a given absorption threshold is exceeded without significantly increasing the energy consumption, and therefore, the autonomy of the device itself. Indeed, by acting on the load, i.e., providing a sort of intelligent bleeder, intermittent extra-absorption peaks sufficient to simulate the minimum load required by the backup device can be ensured so that the latter does not interrupt the delivery even if the average consumption is considerably lower than the permanent load one.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0016">According to an advantageous improvement including the use of a voltage measurement circuit connected to the device input, it is then possible to activate the extra consumption only when an input supply voltage is detected in the range provided by the USB standard so that a decreased consumption for the operation in combination with normal batteries or a network power supply can be at least partially preserved.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0017">Thereby, the flame control device can be supplied by means of a simple USB port connected to any device capable of delivering a voltage which falls within the operating specifications of the electronic components of the flame control device circuits.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0018">Further features are defined in the sub-claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0019">The features and further advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of preferred, although not exclusive, embodiments thereof, which are described, by way of indicative and non-limiting example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0017" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a block diagram of a flame control device according to an embodiment of the invention.

The device in the drawing is shown interfaced with the burner, indicated by numeral <b>3</b>, and a supply device, indicated by numeral <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0026">By virtue of the use of a control logic <b>301</b>, conventionally implemented by a microprocessor or microcontroller control unit, device <b>1</b> generates the signals <b>101</b> for operating various devices commonly present in burners, such as for example those intended to open/close gas delivery valves <b>102</b>, generate the ignition spark <b>202</b>, and detect the flame <b>302</b>, which are shown in the drawing.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0027">The generation of the supply voltage <b>201</b> in conventional flame control devices is conventionally entrusted to dedicated external power supplies, possibly buffered with batteries or backup cells to obviate any network absence.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0028">By virtue of the contrivances implemented in the present invention, supplying the flame control device <b>1</b> can be indistinctly entrusted to dedicated power supplies, with or without buffer batteries, as well as to devices referred to as power banks, i.e., electronic backup devices capable of delivering current when the absorptions exceed a given minimum threshold.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0029">For this purpose, in order to better take advantage of the devices available on the market; in a particularly advantageous embodiment, device <b>1</b> includes using a USB connector <b>4</b> by means of which to receive the supply signal.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0030">Thereby; the supply can be provided by any type of USB power supply such as, for example those commonly used for supplying smartphones, including power banks.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0031">To allow the operation of device <b>1</b> with a power bank, the invention includes using a load controlled by the control unit <b>301</b> so that it absorbs power in a varying manner over time. Thereby, the power bank detects a sufficient load to allow the activation thereof while ensuring a low consumption and therefore an increased operating autonomy.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0032">Such a modulation of the absorbed power can advantageously be provided by alternately activating/deactivating a load <b>401</b> consisting of a fixed impedance, for example provided by a battery of parallel resistors, by means of a switch device <b>501</b> based on a control signal generated by the control unit <b>301</b>, for example a rectangular wave signal with predetermined duty cycle.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0033">In the specific configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, load <b>401</b> and the switch device <b>501</b> are arranged in series between input <b>201</b> and ground with the switch device <b>501</b> which is operable to be opened/closed by the control unit <b>301</b> so as to prevent/allow the passage of current between input and ground through load <b>401</b> when input <b>201</b> is supplied by the supply signal.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0034">The control unit can thus cause the average value of the input impedance of the device to be greater than or equal to a predetermined value, ensuring that any possible supply by means of a power bank or similar operating threshold device is capable of operating.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0035">The switch device <b>501</b> conventionally is a transistor, a preferably a Mosfet. In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, it is an N-channel Mosfet, having the Gate terminal connected to the control unit <b>301</b> so that the control signal <b>601</b> is applied to the Gate terminal. The Drain terminal is connected to a terminal of load <b>401</b>, while the Source terminal is set to ground.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0036">Connecting the other terminal of load <b>401</b> to input <b>4</b>, when the input signal <b>201</b> supplies load <b>401</b> and the control signal <b>601</b> (in the present description also referred to as Bleeder_Enable) takes the high voltage level, voltage V<sub>GS </sub>between the Gate and Source terminals is greater than the threshold voltage V<sub>T </sub>of transistor <b>501</b>, and a current passage I<sub>D </sub>is obtained between the Drain terminal and the Source terminal and therefore, between input <b>201</b> and ground.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0037">Thereby, by varying the duration of the high signal with respect to that of the low signal, i.e., the signal duty cycle, an absorption can be set having a lower average value than a simple passive bleeder circuit, i.e., consisting of only resistors.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0038">The table below shows an example of the absorptions which can be obtained with a load control cycle when the Bleeder_Enable signal <b>601</b> takes a high level (ON) and a low level (OFF), with the times indicated.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="91pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="84pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Bleeder_Enable</entry><entry>Period (s)</entry><entry>Current (mA)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="91pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="84pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>ON</entry><entry>0.36</entry><entry>180</entry></row><row><entry>OFF</entry><entry>4.98</entry><entry>1</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0037" num="0039">Obviously, multiple variants are possible. Indeed, the switch device <b>501</b> can be provided to be indifferently placed upstream or downstream of the load and to consist of any combination of passive components, whether they are in series or in parallel. It may also be provided for only one part of the load to be controlled by the switch device, while the remaining part be fixed, as in the case of splitter <b>701</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0040">Another possibility may be given by using active commercial loads or more complex circuit configurations capable of ensuring the presence of extra currents while keeping low average absorptions.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0041">Thereby, possible backup devices of the power bank type, USB in particular, can be used to supply the flame control device according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0042">Since it may be advantageous to connect the device to network supply sources or buffer batteries or cells in addition to the power bank, the invention optionally includes using a circuit capable of detecting the type of supply connected to the device and correspondingly deactivating the active load when it is not associable with a power bank.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0043">For this purpose, an embodiment of the invention includes using a voltage measurement circuit <b>801</b> connected to input <b>4</b> and to the control unit <b>301</b>. The control unit <b>301</b> is configured to detect the supply signal voltage value at the input <b>4</b> by means of the voltage measurement circuit <b>801</b> so as to deactivate the load <b>401</b> if the voltage value of the detected supply signal falls within a typical range of power supplies or buffer batteries/cells.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0044">The simplest measurement circuit is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, i.e., a voltage splitter <b>801</b> with intermediate socket connected to an input <b>901</b> of the control unit provided with an analogue to digital converter. If the control unit has no converters therein, an external converter or other component or dedicated circuit can easily be used for the purpose based on the knowledge of those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0045">By measuring the input voltage, the control unit <b>301</b> is capable of detecting the supply source type and consistently operating on the active load. An example of the steps carried out by the control logic is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The control unit measures the input voltage and verifies whether it is, for example, in the conventional operating range of USB devices, 4.5 V-5.5 V. If the voltage falls outside this range, the supply comes from a power supply or a cell/battery whereby there is no need to activate the active load. Therefore, the Bleeder_Enable signal <b>601</b> is set to low level (left side of the flow diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) and the switch device <b>501</b> remains open, thus preventing the circulation of current from the supply to ground through load <b>401</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0046">If the measured voltage fails instead within the identified range, the flow on the right of the drawing is performed, i.e., a square wave Bleeder_Enable signal <b>601</b> is generated, introducing idle standby cycles between a Bleeder_Enable ON and Bleeder_Enable OFF command. In the example shown in the drawing, such cycles correspond to 0.36 ms and 4.98 ms, respectively, as seen above. Obviously, other values, i.e., different duty cycles, can be set according to the average current value to be obtained on the active load.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a circuit diagram which includes both the active load <b>401</b>, <b>501</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and the input voltage measurer <b>801</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Obviously, the input voltage measurer circuit <b>801</b> is completely optional and can be omitted from the diagram.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0048">A USB connector <b>4</b>, for example of the micro type, completes the circuit and can be used to directly interface the device according to the invention with a USB source. This may be a power supply <b>103</b> connected to the power grid <b>203</b>, a power bank <b>303</b> or a cell pack or batteries <b>403</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. These components can be interchangeable or co-exist in the same supply device <b>3</b>. For example, the power bank <b>303</b> can be connected to both the power supply <b>103</b> and the output USB port <b>503</b> so as to operate in the absence of a network voltage and simultaneously be recharged when instead there is such a voltage.
