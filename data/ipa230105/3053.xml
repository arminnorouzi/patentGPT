See, for example, U.S. Patent Application No. 2019/0368234 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,893,283; 9,679,429; and 9,495,820 all incorporated herein by this reference. Many such locks are activated via a Bluetooth signal transmitted to the lock from a smart device.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Some cyclists prefer flexible cable locks instead of the rigid hoop style described in published application No. 2019/0368234. On the other hand, known flexible cable locks can be easier to defeat by cutting the cable.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For any electronic lock, the design of the antenna and access to it for the RF signal are design considerations. Adding a port in the lock body for the RF signal to reach the antenna results in an access point for tools or the like which can be used in an effort to defeat the lock.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The size and weight of the lock also increases when the lock is electronically controlled. A battery, a motor, an RF receiver, a controller, and the like are required.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Finally, power management is a concern especially when power is used to both unlock and lock the lock.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Featured in one specific design is a flexible cable electronic lock with a difficult to defeat cable and a spherical lock body which is also difficult to defeat. The lock body has no RF signal port. The lock is made smaller and lighter due to a unique configuration of the mechanism(s) which engages the lock shackle and the retainer which locks the shackle in the lock body. Power is conserved because power is only required to unlock the lock when the retainer is driven for a short time to release the shackle from the lock body. And, the retainer is itself a component of a small solenoid rendering the lock body compact. Also, power for the solenoid is provided by a unique boosting circuit in the lock body.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Featured is a cable lock comprising a cable, a shackle pin connected to one end of the cable, and a lock body connected to another end of the cable. The lock body preferably includes a channel for the shackle pin, at least one lock member adjacent the channel pivotable from an open position disengaged from the shackle pin to a closed position engaging the shackle pin, and a retainer associated with a lock member driven from a released position disengaged from the lock member to an engaged position retaining the lock member in the closed position.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one preferred example, an electronically driven linear actuator, such as a solenoid, drives the retainer to the released position. The linear actuator may include a winding about the retainer. The linear actuator may further include a first spring biasing the retainer in the engaged position. A second spring preferably biases the lock member in the open position and a third spring in the channel biases the shackle pin outwards from the channel.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one example, the lock member includes a striker face which engages the shackle pin to pivot the lock member to the closed position, the shackle pin includes a ledge and the lock member includes a tab seated on the ledge when the lock member is in the closed position. The retainer is in the form of a shaft and the lock member includes a recess receiving the shaft therein when the shaft engages the lock member in its closed position. The recess is aligned with the shaft when the lock member is in the closed position and the recess is not aligned with the shaft when the lock member is in the open position.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the majority of the lock body includes curved surfaces. The lock may further include a power supply for the linear actuator controlled via signal from a receiver in the lock body. In one example, the receiver is a Bluetooth receiver. The power supply may include a battery charging one or more capacitors. The battery is charged via a charging circuit. A circuit is configured to supply a voltage from the one or more capacitors to the linear actuator in response to an unlock signal received by the receiver.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one preferred example, there is an antenna for the receiver, for example, the cable serves as the antenna and includes a wire rope surrounded by a sheath itself surrounded by interlocking metal beads. The sheath can be made of Kevlar&#xae;.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Also featured, is a lock comprising a shackle and a lock body receiving the shackle therein and including at least one lock member driven by the shackle to a first position engaging the shackle and biased to a second position disengaged from the shackle, and a retainer associated with a lock member biased to a first position engaging the lock member and driven to a second position disengaged from the lock member</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Also featured is a method of operating a lock, the method comprising locking the lock by urging a shackle into a lock body closing a lock member to engage the shackle and moving a retainer to engage with the lock member and unlocking the lock by disengaging the retainer from the lock member, an opening the lock member to disengage from the shackle and urging the shackle out of the lock body. Preferably, power is consumed only to disengage the retainer from the lock member and spring forces are used to engage the retainer with the lock member, and to open the lock member, and to urge the shackle out of the lock body.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The subject invention, however, in other embodiments, need not achieve all these objectives and the claims hereof should not be limited to structures or methods capable of achieving these objectives.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Other objects, features and advantages will occur to those skilled in the art from the following description of a preferred embodiment and the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-C</figref> are schematic three-dimensional views showing an example of a new electronic cable lock;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view showing the lock of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in its unlocked position;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view showing the lock of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in its locked configuration;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic view showing a spring biasing the two locking members into an open position;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is another cross-sectional view showing the lock in its unlocked position;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view showing the lock in its locked configuration;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic view showing the carrier assembly within the lock body;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>10</b></figref> are additional schematic views of the carrier assembly; and</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>I</figref> is a block diagram showing the primary components associated with the electronic subsystem(s) of a preferred version of the lock.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Aside from the preferred embodiment or embodiments disclosed below, this invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or being carried out in various ways.

Cable <b>12</b> is preferably constructed according to U.S. Pat. No. 7,055,656 incorporated herein by this reference and it is fairly difficult to defeat due to the use of interlocking metal bead members <b>13</b> about internal metal wire rope <b>24</b>. Interlocking beads <b>13</b> (e.g., steel) are difficult to cut and tools cannot be jammed between them. An insulating protective sheath <b>15</b> may be disposed between the bead members <b>13</b> and the internal wire <b>24</b>. Insulating flexible sheath <b>15</b> may be made of a protective material such as Kevlar&#xae;. Sheath <b>15</b> is flexible and thus is difficult to cut. Lock body <b>14</b> itself is approximately spherical in construction with no or few easily gripped surfaces as shown and includes a metal shell <b>17</b> with only a single small access <b>19</b> for USB charge port <b>23</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) receiving a USB charging cable in order to charge the internal battery <b>21</b>. The mostly spherical shape of the lock body makes it difficult to grasp with a cutter or gripper tool and difficult to cut or damage. Egg or other shapes can be employed such that the majority of the lock body includes curved surfaces and/or is devoid or mostly devoid of easily gripped corners or surfaces. The lock body may include two halves press fit together and retained via a blind dowel pin. Protective (e.g., silicone) sheath <b>17</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, may be disposed about the interlocking beads to protect the bicycle. Lock body <b>19</b> may also include a protective coating such as silicone.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Shackle pin <b>20</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> is fixed to one end of cable <b>12</b> and lock body <b>14</b> is fixed to the other end of cable <b>12</b>. Shackle pin <b>20</b> may be fixed relative to member <b>22</b> which is secured to interior wire rope <b>24</b> of cable <b>12</b>. Lock body <b>14</b> includes cable end <b>26</b> fixed therein. Channel <b>30</b> extends into spherical lock body <b>14</b> receiving shackle pin <b>20</b> therein. Further included are means for retaining the shackle pin <b>20</b> within channel <b>30</b>. In one example, such means includes, inter alia, one or more lock bodies and an associated retainer. For example, lock members <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>are disposed adjacent channel <b>30</b> and pivot about posts <b>34</b><i>a</i>, <b>34</b><i>b</i>, respectively, between an open (unlocked) position, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> disengaged from shackle pin <b>20</b> and a closed (locked) position, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> engaging the shackle pin. A retainer, here in the form of steel shaft <b>36</b>, is driven from a released (unlocked) position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) disengaged from the lock members <b>32</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>b </i>to an engaged (locked) position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) retaining the lock members <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>in their closed position. Spring <b>40</b> in channel <b>30</b> biases shackle pin <b>20</b> out of the channel. When the shackle pin is placed in channel <b>30</b> and the biasing force of spring <b>40</b> is overcome, shackle pin <b>20</b> truncated cone striker end <b>42</b> meshes with striker faces <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>b </i>of locking members <b>32</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>b </i>and a further downward force applied to shackle pin <b>20</b> pivots lock members <b>32</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>b </i>inwards whereupon tabs <b>48</b><i>a</i>, <b>48</b><i>b </i>of locking members <b>32</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>b </i>seat on ledges <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b </i>of shackle pin <b>20</b>. Then, a spring drives shaft <b>36</b> through recess <b>52</b> between locking members <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b</i>. In this position, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, pin <b>36</b> functions to keep the locking members from rotating outward to the positions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">When pin <b>36</b> is retracted, spring <b>54</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> connected to both lock members <b>32</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>b </i>and to structure within the lock body drives lock members <b>32</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>b </i>to their outwardly rotated position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) releasing shackle pin <b>20</b> from the lock body <b>14</b>.

Battery <b>21</b>, in turn, charges the one or more capacitors <b>100</b> via charging circuit <b>156</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A receiver coupled to antenna <b>160</b> (or a transceiver for two-way communications) receives, typically via the Bluetooth standard, a communication from a smart device (e.g., a cell phone with the appropriate application loaded thereon) a signal to unlock the lock. Controller <b>162</b> receives and processes this signal and activates switching circuitry <b>164</b> which allows the capacitors <b>100</b> to discharge their power to solenoid <b>60</b>. A short high voltage pulse is all that is required. The windings of the solenoid then drive the shaft out of engagement with the locking members as described previously and the lock is unlocked. One preferred antenna structure is also previously described.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Bi-directional communications may be useful for authentication, battery power indications, unlock and lock times and date data, GPS location data, and the like.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Although specific features of the invention are shown in some drawings and not in others, this is for convenience only as each feature may be combined with any or all of the other features in accordance with the invention.
