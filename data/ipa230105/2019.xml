No. 63/217,215 filed Jun. 30, 2021, the disclosures of which is incorporated by reference.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">This present disclosure relates to aluminum pontoons, namely the front or nose cone portion. To date, manufacturing of nose cone components has been a manual task. The geometry of the nose cone has a curved leading edge which transitions to a circle. The circular portion is where the nose cone is welded to the rest of the pontoon. For the first step in the manual process, the user takes a piece of sheet metal that is cut to a specific shape and rolls it to begin shaping it. The user then works it around a form to join edges. Joining the edges requires the user to manually adjust and fit the edges, along with forming and shaping the metal to fit. This step is time-consuming and requires skill. The edges are then welded together, making a complete nose cone assembly. Subsequently, the nose cone assembly is welded to a pontoon. Manual forming can create distortion, warping, or irregularity, which must be corrected before the nose cone is welded to the pontoon. The manual steps generate a significant amount of variation between nose cones, which creates alignment and quality issues when mating the nose cone to the rest of the pontoon. Further, with the increased power in pontoon boats, thicker gauge material is needed for strength. Forming this thicker material is outside of the strength of some users and could cause repetitive motion injuries in others. An improved method of manufacturing is needed.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure describes an automated process for shaping, forming, and welding nose cone assemblies. First, the user takes a blank and places it between rollers to form it to a rolled blank. Second, the user takes the rolled blank and places it onto a support form and aligns it using notches cut into the blank that mate to alignment pins on the machine. The machine has a mandrel, strap clamps, and pad clamps. The strap clamps have a strap that is held at the ends and the pad clamps have pads that are pivotable. The strap clamps and pad clamps are movable between an unclamped position and a clamped position, which move with actuators. The actuators are in communication with a control system that moves them to predetermined/programmed positions. In the clamped position, the rolled blank is held against the mandrel with one of the edges in contact. Next, the robotic welder begins welding the contacting edges of the rolled blank. The clamps may move during welding to provide clearance for the welder. At the end of the welding, the clamps return to their unclamped positions and the completed assembly is removed.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a front isometric view of the nose cone forming machine;</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a left side view of the machine in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a top view of the machine in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a rear view of the machine in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an isometric section view <b>5</b>-<b>5</b> of the machine in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> without the mandrel shown;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a top view of a cut blank;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is an isometric view of a plurality of rolled blanks;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is an isometric view of a rolled blank located on the machine and clamped by a locator bar;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is an isometric view of the machine in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> at the beginning of the clamping process;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is an isometric view of the machine in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> with the rolled blank fully clamped;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is an isometric view of the machine in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> during the welding process;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is an isometric view of the mandrel;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a side section view <b>13</b>-<b>13</b> of the machine in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is an isometric view of a rear clamping assembly; and</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is an isometric view of a front clamping assembly.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The nose cone forming machine <b>10</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and has several main components. The machine <b>10</b> consists of a base frame <b>12</b> in which a plurality of forming and clamping devices are attached. The machine <b>10</b> has an interchangeable mandrel <b>20</b> (skeleton) made to the internal shape of the pontoon size and brand. The machine <b>10</b> has a locator bar <b>22</b> under the mandrel <b>20</b> that rises to the mandrel <b>20</b> to act as a holding clamp. An additional riser frame <b>24</b> is affixed to the base frame <b>12</b> or integrated therewith. The riser frame <b>24</b> supports the forming mandrel <b>20</b> and also acts as a mounting surface for a robotic welder <b>26</b>. The machine <b>10</b> is designed to take a partially rolled aluminum blank <b>100</b> and form the blank around the mandrel <b>20</b> using hydraulic cylinders. The machine <b>10</b> is capable of handling different sizes of nose cones utilizing tooling that can be changed to accommodate the different sizes. With the exception of the robotic welder <b>26</b>, the machine <b>10</b> is symmetrical about a plane of symmetry <b>138</b> that extends through the mandrel <b>20</b> and locator bar <b>22</b>. Section views in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>13</b></figref> are taken through the plane of symmetry <b>138</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Turning now to the details of the machine <b>10</b>, the base frame <b>12</b> as shown has three clamping and forming sections, a rear band clamp pair <b>30</b>, a center band clamp pair <b>50</b>, and a front clamp pair <b>70</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the rear band clamp pair <b>30</b> is located closest to the riser frame <b>24</b> and where the mandrel <b>20</b> is attached. The rear band clamp pair <b>30</b> has a first side <b>32</b> and a second side <b>34</b>. The details of the first side <b>32</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, with the second side <b>34</b> having a similar structure. The first side <b>32</b> has a lower frame member <b>43</b> that is affixed to the base frame <b>12</b> and holds the pivot <b>40</b> and one end of the actuator <b>44</b>. The other end of the actuator <b>44</b> is connected to the strap holder <b>45</b>. The strap holder <b>45</b> holds a strap <b>36</b> that is fixed at one end and can be adjusted on the opposite end. The lower frame member <b>43</b> is perpendicular to a strap pivot axis <b>41</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the strap pivot axis <b>41</b> is at an oblique angle with respect to the plane of symmetry <b>138</b>. The second side <b>34</b> is at a mirrored position with respect to the first side <b>32</b>. As with the first side <b>32</b>, the second side <b>34</b> pivots about an axis that is obliquely angled with respect to the plane of symmetry <b>138</b>. The strap holder <b>45</b> pivots about the strap pivot axis <b>41</b> when the actuator <b>44</b> moves. Each side <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> has its own strap <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, which is a flexible material that resists stretching under tension. The straps <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> are secured on the ends and can be adjusted. Each side <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> has a corresponding pivot <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and an actuator <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>. The actuators <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> are shown as hydraulic cylinders, but other devices are contemplated, such as air, electric, or other mechanical controls. The actuators <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> are movable between a retracted position and an extended position that correspond with an unclamped position and clamped position of the first and second sides <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. In the retracted position, the straps <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> are slack and in the extended position, the sides <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> are in the clamped position with the straps tight against the blank <b>100</b>. In the clamped position, there may be a gap between the sides which allows clearance for the welder <b>26</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the first side <b>32</b> and second side <b>34</b> are at an angle with respect to each other and the mandrel <b>20</b>. This is to provide clamping of the blank <b>100</b> that keeps the strap parallel to the outside surface of the blank <b>100</b> as it is clamped around the mandrel <b>20</b>. The center band clamp pair <b>50</b> is similarly structured to the rear band clamp pair <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the center band clamp pair <b>50</b> is located adjacent the rear band clamp pair <b>30</b> and shares the same features. The center band clamp pair <b>50</b> has a first side <b>52</b> and a second side <b>54</b>. Each side <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> has a corresponding strap <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>. Each side <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> has a corresponding pivot <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> and an actuator <b>64</b>, <b>66</b>. The actuators <b>64</b>, <b>66</b> are shown as hydraulic cylinders, but other devices are contemplated, such as air, electric, or other mechanical controls. The actuators <b>64</b>, <b>66</b> are movable between a retracted position and an extended position that correspond with an unclamped position and clamped position of the first and second sides <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>. In the retracted position, the straps <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> are slack and in the extended position, the sides <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> are in the clamped position with the straps tight against the blank <b>100</b>. As with the rear band clamp pair <b>30</b>, the first side <b>52</b> and second side <b>54</b> are at an oblique angle with respect to each other and the mandrel <b>20</b>. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. As with the rear band clamp pair <b>30</b>, the first and second sides <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> are mirrored about the plane of symmetry <b>138</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The front clamp <b>70</b> is made up of a first side <b>72</b> and a second side <b>74</b>. The second side <b>74</b> is a mirror image of the first side <b>72</b> and shares the same components. The first side <b>72</b>, shown individually in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, has a lower frame member <b>82</b> that is affixed to the base frame <b>12</b> and holds the pivots <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> and one end and the actuator <b>94</b>. The other end of the actuator <b>94</b> is connected to a pad holder <b>84</b> that holds a plurality of pressure pads <b>76</b>, <b>78</b>, <b>80</b>. The pad holder <b>84</b> pivots about a pad pivot axis <b>87</b>, which is perpendicular to the lower frame member <b>82</b>. The pad pivot axis <b>87</b> is obliquely angled with respect to the plane of symmetry <b>138</b>. In addition, due to the desired shape of the completed nose cone assembly, the pad pivot axis <b>87</b> is obliquely angled with respect to strap pivot axis <b>41</b>. The lower frame member <b>82</b> allows the first side <b>72</b> to be easily positioned with respect to the frame and mandrel <b>20</b> while keeping the pivots, actuator, and pad holder in alignment. The pressure pads are attached to the pad holder <b>84</b> by mechanisms that allow each of the pressure pads to independently pivot or swivel. In the embodiment shown herein, the pressure pads are attached to the pad holder <b>84</b> through a ball joint connection. The spherical pivoting or swiveling connection of the pressure pad to the pad holder <b>84</b> allows it to make positive contact with the blank <b>100</b> and remain in flat contact with it as the side is being clamped. This prevents dents or distortion. It is contemplated that the pressure pads are fixed with respect to the first side <b>72</b>. As previously described, the second side <b>74</b> is a mirror image of the first side with pressure pads and pivots. The first and second sides <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> move between a clamped position and an unclamped position using actuators <b>94</b>, <b>96</b>. The actuators <b>94</b>, <b>96</b> are position-based and are moved to programmed positions, but it is contemplated that open-loop movement of the actuators is possible and mechanical stops are used to control the clamped and unclamped positions. It is further contemplated that the pressure pads may be a continuous structure or the number of pads would be different than what is shown in the FIGS. The pressure pads are individually adjustable to conform the rolled blank <b>110</b> to the final shape of the nose cone when the front clamp <b>70</b> is in the clamped position.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The actuators and robot are connected to a control system that executes a program to monitor sensors and control the position of the robot and various actuators. The actuators <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>64</b>, <b>66</b>, <b>94</b>, <b>96</b> include position feedback that is communicated to the control system. Optionally the actuators that move the locator bar <b>22</b> include sensors that are in communication with the control system. An optional edge tracking device is attached to the robotic welder <b>26</b> adjacent the weld head <b>28</b> to provide position information of a seam to the control system and/or robotic welder. In addition to the position feedback, the actuators may also provide force or pressure feedback to the control system. Actuators that move the locator bar <b>22</b> are also in communication with and controlled by the control system.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As previously described, the mandrel <b>20</b> is affixed to the riser frame <b>24</b>, but it is contemplated that it is affixed to a different portion of the machine, such as the base frame <b>12</b>. Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref>, the mandrel <b>20</b> is a support and shaping structure that cooperates with the band clamps <b>30</b>, <b>50</b> and front clamp <b>70</b> to shape a rolled blank <b>110</b> into a completed nose cone assembly. The mandrel <b>20</b> is a rigid skeleton structure formed from plates and wire. It is sized to cooperate with the rolled blank <b>110</b> so that half of a front edge <b>106</b> meets the other half of the front edge <b>106</b> when clamped, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>10</b></figref>. The mandrel <b>20</b> has a bottom spine <b>140</b> that cooperates with the locator bar <b>22</b> to trap the rolled blank <b>110</b> and center it. The locator bar <b>22</b> is movable between a released position, where it is spaced from the mandrel <b>20</b>, and a trapped position where it is moved close to the mandrel <b>20</b> and presses the rolled blank <b>110</b> against the bottom spine <b>140</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the locator bar <b>22</b> is shown in the trapped position. The mandrel <b>20</b> may also include a sliding surface <b>142</b> and a stop <b>146</b>. The sliding surface <b>142</b> allows the edges of the rolled blank <b>110</b> to slide as it is being clamped without catching. The stop <b>146</b> prevents overlapping of the front edges <b>106</b> as the rolled blank <b>110</b> is being clamped.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown, the robotic welder <b>26</b> has a welding head <b>28</b> that is used to join the front edge <b>106</b>. The robotic welder <b>26</b> may include a seam tracking device (not shown) for communicating to a control system and tracking where the front edges <b>106</b> meet. The seam tracking device (if included) is used for closed-loop position control of the welding head <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The blank <b>100</b> starts out as a cut shape out of flat material (typically a sheet of aluminum) with a profile matching or similar to the shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. As shown, the blank <b>100</b> is mirror symmetrical and has a first locating notch <b>102</b> and a second locating notch <b>104</b>. The first locating notch <b>102</b> is centered on a rear edge <b>108</b> and the second locating notch <b>104</b> is centered on a front edge <b>106</b>. The blank <b>100</b> has a line of symmetry that intersects the midpoint of the front edge <b>106</b> and rear edge <b>108</b>. In addition, the notches <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> are located on the line of symmetry <b>112</b>. The notches <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> correspond to locating pins <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> on the locator bar <b>22</b>. When the blank <b>100</b> is placed on the locator bar <b>22</b>, the line of symmetry <b>112</b> aligns with the plane of symmetry <b>138</b>. The plane of symmetry is centered on the mandrel and is aligned with section line <b>13</b>-<b>13</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">To form a nose cone assembly, the rolled blank <b>110</b> that is pre-cut to a shape including two locating notches is placed on the centerline or line of symmetry <b>112</b> of the blank <b>100</b>. As previously described, one notch <b>104</b> is located on the nose and one notch <b>102</b> is located on the tail end of the blank. As cut, the cut blank <b>100</b> is a flat or planar component. Before being placed on the nose cone forming machine <b>10</b>, the cut blank <b>100</b> is rolled to be generally cylindrical, such as the rolled blanks <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. Rolling a flat component, such as the cut blank <b>100</b>, is accomplished through standard slip rolling or other tooling to give the cut blank <b>100</b> a curve.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The rolled blank <b>110</b> is placed on top of the locator bar <b>22</b> which registers and locates the blank <b>100</b> on two pins <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> engaging in the notches <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> in the blank. As shown, the curve of the rolled blank <b>110</b> faces up but it is contemplated that the mandrel <b>20</b> is inverted or at another orientation. In any event, the rolled blank <b>110</b> is placed so it partially surrounds the mandrel <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. It is contemplated that the notches align with features on the mandrel <b>20</b> instead of the pins <b>132</b>, <b>134</b>. Because the notches are located on the line of symmetry <b>112</b>, the pins <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> on the locator bar <b>22</b> center the rolled blank <b>110</b> on the mandrel <b>20</b>. This allows half of the front edge <b>106</b> to make contact with the other half of the front edge <b>106</b> when clamped. The locator bar <b>22</b> positions the rolled blank <b>110</b> with respect to the mandrel <b>20</b> and the control system moves the locator bar <b>22</b> to lift the rolled blank <b>110</b> until it contacts the bottom spine <b>140</b> on the mandrel <b>20</b>. The rear band clamp <b>30</b>, center band clamp <b>50</b>, and front clamp <b>70</b> are moved toward their clamped positions, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>11</b></figref>. The clamped positions of the clamps are predetermined and controlled by the control system. The control system can be programmed for the clamps to move in a sequence of positions, with some of the clamps moving partially towards their clamped position, and then moving to be fully clamped. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows the locator bar <b>22</b> in the position to trap the rolled blank <b>110</b> to the mandrel <b>20</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows the clamps <b>30</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>70</b> moving to the clamped position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows the front clamp <b>70</b> moving to the clamped position. As the clamps <b>30</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>70</b> move to the clamped position, the halves of the front edge <b>106</b> slide along the surfaces of the mandrel <b>20</b> and touch. Once the front edges <b>106</b> are touching, the robotic welder <b>26</b> initiates and makes a series of tack welds along a seam formed by the touching front edges <b>106</b>. At this time, the edge tracking device feeds information to the robotic welder <b>26</b> to adjust the position of the welding head <b>28</b> to ensure the weld is properly placed at the seam. The welder <b>26</b> then makes a continuous weld along the entire seam. The robot, the clamps, and the locator bar <b>22</b> retract. Optional push-off cylinders, located near or at the rear edge <b>108</b> and controlled by the control system, dislodge the completed nose cone from the mandrel <b>20</b>. The nose cone is then removed by the operator.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">It is understood that while certain aspects of the disclosed subject matter have been shown and described, the disclosed subject matter is not limited thereto and encompasses various other embodiments and aspects.
