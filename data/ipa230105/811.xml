Ibuprofen is currently the most widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) around the world. Ibuprofen has been clinically used as an anti-inflammatory and analgesic drug for nearly 30 years and is considered to be the safest and most effective one among many NSAIDs. Ibuprofen is an over-the-counter drug and a recommended first step drug of an analgesic ladder. Ibuprofen functions mainly by preventing cyclooxygenase from competing for a hydrogen atom of arachidonic acid so as to prevent the peroxidation of arachidonic acid and ultimately prevent the production of prostaglandins and blood coagulation factors.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">Ibuprofen has a short half-life and needs to be frequently administered to maintain a therapeutic concentration, causing some adverse reactions. For example, oral tablets of ibuprofen have the problems of a short half-life and low bioavailability in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, the oral tablets of ibuprofen need to be frequently administered for a long time, which increases side effects on the gastrointestinal tract and causes certain damages to the kidney. This limits the clinical application of ibuprofen.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">Ibuprofen contains a chiral carbon in structure. Commercially available ibuprofen is racemic ibuprofen which contains 50% levorotatory ibuprofen and 50% dextrorotatory ibuprofen (that is, S-ibuprofen). Studies show that levorotatory ibuprofen has weak anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic effects, dextrorotatory ibuprofen is 28 times stronger than levorotatory ibuprofen, and levorotatory ibuprofen may cause various adverse reactions such as gastrointestinal toxicity, water and sodium retention, decreased renal perfusion and allergic reactions.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">Studies show that S-ibuprofen has significantly better clinical effects (Adam et al., J. Pharm. Pharakol, 28, 257 and Jamali et al., Pharmac Res. 1988, 5, 44). Compared with a racemic mixture, an S-isomer can quickly reach a therapeutic concentration in the blood. Though racemic ibuprofen has been accepted as an anti-inflammatory and analgesic drug by a majority of patients, racemic ibuprofen, if frequently administered at a high dosage as an effective drug for the treatment of rheumatism and rheumatoid arthritis and other chronic diseases for a long time, will increase the side effects on the gastrointestinal tract and even cause gastrointestinal bleeding and cause certain damages to the kidney, which greatly limits its clinical application. Therefore, single chiral S-ibuprofen is worth studying.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">Currently, commercially available dexibuprofen includes only tablets, capsules, injections and suppositories. Oral preparations have the problems of uneven absorption, a strong first-pass effect, and low bioavailability. Dexibuprofen has a short half-life and needs to be frequently administered to maintain the therapeutic concentration, has poor patient compliance, and causes some adverse reactions. Currently, commercially available injections are administered intravenously and irritate injection sites intensely. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a novel dexibuprofen drug with improved and reduced toxic side effects, which is the inevitably demand for expanding the clinical application of the drug.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">Shanbhag et al. have described that the gastrointestinal irritation from NSAIDs containing carboxyl groups such as ibuprofen is mainly caused by the carboxyl groups on molecules. A prodrug prepared from ibuprofen can improve patient compliance [J Pharmaceutical Sciences, 1992, 81(2): 149-154]. The prodrug of ibuprofen mainly focuses on the amidation or esterification of the carboxyl group. Since a human body is rich in biological enzymes that hydrolyze esterases, to esterify the carboxyl group on ibuprofen is an effective method for preparing the prodrug of ibuprofen.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0009">The present application provides an ibuprofen ester prodrug, a pharmaceutical composition, a preparation method and an application.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">In the present application, the carboxyl group of racemic ibuprofen or S-ibuprofen is derivatized so that a series of ester prodrugs are designed and synthesized, and also prepared into fat emulsion injection preparations, which overcomes some problems in the clinical application of the existing ibuprofen and can achieve the purpose of prolonging a half-life, improving stability, improving efficacy, reducing toxic side effects, or the like.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0011">In a first aspect, the present application provides an ibuprofen ester prodrug, a racemate, stereoisomer or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, or a solvate of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, where the ibuprofen ester prodrug is a compound represented by Structural Formula (1):</p><p id="p-0014" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="31.07mm" wi="68.92mm" file="US20230000812A1-20230105-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0015" num="0012">In Structural Formula (1), R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>are identical or different and are each independently selected from C<sub>1-10 </sub>alkyl, C<sub>2-10 </sub>alkenyl, C<sub>2-10 </sub>alkynyl, C<sub>3-8 </sub>cycloalkyl, 5-10 membered heterocyclic groups, C<sub>1-10 </sub>aryl, and 5-10 membered heteroaryl groups;

The compound of the present application exhibits good pharmacokinetic properties through in vitro plasma tests. Moreover, the compound itself has relatively high physical and chemical stability. For example, the purity of the compound remains basically unchanged in high-temperature tests (storage at 60&#xb0; C. for 5-10 days).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0055">(2) The main pharmacological activity of ibuprofen comes from dexibuprofen. In the present application, a dexibuprofen ester prodrug with a (1S) configuration is synthesized with dexibuprofen as a raw material. Studies found that the dexibuprofen ester prodrug has a faster hydrolysis rate in plasma than a levorotatory ibuprofen prodrug and can produce more dexibuprofen. It is known in the art that levorotatory ibuprofen has weak anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic effects, dextrorotatory ibuprofen (in an S configuration) is 28 times stronger than levorotatory ibuprofen (in an R configuration), and levorotatory ibuprofen may cause various adverse reactions such as gastrointestinal toxicity, water and sodium retention, decreased renal perfusion and allergic reactions. Therefore, it is of great significance to study and prepare the ibuprofen ester prodrug in the S configuration, that is, the dextrorotatory enantiomer of the compound represented by Structural Formula (1) in the present application.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0056">(3) It is found through further tests that after the dextrorotatory enantiomer of the ibuprofen ester prodrug of the present application is placed in a water phase or an oil phase for 10 days at a high temperature of 80&#xb0; C., the related substance and an isomer can both maintain relatively high stability.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0057">(4) A series of ibuprofen ester prodrugs prepared in the present application contain a carbonate structure on a side chain, which improves fat solubility. The compound having this structure is an oily substance and can be dissolved in an oily substance to be prepared into the fat emulsion injection. Injection manners include intravenous injection, intramuscular injection, subcutaneous injection, intradermal injection, acupoint injection, and the like. The damages of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug such as traditional ibuprofen to gastrointestinal mucosae are avoided, thereby increasing the bioavailability of the drug.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0073" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a degradation rate of an S-isomer of a compound of the present application in human plasma.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a level of ibuprofen produced through metabolism of an S-isomer of a compound of the present application in human plasma.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a liquid chromatogram of degradation of Compound N6(S) of the present application in human plasma.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a liquid chromatogram of degradation of Compound N9(S) of the present application in human plasma.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a liquid chromatogram of degradation of Compound N2(S) of the present application in human plasma.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of Compound N6(S) of the present application.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of Compound N9(S) of the present application.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows plasma concentration-time curves of injections of dexibuprofen and a dexibuprofen ester derivative N9(S).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows plasma concentration-time curves of injections of dexibuprofen, a dexibuprofen ester derivative N9(S), and side chain chiral compounds N9(S)A and N9(S)B.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0082" num="0067">Technical solutions of the present application are described below in more detail in conjunction with specific examples.

It can be seen that the ester prodrug can be metabolized quickly into dexibuprofen with anti-inflammatory activity in rats, and the overall exposure in rats is consistent. The pharmacokinetic parameters show that the replacement of a dexibuprofen salt with an ester prodrug in injection preparations can prolong the half-life and mean residence time of dexibuprofen, reduce an elimination rate of dexibuprofen, and increase an apparent volume of distribution. Therefore, the present application prolongs the time of action of the drug in the body while achieving the same efficacy in clinical applications.</p><heading id="h-0035" level="1">Test Example 5</heading><p id="p-0246" num="0220">The dexibuprofen derivative Compound N9(S) includes a chiral center at the position where a side chain is joined in addition to a chiral center on main chain ibuprofen.
