More so, the present invention relates to an air handler that sits on a drain pan, and intakes air from opposing coil panels, or a panel formed from a plurality of coils arranged in parallel, such that the air flows across the coils that carry a cooling fluid, thereby cooling the air; and further draws in the cooled air with a fan to disperse through an HVAC duct or plenum; whereby the intake of air from opposing panels enables the miniaturization of the air handler.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The following background information may present examples of specific aspects of the prior art (e.g., without limitation, approaches, facts, or common wisdom) that, while expected to be helpful to further educate the reader as to additional aspects of the prior art, is not to be construed as limiting the present invention, or any embodiments thereof, to anything stated or implied therein or inferred thereupon.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Often, buildings and enclosed structures are cooled using chilled water that is circulated through the building. In many instances, the chiller utilizes water conduits to carry the chilled water through the building. The water conduits are routed to air handlers located on individual floors and sections of the building. The air handlers push or pull air past cooling coils through which the chilled water flows. Heat is removed from the air by the cooling coils and the chilled water within the cooling coils. During this cycle, the chilled water warms up and is returned via water conduits to one or more chillers for cooling. The chillers controllably adjust the temperature of the chilled water output for the air handlers.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As variables such as temperature and humidity vary, multiple chillers, pumps, or cooling towers may need to be brought online or taken offline to serve the varying cooling needs of the building. It can be problematic to efficiently control a chiller plant for a building. Due in part to the varying nature of a building environment (e.g., occupancy, etc.), the varying nature of weather (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.), and the varying nature of equipment performance.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Typically, the capacity of an air conditioning unit is directly related the surface area of the cooling coil. The higher the BTU removal capacity of the cooling coil, the larger the cooling coil needs to be which requires a larger cabinet to house the coil as well as a larger space to fit the entire air conditioning unit. Since space is at a premium in most building and mechanical rooms, a substantial amount of room is needed to fit conventional cooling coil designs in these air conditioning systems.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Also due to the size of such air conditioning units, it can be difficult to change and maintain.

Also due to the size of these air conditioning units, it is often difficult to change and maintain. Further, the higher capacity of an air conditioning unit in BTU's the larger cooling coil section needs to be and with a single direction airflow unit this requires larger rooms and coil pull areas to service the cooling coil or change if necessary.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Other proposals have involved air conditioning units that have smaller profiles. The problem with these units is that they do not intake air from multiple sides of the unit. Also, they allow excess condensate to fall into components of the air handler, causing flooding. Even though the above cited air conditioning units meet some of the needs of the market, a miniaturized air handler assembly that includes an air handler that sits on a drain pan, and intakes air from opposing coil panels across coils that carry a cooling fluid, thereby cooling the air; and further draws in the cooled air with a fan to disperse through an HVAC duct or plenum; whereby the intake of air through opposing panels, or a wall of coils, enables the miniaturization of the air handler, is still desired.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Illustrative embodiments of the disclosure are generally directed to a miniaturized air handler assembly. The miniaturized air handler assembly provides a unique air handler that resides completely on a drain pan. The air handler comprises multiple panels forming an enclosed chamber with a central region. Two of the opposing panels are apertured, or coil assemblies, so as to enable passage of air from outside to the enclosed chamber. Multiple cooling coils, which carry a cooling fluid, are disposed in a generally parallel relationship, and on the inner side, of the coil panels. A blower forces high velocity air through the two opposing coil panels, and across the cooling coils. This serves to cool the air. The condensate that inherently forms on the cooling coils falls into the drain pan; and thereby does not travel into the subsequent components of the air handler.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">From the cooling coils, the cooled air flows to the central region of the air handler. A fan at the top of the air handler sucks the cooled air from an outlet opening that forms in a top panel for dispersing through a duct or plenum. The air handler is unique in that, the intake of air from opposing panels enables the miniaturization of the air handler. The air handler is also unique in that the condensate never reaches the fan or central region of the air handler, because the high velocity airflow causes condensate to drip, or fall, off the surface of the cooling coils, and into the drain pan. In essence, all the air and the condensate enter into the central region. It is known in the art that in prior art units, such condensate flooded the air handler if the condensate blew off the coil missing the drain pan. This is known in the industry as carry over.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one aspect, a miniaturized air handler assembly, comprises:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0013">multiple coil panels comprising multiple cooling coils arranged in fluid communication, the coil panels having multiple edges, the cooling coils operable to carry a cooling fluid, the cooling coils forming a fluid inlet operable to enable ingress of the cooling fluid, the cooling coils further forming a fluid outlet operable to enable egress of the cooling fluid;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0014">a cooling fluid manifold having a manifold inlet and a manifold outlet, the manifold inlet and the manifold outlet being in fluid communication with the fluid inlet and the fluid outlet of the cooling coils;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0015">at least one screen overlaying the coil panels, the screen defining multiple apertures; multiple solid panels having multiple edges, whereby the edges of the coil panels and the solid panels join to form an enclosed chamber, the enclosed chamber defining a central region;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0016">at least one of the solid panels defining an outlet opening, the outlet opening enabling egress of the air from the enclosed chamber;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0017">a fan disposed over the outlet opening, the fan operable to draw air into the enclosed chamber through the coil panels,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0018">whereby the cooling coils help cool the incoming air,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0019">whereby the air passing through the coil panels accumulates in the central region of the enclosed chamber,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0020">the fan also operable to draw the cooled air from the central region through the outlet opening;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0009" num="0021">a drain pan defining a surface having a perimeter flange, the surface of the drain pan supporting the coil panels and the solid panels, whereby the coil panels and the solid panels are substantially disposed inside the perimeter flange of the drain pan; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0010" num="0022">a duct or a plenum, the duct or the plenum being joined with the top panel and in fluid communication with the enclosed chamber through the outlet opening, the duct or the plenum being operable to carry the cooled air drawn in by the fan.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0014" num="0023">In another aspect, the enclosed chamber defines a cubicle or a rectangular shape.

The miniaturized air handler assembly <b>100</b>, hereafter &#x201c;assembly <b>100</b>&#x201d; provides a miniaturized version of an air handler unit, that not only takes up lesser space than prior art air handlers, but also turns out greater BTU's than the prior art air handlers and HVAC systems due to optimal positions of the cooling coils, i.e., evaporator cooling coils. The assembly <b>100</b> is capable of being scaled down in size due to the use of opposing coil panels <b>102</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>c </i>made up of multiple cooling coils <b>302</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>. Two sets of cooling coils <b>302</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>may form a wall, of sorts, on opposing sides of the air handler. This dual cooling concept exponentially increases the cooling effect of the air handler, while also allowing for a smaller dimension.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0062">Additionally, the assembly <b>100</b> rests within a perimeter flange of a drain pan <b>108</b>, such that condensate falling from the cooling coils <b>302</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>is restricted from flooding components of the air handler. Such a structural configuration, enables a greater velocity of inbound air to flow over the cooling coils <b>302</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>; thereby increasing BTU's and overall efficiency of the assembly <b>100</b>. In another novel structural design, the assembly <b>100</b> is operable with an HVAC system; either as part of a new A/C unit, or retrofitted to an existing A/C unit.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0063">In one exemplary use, the assembly <b>100</b> has a unique configuration of coil panels <b>102</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>c </i>that cools incoming air. The coil panels <b>102</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>c </i>comprise multiple cooling coils <b>302</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>, i.e., evaporator cooling coils. The cooling coils <b>302</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>are sized and dimensioned to carry a cooling fluid, such as chilled water, that cools incoming air. The coil panels and multiple solid panels <b>102</b><i>b</i>, <b>102</b><i>d</i>, <b>102</b><i>e</i>, <b>102</b><i>f </i>may join at the edges to form an enclosed chamber <b>204</b> where cooled air accumulates before being sucked in to a duct.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0064">In any case, the cooling coils <b>302</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>are arranged in a continuous, side-by-side relationship with each other while carrying a cooling fluid. When the edges coil panel are joined with other coil panels, or solid panels, the square or rectangular-shaped enclosed chamber <b>204</b> is formed. Air is sucked through the coil panels to accumulate into the enclosed chamber, where a fan sucks the cooled air through exterior ducts. Additionally, the coil panels rest atop a drain pan <b>108</b>, such that all the cooling coils <b>302</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>are within the perimeter of the drain pan <b>108</b>, and any falling condensate from blowing air falls into the drain pan <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0065">In one possible embodiment, the cooling coils are normally referred to as &#x201c;Cooling Coils&#x201d;. In the case of Chilled Water, they are referred to as &#x201c;Chilled Water Coils&#x201d; in the case of a DX (Direct Expansion) they are referred to as Cooling coils. And in the case of heating, they can just be referred to as heating coils. or heating elements if electricity is used to heat.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0066">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> references, the assembly <b>100</b> comprises multiple solid panels <b>102</b><i>b</i>, <b>102</b><i>d</i>, <b>102</b><i>e</i>, <b>102</b><i>f </i>that form the structural framework for the air handler. As discussed below, the solid panels, and adjoining coil panels form an arrangement that creates an enclosed chamber <b>204</b> where cooled air accumulates. For example, the edges of the solid panels are configured to join with the edges of the coil panels to form the enclosed chamber <b>204</b>. In some embodiments, the edges of the coiled and solid panels can join through welding, or through use of fasteners, such as bolts. In other embodiments, the solid panels are solid, having no openings, outlets, or apertures. In yet other embodiments, the solid panels are fabricated from aluminum, metal, or metal alloys.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0067">In one possible embodiment, the solid panels include two side solid panels <b>102</b><i>b</i>, <b>102</b><i>d</i>, a top solid panel <b>102</b><i>e</i>, and a bottom solid panel <b>102</b><i>f </i>join to form the cubicle or rectangular shape of the enclosed chamber. In alternative embodiments, multiple corner reinforcement panels (not shown) may also be used to help seal the enclosed chamber. In any case, the enclosed chamber <b>204</b> is generally sealed and weatherproof. Formed from the panels, the enclosed chamber <b>204</b> defines a central region <b>106</b>, which is generally concentric from the inner surfaces of the panels <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>. The central region <b>106</b> is significant in that cooled air accumulates there before being sucked out into a duct <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b </i>or plenum.

The duct <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b </i>or plenum is in fluid communication with the enclosed chamber <b>204</b> through the outlet opening <b>200</b>. It is known in the art that the duct <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b </i>and the plenum are configured to carry cooled air that is drawn in by the fan <b>202</b> for subsequent dispersion through an HVAC system.

This enhances the cooling effect, allowing for a miniaturized version of air handler. The cooling coils may have a tubular configuration. Any number of cooling coils may also be used on corresponding coil panels <b>102</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>c</i>. And any number of coil panels may be used; including two, three, or four that form a cube of coil panels.

For example, illustrated is two sets of coil panels with opposing airflows blow past the cooling coils <b>302</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>towards each other into the center of the enclosed chamber <b>204</b>. This high velocity airflow causes condensate to drip, or fall, off the surface of the cooling coils <b>302</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>, which in prior art units, flooded the air handler.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0087">Since, the assembly <b>100</b> rests within the perimeter flange <b>114</b> of the drain pan <b>108</b>, the condensate falls directly into the drain pan <b>108</b> before reaching the components of the assembly <b>100</b>. This serves to minimize flooding and damage to the air handler. In this manner, more BTU's can be generated by the assembly <b>100</b>. It is significant to note that because the cooling coils <b>302</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>and panels <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>are disposed within the perimeter flange <b>114</b> of the drain pan <b>108</b>, the velocity can reach 1,000 ft/min. Thus, the condensate that inherently forms on the cooling coils <b>302</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>falls into the drain pan <b>108</b>; and thereby does not travel into the subsequent components of the air handler. In one possible embodiment, a bracket <b>206</b> is configured to fasten the fan <b>202</b> to the top panel <b>102</b><i>e</i>, or the panel that forms the outlet opening <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0088">The assembly <b>100</b> is unique in that the intake of air from opposing coil panels enable the miniaturization of the air handler. The assembly <b>100</b> is also unique in that the condensate never reaches the fan <b>202</b> or central region <b>106</b> of the air handler, because the high velocity airflow causes condensate to drip, or fall, off the surface of the cooling coils <b>302</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>, and into the drain pan <b>108</b>. It is known in the art that in prior art units, such condensate flooded the air handler.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0089">The assembly <b>100</b> reduces the space needed for an air conditioning unit in comparison to an air conditioner unit of similar capacity. In this manner, the assembly <b>100</b> creates a more compact air conditioning unit that takes up less space, and is easier to install and replace. Rather than air flow through a single panel of cooling coils <b>302</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>, i.e., evaporator cooling coils in one direction, the assembly <b>100</b> uses multiple panels with cooling coils <b>302</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>, where the air flows from opposing coil panels from opposing directions.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0090">As an example of how the design of the assembly <b>100</b> (miniaturized Air Handler Unit) increases capacity and can decrease the size. A standard 6 row chilled water coil has a measurement of 24&#x2033; wide and 40&#x2033; height with a total capacity of 84,000 BTU's with a standard face velocity of around 500ft/min.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0091">With this novel invention the BTU capacity can be doubled by using two apposed flow coils (coil panels), tripled by adding three apposed flow coils, and quadrupled by having four apposed flow coils without increasing the size of the unit. So, within an assembly <b>100</b> that is just 34&#x2033;&#xd7;34&#x2033; the total capacity can be increased from 84,000 BTU's to 336,000 BTU's. This is an incredible increase in capacity within a very small space.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0092">Beyond the ability to maximize the space by the design of this Novel AHU, the assembly <b>100</b> can exceed the industry standard face velocity of the coil, which further increases the BTU capacity of the unit without increasing the size of the unit. This is possible because the negative consequence that comes from exceeding the standard face velocity of about 500 ft/min which causes moisture carryover is mitigated.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0093">As a further example, the coils that are in the assembly <b>100</b> shown in the illustration have a BTU capacity of 241,000 BTU's at a face velocity of 700 ft/min. Thus, with two opposed coils, the capacity would be 482,000 BTU's; and with three apposed coils the capacity is 723,000 BTU's; and four coils creates a cube having a capacity of 964,000 BTU's in a space approximately 3&#x2032;&#xd7;3&#x2032; and 45&#x2033; tall. This creates 80 tons of coiling capacity within a very small space. This is an example of how the design is Novel and truly minimizes the size of an Air Handling Unit.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0094">In operation, the fan <b>202</b> draws the air into the enclosed chamber <b>204</b> and through the cooling coils <b>302</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>into the enclosed chamber <b>204</b> created by the closed in cooling coils <b>302</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>. The air is cooled as it passes through the cooling coils into the central region <b>106</b>. The fan <b>202</b> removes the combined air of the cooling coils <b>302</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>from the chamber <b>204</b> discharging it from the fan <b>202</b> into the duct <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b </i>or plenum to condition the area it is to serve.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0095">Advantageously, the assembly <b>100</b> can be used in multiple applications. In a first embodiment, the assembly <b>100</b> can be installed as part of a new AC unit where the needed space for an air handler is decreased. In a second embodiment, the assembly <b>100</b> can be part of an older air handler retrofit to replace old cooling coils and fans. In this instance it can simplify the installation of a new coil and fan <b>202</b> unit as it can fit through smaller openings and passageways. In a third embodiment, the assembly <b>100</b> can also be used as a standalone temporary air conditioning unit that takes up less space than a conventional temporary air conditioning unit. Additionally, the assembly <b>100</b> can be used in Heating, Ventilation or Air conditioning. In another embodiment, a hot fluid is utilized in the cooling coils to heat, rather than to cool. In this heating configuration, the coil panel works in substantially the same manner as described above for cooling.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0096">These and other advantages of the invention will be further understood and appreciated by those skilled in the art by reference to the following written specification, claims and appended drawings.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0097">Because many modifications, variations, and changes in detail can be made to the described preferred embodiments of the invention, it is intended that all matters in the foregoing description and shown in the accompanying drawings be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.
