Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present technology relates to a pneumatic tire, and a method for manufacturing a pneumatic tire.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Some pneumatic tires in the related art have achieved desired performance by devising a member disposed on an outer side in a tire radial direction of a belt layer. For example, a pneumatic tire described in Japan Patent No. 4865259 improves projection resistance in such a way that two belt protecting layers are disposed on an outer side in a tire radial direction of a belt layer, and the belt protecting layer on the outer side in the tire radial direction has a narrower width than a width of the belt protecting layer on an inner side in the tire radial direction. In a pneumatic tire described in Japan Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2010-64644, a belt reinforcing layer is disposed between a tread portion and a belt layer, and the belt reinforcing layer is configured to be three layers on a tire equatorial portion to ensure breaking energy while suppressing an increase in weight.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A pneumatic tire described in Japan Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2017-137032 includes a band-like sound absorbing member adhered to a tire inner surface in a tread portion, a full cover layer disposed on an outer circumferential side of a belt layer, and a center cover layer disposed on an outer circumferential side of the full cover layer and locally covering a tire width central region. By defining respective widths of the band-like sound absorbing member and the belt layer and widths of the center cover layer and the band-like sound absorbing member, a decrease in high-speed durability caused by accumulation of heat in the band-like sound absorbing member is reduced while obtaining sufficient quietness by the band-like sound absorbing member.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a pneumatic tire described in Japan Patent No. 4635366, a belt cover layer constituted by an end portion belt cover layer and a central portion belt cover layer is disposed outside a belt layer, and a tensile strength of organic fiber cords forming the end portion belt cover layer and the central portion belt cover layer and a sum of the end portion belt cover layer and the central portion belt cover layer are defined to ensure reduction in road noise in a high frequency band and weight reduction. Additionally, a pneumatic tire described in Japan Patent No. 4687201 includes a belt cover formed by helically winding a strip material on an outer circumferential side of a belt layer. In the belt cover, lap winding of the strip material at a position covering an end portion in a tire width direction in the belt layer and a position covering a central portion in the tire width direction in the belt layer improves steering stability and durability.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Here, among pneumatic tires, for example, there are pneumatic tires that can accommodate a high load, such as a pneumatic tire with EXTRA LOAD standard. Such pneumatic tires can be used at relatively high air pressures for accommodating high loads. Meanwhile, when the air pressure of the pneumatic tire is increased, rigidity of a tread portion increases. As a result, the tread portion is less likely to deform when a foreign material is trodden, and a shock burst, which is caused by the foreign material being trodden, is likely to occur. That is, the use of the pneumatic tire at high air pressure is likely to reduce shock burst resistance performance, which is a resistance against a shock burst.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A shock burst is likely to occur by treading on a foreign material on a road surface with a region at or near a tire equatorial plane on a ground contact surface of the tread portion. Accordingly, to improve shock burst resistance performance, reinforcement at or near the tire equatorial plane in the tread portion is effective. However, new addition of a member for reinforcement increases a manufacturing process by that much, thereby reducing productivity. For this reason, achieving both shock burst resistance performance and productivity in a compatible manner has been extremely difficult.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present technology provides a pneumatic tire that is capable of achieving both shock burst resistance performance and productivity in a compatible manner, and a method for manufacturing the pneumatic tire.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An embodiment of the present technology provides a pneumatic tire including a tread portion, a belt layer disposed in the tread portion, and a belt cover layer disposed on an outer side of the belt layer in a tire radial direction, the belt cover layer being disposed spanning between shoulder regions on both sides in a tire width direction, the belt cover layer being formed by winding one belt cover material having a band-like shape, in a helical shape around a tire rotation axis on the outer side of the belt layer in the tire radial direction, the belt cover layer including a lap winding portion formed between the shoulder regions on both sides in the tire width direction, the lap winding portion including a lap portion in which parts of circumferential portions, adjacent in the tire width direction, of the belt cover material wound in a helical shape are lap-wound in the tire radial direction, a width of the lap winding portion in the tire width direction being within a range of 3% or more and 30% or less of a width of the belt cover layer in the tire width direction, and in portions of the belt cover layer located in the shoulder regions, the circumferential portions, adjacent in the tire width direction, of the belt cover material wound in a helical shape being wound without being lapped in the tire radial direction.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Additionally, in the pneumatic tire, preferably, the width of the lap winding portion in the tire width direction is within a range of 5 mm or more and 40 mm or less.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, in the pneumatic tire, preferably, the lap winding portion is formed across a tire equatorial plane in the tire width direction.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Additionally, in the pneumatic tire, preferably, a width of the lap portion of the lap winding portion is within a range of 20% or more and 70% or less of a width of the belt cover material.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Additionally, in the pneumatic tire described above, preferably, the belt cover layer includes a first full cover layer including the lap winding portion and formed spanning between the shoulder regions on both sides in the tire width direction, and a second full cover layer stacked on the first full cover layer in the tire radial direction and formed spanning between the shoulder regions on both sides in the tire width direction, and in a portion of the belt cover layer in which the lap portion is located in the tire width direction, the belt cover material includes three or more layers lapped in the tire radial direction.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In addition, in the pneumatic tire described above, preferably, in the lap winding portion, a width of the lap portion varies depending on a position in the tire width direction.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Additionally, an embodiment of the present technology provides a method of manufacturing a pneumatic tire, in which a belt cover layer is disposed by winding a belt cover material having a band-like shape, in a helical shape around a tire rotation axis on an outer side of a belt layer in a tire radial direction, the method including the steps of: forming the belt cover layer between shoulder regions by winding one belt cover material in a helical shape spanning between the shoulder regions on both sides in a tire width direction;

The vehicle is driven by transferring a driving force or a braking force to the road surface, using the frictional force between the ground contact surface <b>3</b> and the road surface, or by generating a turning force.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">For example, in a case where the vehicle on which the pneumatic tires <b>1</b> are mounted travels on a dry road surface, the vehicle travels mainly by transmitting a driving force or a braking force to the road surface or generating a turning force by a frictional force between the ground contact surface <b>3</b> and the road surface. When the vehicle travels on a wet road surface, the vehicle travels in such a way that water between the ground contact surface <b>3</b> and the road surface enters grooves, such as the main grooves <b>30</b> and the lug grooves, and the water between the ground contact surface <b>3</b> and the road surface is drained through these grooves. Accordingly, the ground contact surface <b>3</b> is easily grounded on the road surface, and the frictional force between the ground contact surface <b>3</b> and the road surface allows the vehicle to travel as desired.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Additionally, while the vehicle is traveling, the pneumatic tire <b>1</b> is subjected to a load associated with a weight of a vehicle body, acceleration/deceleration, and turning. Accordingly, a large load acts in the tire radial direction. This load is mainly received by air filled into the pneumatic tire <b>1</b>, but is also received by the tread portion <b>2</b> and the sidewall portion <b>8</b> as well as the air inside the pneumatic tire <b>1</b>. That is, the sidewall portion <b>8</b> transmits the load between the bead portion <b>10</b> to which the rim wheel R is fitted and the tread portion <b>2</b>, and the tread portion <b>2</b> transmits the load between the sidewall portion <b>8</b> and the road surface. Accordingly, the large load acts on the sidewall portion <b>8</b> and the tread portion <b>2</b> while the vehicle is traveling, and the sidewall portion <b>8</b> and the tread portion <b>2</b> receive this load while deflecting mainly in the tire radial direction.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Additionally, while the vehicle is traveling, the pneumatic tire <b>1</b> rotates, so the position in the ground contact surface <b>3</b> that comes into contact with the road surface continuously moves in the tire circumferential direction. In accordance with this, the positions in the sidewall portion <b>8</b> and the tread portion <b>2</b> deflected by the load while the vehicle is traveling also move in the tire circumferential direction. Thus, while the vehicle is traveling, the pneumatic tire <b>1</b> rotates while repeating the sequential deflection of the respective positions of the sidewall portion <b>8</b> and the tread portion <b>2</b> on the tire circumferential direction.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Additionally, a projection projecting from a road surface, such as a stone, is possibly present on a road surface on which the vehicle travels, and the vehicle during traveling possibly treads such a projection by the tread portion <b>2</b> of the pneumatic tire <b>1</b>. At this time, when the sidewall portion <b>8</b> and the tread portion <b>2</b> have a small deflection due to the high air pressure filled in the pneumatic tire <b>1</b>, the pneumatic tire <b>1</b> cannot absorb the change in the shape of the road surface due to the presence of the projection, and the projection possibly penetrates the tread portion <b>2</b> of the pneumatic tire <b>1</b>. That is, in the pneumatic tire <b>1</b> with the increased internal pressure, when the projection on the road surface is trodden, the small deflection of the sidewall portion <b>8</b> and the tread portion <b>2</b> causes the projection to penetrate the tread portion <b>2</b>, possibly causing a shock burst.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In contrast, in the pneumatic tire <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment, the belt cover layer <b>15</b> is formed by winding one band-like belt cover material <b>40</b> in a helical shape, and the belt cover layer <b>15</b> includes the lap winding portion <b>45</b> between the shoulder regions Ash on both sides in the tire width direction, and thus shock bursts can be suppressed in a case where the internal pressure is increased. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is an explanatory diagram illustrating a state in which a projection <b>105</b> on a road surface <b>100</b> is trodden by the pneumatic tire <b>1</b> according to the embodiment. In the pneumatic tire <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment, the belt cover layer <b>15</b> includes the lap winding portion <b>45</b> with parts of the circumferential portions adjacent in the tire width direction being lapped in the tire radial direction, thus allowing the formation, between the shoulder regions Ash, of a portion including more lapped portions of the belt cover material <b>40</b> and having a higher strength, than the other portions. In other words, at the positions other than the lap portions <b>46</b> of the overlap winding portion <b>45</b> in the belt cover layer <b>15</b>, the belt cover layer <b>15</b> is formed of one layer of the belt cover material <b>40</b>, whereas at the positions of the lap portions <b>46</b> of the lap winding portion <b>45</b>, the belt cover layer <b>15</b> is formed of two layers of the belt cover material <b>40</b>. This allows the strength of the lap winding portion <b>45</b> in the belt cover layer <b>15</b> to be made higher than the strength of the portions other than the lap winding portion <b>45</b>. This increases the strength at break of the central region of the tread portion <b>2</b> in the tire width direction. Even when the projection <b>105</b> on the road surface <b>100</b> is trodden at or near the center land portion <b>21</b> where a ground contact pressure is likely to increase, the penetration of the projection <b>105</b> through the tread portion <b>2</b> can be suppressed. Accordingly, shock bursts caused by the projection <b>105</b> being trodden during traveling of the vehicle can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In addition, in the portion of the belt cover layer <b>15</b> located in the shoulder region Ash, the belt cover material <b>40</b> is wound in the tire radial direction with the circumferential portions, adjacent in the tire width direction, of the belt cover material <b>40</b> wound in a helical shape not being lapped. Thus, even in a case where shock burst resistance is improved using the belt cover material <b>40</b>, an unnecessarily high strength of the shoulder region Ash in the tread portion can be suppressed. This enables the shoulder region Ash to be easily deformed in a case where the projection <b>105</b> is trodden in a central region of the tread portion <b>2</b> in the tire width direction, allowing the shoulder region Ash to be easily deformed in the direction in which the central region of the tread portion <b>2</b> in the tire width direction leaves the road surface <b>100</b>. Thus, the pressure applied to the tread portion <b>2</b> by the projection <b>105</b> can be reduced, allowing suppression of penetration of the tread portion <b>2</b> by the projection <b>105</b>. Accordingly, shock bursts caused by the projection <b>105</b> being trodden during traveling of the vehicle can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Additionally, the belt cover layer <b>15</b> is formed by winding one belt cover material <b>40</b> in a helical shape, and the portion of the belt cover layer <b>15</b> that is to have an increased strength includes the lap winding portion <b>45</b> in which parts of the circumferential portions, adjacent in the tire width direction, of the belt cover material <b>40</b> wound in a helical shape are lap-wound in the tire radial direction. Thus, the belt cover layer <b>15</b> can be easily formed using one belt cover material <b>40</b>, and the strength of a part of the belt cover layer <b>15</b> can be easily increased. Accordingly, productivity can be improved in a case where shock burst resistance is improved by using the belt cover layer <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Additionally, in the portion of the belt cover layer <b>15</b> located in the shoulder region Ash, the belt cover material <b>40</b> is wound with the adjacent circumferential portions not lapped in the tire radial direction, whereas between the shoulder regions Ash on both sides in the tire width direction, the belt cover material <b>40</b> is wound with the lap portions <b>46</b> formed. This allows the strength of the belt cover layer <b>15</b> to be easily varied using one belt cover material <b>40</b> depending on the position in the tire width direction. This allows more reliable improvement in the productivity in a case where the strength of the belt cover layer <b>15</b> is easily varied depending on the position in the tire width direction.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Additionally, the width Ws of the lap winding portion <b>45</b> of the belt cover layer <b>15</b> in the tire width direction is within the range of 3% or more and 30% or less of the width CW of the belt cover layer <b>15</b> in the tire width direction. This enables an increase in strength at break of the central region of the tread portion <b>2</b> in the tire width direction, which is likely to receive an increased ground contact pressure, with a decrease in productivity suppressed in a case where the belt cover layer <b>15</b> is formed by winding the belt cover material <b>40</b> in a helical shape. In other words, when the width Ws of the lap winding portion <b>45</b> is less than 3% of the width C W of the belt cover layer <b>15</b>, the width Ws of the lap winding portion <b>45</b> is excessively small, and thus the strength at the position of the lap winding portion <b>45</b> in the belt cover layer <b>15</b> may be difficult to ensure. In this case, even in a case where the lap winding portion <b>45</b> is formed in the belt cover layer <b>15</b>, the strength at break of the central region of the tread portion <b>2</b> in the tire width direction is difficult to increase, and this may lead to difficulty in suppressing penetration of the tread portion <b>2</b> by the projection <b>105</b> trodden by the tread portion <b>2</b>. In addition, when the width Ws of the lap winding portion <b>45</b> is greater than 30% of the width CW of the belt cover layer <b>15</b>, the width Ws of the lap winding portion <b>45</b> is excessively large, and this may excessively increase the range of the belt cover material <b>40</b> in which the circumferential portions, adjacent in the tire width direction, of the belt cover material <b>40</b> are lapped in the tire radial direction. This may be likely to reduce the productivity. In other words, in a case where the circumferential portions, adjacent in the tire width direction, of the belt cover material <b>40</b> are lapped in the tire radial direction, speed that is involved in winding the belt cover material <b>40</b> in a helical shape decreases to gradually form the belt cover layer <b>15</b> in the tire width direction. Thus, with an increased range in which the circumferential portions adjacent in the tire width direction are lapped in the tire radial direction, the increased range is correspondingly likely to reduce the productivity. Thus, in a case where the circumferential portions, adjacent in the tire width direction, of the belt cover material <b>40</b> are excessively large in the tire radial direction, the productivity may be likely to be degraded.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In contrast, when the width Ws of the lap winding portion <b>45</b> is within the range of 3% or more and 30% or less of the width CW of the belt cover layer <b>15</b>, the strength of the lap winding portion <b>45</b> can be more reliably ensured, with suppression of an excessive increase in the range in which the circumferential portions, adjacent in the tire width direction, of the belt cover material <b>40</b> are lapped in the tire radial direction. Accordingly, with a decrease in productivity suppressed in a case where the belt cover material <b>40</b> is wound in a helical shape to form the belt cover layer <b>15</b>, the strength at break of the central region of the tread portion <b>2</b>, which is likely to receive an increased ground contact pressure, can be more reliably increased. As a result, both shock burst resistance performance and productivity can be achieved in a compatible manner.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Additionally, since the width Ws of the lap winding portion <b>45</b> is within the range of 5 mm or more and 40 mm or less, with an excessive increase in the weight of the belt cover layer <b>15</b> suppressed, the strength of the lap winding portion <b>45</b> can be more reliably ensured. In other words, when the width Ws of the lap winding portion <b>45</b> is less than 5 mm, the width Ws of the lap winding portion <b>45</b> is excessively small. Thus, the strength of the lap winding portion <b>45</b> may be difficult to ensure.

Additionally, when the width Ws of the lap winding portion <b>45</b> is greater than 40 mm, the width Ws of the lap winding portion <b>45</b> is excessively large, and thus the belt cover material <b>40</b> used may be excessively large.

This allows suppression of the adverse effect, on running performance, of a rapid change in the strength of the tread portion <b>2</b> in the tire width direction depending on the position on the tread portion <b>2</b> in the tire width direction.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In addition, in a case where the width W b of the lap portion <b>46</b> is varied depending on the position on the lap winding portion <b>45</b> in the tire width direction, the width Wb may be varied between the portions other than the central region and the end portion region of the lap winding portion <b>45</b> in the tire width direction. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is an explanatory diagram of a modified example of the pneumatic tire <b>1</b> according to an embodiment, in which the width Wb of the lap portion <b>46</b> varies between the opposite sides of the lap winding portion <b>45</b> in the tire width direction. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the width Wb of each lap portion <b>46</b> in the lap winding portion <b>45</b> included in the belt cover layer <b>15</b> may be varied between one end side, where the lap portion <b>46</b> has a width Wba, and the other end side, where the lap portion <b>46</b> has a width Wbb, of the lap winding portion <b>45</b> in the tire width direction. For example, in a case where the rigidity of the tread portion <b>2</b> varies between the opposite sides of tire equator line CL in the tire width direction due to the asymmetry of the tread pattern with respect to the tire equator line CL, the width Wb of each lap portion <b>46</b> in the lap winding portion <b>45</b> may be varied between the opposite sides of the tire equator line CL in the tire width direction. Alternatively, for the pneumatic tire <b>1</b> for which the vehicle mounting direction is defined, the width Wb of the lap portion <b>46</b> may be varied between a portion of the lap winding portion <b>45</b> located relatively outward in the vehicle mounting direction and a portion of the lap winding portion <b>45</b> located relatively inward in the vehicle mounting direction. By varying the width Wb of the lap portion <b>46</b> between the opposite sides of the lap winding portion <b>45</b> in the tire width direction depending on the aspect of the tread portion <b>2</b> or the pneumatic tire <b>1</b>, the shock burst resistance performance can be improved without affecting the running performance.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In the above-described embodiment, four main grooves <b>30</b> are formed, but the number of main grooves <b>30</b> may be other than four. In the embodiments described above, although the center land portion <b>21</b> is positioned on the tire equatorial plane CL, the land portion <b>20</b> needs not to be positioned on the tire equatorial plane CL. For example, the main groove <b>30</b> may be positioned on the tire equatorial plane CL. In a case where the main groove <b>30</b> is located on the tire equatorial plane CL, at least a part of the lap winding portion <b>45</b> of the belt cover layer <b>15</b> is preferably located on the inner side in the tire radial direction of one of the plurality of land portion <b>20</b> that is closest to the tire equatorial plane CL.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Examples</heading><p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>B</figref> include a table showing results of performance evaluation tests of pneumatic tires. In relation to the pneumatic tire <b>1</b> described above, description will be given of performance evaluation tests conducted on a pneumatic tire according to Conventional Example, the pneumatic tires <b>1</b> according to embodiments of the present technology, and pneumatic tires according to Comparative Examples to be compared with pneumatic tires <b>1</b> according to the embodiments of the present technology. For the performance evaluation tests, tests were conducted on the shock burst resistance performance, corresponding to shock burst resistance, and on the productivity during tire manufacture.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The performance evaluation tests were performed using the pneumatic tire <b>1</b> having the nominal size of 275/40ZR19 105Y of the tire defined by JATMA and mounted on a standard rim wheel of JATMA having a rim size of 19&#xd7;9.5 J. The evaluation method for each of the test items was evaluated for the plunger test by filling the test tire with an air pressure of a regular internal pressure, performing a plunger breakage test, in accordance with JIS K6302 with a plunger diameter of 19 mm and an insertion speed of 50 mm/minute, and measuring a tire breaking energy J. Shock burst resistance performance is expressed as index values with Conventional Example described below being assigned the value of 100. Larger index values indicate superior tire strength and superior shock burst resistance performance.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In addition, regarding productivity, a time required for winding the belt cover materials <b>40</b> in the step of winding the belt cover materials <b>40</b> during the manufacturing of the tire was measured. The productivity is expressed as index evaluations of a reciprocal of the measured time with Conventional Example described below being assigned as 100. Larger index values indicate shorter winding time and higher productivity. Note that an index value of 90 or more is assumed to indicate the suppression of significant degradation of performance with respect to the Conventional Example.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The performance evaluation tests were conducted on 14 types of pneumatic tires including a pneumatic tire according to Conventional Example, corresponding to an example of a conventional pneumatic tire, Examples 1 to 9 corresponding to examples of the pneumatic tire <b>1</b> according to an embodiment of the present technology, and Comparative Examples 1 to 4 corresponding to examples of pneumatic tires to be compared with the pneumatic tire <b>1</b> according to the an embodiment of the present technology. Note that in the pneumatic tire according to Conventional Example, the belt cover layer <b>15</b> is formed by one belt cover material <b>40</b> but does not include the lap winding portion <b>45</b>. Additionally, in the pneumatic tire according to Comparative Example 1, after the belt cover material <b>40</b> of the belt cover layer <b>15</b> is wound in a helical shape to form a full cover layer, the belt cover material <b>40</b> is cut once, and the belt cover material <b>40</b> is wound only around a central portion region of the full cover layer in the tire width direction on the outer side of the full cover layer in the tire radial direction, thus forming, in the central portion region of the full cover layer in the tire width direction, a two-layer portion in which the belt cover layer <b>40</b> includes two layers. Additionally, in the pneumatic tires according to Comparative Examples 2 and 3, the width Ws of the lap winding portion <b>45</b> included in the belt cover layer <b>15</b> is not within the range of 3% or more and 30% or less of the width CW of the belt cover layer <b>15</b>. Also, in the pneumatic tire of Comparative Example 4, in a portion located in the shoulder region Ash of the belt cover layer <b>15</b>, the circumferential portions adjacent to each other in the tire width direction of the belt cover material <b>40</b> are lapped in the tire radial direction.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In contrast, in Examples 1 to 9, corresponding to examples of the pneumatic tire <b>1</b> according to an embodiment of the present technology, the belt cover layer <b>15</b> is formed from one belt cover material <b>40</b> and includes the lap winding portion <b>45</b>, and the width Ws of the lap winding portion <b>45</b> is within the range of 3% or more and 30% or less of the width CW of the belt cover layer <b>15</b>, and in the portion of the belt cover layer <b>15</b> located in the shoulder region Ash, the circumferential portions, adjacent in the tire width direction, of the belt cover material <b>40</b> are wound without being lapped in the tire radial direction. Furthermore, the pneumatic tires <b>1</b> according to Examples 1 to 9 differ from one another in the width Ws of the lap winding portion <b>45</b> of the belt cover layer <b>15</b> in the tire width direction, the width Wb of each lap portion <b>46</b> included in the lap winding portion <b>45</b> with respect to the width Wa of the belt cover material <b>40</b>, and whether the belt cover layer <b>15</b> includes the second full cover layer <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">As a result of the performance evaluation tests conducted using these pneumatic tires, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>B</figref>, it was revealed that compared with Conventional Example, the pneumatic tires <b>1</b> according to Examples 1 to 9 can improve the shock burst resistance performance while suppressing a decrease in productivity as much as possible, allowing better improvement in comprehensive performance including a combination of the shock burst resistance performance and the productivity than Conventional Example and Comparative Examples 1 to 4. In other words, the method for manufacturing the pneumatic tires <b>1</b> according to Examples 1 to 9 can achieve both shock burst resistance performance and productivity in a compatible manner.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
