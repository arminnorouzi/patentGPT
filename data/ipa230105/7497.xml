Therefore, when both Bluetooth (BT) and Wi-Fi communications occur in the same location at the same time, they can act as interferers to one another. More and more products are starting to use Bluetooth and Wi-Fi together. Traditional set top boxes use BT for BT remote control operation and audio transmission. As set top box technology converges with Internet of Things (IOT) technology, set top boxes will take on additional roles such as IOT hub (smart home hub) and the need for BT in such a device is inevitable. As the requirement for Bluetooth devices increases (as is the case with IOT and other smart technologies, e.g., BT watch, BT fitness band, BT sensors, wireless switches, etc.), usage of the 2.4 GHz ISM band by BT will increase and this will affect Wi-Fi performance. A major problem solved herein is a way for an electronic apparatus having both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to dynamically choose the best Bluetooth and Wi-Fi co-existence scheme.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Choosing a coexistence scheme statically does not give the best performance as signal conditions (channel conditions), and application needs, keeps changing with time. Thus, many applications (devices, electronic apparatuses) can implement methods disclosed herein to attain the best performance.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Accordingly, there is a necessity to implement Bluetooth (BT)/Wi-Fi co-existence techniques in order to allow Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to be used in the same location. BT/Wi-Fi co-existence can be achieved by several techniques such as spatial separation, time division multiplexing, and adaptive frequency hopping.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In an electronic apparatus that includes both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, a spatial separation technique can achieve BT/Wi-Fi co-existence by designing and locating antennas, or designing the antenna patterns, in the apparatus in such a way that the Bluetooth antenna and the Wi-Fi antenna are spatially separated and there is enough isolation between them, e.g., a minimum of 40 dB isolation. For example, the Bluetooth antenna can be located at one end of the electronic device, the Wi-Fi antenna placed at the other opposite end, and, optionally, shielding can be placed at a location between the two antennas.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Time division multiplexing can be utilized to achieve BT/Wi-Fi coexistence by operating the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi communications at different times, such as by interleaving the use times of the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, so as to time share the same radio frequency space. For example, a processor on board the apparatus can control the times at which the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi communications are transmitted.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">With AFH (Adaptive Frequency Hopping) techniques, the processor effects rapid change of the particular frequency on which the Bluetooth communication occurs, such that the processor avoids implementing Bluetooth communication on channels where Wi-Fi interference exists or is higher than a predetermined amount, by selecting channels for frequency hopping that do not interfere with Wi-Fi communication. Bluetooth Devices are radio frequency devices designed to use the 2.4 to 2.48 GHz frequency band known as the ISM band. Bluetooth devices share this band with other devices such as wireless networks (IEEE 802.11) and cordless phones.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Bluetooth devices use frequency hopping to help minimize the effects of interference with other devices. In implementing the frequency hopping technique, a link between the communicating devices is formed such that the devices are synchronized to change channels together many times per second. The pattern of channels used is called the hop sequence and is unique for each link. Since the devices spend only small amounts of time on a particular channel, and because the hop sequence is different for each link, the possibility of interference is minimized. Moreover, from Bluetooth Revision 1.2 onwards, devices also use AFH, an adaptive form of frequency hopping that tries to reduce interference further by adapting the hop sequence to avoid channels in use by other devices operating in the same ISM band. The adaptive concept of AFH is that the Bluetooth device actually looks at what channels are already heavily in use and avoids those channels in the hop sequence. Using this technique BT can avoid the channel frequencies used by Wi-Fi and thus BT and Wi-Fi apparatuses existing in the same device can communicate on frequencies that do not overlap and thus do not affect each other.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A known method includes selection of a co-existence profile based on Wi-Fi RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) and/or Bluetooth RSSI; and the number of BT and Wi-Fi devices that the device is communicating with. Such method includes storing a plurality of coexistence profiles for different communication scenarios; initializing a device with default coexistence profiles; dynamically selecting different coexistence profiles based on current communication conditions; and configuring the device based on the selected communication profile. The coexistence profile can be changed dynamically, by monitoring the above mentioned parameters and can be changed at interval of 1 ms/1 sec. However, such a known method does not use the actual packet statistics of the received and transmitted data and the configuration and/or needs of the application to make the decision.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">RSSI is not a representation of signal quality of the received signal, but it only gives the signal strength. Signal to noise ratio (SNR) can be low even with RSSI being high, and thus the received data integrity can be compromised even with a high RSSI. Methods relying primarily on RSSI do not take this into account. Therefore, the basic criteria for making the decision is not accurate which will lead to the wrong mode being selected and the performance being compromised.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Rather than relying generally on signal strength per se, or even RSSI specifically, the electronic apparatuses disclosed herein execute a dynamic BT/Wi-Fi coexistence mode selection process in which signal parameters, other than mere signal strength, are detected and analyzed in order to determine the channel conditions on which a determination is made as to which one of plural BT/Wi-Fi coexistence modes is selected. Specifically, for example, RF signal diagnostics and/or packet statistics are detected and analyzed. Moreover, in addition to such signal parameters, the application type and communication requirements can be taken into account in the dynamic BT/Wi-Fi coexistence mode selection process. Such an electronic apparatus as disclosed herein provides advantageous effects, such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi data transmission efficiency being increased with reduced loss of data, resulting in improved users experience. By using more accurate parameters for analyzing and inferring the channel conditions, a more accurate co-ex mode can be selected.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A first aspect is an electronic apparatus including one or more antennas;

The controller <b>2</b>, in step <b>410</b>, collects a list of applications that need access to Bluetooth (or BLE) running on the electronic apparatus <b>1</b> as well as the priorities Bp of the applications in the list. At step <b>415</b>, the controller <b>2</b> collects the network statistics associated with each application in the lists. In this step, controller <b>2</b> receives information from each application indicating whether the electronic apparatus <b>1</b> has made available, for use by the application, enough band-width so that the application can operate satisfactorily. Specifically, the application provides a success/failure code to convey to the controller <b>2</b> if it can operate satisfactorily with the bandwidth allocated to it. At step <b>420</b>, controller <b>2</b> collects signal statistics regarding Bluetooth operation and Wi-Fi operation, and at step <b>425</b> the controller <b>2</b> collects packet statistics from one or more Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices communicating with the electronic device <b>1</b> vis-&#xe0;-vis the applications. In some cases, it is not possible for the application to convey if it is getting enough bandwidth or time of the network resource. In such cases the data from the collected packet statistics is used by the controller <b>2</b> to determine if the application is getting enough bandwidth (or time in TDM) to operate satisfactorily. For example, a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) remote controller application may not know if it's getting enough bandwidth, because it does not execute continuous data transmission. However, packet statistics mentioning a loss of BLE HID data convey that a BLE HID application is not operating satisfactorily. At step <b>430</b>, the controller <b>2</b> uses the collected data to select the appropriate coexistence mode.

At step <b>505</b>, P is set to 1. At step <b>510</b> the controller <b>2</b> determines whether P is less than or equal to PriorityMin. According the example above, where the minimum priority is 10, the controller <b>2</b> would be determining here whether P is less than or equal to 10.

For example, if the processing is occurring for P=3, then the controller determines that applications with Wp of 1, 2, and 3, and applications with Bp of 1, 2, and 3, are operating satisfactorily. If at step <b>530</b>, the applications using Bluetooth are also found to be able to work satisfactorily, then the process moves to <b>540</b>, where the controller <b>2</b> selects the application (or applications) that has the next lower priority, i.e., P is incremented by one (P=P+1) and runs the loop again starting from step <b>510</b>.

These statistics can be used as a measure to evaluate the channel reception conditions (i.e., whether Wi-Fi or Bluetooth is performing above or below a predetermined level). These 2 measures can be used in place of RSSI where possible.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0068">If Wi-Fi BER/PER is poor, then it is an indication that the signal reception condition is worse (or getting worse) and thus the controller <b>2</b> can use Wi-Fi MCS (Modulate Coding Scheme) to select the best MCS rate which is suitable for the signal condition. Even after selecting the best MCS if Wi-Fi suffers, then the controller <b>2</b> can choose a different frequency for Wi-Fi, and to change the BT channel hopping sequence.

For example, if SNR of Bluetooth is low and it reaches a limit beyond which it is known that Bluetooth performance of applications will suffer, then without waiting for loss of data, the controller <b>2</b> can allocate more time slots to Bluetooth, or the Bluetooth hopping sequence can be changed, or the controller can switch off Wi-Fi during Bluetooth operation.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0070">Throughput=WLAN throughput/BT throughput. WLAN throughput and drop of throughput provides data of changing channel conditions. In noisy signal conditions, throughput reduces as there are loss of data. Throughput can be calculated at transmission or reception and based on throughput, decision on which coexistence mode to use can be made. For example, if WLAN throughput is dropping well below the minimum requirement, then the controller can switch off Bluetooth during Wi-Fi usage to help WLAN throughput improve.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0071">Similarly if Bluetooth is used to stream audio to the customer's headphones that is being downloaded from internet through Wi-Fi and if Bluetooth suffers because of Wi-Fi's interference, then the end goal of streaming audio to the customer fails, and even though the audio is being successfully downloaded through Wi-Fi, it is of no use because the customer cannot hear the audio due to the fact that Wi-Fi interference has stopped the successful Bluetooth transmission/reception. In such cases, the controller <b>2</b> can detect the Bluetooth throughput and ensure that a minimum Bluetooth throughput is achieved so that the user's experience is not affected.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0072">Packet statistics=Packet statistics such as &#x2018;not-acked&#x2019; packets, number of duplicate packets received, give the exact statistics of the RF channel condition. Using these to select the co-existence mode gives accurate results. Not-Acked packet statistics give a good indication that the receiver and the transmitter are not able to communicate with each other. If the performance of Wi-Fi is suffering (or the performance of applications using Wi-Fi is not satisfactory), then the controller <b>2</b> can back-off Bluetooth (e.g., via TDM) in order to provide more time for Wi-Fi to transmit.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0073">Application requirement=Applications (electronic device) may not use Bluetooth at times and at such times, priority is provided to WLAN communication. Some blue tooth modes (HID) may not require constant transmission during which priority can be given to WLAN. And when Wi-Fi is not used, Bluetooth can take priority based on the demand and need from the application. For example, for a Bluetooth remote, if the user presses a key once, then chances are high that he is going to use the remote again soon and thus the controller <b>2</b> can give more slots/time to the remote application to use the Bluetooth channel.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0074">For example, when watching a video being streamed from Wi-Fi and using Bluetooth to transfer a photo file and using Bluetooth RCU, priority is the following order:</p><p id="p-0075" num="0000">1) BT remote<br/>2) Wi-Fi video downloading<br/>3) BT Photo sharing.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In similar way, all the applications using Bluetooth and Wi-Fi can be given priorities.
