In particular, biological and chemical specimens may be analyzed to determine the existence of a particular biological or chemical agent. Types of biological specimens commonly collected and delivered to clinical laboratories for analysis may include blood, urine, sputum, saliva, pus, mucous, cerebrospinal fluid, and others. Since these specimen types may contain pathogenic organisms or other harmful compositions, it is important to ensure that vessels are substantially leak-proof during use and transport. Substantially leak-proof vessels are particularly critical in cases where a clinical laboratory and a collection facility are separate.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To prevent leakage from the vessels, caps are typically screwed, snapped or otherwise frictionally fitted onto the vessel, forming an essentially leak-proof seal between the cap and the vessel. In addition to preventing leakage of the specimen, a substantially leak-proof seal formed between the cap and the vessel may reduce exposure of the specimen to potentially contaminating influences from the surrounding environment. A leak-proof seal can prevent introduction of contaminants that could alter the qualitative or quantitative results of an assay as well as preventing loss of material that may be important in the analysis.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">While a substantially leak-proof seal may prevent specimen seepage during transport, physical removal of the cap from the vessel prior to specimen analysis presents another opportunity for contamination. When removing the cap, any material that may have collected on the under-side of the cap during transport may come into contact with a user or equipment, possibly exposing the user to harmful pathogens present in the sample. If a film or bubbles form around the mouth of the vessel during transport, the film or bubbles may burst when the cap is removed from the vessel, thereby disseminating specimen into the environment. It is also possible that specimen residue from one vessel, which may have transferred to the gloved hand of a user, will come into contact with specimen from another vessel through routine or careless removal of the caps. Another risk is the potential for creating a contaminating aerosol when the cap and the vessel are physically separated from one another, possibly leading to false positives or exaggerated results in other specimens being simultaneously or subsequently assayed in the same general work area through cross-contamination.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Concerns with cross-contamination are especially acute when the assay being performed involves nucleic acid detection and an amplification procedure, such as the well-known polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or a transcription based amplification system (TAS), such as transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) or strand displacement amplification (SDA). Since amplification is intended to enhance assay sensitivity by increasing the quantity of targeted nucleic acid sequences present in a specimen, transferring even a minute amount of specimen from another container, or target nucleic acid from a positive control sample, to an otherwise negative specimen could result in a false-positive result.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A pierceable cap can relieve the labor of removing screw caps prior to testing, which in the case of high throughput instruments, may be considerable. A pierceable cap can minimize the potential for creating contaminating specimen aerosols and may limit direct contact between specimens and humans or the environment. Certain caps with only a frangible layer, such as foil, covering the vessel opening may cause contamination by jetting droplets of the contents of the vessel into the surrounding environment when pierced. When a sealed vessel is penetrated by a transfer device, the volume of space occupied by a fluid transfer device will displace an equivalent volume of air from within the collection device. In addition, temperature changes can lead to a sealed collection vessel with a pressure greater than the surrounding air, which is released when the cap is punctured. Such air displacements may release portions of the sample into the surrounding air via an aerosol or bubbles. It would be desirable to have a cap that permits air to be transferred out of the vessel in a manner that reduces or eliminates the creation of potentially harmful or contaminating aerosols or bubbles.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Other existing systems have used absorptive penetrable materials above a frangible layer to contain any possible contamination, but the means for applying and retaining this material adds cost. In other systems, caps may use precut elastomers for a pierceable seal, but these caps may tend to leak. Other designs with valve type seals have been attempted, but the valve type seals may cause problems with dispense accuracy.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Ideally, a cap may be used in both manual and automated applications, and would be suited for use with pipette tips made of a plastic material.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Generally, needs exist for improved apparatus and methods for sealing vessels with caps during transport, insertion of a transfer device, resealing and storage of samples after initial testing, additional transfer of sample from the vessel after storage, or transfer of samples. Improvements in replacement caps that have already been accessed, which may need to be sealed and stored for future access is also described.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Embodiments of the present invention solve some of the problems and/or overcome many of the drawbacks and disadvantages of the prior art by providing an apparatus and method for sealing vessels with pierceable caps.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Certain embodiments of the invention accomplish this by providing a pierceable cap apparatus including a shell, an access port in the shell for allowing passage of at least part of a transfer device through the access port, wherein the transfer device transfers a sample specimen, a lower frangible layer disposed across the access port for preventing transfer of the sample specimen through the access port prior to insertion of the at least part of the transfer device, one or more upper frangible layers disposed across the access port for preventing transfer of the sample specimen through the access port after insertion of the at least part of the transfer device through the lower frangible layer, one or more extensions between the lower frangible layer and the one or more upper frangible layers, and wherein the one or more extensions move and pierce the lower frangible layer upon application of pressure from the transfer device.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In embodiments of the present invention the lower frangible layer may be coupled to the one or more extensions. The one or more upper frangible layers may contact a conical tip of a transfer device during a breach of the lower frangible layer.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Embodiments of the present invention may include one or more upper frangible layers that are peripherally or otherwise vented.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In embodiments of the present invention the upper frangible layer and the lower frangible layer may be foil or other materials. The upper frangible layer and the lower frangible layer may be constructed of the same material and have the same dimensions. Either or both of the upper frangible layer and the lower frangible layer may be pre-scored.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Embodiments of the present invention may include an exterior recess within the access port and between a top of the shell and the one or more extensions.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The one or more upper frangible layers may be offset from the top of the shell or may be flush with a top of the shell.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A peripheral groove for securing the lower frangible layer within the shell may be provided. A gasket for securing the lower frangible layer within the shell and creating a seal between the pierceable cap and a vessel may be provided.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In embodiments of the present invention the movement of the one or more extensions may create airways for allowing air to move through the access port. The one or more upper frangible layers may be peripherally vented creating a labyrinth-like path for the air moving through the access port.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Alternative embodiments of the present invention may include a shell, an access port through the shell, a lower frangible layer disposed across the access port, an upper frangible layer disposed across the access port, and one or more extensions between the lower frangible layer and the upper frangible layer wherein the one or more extensions are coupled to walls of the access port by one or more coupling regions.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In another alternate embodiment, a single frangible seal is seated within a shell. In these embodiments, the seal is configured to address the problems that derive from the fact that the volume of the transfer device (e.g., a pipette) is much larger than the vessel containing the specimen. In certain embodiments, such seals are made of a material that forms a seal around the transfer device when the seal is initially pierced (to prevent the backsplash of fluid from the vessel during piercing) but allows for venting from the vessel only after the initial piercing. In other embodiments, the frangible seal is not required to seal around the transfer device to prevent aerisolization upon piercing, for the narrowing portion of the seal itself serves to prevent the undesired backsplash as described in further detail below. For venting, the seal is provided with a preferably asymmetric tearable portions that are disposed on structural ribs on the underside of the seal. However, symmetric tearable portions are also contemplated. The weakened portions tear in a manner that does not permit venting upon the initial pierce, but, as the transfer device is advanced through the seal, venting will occur because of the asymmetry in the tearable portion. The design leverages the use of a tapered transfer device, wherein the tip (distal portion) of the transfer device has the smallest diameter. The increasing thickness of the transfer device causes the weakened portions to tear, and those tears permit desired venting during transfer, but not during the initial piercing of the frangible seal. During initial piercing, venting from the vessel can only occur through the transfer device, and not through the frangible seal. In an alternate embodiment, the seal and shell are a unitary structure as contemplated herein.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In another alternative embodiment, the frangible seal is configured so that its circumference narrows as it extends into the vessel from the cap in which it is seated. This narrowing serves a two-fold purpose of guiding the transfer device to the weakened portion for insertion through the seal and (as noted above) preventing specimen backsplash during the initial piercing. The narrowing portion may have a circumferential band, either integral to the seal or configured as an o-ring, that exerts an upward pressure on the narrowing portion, causing it to close up when the transfer device is removed from the vessel, working to substantially reseal the transfer device after sample transfer. The walls of this narrowing section may also close on each other after the initial puncture to effect resealing of the closure.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Embodiments of the present invention may also include a method of piercing a cap including providing a pierceable cap comprising a shell, an access port through the shell, a lower frangible layer disposed across the access port, an upper frangible layer disposed across the access port, and one or more extensions between the lower frangible layer and the upper frangible layer wherein the one or more extensions are coupled to walls of the access port by one or more coupling regions, inserting a transfer device into the access port, applying pressure to the one or more upper frangible layers to breach the one or more upper frangible layers, applying pressure to the one or more extensions with the transfer device wherein the one or more extensions rotate around the one or more coupling regions to contact and breach the lower frangible layer, and further inserting the transfer device through the access port.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In additional embodiments, the pierceable cap may contain a shell adapted to couple with a sample vessel, and that shell may also contain an access port in the shell, which allows for passage of a fluid transfer device, such as a pipette. The cap may also contain a penetrable seal having walls, wherein those walls form a bottom surface that an openable slitted portion adapted to be closed when the pierceable cap is fastened to a sample vessel.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In other embodiments, the pierceable caps may contain an annular ring from which extend the walls with lower surfaces having protuberances that may be configured to be compressed against a sample vessel when the pierceable cap is fastened to the sample vessel. This compression occurs as the cap is screwed onto the vessel and causes the openable slitted portion to close. The openable slitted portion may be a tearable slitted portion or an unjoined slit.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In yet another embodiment, a pierceable cap may have an elastomeric shell containing locking structures for securing the shell to a vessel, and may also have a resilient access port in the shell for allowing passage of at least part of a transfer device. The cap may also contain a frangible layer with cross slits disposed across the access port which may prevent transfer of the sample specimen through the access port before insertion of at least part of the transfer device.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The frangible layer may also have ribbed portions extending both inwardly and downwardly into the vessel which terminate in a bottom surface having weakened portions disposed thereon. These cross slits may be tearable webbed cross-slits or unjoined cross slits. The cap may also contain an o-ring configured on the shell to be disposed between the shell and a sample vessel, when the shell is seated on the sample vessel. The frangible layer and the o-ring may be one piece, and the ribbed portions of the frangible layer may serve to guide the transfer device to the slitted portions on insertion, and close upon each other when the transfer device is removed. This structural arrangement allows the slitted portion to be openable.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Additional features, advantages, and embodiments of the invention are set forth or apparent from consideration of the following detailed description, drawings and claims.

id="p-0078" num="0077">Some embodiments of the invention are discussed in detail below. While specific example embodiments may be discussed, it should be understood that this is done for illustration purposes only. A person skilled in the relevant art will recognize that other components and configurations may be used without parting from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Embodiments of the present invention may include a pierceable cap for closing a vessel containing a sample specimen. The sample specimen may include diluents for transport and testing of the sample specimen. A transfer device, such as, but not limited to, a pipette, may be used to transfer a precise amount of sample from the vessel to testing equipment. A pipette tip may be used to pierce the pierceable cap. A pipette tip is preferably plastic, but may be made of any other suitable material. Scoring the top of the vessel can permit easier piercing. The sample specimen may be a liquid patient sample or any other suitable specimen in need of analysis.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">A pierceable cap of the present invention may be combined with a vessel to receive and store sample specimens for subsequent analysis, including analysis with nucleic acid-based assays or immunoassays diagnostic for a particular pathogenic organism. When the sample specimen is a biological fluid, the sample specimen may be, for example, blood, urine, saliva, sputum, mucous or other bodily secretion, pus, amniotic fluid, cerebrospinal fluid or seminal fluid. However, the present invention also contemplates materials other than these specific biological fluids, including, but not limited to, water, chemicals and assay reagents, as well as solid substances which can be dissolved in whole or in part in a fluid milieu (e.g., tissue specimens, tissue culture cells, stool, environmental samples, food products, powders, particles and granules). Vessels used with the pierceable cap of the present invention are preferably capable of forming a substantially leak-proof seal with the pierceable cap and can be of any shape or composition, provided the vessel is shaped to receive and retain the material of interest (e.g., fluid specimen or assay reagents). Where the vessel contains a specimen to be assayed, it is important that the composition of the vessel be essentially inert so that it does not significantly interfere with the performance or results of an assay.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Embodiments of the present invention may lend themselves to sterile treatment of cell types contained in the vessel. In this manner, large numbers of cell cultures may be screened and maintained automatically. In situations where a cell culture is intended, a leak-proof seal is preferably of the type that permits gases to be exchanged across the membrane or seal. In other situations, where the vessels are pre-filled with transport media, stability of the media may be essential. The membrane or seal, therefore, may have very low permeability.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>G</figref> show an embodiment of a pierceable cap <b>11</b>. The pierceable cap <b>11</b> may include a shell <b>13</b>, a frangible layer <b>15</b>, and, optionally, a gasket <b>17</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The shell <b>13</b> may be generally cylindrical in shape or any other shape suitable for covering an opening <b>19</b> of a vessel <b>21</b>. The shell <b>13</b> is preferably made of plastic resin, but may be made of any suitable material. The shell <b>13</b> may be molded by injection molding or other similar procedures. Based on the guidance provided herein, those skilled in the will be able to select a resin or mixture of resins having hardness and penetration characteristics which are suitable for a particular application, without having to engage in anything more than routine experimentation. Additionally, skilled artisans will realize that the range of acceptable cap resins will also depend on the nature of the resin or other material used to form the vessel <b>21</b>, since the properties of the resins used to form these two components will affect how well the cap <b>11</b> and vessel <b>21</b> can form a leak proof seal and the ease with which the cap can be securely screwed onto the vessel. To modify the rigidity and penetrability of a cap, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the molded material may be treated, for example, by heating, irradiating or quenching. The shell <b>13</b> may have ridges or grooves to facilitate coupling of the cap <b>11</b> to a vessel <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The cap <b>11</b> may be injection molded as a unitary piece using procedures well known to those skilled in the art of injection molding, including a multi-gate process for facilitating uniform resin flow into the cap cavity used to form the shape of the cap.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The vessel <b>21</b> may be a test tube, but may be any other suitable container for holding a sample specimen.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The frangible layer <b>15</b> may be a layer of material located within an access port <b>23</b>. For the purposes of the present invention, &#x201c;frangible&#x201d; means pierceable or tearable. Preferably, the access port <b>23</b> is an opening through the shell <b>13</b> from a top end <b>37</b> of the shell <b>13</b> to an opposite, bottom end <b>38</b> of the shell <b>13</b>. If the shell <b>13</b> is roughly cylindrical, then the access port <b>23</b> may pass through the end of the roughly cylindrical shell <b>13</b>. The access port <b>23</b> may also be roughly cylindrical and may be concentric with a roughly cylindrical shell <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The frangible layer <b>15</b> may be disposed within the access port <b>23</b> such that transfer of the sample specimen through the access port is reduced or eliminated. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>G</figref>, the frangible layer <b>15</b> is a diaphragm. Preferably, the frangible layer <b>15</b> is a thin, multilayer membrane with a consistent cross-section. Alternative frangible layers <b>15</b> are possible. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>, not shown to scale, are exemplary frangible layers <b>15</b> in the form of diaphragms. The frangible layer <b>15</b> is preferably made of rubber, but may be made of plastic, foil, combinations thereof or any other suitable material. The frangible layer may also be a Mylar or metal coated Mylar fused, resting, or partially resting upon an elastic diaphragm. A diaphragm may also serve to close the access port <b>23</b> after a transfer of the sample specimen to retard evaporation of any sample specimen remaining in the vessel <b>21</b>. The frangible layer <b>15</b> may be thinner in a center <b>57</b> of the frangible layer <b>15</b> or in any position closest to where a break in the frangible layer <b>15</b> is desired. The frangible layer <b>15</b> may be thicker at a rim <b>59</b> where the frangible layer <b>15</b> contacts the shell <b>13</b> and/or the optional gasket <b>17</b>. Alternatively, the frangible layer <b>15</b> may be thicker at a rim <b>59</b> such that the rim <b>59</b> of the frangible layer <b>15</b> forms a functional gasket within the shell <b>13</b> without the need for the gasket <b>17</b>. The frangible layer <b>15</b> is preferably symmetrical radially and top to bottom such that the frangible layer <b>15</b> may be inserted into the cap <b>11</b> with either side facing a well <b>29</b> in the vessel <b>21</b>. The frangible layer <b>15</b> may also serve to close the access port <b>23</b> after use of a transfer device <b>25</b>. A peripheral groove <b>53</b> may be molded into the shell <b>13</b> to secure the frangible layer <b>15</b> in the cap <b>11</b> and/or to retain the frangible layer <b>15</b> in the cap <b>11</b> when the frangible layer <b>15</b> is pierced. The peripheral groove <b>53</b> in the cap <b>11</b> may prevent the frangible layer <b>15</b> from being pushed down into the vessel <b>21</b> by a transfer device <b>25</b>. One or more pre-formed scores or slits <b>61</b> may be disposed in the frangible layer <b>15</b>. The one or more preformed scores or slits <b>61</b> may facilitate breaching of the frangible layer <b>15</b>. The one or more preformed scores or slits <b>61</b> may be arranged radially or otherwise for facilitating a breach of the frangible layer <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The frangible layer <b>15</b> may be breached during insertion of a transfer device <b>25</b>. Breaching of the frangible layer <b>15</b> may include piercing, tearing open or otherwise destroying the structural integrity and seal of the frangible layer <b>15</b>. The frangible layer <b>15</b> may be breached by a movement of one or more extensions <b>27</b> around or along a coupling region <b>47</b> toward the well <b>29</b> in the vessel <b>21</b>. The frangible layer <b>15</b> may be disposed between the one or more extensions <b>27</b> and the vessel <b>21</b> when the one or more extensions <b>27</b> are in an initial position.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In certain embodiments, the frangible layer <b>15</b> and the one or more extensions <b>27</b> may be of a unitary construction. In some embodiments, the one or more extensions <b>27</b> may be positioned in a manner to direct or realign a transfer device <b>25</b> so that the transfer device <b>25</b> may enter the vessel <b>21</b> in a precise orientation. In this manner, the transfer device <b>25</b> may be directed to the center of the well <b>29</b>, down the inner side of the vessel <b>21</b> or in any other desired orientation.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In embodiments of the present invention, the one or more extensions <b>27</b> may be generated by pre-scoring a pattern, for example, a &#x201c;+&#x201d; in the pierceable cap <b>11</b> material. In alternative embodiments, the one or more extensions <b>27</b> may be separated by gaps. Gaps may be of various shapes, sizes and configuration depending on the desired application. In certain embodiments, the pierceable cap <b>11</b> may be coated with a metal, such as gold, through a vacuum metal discharge apparatus or by paint. In this manner, a pierced cap may be easily visualized and differentiated from a non-pierced cap by the distortion in the coating.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The one or more extensions <b>27</b> may be integrally molded with the shell <b>13</b>. The one or more extensions <b>27</b> may have different configurations depending on the use. The one or more extensions <b>27</b> may be connected to the shell <b>13</b> by the one or more coupling regions <b>47</b>. The one or more extensions <b>27</b> may include points <b>49</b> facing into the center of the cap <b>11</b> or toward a desired breach point of the frangible layer <b>15</b>.

Either the frangible layer and/or the stiff extensions can be scored or cut; however, embodiments where neither is scored or cut are also contemplated. Frangible materials by themselves may not normally open any wider than a diameter of the one or more piercing elements. In many situations, the frangible material may remain closely in contact with a shaft of a transfer device. This arrangement may provide inadequate venting for displaced air. Without adequate airways or vents a transferred volume may be inaccurate and bubbling and spitting of the tube contents may occur. Stiff components used alone to seal against leakage can be hard to pierce, even where stress lines and thin wall sections are employed to aid piercing. This problem can often be overcome, but requires additional costs in terms of quality control. Stiff components may be cut or scored to promote piercing, but the cutting and scoring may cause leakage. Materials that are hard to pierce may result in bent tips on transfer devices and/or no transfer at all. Combining a frangible component with a stiff yet moveable component may provide both a readily breakable seal and adequate airways or vents to allow accurate transfer of a sample specimen without contamination. In addition, in some embodiments, scoring of the frangible layer will not align with the scoring of the still components. This can most easily be forced by providing a frangible layer and stiff components that are self aligning.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">Furthermore, changing the motion profile of the tip of the transfer device during penetration may reduce the likelihood of contamination. Possible changes in the motion profile include a slow pierce speed to reduce the speed of venting air. Alternative changes may include aspirating with the pipettor or similar device during the initial pierce to draw liquid into the tip of the transfer device.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> depicts another embodiment of a pierceable cap having a single frangible, membrane <b>502</b>. The membrane <b>502</b> has elastomeric properties and contains a thin webbing <b>507</b>, which provides a seal until it is pierced or otherwise breached by a transfer device. The webbing feature provides a structurally weakened membrane portion that controls how the seal splits, thus insuring proper function of the cap. This weakened membrane portion is achieved by making the membrane thinner in the portions designated for tearing. Alternatively, the membrane may be weakened by any other means known, such as perforations or scoring.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> depicts the pierceable cap shell <b>501</b>, the frangible membrane <b>502</b> and the vessel (tube) <b>503</b>. The o-ring feature <b>504</b> on the frangible membrane <b>502</b> is sealed to the tube by screwing the cap shell <b>501</b> along the threads <b>505</b>. The elastomeric membrane <b>502</b> has a cross slit <b>506</b> that is closed by a very thin web of elastomeric material <b>507</b>.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates a further embodiment, wherein the features illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> may be optionally combined with an upper frangible layer, such as a foil seal <b>508</b>.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">In the embodiments described above, the cap may consist of at least two components, an external shell and a frangible, membrane with elastomeric properties. The external shell <b>501</b> serves to secure the membrane to the vessel. In this embodiment, the membrane <b>502</b> provides a leak-proof seal that is reinforced by the threads <b>505</b> of the shell <b>501</b>.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">The membrane <b>502</b> may be separate or integral with the shell. The membrane contains a pre-made, slit geometry <b>506</b> that may be sealed by a thin membrane, or web of elastomeric material <b>507</b>, which may be a separate layer, or integrated within the membrane <b>502</b>. The seal is ruptured through the webbed slits <b>506</b> when accessed by a transfer device. The slit geometry <b>506</b> may be symmetrical, wherein both slits are the same length, or asymmetrical (as shown) where the slits vary in length and or proportion. As demonstrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>11</b></figref>, in one embodiment the slit geometry <b>506</b> may appear in a configuration resembling a cross. However, the present invention is by no means limited to any particular slit orientation or slit geometry. The outline of the slit orientation may also be thickened with more material in order to guide how the thin webbing tears.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">In the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> embodiment, the cap may also be configured to receive an o-ring <b>504</b>, which would fit within a recess <b>510</b> disposed on the interior surface of the shell <b>501</b>. The o-ring may be integral with the shell <b>501</b>, or a separate component.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">This o-ring <b>504</b> functions to form a liquid tight seal between the shell <b>501</b> and the vessel <b>503</b>. The seal formed by the o-ring <b>504</b> maintains sample integrity while preventing aerisolization and contamination caused by the escape of the sample contents from the vessel. It also provides a slit geometry without relying on a feature on the shell <b>501</b> to open the membrane <b>502</b>, such as extensions from the shell itself. In contrast to other embodiments described herein, the membrane taught by the present embodiment may be a single frangible layer, rather than multiple layers. The two part design allows for the control of the seal by the securing mechanism on the external shell <b>505</b>.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">The elastomeric material may be opened along the predetermined slit geometry <b>506</b> when accessed by the manual or automatic transfer device. As the elastomeric material used will be generally resilient and compliant, it functions to closely contact the tip of a transfer device, which drastically reduces or eliminates aerisolization and potential contamination. As the transfer device advances further into the vessel, through the slits, the slits will begin to tear, allowing for venting to occur. This venting further reduces the incidence of aerisolization and contamination. The slit geometry and webbing also increase the efficiency of any fluid pumping from the vessels themselves, as it serves to prevent the creation of a vacuum.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows another alternative embodiment of a one piece cap with an integrated frangible membrane <b>602</b> and an o-ring <b>604</b>. This embodiment is a departure from the other embodiments described herein, in that the frangible membrane <b>602</b>, o-ring <b>604</b> and shell <b>601</b> are constructed as a single piece, and not separate components. The present embodiment also does not require extensions for piercing the frangible membrane <b>602</b>. The one piece locking cap of the present embodiment contains coupling structures for securing, snapping, or locking the cap to a vessel or tube (&#x201c;locking structures&#x201d;) <b>605</b>. For purposes of this disclosure, the terms &#x201c;vessel&#x201d; and &#x201c;tube&#x201d; are used interchangeably. As noted above, the frangible membrane <b>602</b> is capable of being incorporated in the assembly structures previously described.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> depicts a cross-section view of the single cap assembled on the vessel <b>606</b> with a bottom view of the cap. The shoulder <b>610</b> at the top of the cap prevents the user from touching the sample membrane <b>602</b> as the cap is attached to the vessel <b>606</b>. The thin section <b>603</b> of the membrane <b>602</b> defines the tear geometry of the cap. The internal o-ring <b>604</b> seals to the inside of the tube and is chamfered for guiding the insertion of the cap on the vessel. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the o-ring <b>604</b> is configured to sit flush with the interior wall of the vessel <b>606</b>. The juxtaposition of the o-ring <b>604</b> and the vessel <b>606</b> create a seal, which prevents aerisolization of the sample and therefore reduces or eliminates contamination.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">In one variation, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the cap <b>601</b> may contain locking structures such as sawtooth or ratchet-like projections <b>605</b> on the, lower inside portions of the shell <b>601</b>. A triangular &#x201c;ratcheting&#x201d; feature in the cap is employed wherein the &#x201c;slant&#x201d; portion is oriented in the direction of insertion and the flat portion <b>615</b> is oriented in the direction of removal of the cap. The flat portion <b>615</b> then contacts the ridge <b>617</b> on the vessel. The flat portion <b>615</b> of the top projection contacts the bottom surface of the corresponding recesses <b>607</b> on the vessel <b>606</b>. In a preferred embodiment, there are three ridges <b>617</b> in place for seal redundancy, however, the number of ridges can vary.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">While the embodiments depicted herein are described as triangular sawtooth or ratchet-like projections, the actual structure can be any type commonly known that will lock or secure the cap to the vessel, including but not limited to ridges and threads. By applying a downward axial force to the cap, a dynamic seal between the cap and the vessel is created.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">This seal may be due, at least in part, to an internal expansion of the locking structures <b>605</b> that are engaged under the locking structures or recesses present on the vessel <b>607</b>.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">In another preferred embodiment, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B</figref>, the shell <b>608</b> may be configured with at least one elastomeric ridge <b>608</b> circumferentially disposed on the inner surface of the shell <b>601</b>. This ridge may be in the shape of a sawtooth structure, as described above. In this embodiment, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>, the elastomeric ridge(s) <b>608</b> may not mate with a corresponding structure on the sample vessel. Instead, a seal is provided between the vessel and the shell, by way of the elastomeric ridge(s) <b>608</b>. In this embodiment, the outer diameter of the vessel is larger than the inner diameter of the shell. In alternate embodiments, the vessel may contain one or more annular ridges (not shown) that may be positioned above the elastomeric ridge(s) <b>608</b> of the shell, when the shell is coupled to the vessel. The annular ridges on the vessel, while not required, may further prevent the cap from being inadvertently removed from the vessel.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">The embodiment of the cap depicted, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B</figref>, which is preferably composed of elastomeric or similarly &#x201c;elastic&#x201d; material is designed to possess a certain degree of elasticity. This property enables the cap to stretch or adapt to the outer diameter of the vessel. The cap described in this particular embodiment may be advantageous over a traditional &#x201c;hard cap&#x201d; that would require manual manipulation to place on and off. The cap of the present embodiment provides a liquid-tight seal that is maintained during handling and agitation of the vessel. The liquid in the sealed vessel may then be accessed by piercing the frangible membrane <b>602</b> of the cap. By virtue of the described locking mechanisms, the cap may be retained on the vessel even when a separation force is applied. The cap can maintain a liquid tight seal while a torsion and/or vibration force is applied to the vessel. The cap can be used as a primary cap or as a replacement cap after the contents of the vessel have been accessed on the vessel has otherwise been unsealed.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">The cap is configured such that its removal is unnecessary to access the liquid in the sample. Accessing liquid can be performed manually, or by using liquid handling automation, which is an improvement over a traditional screw cap. Such handling can be performed using any of the methods known in the art, but in preferred embodiments is done using the transfer devices described herein.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">The integrated frangible membrane <b>602</b> is intended to be punctured in such a way that it prevents sealing to the liquid handling apparatus, resulting in accurate manipulation of the liquid. The cap can therefore be handled without contaminating the membrane surface accessed by the liquid handling robot. The cap is easily manufactured with no assembly required.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">Contamination of the integrated membrane is prevented in part, by the shoulder <b>610</b> at the top of the cap, which is smaller than the diameter of the pressure pad of the thumb or forefinger of an average user. By virtue of this design, when applying the cap by placing a downward force on the top of the cap, the user does not contact the frangible membrane <b>602</b>. The elimination of this contact substantially reduces or prevents any contamination on the part of the user.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">The coefficient of friction between the frangible membrane and the pipette tip is sufficient to allow a transfer device to be easily inserted into or removed from the membrane.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">The manner in which the slits of the pierceable or frangible membrane tear, otherwise known as tear geometry, is an important factor for maintaining a proper liquid tight seal. The tear geometry in the present embodiment is controlled, at least in part, by a layer of membrane <b>603</b> in a precisely defined geometry that is multiple times thinner than the rest of the membrane. However, in further alternative embodiments the membrane portion <b>603</b> does not have to be thinner than the rest of the membrane <b>602</b>. This membrane portion <b>603</b> may be made of exactly the same material as the rest of the membrane <b>602</b>, or may be a different material. The geometry of the membrane portion <b>603</b> will define where the membrane tears when it is pierced. In one preferred embodiment, sealing around a pipette tip from a liquid handling robot is controlled by providing a cross slit geometry allowing the membrane to open in two directions. After being pierced by a transfer device, such as an automated robot, the slits close to form a liquid tight seal.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">The embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is optimized in part, by the fact that one slit is longer than the other. This configuration may further contribute to the reduction of leakage and aerisolization. The geometry functions to prevent sealing of the membrane to the pipette tip during sample access. The slit is forced to open unevenly causing air gaps along the long slit preventing a vacuum seal around the tip. This slit geometry also functions to provide venting so as to increase the pumping efficiency of fluid from the vessel, as it reduces or eliminates the creation of a vacuum within the vessel itself.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">In another embodiment, the cap employs an internal o-ring <b>604</b> at the undersurface of the membrane <b>602</b> and a three ridge redundant seal at the internal base of the cap while using a suitable elastomeric material that conforms to vessel geometries. For ease of assembly, the ridges <b>607</b> and the o-ring <b>604</b> are chamfered. The multi-surface redundant seal is present on both the inner and outer top surface of the tube, as well as below the locking structures on the tube at the pivot point of the dynamic movement of the cap on the tube during agitation.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">The one piece locking cap described herein is useful to eliminate several user steps of securing and removing screw caps on sample tubes, such as any commercial available buffer tubes. Once a sample is added to a sample vessel, the one piece locking cap is placed on the vessel with a downward axial motion. The vessel is then agitated in a multi-tube vortex that contains a stationary plate and a movable plate with the vessel and one piece locking cap placed between them.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">Typical sample buffers for molecular diagnostics contain high levels of detergent that can both lower the surface tension of the liquid allowing for a higher incidence of leaks as well as lubricate the surface of the thermoplastic/elastomeric parts. Once agitated the sealed vessel can then be accessed by a transfer device, such as the BD MAX instrument. The instrument will pierce the integrated frangible membrane with a pipette tip causing the thin layer of webbing to tear along the cross shaped pattern allowing for tearing in multiple directions and therefore preventing sealing to the pipette tip. The one piece locking cap is retained on the tube while the pipette tip is removed from the tube. Once removed from the tube, the integrated membrane closes, thus forming a functional liquid tight seal to prevent liquid spillage during further handling of the sample tube.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">The geometry of membrane portion <b>603</b> illustrated in another embodiment is directed to a pierceable cap for a vessel that maintains a spill-proof, leak-proof, or vapor-escape proof seal during sample transport, and storage and can be accessed by a manual or automated liquid handling robot that deploys transfer devices for aspirating the sample from the vessel. This embodiment mitigates the risk of sample splashing and aerisolization when the cap is pierced by the tip of the transfer device.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">In this embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>21</b></figref>, the cap may consist of an external shell <b>634</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>), and an elastomeric seal <b>612</b>. The shell and seal may be of separate or unitary construction. The seal in the present embodiment is designed to not tear upon insertion of a transfer device. Rather, the transfer device parts the walls <b>642</b> and <b>643</b>, of the elastomeric seal, thus creating a space <b>644</b> without permanently tearing the elastomeric material. This space enables the transfer device to access the sample contained within the vessel.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">The shell <b>634</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>) may be cylindrical in shape and contain at least one outer and inner surface, which extends in an axial direction.

Increasing the number of ribs may serve to increase the effectiveness of the set in guiding a transfer device into a vessel.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">In the illustrated embodiment, the ribs are arranged radially, in order to achieve an intersecting angle of 90&#xb0;. However, the ribs may be configured to intersect at any angle, relative to one another.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">In this embodiment, the bottom surface <b>626</b> may contain a slitted portion having tearable portion(s) <b>630</b>, which may be symmetrical or asymmetrical. The tearable portions <b>630</b> may be frangible and are designed to tear or puncture upon insertion of a sample transfer device. The tearable portion(s) <b>630</b> may be thinner than the rest of the seal, and may also contain a webbing integral within the seal, in accordance with the embodiments described in detail above.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">The ribs <b>620</b> and <b>621</b> may extend into the vessel both vertically and horizontally. They therefore act a guide to the penetration of the transfer device so, that the tearable portions <b>630</b> are initially pierced. Being made of suitably resilient material, the initially pierced seal seats around the transfer device. As a result, any venting of the vessel that occurs during the initial pierce may be through the transfer device. As the transfer device advances through the seal, the tearable portions tear further, allowing for venting around the transfer device and through the seal during sample transfer.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">Upon extraction of the transfer device, the support band, which has a circumference that may be slightly less than the outer circumference of the seal <b>612</b>, exerts an upward pressure on the inwardly extending sides <b>620</b>, causing them to join together and close upon the tears formed by the pierce of the transfer device. In other embodiments, the outer circumference of the support band and the outer circumference of the seal may be approximately the same.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b> through <b>21</b></figref> depict another embodiment of a pierceable cap made up of at least a seal <b>641</b>, and a shell <b>634</b> that combines elements to improve resealing performance. The seal may contain a slitted portion <b>640</b>, which may either contain one or both of an openable portion <b>644</b>, which is unjoined, or a frangible portion <b>645</b>. The seal <b>641</b> and shell <b>634</b> may be coupled to form the pierceable cap. The seal <b>641</b> may include an annular ring, or projection <b>646</b> that defines the outermost surface of the seal <b>641</b>, and projecting upward from the surface of the seal <b>641</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>. A complimentary annular protuberance <b>639</b> on the lower surface of the seal <b>641</b> is offset from the seal <b>641</b> perimeter. Further, the protuberance <b>639</b> may be positioned such that it sits between on the walls of the tube <b>631</b> and the shell <b>634</b> when assembled.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> depicts the relationship of the cap and vessel <b>631</b>, before the cap is fully screwed onto the vessel, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> demonstrates the structural and functional relationship after the cap has been fully screwed onto the vessel. The protuberances <b>639</b>, act in concert with the walls of the vessel <b>631</b>, (as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b> and <b>21</b></figref>) to close the seal sidewalls <b>642</b> and <b>643</b> upon each other and form a seal. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, as the cap is screwed further onto the vessel <b>631</b>, internal stresses are imposed on the sidewalls <b>642</b> and <b>643</b> of the seal <b>641</b>, and more particularly, on the protuberances <b>639</b>. The internal stresses create forces on the sidewalls of the seal <b>642</b> and <b>643</b> that urge the sidewalls <b>642</b> and <b>643</b> toward and into contact with each other.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">With the sidewalls <b>642</b> and <b>643</b> pressed upon each other in this manner to create a liquid seal, the design of the penetrable bottom portion of the seal may be accomplished in at least two possible ways. The first, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, is an openable seal. When the seal is in its native configuration, the apex of the sidewalls <b>642</b> and <b>643</b> do not touch each other at all but are openable, and instead form a very narrow slot <b>644</b> in a slitted portion <b>640</b>, just wide enough to facilitate injection molding. When assembled with the shell <b>634</b> and vessel <b>631</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, the sidewalls <b>642</b> and <b>643</b> are forced together to create the seal <b>650</b>. This embodiment may have the advantage of not being torn during tip insertion/penetration, thus limiting the potential for debris falling into the sample tube that may result from the tearing mechanism.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">The second embodiment seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> depicts a frangible seal <b>645</b> on or within the slitted portion, having a thin web of material that is torn on the first penetration of the pipette tip. In all other aspects, it performs identically to the seal described in the previous paragraph.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">Both of the embodiments of the seal in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b> and <b>19</b></figref> may be used in conjunction with a foil top seal <b>648</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, to improve durability for shipping and handling, and to serve as an additional barrier to aerosols during pipette insertion.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">In certain embodiments, the seal may be made of any material which is sufficiently resilient to form a seal around the outer circumference of the transfer device, such as a pipette, when initially pierced. However, since the inwardly and downwardly sloping ribs or sidewalls mitigate the risk of aerisolization upon initial piercing, sealing around the transfer device on initial pierce may not be required. In the illustrated embodiment, the seal <b>612</b>, <b>641</b> has an elastomeric membrane <b>614</b>, <b>645</b>. During initial piercing, the membrane <b>612</b>, <b>645</b> conforms to the circumference of the transfer device in a manner to prevent the above-described unwanted splashing or aerisolization of the sample from the vessel, thereby ensuring that the sample remains contained in the vessel during the initial piercing step.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">In one embodiment, the liquid transfer device is a pipette tip having a filter (not shown) contained therein. Upon insertion of the transfer device, there is a pause in its motion after piercing in order to allow any air pressure within the vessel to vent. The seal provides the leak-proof barrier and forces any venting at this stage through the transfer device and not around the transfer device.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> which shows the seal <b>612</b> in cross-section disposed in the vessel <b>521</b>. The external shell provides the locking mechanism to the liquid vessel and insures that the seal remains in place during storage and transport as well as protecting the seal from being damaged and therefore compromised.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">In yet another embodiment of the present invention, a method is provided for advancing at least a portion of a transfer device into the access port of a shell, which is secured to a sample vessel. As the transfer device enters the access port, it is advanced distally and guided, in part, by one or more ribs. The transfer device is advanced towards the webbing contained in the bottom surface of the seal, and ultimately punctures the webbing, in order to acquire access to the sample.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">Furthermore, changing the motion profile of the tip of the transfer device during penetration may reduce the likelihood of contamination. Possible changes in the motion profile include a slow pierce speed to reduce the speed of venting air. Alternative changes may include aspirating with the pipette or similar device during the initial pierce to draw liquid into the tip of the transfer device.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">Although the foregoing description is directed to the preferred embodiments of the invention, it is noted that other variations and modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art, and may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Moreover, features described in connection with one embodiment of the invention may be used in conjunction with other embodiments, even if not explicitly stated above.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-01-20" num="01-20"><claim-text><b>1</b>-<b>20</b>.
