description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to compositions and methods for potentiating glutathione enhancement for use in brain health. In particular, the compositions and methods of the invention are beneficial for use in subjects in need of increasing motivational performance and/or mental energy, functions that may be decreased upon stress and anxiety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Glutathione (GSH) is an essential antioxidant used by the body to prevent cellular and tissue damage. It is involved in many fundamental metabolic processes ranging from the nitric oxide cycle to dietary mineral incorporation. Additionally, glutathione is instrumental for cells to regulate their division and their differentiation from progenitor cells into mature somatic cells.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As one of the body's core antioxidants, glutathione binds circulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) which can cause cellular and DNA damage if left unchecked. Reactive oxygen species, also known as free radicals, are byproducts of metabolism and can be broadly harmful to the body. To scavenge circulating ROS, glutathione binds to ROS thereby becoming oxidized. This means that glutathione prevents important cellular proteins or DNA from being oxidized, which can inhibit their function.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Increased oxidative damage and decreased glutathione levels are observed under situations of high energetic demand in the brain such as psychogenic stress.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">High concentrations of oxidized glutathione in the brain are a hallmark that the brain is in a compromised state, but high concentrations in the blood plasma may be considered to be healthy and normal. The reason is that oxidized glutathione must return to the bloodstream from the brain in order to discharge the ROS it carries into a metabolic processes which can make use of them constructively. Alternatively, the oxidized form of GSH can be locally reverted back into the reduced state by glutathione reductase or it can return from the brain to the bloodstream in order to discharge the ROS constructively. As such, high concentrations of oxidized glutathione in the brain may mean that there is not enough glutathione to remove all of the reactive oxygen species that are circulating, indicating severe levels of stress.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">By only measuring glutathione levels in blood plasma, one may erroneously assume that circulating glutathione is normal, even in cognitively impaired individuals. Only recently, it was recognized that cognitively impaired individuals have decreased glutathione levels in the brain, however, it is not known under what conditions glutathione levels in the brain may transiently change in normal healthy individuals related to their performance of different cognitive and motor tasks.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Direct supplementation with GSH is a challenging approach, particularly because it can be rapidly degraded in the liver into its constituent amino acids as well as be partially hydrolyzed and oxidized. Consequently, GSH bioavailability is limited following oral administration. Therefore, there is a need to find compositions and methods of increasing glutathione in the brain in situations of high energetic demand in the brain.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides compositions and methods for enhancement of glutathione levels in the brain. In particular, the present invention provides compositions and methods for enhancement of glutathione during high energy demands in the brain, for example, to be used to increase motivational performance and/or mental energy.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As mentioned above, direct oral administration of glutathione has limited bioavailable effectiveness.

Moreover, these numerical ranges should be construed as providing support for a claim directed to any number or subset of numbers in that range. For example, a disclosure of from 1 to 10 should be construed as supporting a range of from 1 to 8, from 3 to 7, from 1 to 9, from 3.6 to 4.6, from 3.5 to 9.9, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0083">As used herein and in the appended claims, the singular form of a word includes the plural, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, the references &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are generally inclusive of the plurals of the respective terms.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0084">Similarly, the words &#x201c;comprise,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; and &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; are to be interpreted inclusively rather than exclusively. Likewise, the terms &#x201c;include,&#x201d; &#x201c;including&#x201d; and &#x201c;or&#x201d; should all be construed to be inclusive, unless such a construction is clearly prohibited from the context. However, the embodiments provided by the present disclosure may lack any element that is not specifically disclosed herein. Thus, a disclosure of an embodiment defined using the term &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; is also a disclosure of embodiments &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; and &#x201c;consisting of&#x201d; the disclosed components.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0085">Where used herein, the term &#x201c;example,&#x201d; particularly when followed by a listing of terms, is merely exemplary and illustrative, and should not be deemed to be exclusive or comprehensive. Any embodiment disclosed herein can be combined with any other embodiment disclosed herein unless explicitly indicated otherwise.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0086">The &#x201c;subject&#x201d; or &#x201c;individual&#x201d; of the present invention is an human adult subject, preferably a healthy adult with the need to improve motivational performance through modulating glutathione levels in the brain. The compositions of the invention may be beneficially used for increasing glutathione level in the brain, in particular, the nucleus accumbens for preventing or treating conditions or diseases which are characterized by low glutathione levels in the brain, whether transient or chronic.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0087">In biology and psychology, the term &#x201c;stress&#x201d; refers to the consequence of the failure of a human or other animal to respond appropriately to physiological, emotional, or physical threats, whether actual or imagined. The psychobiological features of stress may present as manifestations of oxidative stress, i.e., an imbalance between the production and manifestation of reactive oxygen species and the ability of a biological system readily to detoxify the reactive intermediates or to repair the resulting damage. Disturbances in the normal redox state of tissues can cause toxic effects through the production of peroxides and free radicals that damage all of the components of the cell, including proteins, lipids, and DNA. Some reactive oxidative species can even act as messengers through a phenomenon called &#x201c;redox signaling.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0086" num="0088">&#x201c;Reactive oxygen species&#x201d; play important roles in cell signaling, a process termed redox signaling. Thus, to maintain proper cellular homeostasis a balance must be struck between reactive oxygen production and consumption. One source of reactive oxygen under normal conditions in humans is the leakage of activated oxygen from mitochondria during oxidative phosphorylation. Other enzymes capable of producing superoxide (O2-) are xanthine oxidase, NADPH oxidases and cytochromes P450. Hydrogen peroxide, another strong oxidizing agent, is produced by a wide variety of enzymes including several oxidases.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0089">The terms &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; and &#x201c;treating&#x201d; include any effect that results in the improvement of the condition or disorder, for example lessening, reducing, modulating, or eliminating the condition or disorder. The term does not necessarily imply that a subject is treated until total recovery. Non-limiting examples of &#x201c;treating&#x201d; or &#x201c;treatment of&#x201d; a condition or disorder include: (1) inhibiting the condition or disorder, i.e., arresting the development of the condition or disorder or its clinical symptoms and (2) relieving the condition or disorder, i.e., causing the temporary or permanent regression of the condition or disorder or its clinical symptoms. A treatment can be patient- or doctor-related.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0090">The terms &#x201c;prevention&#x201d; or &#x201c;preventing&#x201d; mean causing the clinical symptoms of the referenced condition or disorder to not develop in an individual that may be exposed or predisposed to the condition or disorder but does not yet experience or display symptoms of the condition or disorder. The terms &#x201c;condition&#x201d; and &#x201c;disorder&#x201d; mean any disease, condition, symptom, or indication.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0091">The relative terms &#x201c;improved,&#x201d; &#x201c;increased,&#x201d; &#x201c;enhanced&#x201d; and the like refer to the effects of the composition on increasing glutathione in the brain, in particular in the nucleus accumbens region of the brain, and subsequently improving the cognitive or motor performance in the individual subject.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0092">&#x201c;Motivational performance&#x201d; is synonymous with the terms &#x201c;mental energy&#x201d; and related terms of &#x201c;volition&#x201d;, &#x201c;will-power&#x201d;, &#x201c;time-on-task&#x201d;, &#x201c;persistence&#x201d;, &#x201c;self-control&#x201d;, &#x201c;sustained effort&#x201d;, and &#x201c;self-efficacy&#x201d;. All these terms relate to a person's drive to initiate and do things. Motivational performance is linked to subjectively perceived self-efficacy and well-being.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0093">Motivational performance describes the subjective perception of mental resources available, which in turn is linked to cognitive functioning (Egan et al. (2015) Personality &#x26; Social Psychology Bulletin, 41(3), 336-350). For example, motivational performance is reduced in states of depression and anxiety (O'Connor et al. (2006) Nutrition Reviews, 64(7 Pt 2), S2-6).</p><p id="p-0092" num="0094">Measurement of &#x201c;motivational performance&#x201d; can be by both motor tasks and cognitive tasks. Typically, these motor tasks and cognitive tasks are performed under incentivized conditions, meaning that individuals get an incentive depending on their performance of the task.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0095">For example, a motor task under incentivized conditions may be measured as an individual's ability to perform a strenuous motor task, e.g. squeezing a handgrip measuring both force and endurance wherein the performance is normalised for individual muscular strength (Zhu et al. (2019) NeuroImage. Clinical, 23, 101922).</p><p id="p-0094" num="0096">For example, a cognitive task under incentivized conditions may be an individual's ability to perform a strenuous cognitive task, e.g. continuous/sustained attention and working memory (e.g. Unsworth et al. (2019) Journal of Experimental Psychology. Learning, Memory, and Cognition), mental arithmetic, or spatial reasoning (e.g. Nagase et al. (2015) Journal of the Society for Neuroscience, 38(10), 2631-2651) wherein the performance is normalised for individual capacity to perform this task.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0097">In animals, such as rodents, measurement of &#x201c;motivational performance&#x201d; is measured through motor tasks such as the forced swim test or cognitive tasks such as social dominance test or operant conditioning. Motivational performance can also be measured in relation to anxiety in tests such as &#x201c;elevated plus maze&#x201d; (e.g. Hollis et al. (2018) Neuropharmacology, 138, 245-256) and &#x201c;open field and novel object&#x201d; (e.g. Toledo-Rodgriguez and Sandi, (2011) Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience, 5, 17).</p><p id="p-0096" num="0098">The &#x201c;nucleus accumbens&#x201d; is the most ventral part of the striatum and is mainly connected to the limbic system. As a functionally central structure between amygdala, basal ganglia, mesolimbic dopaminergic regions, mediodorsal thalamus and prefrontal cortex, the nucleus accumbens appears to play a modulative role in the flow of the information from the amygdaloid complex to these regions. Together with the prefrontal cortex and amygdala, nucleus accumbens consists a part of the cerebral circuit which regulates functions associated with effort or motivated performance. It is anatomically located in a unique way to serve emotional and behavioral components of feelings. It is considered as a neural interface between motivation and action, having a key-role in food intake, sexual behavior, reward-motivated behavior, stress-related behavior and substance-dependence (Mavridis, Psychiatriki. 2015 October-December; 25(4):282-94). The present invention has surprisingly found that a higher level of glutathione measured in the nucleus accumbens significantly correlates with improved motivational performance (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) while stress as measured by cortisol levels is negatively correlated with levels of glutathione in the nucleus accumbens (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0097" num="0099">The terms &#x201c;food,&#x201d; &#x201c;beverage&#x201d;, &#x201c;food product&#x201d;, &#x201c;beverage product&#x201d;, &#x201c;food composition&#x201d; and &#x201c;beverage composition&#x201d; mean a product or composition that is intended for ingestion by an individual such as a human and provides at least one nutrient to the individual.

To control for this aspect of task performance, we assessed state and trait anxiety with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) (Calixto et al., International Journal of Nanomedicine, 9(1), 3719-3735, 2014). Due to the previously reported role of social dominance on NAc mediated competitive behavior in rats (Hollis et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 112(50), 15486-15491, 2015), we controlled for this aspect with the Personality Research Form (PRF) dominance scale which measures dominance motivation in humans (Jackson, Personality research form manual. Research Psychologists Press, 1974). Likewise, we controlled for competitiveness with the revised competitiveness index capturing interpersonal competitiveness in everyday contexts (Houston et al. Psychological Reports, 90(1), 31-34, 2002), self-perceived social rank with the social comparison scale (Gilbert et al., New Ideas in Psychology, 13(2), 149-165, 1995), participants' physical fatigue (state and trait) and physical activity with the Mental and Physical State Energy and Fatigue Scales (SEF) (Loy et al., Physiology and Behavior, 153, 7-18, 2016). In addition to the above scales, we measured age, height, weight, computed the BMI and elicited individuals' maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), the latter procedure is described in the Methods below. Both before and at various time points during the experiment, saliva samples were collected using salivettes (Sarstedt).

Our modified MID version relied on exerting force on a hand grip or dynamometer (TSD121B-MRI, Biopac) at a threshold corresponding to 50% of the participant's maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). To set individuals' task threshold, each participant was instructed to exert as much force as possible on the dynamometer for 1 sec, repeated 3 times interspersed by breaks of 3 min each to allow for recovery (Voor et al., Journal of Motor Behavior, 1(3), 210-219, 1969). The highest out of the 3 values was used to calibrate the threshold for the handgrip force required to be exerted in the modified MID task. Force (in kilogram, kg) was recorded in Acknowledge 4.3 (BIOPAC Systems, United States). Visual signal inspection confirmed the absence of artefacts.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0201">Participants were comfortably seated in front of a computer screen at 90 cm distance and were instructed to keep the same right upper limb position (i.e., upper arm and forearm at 90&#xb0; angle and hand extended) whenever using the dynamometer. The signal recorded with the dynamometer, linearly proportional to the exerted force (in kg), was fed back to the stimuli presentation PC (running the MID task in E-Prime) in real-time. The task was run in 2 blocks with a 3 min break between the 2 blocks. Each block contained 2 sessions and each session had twenty trials: 5 incentivized trials of each of the different incentives (0.2, 0.5, 1) in a random order, and 5 non-incentivized rest trials interspersed within every 3 incentivized trials. Our modified MID task had eighty total trials. To earn the displayed incentives, the participant's 50% MVC threshold had to be reached within 2 sec and the force at or above the threshold maintained for another 3 sec. Performance was guided by visual cues on the screen that were adapting to participants' performance in real-time.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0202">During the task, trials started with a fixation cross (varying between 1-4 sec), followed by an anticipatory signal (3 sec) indicating the trial's incentive. To earn the monetary incentives, participants were instructed to exert force on the dynamometer. The beginning of the force exertion period was signaled by the appearance of a red circle around the fixation cross. If the established threshold (i.e. 50% of the participant's MVC force&#x2014;0.5 kg) was reached within 2 sec, the red circle was replaced by a green circle. The green circle also indicated that participants had to maintain the contraction force level above the threshold for 3 more seconds. If participants did not reach the threshold in the initial 2 sec or if the force level fell below the maintenance threshold during the 3 sec maintenance period, the trial was failed, and visualized by a red cross occurring on the screen. If the force was maintained for the required 3 sec, a green tick indicated successful task performance during a single trial. Total trial duration was fixed to 10 sec.

Animal physiology was maintained stable under 1.3%-1.5% isoflurane in a 1:1 air/oxygen mixture and was monitored for breathing (small animal monitor system: SA Instruments Inc., New York, N.Y., USA) and rectal temperature (circulating water bath). Body temperature was maintained at 36.5&#xb1;0.4_C and breathing rate ranged between 70-100 rpm. Maximal time under anesthesia was 2 h for each animal. Mice were scanned with a horizontal 14.1 T/26 cm Varian magnet (Agilent Inc., USA) and a homemade 1H surface coil in quadrature consisting of two geometrically decoupled loops used as radio frequency (RF) transceiver. Coronal T2-weighted fast spin echo (FSE) images were obtained (15 3 0.4 mm slices, TEeff/TR=50/2000 ms, averages=2) for volumes of interest (VOIs) localization. VOIs included medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) (1.7&#xd7;1.4&#xd7;1.2 mm3) and bilateral nuclei accumbens (NAc) (1.4&#xd7;4.1&#xd7;1 mm3). Field homogeneity was adjusted using first- and second order shims obtained using the FASTMAP protocol [49] to reach a water linewidth under 20 Hz. The VAPOR module was used for water suppression and outer volume suppression was performed to avoid spectra artifacts. Spectra were obtained using the spin echo full intensity acquired localized (SPECIAL) sequence on the target VOIs (TE/TR=2.8/4000 ms) [50] in blocks of 16 averages. Scan time was adjusted in order to obtain a satisfactory SNR (i.e. &#x3e;10) and was in average around 20 min for NAc and 25 min for mPFC. Spectra were frequency corrected using the Creatine (Cr) frequency peak at 3.03 ppm as reference and blocks were summed for quantification. The LCModel [51] method, which is based on a linear combination of metabolite resonance peaks, was used to quantify the spectra in the frequency domain. For each animal, nineteen individual metabolites together with the macromolecule signals were quantified [alanine (Ala), ascorbate (Asc), aspartate (Asp), gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), N-acetylaspartate (NAA), N-acetyl-aspartate glutamate (NAAG), glutathione (GSH), Cr, phosphocreatine (PCr), glutamate (Glu), glutamine (Gln), lactate (Lac), taurine (Tau), myoinositol (Ins), glycine (Gly), phosphorylcholine (PCho), glycerophosphocholine (GPC), glucose (Glc), phosphorylethanolamine (PE)]. An unsuppressed water spectrum was acquired before each MRS scan and was used as a reference for metabolite absolute concentration determination assuming 80% water content in the brain. Fitting reliability was determined using the Cram_er-Rao lower bound errors (CRLB). A threshold of CRLB % 20% was chosen for high concentrated metabolites and CRLB % 50% for low concentration metabolites.

Rats were then treated with either normal drinking water (vehicle) or N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) in the drinking water (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>A</figref>) at a dose that was previously shown to enhance GSH levels (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>B</figref>). Following 2 weeks of treatment, rats were given an additional 2 training sessions, followed 24 h later by a progressive ratio session designed to test their motivated behaviour. During this progressive ratio session, rats have to increasingly work harder to earn the saccharine pellet, as described in the methods below. NAC-treated rats made significantly more nose pokes during this session (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>C</figref>) and received a greater number of rewards (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>D</figref>). Finally, NAC-treated rats exhibited a significantly higher breakpoint level compared to vehicle-treated counterparts (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>E</figref>). The breakpoint is defined as the last step in the session where the animals received a reward and is a direct correlate of their willingness to exert an effort. A higher breakpoint indicates that the animal exerted greater effort during the session.</p><heading id="h-0051" level="2">Materials and Methods:</heading><p id="p-0250" num="0250">Animals: Adult male Wistar rats (Charles Rivers, Saint-German-Nuelle, France) weighing 250-275 gr at the beginning of the experiment were used for all experiments. Rats were individually housed in cages in housing colonies on a 12:12 h reversed light:dark cycle with lights on at 20:00, and lights-off at 8:00. Food and water were available ad libitum. Following a week of acclimatization to the animal facilities, rats were handled for 2 min per day for three days prior to the start of the experiments, in order to habituate to the experimenters.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0251">Operant conditioning: Ten days after introduction to the reversed day-night cycle, rats started training in a fixed ratio 1 reinforcement schedule (FR1). Operant chambers (Coulbourn Instruments, Holliston, Mass., US), placed in sound attenuating cubicles, were equipped with a grid, underneath which a tray with standard bedding material was placed for collection of feces and urine after each training session. Each chamber had one food tray and two ports placed on either side of the tray. A cue light was placed in each port and the food tray, whereas a house light was placed above the food tray. The right-hand side port of each chamber was designated as &#x201c;active&#x201d;, meaning that spontaneous nosepoking would result in the drop of one 45 mg food pellet (Bio-Serv, Flemington, N.J., USA) to the food tray. Upon nosepoking in the active port, the cue and house lights were turned off, while the tray light turned on and the pellet dropped to the food tray. The two ports remained inactive for 20 s, during which nosepokes would not result in the delivery of a new pellet. Subsequently, the chamber returned to its initial condition. Each training session lasted maximally two hours or until a rat acquired 100 pellets. Each rat received six training sessions (one training on each day for five consecutive days, followed by two days without training and one training session on day 8). Only rats that finished at least two training sessions acquiring 100 pellets before the two-hour mark were used for progressive ratio experiments.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0252">Subsequently, rats were treated with N-acetyl cysteine in the drinking water (500 mg/L) or continued having access to normal water (control). After two weeks of treatment, rats were exposed to another two days of FR1 training to ensure their training performance was similar to pre-treatment levels.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0253">To test motivated behaviour, rats were exposed to a progressive ratio reinforcement schedule (progressive ratio test). Progressive ratio sessions were identical to training sessions except that the operant requirement in each trial (T) was the integer (rounded down) of the function 1.4<sup>(T-1) </sup>starting at one nosepoke for the first three trials and increasing in subsequent trials for rats (Wanat et al. Nat Neurosci. 2013; 16(4):383-5). Progressive ratio sessions lasted two hours. Correct nosepokes (i.e. nosepokes in the active port and outside the timeout period, thus resulting in food delivery) were calculated to evaluate behavioural performance, as well as the number of acquired rewards and the last completed ratio (breakpoint).</p><heading id="h-0052" level="1">Example 8: GSH Increases after N-Acetyl Cysteine and L-Cysteine Administration in Medium Reduced in Cysteine and Methionine</heading><p id="p-0254" num="0254">To measure GSH increase after N-acetyl cysteine (Nac) and L-cysteine supplementation, rat primary astrocytes were cultured in medium depleted of methionine (a precursor of cysteine) and cystine but still supplemented with 15% FBS to not have a full depletion but rather a reduction of these amino acids. Experiments were performed only with the same batch of FBS to avoid any difference in amino-acid content amongst batches.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0255">Because standard DMEM is very high in cysteine and its precursor methionine, to see a full dynamic range in response to the supplementation we used a reduction in cysteine, however, not a total depletion as cysteine is still present in FBS. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> demonstrated that NAC and L-cysteine significantly increase the GSH intracellular level.</p><heading id="h-0053" level="1">Example 9: BSO an Inhibitor of Glutathione Modifies Motivational Performance</heading><p id="p-0256" num="0256">Investigation of the Nucleus accumbens was undertaken in cannulated rats which were then moved to a reverse light-dark cycle to recover for 10 days. Subsequently, they were trained in a fixed ratio 1 reinforcement schedule (FR1) for 8 days (six training sessions). Following the last FR1 session and 24 hours before a progressive ratio (PR) reinforcement schedule session, they were then infused in the Nucleus Accumbens with 1 &#x3bc;l of vehicle (saline) or buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) (7 &#x3bc;g/&#x3bc;l), the compound is known to reduce the levels of glutathione by inhibiting the gamma-glutamylcysteine ligase (GCL), the enzyme required in the first step of glutathione synthesis. Progressive ratio sessions were identical to training sessions except that the operant requirement in each trial (T) was the integer (rounded down) of the function 1.4(T&#x2212;1) starting at one nosepoke for the first three trials and increasing in subsequent trials for them (Wanat et al. Nat Neurosci. 2013; 16(4):383-5). Progressive ratio sessions lasted two hours. Correct nosepokes (i.e. nosepokes in the active port and outside the timeout period, thus resulting in food delivery) were calculated to evaluate behavioural performance, as well as the number of acquired rewards and the last completed ratio (breakpoint). All experiments were performed with the approval of the Cantonal Veterinary Authorities (Vaud, Switzerland).</p><heading id="h-0054" level="2">Results</heading><p id="p-0257" num="0257">A single injection of BSO 24 hours before the test reduced GSH levels by 29% in the Nucleus Accumbens (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>). This resulted in decreased performance of the BSO-treated compared to the vehicle-treated animals in the operant conditioning paradigm (PR-schedule).
