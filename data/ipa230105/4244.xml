A capacitance-sensing system can be configured to measure a self-capacitance between a sensor electrode and its surrounding environment or a mutual capacitance between a first sensor electrode and a second sensor electrode. In the self-capacitance case, the surrounding environment can include an object (e.g., a finger) in proximity to or contacting the cover member. In the self-capacitance case, the presence of a water droplet in proximity to or contacting the cover member does not significantly change the capacitance, compared to only air being present. In the mutual capacitance case, the object in proximity to or contacting the cover member near the first sensor electrode and the second sensor electrode alters the mutual capacitance. In the mutual capacitance case, the object that causes the mutual capacitance to change can be a finger or a water droplet, for example. To measure the self-capacitance or the mutual capacitance, it is important that the cover member be electrically non-conducting.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Capacitance sensing is useful for detecting user input. However, there is a need to improve rejection of false signals and to provide more refined information such as force of touch.

The user-input system <b>100</b> includes a force-measuring device <b>20</b> implemented as packaged integrated circuits (IC). In the example shown, the force-measuring device <b>20</b> includes strain-sensing elements <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>. Each strain-sensing element <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> is configured to output voltage signals in accordance with a time-varying strain at each respective strain-sensing element. For example, the strain-sensing element can be a piezoelectric micromechanical force-measuring element (PMFE) or a piezoresistive element. The user-input system <b>100</b> also includes a cover member <b>120</b> and an elastic circuit board substrate <b>102</b> interposed between the force-measuring device <b>20</b> and the cover member <b>120</b>. The elastic circuit board substrate <b>102</b> is mechanically coupled to the cover member <b>120</b> and to the force-measuring device <b>20</b>. The force-measuring device <b>20</b> is mounted to and electrically connected to the elastic circuit board substrate <b>102</b>. In the example shown, the force-measuring device <b>20</b> is mounted to and electrically connected to the elastic circuit board substrate <b>102</b> at its first surface (bottom surface) <b>104</b>. For example, there are sensor electrodes <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> on or in in the elastic circuit board substrate <b>102</b>. An electrical wiring <b>113</b> electrically connects sensor electrode <b>112</b> to a circuit (signal processor <b>46</b>) in the force-measuring device <b>20</b>. An electrical wiring <b>115</b> electrically connects sensor electrode <b>114</b> to the signal processor <b>46</b>. The force-measuring device <b>20</b> can be attached to the elastic circuit board substrate by solder-bonding, for example. Additionally, other integrated circuits (IC), electrical components, and electromechanical components (e.g., a motor) can be mounted the elastic circuit board substrate <b>102</b> at the bottom surface <b>104</b>. These other components are collectively labeled as <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0028">The cover member <b>120</b> has an exposed outer surface <b>124</b> and an inner surface <b>122</b> opposite the outer surface. The cover member <b>120</b> should be robust but should be sufficiently deformable such that a deformation of the cover member is transmitted to the strain-sensing elements in the force-measuring device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example of a contact point <b>119</b>, which is an area where the finger <b>118</b> contacts the outer surface <b>124</b> of the cover member <b>120</b> when touching, tapping, and/or pressing. The cover member <b>120</b> can be a robust material that deforms when pressed by the finger <b>118</b>. Examples of such robust materials are wood, glass, metal, plastic, leather, fabric, and ceramic. However, for user-input systems that are configured to measure self-capacitance or mutual capacitance, the cover member should be electrically non-conducting. In this case, the use of metal can be avoided. The cover member <b>120</b> could also be a composite stack of any of the foregoing materials. The elastic circuit board substrate <b>102</b> is adhered to or attached to the inner surface <b>122</b> of the cover member <b>120</b> by a layer of adhesive <b>108</b>, for example. The choice of adhesive <b>108</b> is not particularly limited if the elastic circuit board substrate <b>102</b> remains attached to the cover member.

In the example shown, small capacitance values were measured at the small grey circles <b>412</b> and large capacitance values were measured at the large grey circles <b>414</b>. Four adjacent sensor electrodes (large grey circles <b>414</b>) exhibited large capacitances. The large capacitance data (self-capacitance or mutual capacitance) measured at the sensor electrodes <b>414</b> exceeded a capacitance threshold and the small capacitance data (self-capacitance or mutual capacitance) measured at the sensor electrodes <b>412</b> did not exceed a capacitance threshold. The magnitude of the capacitance data exceeding a capacitance threshold can be one of the conditions for the signal processor to detect user input. For example, the capacitance threshold (self-capacitance or mutual capacitance) can be predetermined (e.g., determined at the time of programming the signal processor) or algorithmically determined (e.g., determined and changed from time to time by an algorithm).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">Depending on geometrical factors such as the sizes of the sensor electrodes and the distances between the sensor electrodes, a typical human finger might overlap all four sensor electrodes <b>414</b> exhibiting large capacitances or a typical finger might contact the cover member at a point in between the sensor electrodes <b>414</b>.

The force-imparting position varied between 0 and 100 arbitrary units. At each force-imparting position, a standardized force is applied. The standardized force is a force corresponding to a typical press by a finger, such as <b>7</b>.<b>5</b>N. The PMFE from which the PMFE voltage signals were output was located at position <b>438</b>, near 40 arbitrary units. The PMFE data <b>446</b> (black circles) are obtained by amplification, analog-to-digital conversion, and other signal processing of the PMFE voltage signals. The PMFE data <b>440</b> depend on the force-imparting point. The magnitude and/or the polarity of the PMFE data <b>440</b> can depend on a distance between the PMFE and the force-imparting point. The magnitude and/or the polarity of the PMFE data <b>440</b> can also depend on local mechanical properties of the cover member and the elastic circuit board substrate.

The magnitude of the PMFE voltage signals exceeding a force threshold can be one of the conditions for the signal processor to detect user input. For example, the force threshold can be predetermined (e.g., determined at the time of programming the signal processor) or algorithmically determined (e.g., determined and changed from time to time by an algorithm).

The haptic feedback position is the user-input position at which a finger contacts the cover member and senses the haptic feedback. The haptic feedback position varied between 0 and 100 arbitrary units. The haptic motor was located at position <b>466</b>, near 15 arbitrary units.

In the case of position-independent haptic feedback <b>470</b>, the haptic driver drives the haptic motor at constant amplitudes. Since the haptic feedback position (user-input position) varies and the distance between the haptic feedback position and the haptic motor position varies, the haptic feedback sensed by the finger varies.
