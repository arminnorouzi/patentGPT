Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an endoscope processor and an endoscope system capable of performing power feeding to and signal transmission and reception with a connector for endoscope in a non-contact manner.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, in the medical field, an endoscope has widely been used that allows observation of an organ within a body cavity or the like by inserting an elongated insertion portion into the body cavity. For displaying an observation image of the organ within the body cavity or the like on a monitor, an endoscope (electronic endoscope) has widely been used in which a solid image pickup device, such as a Charge Coupled Device (CCD), is disposed in an image pickup portion at the distal end or the rear end of the insertion portion of the endoscope.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A signal outputted from the image pickup device provided in the endoscope is turned into a video signal by an endoscope processor separate from the endoscope and outputted to the monitor. The connection between the endoscope and the endoscope processor is established with the insertion of a connector for endoscope provided in the endoscope into a receptacle that is a connector receiver provided in the endoscope processor. In other words, the connector for endoscope is provided with a plurality of electric contacts, such as an electric contact for power, an electric contact for image signal transmission, and an electric contact for control signal reception. Meanwhile, the receptacle of the endoscope processor is provided with a plurality of electric contacts corresponding to the respective electric contacts of the connector for endoscope. When the connector for endoscope is inserted into the receptacle, the electric contacts of the connector for endoscope are electrically connected to the electric contacts of the receptacle, so that the connection between the endoscope and the endoscope processor is established.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, a configuration of an endoscope system including an endoscope and an endoscope processor has been proposed in which the transfer of power and various signals between the connector for endoscope and the receptacle is realized in a non-contact manner (wirelessly) without using an electric contact. For example, Japanese Patent No. 6106142 discloses an endoscope system in which a connector for endoscope (first connector) is provided with a power receiving unit formed by a secondary coil, an image signal transmission unit including a light emitting element, and a signal transmission and reception unit including a light emitting element and a light receiving element, and a receptacle (second connector) is provided with a power supply unit formed by a primary coil, an image signal reception unit including a light receiving element, and a signal transmission and reception unit including a light receiving element and a light emitting element.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An endoscope processor according to one aspect of
