main components of a secondary battery.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, such an electrode assembly generates heat while undergoing the process of charging and discharging, and a temperature rise due to the generated heat deteriorates performance of the secondary battery.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, the cell body member in which the electrode assembly is accommodated is configured such that a cooling plate member for cooling, a heat sink, and the like, are connected thereto.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In particular, in the case of a secondary battery having the

secondary battery, a heat conductive member is provided between the cooling plate member and the cell body member.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">There has been research into such heat conductive members, involving adding an additive, or the like, to enhance heat conductivity; however, there are limits resulting from the addition of additives and use of comparatively expensive heat conductive materials for heat conductivity enhancement.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, there is also a problem in that there is a limit to increasing heat conductivity using properties of the additives
