Users can use their computing devices to, for example, interact with one another, access content, share content, and create content. In some cases, content items can include postings from users participating in a social networking system. The postings may include text and media content items, such as images, graphical interchange formats (GIFs), videos, and audio. In some cases, the postings may also include user generated content associated with an event or activity. The postings may be published to the social networking system for consumption by others.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In general, a social networking system can provide users with access to various content items. For example, the social networking system can provide users with access to content items through their content feeds. These content items may include pictures, video, posts, and/or other user generated content items. For example, a content item (or a post) containing one or more images taken by a user at an event can be made accessible to other users (e.g., friends of the user) through their content feeds. In some cases, users can interact with posted content items in content feeds. For example, users may comment, share, like, or otherwise interact with content items posted by other users. In general, for users to have access to and/or interact with content items posted by a particular user, the users and the particular user often share a connection in the social networking system. In some instances, a plurality of users may attend an event and may post content items relating to the event. In such instances, a user assessing content items may be presented with duplicate or similar content items in the user's content feed. For example, assume a wedding in which friends of the bride who are in attendance post various content items (e.g., pictures, videos, etc.) relating to the wedding to the social networking system. In this example, a friend who could not attend the wedding may want to view the posted content items. In this example, the friend may be presented with multiple threads of content items describing the wedding. Moreover, various user interactions between the friends and the bride (e.g., comments, likes, etc.) may be difficult for the friend to track or follow as these interactions may be spread over the multiple threads of content items. As such, conventional approaches to organize and present content items to users in their content feeds may not be helpful or coherent when a plurality of users post content items relating to a common event. Accordingly, conventional approaches may not be effective in addressing these and other problems arising in computer technology.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">An improved approach rooted in computer technology overcomes the foregoing and other disadvantages associated with conventional approaches specifically arising in the realm of computer technology. The present technology can generate a private space within a content sharing system, such as a social networking system, through which users can access content items and communicate with one another. The private space can be a space separate from a content feed or other surfaces of the social networking system. For example, users attending a barbeque may collectively post pictures and video of the barbeque to a private space created within the social networking system. In some embodiments, the content items posted to the private space are not displayed or otherwise accessible through other surfaces of the social networking system. In various embodiments, a private space can be generated based on satisfaction of one or more space creation criteria relating to user activity. For example, users may post content items relating to an event to the social networking system. Based on the posting of the content items, the social networking system may determine that the users are attending a common event and may generate a private space for the users to post and exchange content items and communications relating to the event. In some embodiments, once a private space has been generated, users can invite other users to the private space. For example, in one instance, users who are posting content items in a private space can invite other users to post content items to the private space. In another instance, the users can invite other non-posting users to view or interact with the posted content items. The invited users can be apprised of the private space via a notification, such as a notification provided in content feeds of the invited users. In some embodiments, various content items from users can be aggregated in a private space. For example, content items from a first user and content items from a second user can be organized in the private space for presentation. In some embodiments, users may interact with content items posted in a private space. For example, a first user may comment or like a content item posted by a second user in a private space. Likewise, the second user may comment or like a content item posted by the first user in the private space. In some embodiments, users can share content items posted in a private space. For example, a user may select one or more content items from a private space to share the selected content items with others outside the private space, subject to privacy restrictions of the content items. In some cases, the user can share the selected content items via another application, such as a messaging application. More details describing the present technology are provided below.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example system <b>100</b>, including an example private space module <b>102</b>, according to an embodiment of the present technology. In some embodiments, the private space module <b>102</b> can be implemented as part of a content sharing system, such as a social networking system. As shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the private space module <b>102</b> can include a space determination module <b>104</b>, a space generation module <b>106</b>, and a notification module <b>108</b>. In some instances, the example system <b>100</b> can include at least one data store <b>110</b>. The components (e.g., modules, elements, etc.) shown in this figure and all figures herein are exemplary only, and other implementations may include additional, fewer, integrated, or different components. Some components may not be shown so as not to obscure relevant details.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, the private space module <b>102</b> can be implemented, in part or in whole, as software, hardware, or any combination thereof. In general, a module as discussed herein can be associated with software, hardware, or any combination thereof. In some implementations, one or more functions, tasks, and/or operations of modules can be carried out or performed by software routines, software processes, hardware, and/or any combination thereof. In some cases, the private space module <b>102</b> or at least a portion thereof can be implemented using one or more computing devices or systems that include one or more servers, such as network servers or cloud servers. In some instances, the private space module <b>102</b> can, in part or in whole, be implemented within or configured to operate in conjunction with a social networking system (or service), such as the social networking system <b>630</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. In some instances, the private space module <b>102</b> can be, in part or in whole, implemented within or configured to operate in conjunction or be integrated with a client computing device, such as the user device <b>610</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The private space module <b>102</b> can be implemented as or within a dedicated application (e.g., app), a program, or an applet running on a user computing device or client computing system. The application incorporating or implementing instructions for performing some, or all, functionality of the private space module <b>102</b> can be created by a developer. The application can be provided to or maintained in a repository. In some cases, the application can be uploaded or otherwise transmitted over a network (e.g., Internet) to the repository. For example, a computing system (e.g., server) associated with or under control of the developer of the application can provide or transmit the application to the repository. The repository can include, for example, an &#x201c;app&#x201d; store in which the application can be maintained for access or download by a user. In response to a command by the user to download the application, the application can be provided or otherwise transmitted over a network from the repository to a computing device associated with the user. For example, a computing system (e.g., server) associated with or under control of an administrator of the repository can cause or permit the application to be transmitted to the computing device of the user so that the user can install and run the application. The developer of the application and the administrator of the repository can be different entities in some cases, but can be the same entity in other cases. It should be understood that many variations are possible.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, the private space module <b>102</b> can be configured to communicate and/or operate with the at least one data store <b>110</b>, as shown in the example system <b>100</b>. The at least one data store <b>110</b> can be configured to store and maintain various types of data. For example, the at least one data store <b>110</b> can store information describing various content that has been viewed, accessed, consumed, modified, or created by user or third party entities of the social networking system. In some implementations, the at least one data store <b>110</b> can store information associated with the social networking system (e.g., the social networking system <b>630</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). The information associated with the social networking system can include data about users, third party entities, social connections, social interactions, locations, geo-fenced areas, maps, places, events, pages, groups, posts, communications, content, feeds, account settings, privacy settings, a social graph, and various other types of data. In some implementations, the at least one data store <b>110</b> can store information associated with users or third party entities, such as user or third party entity identifiers, user or third party entity information, profile information, user or third party entity specified settings, content produced or posted by users or third party entities, and various other types of user or third party entity data.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, the private space module <b>102</b> can be configured to generate a private space based on user activity of users of a social networking system. In general, a private space can be a space or virtual location within the social networking system through which certain users can share and communicate with one another. Content items posted to the private space are not publicly accessible&#x2014;only users with access to the private space can, for example, view, comment, and/or share the content items posted to the private space. Users can interact with content items posted in the private space. For example, users can comment on or like content items posted by other users in the private space. In some cases, users can interact with other users in the private space. For example, users can message one another in the private space. In some embodiments, a private space can be generated based on user activity of users. In various embodiments, the user activity of the users can include activities relating to the users accessing content items in the social networking system. For example, user activity can include a determined location of a user while the user posts a content item to the social networking system. As another example, user activity can include a determined location of a user while the user comments on a post in the social networking system. In various embodiments, the user activity can include activities performed in the social networking system. For example, a user can plan an event using an event feature of the social networking system. The user can invite other users to the event using the event feature. In this example, user activity can include attendance by users at the event. Many variations are possible. In some embodiments, a private space can be generated when user activity of users satisfies one or more space creation criteria, as discussed in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The space determination module <b>104</b> can be configured to determine whether to generate a private space based on user activity of users satisfying one or more space creation criteria. The one or more space creation criteria can include, for example, a location criterion, an event criterion, and any other types of suitable criteria. In some embodiments, only users associated with user activity that satisfies the one or more creation criteria may access the private space. Users associated with user activity that does not satisfy the one or more space creation criteria do not have access to the private space. In some embodiments, the space determination module <b>104</b> can determine whether to generate a private space based on satisfaction of the location criterion. The location criterion relates to user activity associated with the location of users. For example, in some embodiments, the location criterion can be satisfied when the users participating in an event are posting content items relating to the event to the social networking system and are within a threshold distance from each other. The content sharing system can determine, based on various data (e.g., GPS data, image recognition applied to captured images or videos, etc.), that the users are within a threshold distance of one another. When the location criterion is satisfied, a private space can be generated for the users to post and share content items. As another example, in some embodiments, the location criterion can be satisfied when users are within a threshold distance from a geographical location. A private space can be generated for the users to post and share content items when the users are within the threshold distance from the geographical location. For instance, assume a first user and a second user are attending a wedding and post content items relating to the wedding to the social networking system. In this instance, because the first user and the second user are within a threshold distance from a geographical location associated with the wedding, the location criterion is satisfied and a private space can be generated for the two users to post and share content items relating to the wedding event. In some embodiments, the space determination module <b>104</b> can determine whether to generate a private space based on satisfaction of the event criterion. The event criterion relates to user activity associated with creating an event, for example, using a calendar feature of the social networking system. In various embodiments, users can create events (or gatherings) using the calendar feature of the social networking system. For example, a user may create a barbeque event, a picnic event, or a movie event using the calendar feature and invite friends of the user to participate through the social networking system. The satisfaction of the event criterion can be determined based on identifying users who are attending an event created through the social networking system. For example, a user can create a barbeque event through the social networking system. Users attending the barbeque event can be identified by the social networking system based on the users' acceptance of invitations to the barbeque event. When the event criterion is satisfied, a private space can be generated for the users and the user to post and share content items relating to the barbeque event. In some embodiments, a private space is generated upon satisfaction of one criterion or a combination of criteria. Many variations are possible.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The space generation module <b>106</b> can be configured to generate a private space in the social networking system for users. The space generation module <b>106</b> can generate the private space based on satisfaction of one or more space creation criteria as determined by the space determination module <b>104</b>, discussed above. A private space, in various embodiments, can be a page or other virtual location within the social networking system (e.g., separate from a content feed) in which content items and messages can be shared. In some instances, the content items may share a common theme or idea, or in some cases, relate to a common event. In some embodiments, the private space can be accessed by users from their content feeds. In some embodiments, the space generation module <b>106</b> can provide an invitation to a user to access content items posted in a private space. In some embodiments, the space generation module <b>106</b> can aggregate content items of users. In some embodiments, the space generation module <b>106</b> allows users in a private space to interact with content items posted in the private space.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the space generation module <b>202</b> can include an invitation module <b>204</b>, a content aggregation module <b>206</b>, a content interaction module <b>208</b>, and a content sharing module <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The invitation module <b>204</b> can be configured to invite users (e.g., invitees) of the social networking system to access content items posted in a private space. The invitation module <b>205</b> can invite an invitee to a private space based on a request from a user already participating in the private space to invite the invitee to the private space. For example, a private space for an event can be generated for participants of the event. In this example, a participant can invite other users of the social networking system to the private space. In some cases, the invitation module <b>204</b>, upon receiving a request from a participant in a private space, can invite an invitee to, for example, post, interact with, or communicate about content items in the private space.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The content aggregation module <b>206</b> can be configured to aggregate content items of users in a private space. In some embodiments, once a private space is created, the content aggregation module <b>206</b> can aggregate various content items posted by users to the private space. For example, a first user can post content items relating to an event to a private space for sharing. A second user also can post content items relating to the event to the private space. In this example, the content aggregation module <b>206</b> can combine, organize, or otherwise aggregate the content items from the first user and the second user in the private space. In some embodiments, the content aggregation module <b>206</b> can organize content items based on metadata associated with the content items. For example, content items from a first user may have earlier timestamps (e.g., capture times, post times) than content items from a second user. In this example, the content aggregation module <b>206</b> can organize content items in a private space such that the content items are presented in chronological order according to their timestamps. As another example, content items can be organized for presentation through the private space based on which user posted the content items to the private space. Many variations are possible.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The content interaction module <b>208</b> can be configured for users to interact with content items posted in a private space. For example, a private space associated with an event may include content items posted by users participating in the event. The users may interact with the content items posted in the private space. For instance, a user may comment on or like a content item posted by a second user, and vice versa. Further, in this instance, the second user may reply to the comment or the like from the first user. In some embodiments, the content interaction module <b>208</b> can allow non-posting users to interact with content items posted in a private space. For example, a non-posting user can be invited to the private space. In this example, the non-posting user can interact with (e.g., comment, like, etc.) the content items posted in the private space.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The content sharing module <b>210</b> can be configured for users to share content items posted in a private space. In some embodiments, the content sharing module <b>210</b> allows a content item posted in the private space to be shared through other surfaces of a social networking system. Such sharing can be subject to the privacy restrictions associated with the content items. For example, while browsing content items in a private space, a user can select one or more content items in the private space for sharing in one or more content feeds that are accessible to users who do not have access to the private space. In some embodiments, the content sharing module <b>210</b> allows the user to share content items posted in the private space by using another application. For example, a user can select one or more content items in a private space for sharing using a messaging application. In some embodiments, access to a private space can lapse or be terminated after passage of a predetermined period of time from the generation of the private space or first posting to the private space. Such predetermined period of time can be any selected duration of time, such as an hour, two hours, three hours, a day (e.g., 24 hours), a week, etc. In some embodiments, after passage of the predetermined time, the private space is no longer accessible to users and functionality of the private space is terminated (or expired). In some embodiments, after passage of the predetermined time, the private space is eliminated and no longer exists on the social networking system. Further, content items or messages posted to the private space are automatically deleted and no longer accessible to users after expiration of the private space.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> Illustrates an example functional block diagram <b>300</b>, according to an embodiment of the present technology. The functionality described in the example block diagram <b>300</b> is supported by the private space module <b>102</b>. A private space within a social networking system can be generated at block <b>302</b>. The private space can be generated based on user activity of users satisfying space creation criteria. The space creation criteria can include various criteria, such as a location criterion and an event criterion, as discussed above. Once the private space is generated, content items posted by the users can be aggregated at block <b>304</b>. The content items can be aggregated and, in some cases, organized based on metadata associated with the content items. In various embodiments, the users can interact with content items posted in the private space at block <b>306</b>. These interactions can include commenting or liking a content item posted in the private space. For example, a user can comment on a photo posted by another user and vice versa. As another example, a user can &#x201c;like&#x201d; a photo posted by another user. In some embodiments, the users can message one another in the private space. In some embodiments, content items posted in the private space can be shared through other surfaces of the social networking system subject to privacy restrictions of the content items. For example, the users may select one or more content items and the social networking system can share the selected content items through, for example, one or more content feeds. In some cases, the users may share the selected content items via a messaging application. In some embodiments, the users may invite other users (e.g., invitees) to access the private space. In such embodiments, a notification can be sent to users who are invited to access the private space. Many variations are possible.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> illustrates an example diagram <b>400</b>, according to an embodiment of the present technology. This example diagram <b>400</b> depicts a scenario supported by the private space module <b>102</b> in which a user can access a content item <b>402</b> through an application of a content sharing system, such as a social networking system. In particular, the content item can be accessed through a content feed <b>404</b> presented on a display of a computing device <b>406</b> (e.g., a smartphone, a tablet, etc.). In some embodiments, while the user is accessing content items through the content feed <b>404</b>, the social networking system can provide a notification <b>412</b> to the user that a private space has been generated (e.g., &#x201c;Happening Now&#x201d;). The private space is generated upon satisfaction of space creation criteria relating to user activities of users <b>414</b> connected to the user in the social networking system. The private space can correspond to an event, and the users <b>414</b> can post content items related to the event to the private space. The user can access the private space by selecting the notification <b>412</b>. For example, the user may touch or press the notification <b>412</b> to access the private space.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> illustrates another example diagram <b>440</b>, according to an embodiment of the present technology. This example diagram <b>440</b> depicts a scenario in which a user has selected a notification of a private space (e.g., the notification <b>412</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>) presented in a content feed of a social networking system (e.g., the content feed <b>404</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>). In some embodiments, upon a user selection (e.g., touch or press) of the notification, the user is provided access to a private space <b>442</b> corresponding to an event (e.g., &#x201c;Summer Picnic&#x201d;). The private space <b>442</b> contains various content items <b>444</b> relating to the event posted by users <b>446</b> who have joined the private space. In some embodiments, the user can be connected as friends to one or more of the users <b>446</b> in the social networking system. In various embodiments, the content items <b>444</b> posted to the private space <b>442</b> can include images or video, or a combination both. In some embodiments, the user and the users <b>446</b> can communicate about the content items <b>444</b> posted to the private space <b>442</b> through a messaging interface <b>450</b>. For example, the user can comment on an image (e.g., &#x201c;That cake looks super good!!) through the messaging interface <b>450</b>. As another example, one of the users <b>446</b> may comment (e.g., &#x201c;Nah, it's okay. Person B made it&#x201d;) in response to the comment made by the user. In some cases, the user and the users <b>446</b> may like the content items <b>444</b>. In some embodiments, the private space <b>442</b> can be ephemeral and thus only accessible or functional for a predetermined period of time. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the user or the users <b>446</b> may invite other users (e.g., invitees) of the social networking system to the private space <b>442</b> by selecting an element <b>448</b>.

The system <b>600</b> includes one or more user devices <b>610</b>, one or more external systems <b>620</b>, a social networking system (or service) <b>630</b>, and a network <b>655</b>. In an embodiment, the social networking service, provider, and/or system discussed in connection with the embodiments described above may be implemented as the social networking system <b>630</b>. For purposes of illustration, the embodiment of the system <b>600</b>, shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, includes a single external system <b>620</b> and a single user device <b>610</b>. However, in other embodiments, the system <b>600</b> may include more user devices <b>610</b> and/or more external systems <b>620</b>. In certain embodiments, the social networking system <b>630</b> is operated by a social network provider, whereas the external systems <b>620</b> are separate from the social networking system <b>630</b> in that they may be operated by different entities. In various embodiments, however, the social networking system <b>630</b> and the external systems <b>620</b> operate in conjunction to provide social networking services to users (or members) of the social networking system <b>630</b>. In this sense, the social networking system <b>630</b> provides a platform or backbone, which other systems, such as external systems <b>620</b>, may use to provide social networking services and functionalities to users across the Internet.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The user device <b>610</b> comprises one or more computing devices that can receive input from a user and transmit and receive data via the network <b>655</b>. In one embodiment, the user device <b>610</b> is a conventional computer system executing, for example, a Microsoft Windows compatible operating system (OS), Apple OS X, and/or a Linux distribution. In another embodiment, the user device <b>610</b> can be a device having computer functionality, such as a smart-phone, a tablet, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile telephone, etc. The user device <b>610</b> is configured to communicate via the network <b>655</b>. The user device <b>610</b> can execute an application, for example, a browser application that allows a user of the user device <b>610</b> to interact with the social networking system <b>630</b>. In another embodiment, the user device <b>610</b> interacts with the social networking system <b>630</b> through an application programming interface (API) provided by the native operating system of the user device <b>610</b>, such as iOS and ANDROID. The user device <b>610</b> is configured to communicate with the external system <b>620</b> and the social networking system <b>630</b> via the network <b>655</b>, which may comprise any combination of local area and/or wide area networks, using wired and/or wireless communication systems.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one embodiment, the network <b>655</b> uses standard communications technologies and protocols. Thus, the network <b>655</b> can include links using technologies such as Ethernet, 802.11, worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), 3G, 4G, CDMA, GSM, LTE, digital subscriber line (DSL), etc. Similarly, the networking protocols used on the network <b>655</b> can include multiprotocol label switching (MPLS), transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), hypertext transport protocol (HTTP), simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP), file transfer protocol (FTP), and the like. The data exchanged over the network <b>655</b> can be represented using technologies and/or formats including hypertext markup language (HTML) and extensible markup language (XML). In addition, all or some links can be encrypted using conventional encryption technologies such as secure sockets layer (SSL), transport layer security (TLS), and Internet Protocol security (IPsec).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In one embodiment, the user device <b>610</b> may display content from the external system <b>620</b> and/or from the social networking system <b>630</b> by processing a markup language document <b>614</b> received from the external system <b>620</b> and from the social networking system <b>630</b> using a browser application <b>612</b>. The markup language document <b>614</b> identifies content and one or more instructions describing formatting or presentation of the content. By executing the instructions included in the markup language document <b>614</b>, the browser application <b>612</b> displays the identified content using the format or presentation described by the markup language document <b>614</b>. For example, the markup language document <b>614</b> includes instructions for generating and displaying a web page having multiple frames that include text and/or image data retrieved from the external system <b>620</b> and the social networking system <b>630</b>. In various embodiments, the markup language document <b>614</b> comprises a data file including extensible markup language (XML) data, extensible hypertext markup language (XHTML) data, or other markup language data. Additionally, the markup language document <b>614</b> may include JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data, JSON with padding (JSONP), and JavaScript data to facilitate data-interchange between the external system <b>620</b> and the user device <b>610</b>. The browser application <b>612</b> on the user device <b>610</b> may use a JavaScript compiler to decode the markup language document <b>614</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The markup language document <b>614</b> may also include, or link to, applications or application frameworks such as FLASH&#x2122; or Unity&#x2122; applications, the SilverLight&#x2122; application framework, etc.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In one embodiment, the user device <b>610</b> also includes one or more cookies <b>616</b> including data indicating whether a user of the user device <b>610</b> is logged into the social networking system <b>630</b>, which may enable modification of the data communicated from the social networking system <b>630</b> to the user device <b>610</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The external system <b>620</b> includes one or more web servers that include one or more web pages <b>622</b><i>a</i>, <b>622</b><i>b</i>, which are communicated to the user device <b>610</b> using the network <b>655</b>. The external system <b>620</b> is separate from the social networking system <b>630</b>. For example, the external system <b>620</b> is associated with a first domain, while the social networking system <b>630</b> is associated with a separate social networking domain. Web pages <b>622</b><i>a</i>, <b>622</b><i>b</i>, included in the external system <b>620</b>, comprise markup language documents <b>614</b> identifying content and including instructions specifying formatting or presentation of the identified content.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The social networking system <b>630</b> includes one or more computing devices for a social network, including a plurality of users, and providing users of the social network with the ability to communicate and interact with other users of the social network. In some instances, the social network can be represented by a graph, i.e., a data structure including edges and nodes. Other data structures can also be used to represent the social network, including but not limited to databases, objects, classes, meta elements, files, or any other data structure. The social networking system <b>630</b> may be administered, managed, or controlled by an operator. The operator of the social networking system <b>630</b> may be a human being, an automated application, or a series of applications for managing content, regulating policies, and collecting usage metrics within the social networking system <b>630</b>. Any type of operator may be used.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Users may join the social networking system <b>630</b> and then add connections to any number of other users of the social networking system <b>630</b> to whom they desire to be connected. As used herein, the term &#x201c;friend&#x201d; refers to any other user of the social networking system <b>630</b> to whom a user has formed a connection, association, or relationship via the social networking system <b>630</b>. For example, in an embodiment, if users in the social networking system <b>630</b> are represented as nodes in the social graph, the term &#x201c;friend&#x201d; can refer to an edge formed between and directly connecting two user nodes.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Connections may be added explicitly by a user or may be automatically created by the social networking system <b>630</b> based on common characteristics of the users (e.g., users who are alumni of the same educational institution). For example, a first user specifically selects a particular other user to be a friend. Connections in the social networking system <b>630</b> are usually in both directions, but need not be, so the terms &#x201c;user&#x201d; and &#x201c;friend&#x201d; depend on the frame of reference. Connections between users of the social networking system <b>630</b> are usually bilateral (&#x201c;two-way&#x201d;), or &#x201c;mutual,&#x201d; but connections may also be unilateral, or &#x201c;one-way.&#x201d; For example, if Bob and Joe are both users of the social networking system <b>630</b> and connected to each other, Bob and Joe are each other's connections. If, on the other hand, Bob wishes to connect to Joe to view data communicated to the social networking system <b>630</b> by Joe, but Joe does not wish to form a mutual connection, a unilateral connection may be established. The connection between users may be a direct connection; however, some embodiments of the social networking system <b>630</b> allow the connection to be indirect via one or more levels of connections or degrees of separation.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In addition to establishing and maintaining connections between users and allowing interactions between users, the social networking system <b>630</b> provides users with the ability to take actions on various types of items supported by the social networking system <b>630</b>. These items may include groups or networks (i.e., social networks of people, entities, and concepts) to which users of the social networking system <b>630</b> may belong, events or calendar entries in which a user might be interested, computer-based applications that a user may use via the social networking system <b>630</b>, transactions that allow users to buy or sell items via services provided by or through the social networking system <b>630</b>, and interactions with advertisements that a user may perform on or off the social networking system <b>630</b>. These are just a few examples of the items upon which a user may act on the social networking system <b>630</b>, and many others are possible. A user may interact with anything that is capable of being represented in the social networking system <b>630</b> or in the external system <b>620</b>, separate from the social networking system <b>630</b>, or coupled to the social networking system <b>630</b> via the network <b>655</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The social networking system <b>630</b> is also capable of linking a variety of entities. For example, the social networking system <b>630</b> enables users to interact with each other as well as external systems <b>620</b> or other entities through an API, a web service, or other communication channels. The social networking system <b>630</b> generates and maintains the &#x201c;social graph&#x201d; comprising a plurality of nodes interconnected by a plurality of edges. Each node in the social graph may represent an entity that can act on another node and/or that can be acted on by another node. The social graph may include various types of nodes. Examples of types of nodes include users, non-person entities, media content items, web pages, groups, activities, messages, concepts, and any other things that can be represented by an object in the social networking system <b>630</b>. An edge between two nodes in the social graph may represent a particular kind of connection, or association, between the two nodes, which may result from node relationships or from an action that was performed by one of the nodes on the other node. In some cases, the edges between nodes can be weighted. The weight of an edge can represent an attribute associated with the edge, such as a strength of the connection or association between nodes. Different types of edges can be provided with different weights. For example, an edge created when one user &#x201c;likes&#x201d; another user may be given one weight, while an edge created when a user befriends another user may be given a different weight.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As an example, when a first user identifies a second user as a friend, an edge in the social graph is generated connecting a node representing the first user and a second node representing the second user. As various nodes relate or interact with each other, the social networking system <b>630</b> modifies edges connecting the various nodes to reflect the relationships and interactions.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The social networking system <b>630</b> also includes user-generated content, which enhances a user's interactions with the social networking system <b>630</b>. User-generated content may include anything a user can add, upload, send, or &#x201c;post&#x201d; to the social networking system <b>630</b>. For example, a user communicates posts to the social networking system <b>630</b> from a user device <b>610</b>. Posts may include data such as status updates or other textual data, location information, images such as photos, videos, links, music or other similar data and/or media. Content may also be added to the social networking system <b>630</b> by a third party. Content &#x201c;items&#x201d; are represented as objects in the social networking system <b>630</b>. In this way, users of the social networking system <b>630</b> are encouraged to communicate with each other by posting text and media content items of various types of media through various communication channels. Such communication increases the interaction of users with each other and increases the frequency with which users interact with the social networking system <b>630</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The social networking system <b>630</b> includes a web server <b>632</b>, an API request server <b>634</b>, a user profile store <b>636</b>, a connection store <b>638</b>, an action logger <b>640</b>, an activity log <b>642</b>, and an authorization server <b>644</b>. In an embodiment of the invention, the social networking system <b>630</b> may include additional, fewer, or different components for various applications. Other components, such as network interfaces, security mechanisms, load balancers, failover servers, management and network operations consoles, and the like are not shown so as to not obscure the details of the system.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The user profile store <b>636</b> maintains information about user accounts, including biographic, demographic, and other types of descriptive information, such as work experience, educational history, hobbies or preferences, location, and the like that has been declared by users or inferred by the social networking system <b>630</b>. This information is stored in the user profile store <b>636</b> such that each user is uniquely identified. The social networking system <b>630</b> also stores data describing one or more connections between different users in the connection store <b>638</b>. The connection information may indicate users who have similar or common work experience, group memberships, hobbies, or educational history. Additionally, the social networking system <b>630</b> includes user-defined connections between different users, allowing users to specify their relationships with other users. For example, user-defined connections allow users to generate relationships with other users that parallel the users' real-life relationships, such as friends, co-workers, partners, and so forth. Users may select from predefined types of connections, or define their own connection types as needed. Connections with other nodes in the social networking system <b>630</b>, such as non-person entities, buckets, cluster centers, images, interests, pages, external systems, concepts, and the like are also stored in the connection store <b>638</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The social networking system <b>630</b> maintains data about objects with which a user may interact. To maintain this data, the user profile store <b>636</b> and the connection store <b>638</b> store instances of the corresponding type of objects maintained by the social networking system <b>630</b>. Each object type has information fields that are suitable for storing information appropriate to the type of object. For example, the user profile store <b>636</b> contains data structures with fields suitable for describing a user's account and information related to a user's account. When a new object of a particular type is created, the social networking system <b>630</b> initializes a new data structure of the corresponding type, assigns a unique object identifier to it, and begins to add data to the object as needed. This might occur, for example, when a user becomes a user of the social networking system <b>630</b>, the social networking system <b>630</b> generates a new instance of a user profile in the user profile store <b>636</b>, assigns a unique identifier to the user account, and begins to populate the fields of the user account with information provided by the user.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The connection store <b>638</b> includes data structures suitable for describing a user's connections to other users, connections to external systems <b>620</b> or connections to other entities. The connection store <b>638</b> may also associate a connection type with a user's connections, which may be used in conjunction with the user's privacy setting to regulate access to information about the user. In an embodiment of the invention, the user profile store <b>636</b> and the connection store <b>638</b> may be implemented as a federated database.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Data stored in the connection store <b>638</b>, the user profile store <b>636</b>, and the activity log <b>642</b> enables the social networking system <b>630</b> to generate the social graph that uses nodes to identify various objects and edges connecting nodes to identify relationships between different objects. For example, if a first user establishes a connection with a second user in the social networking system <b>630</b>, user accounts of the first user and the second user from the user profile store <b>636</b> may act as nodes in the social graph. The connection between the first user and the second user stored by the connection store <b>638</b> is an edge between the nodes associated with the first user and the second user. Continuing this example, the second user may then send the first user a message within the social networking system <b>630</b>. The action of sending the message, which may be stored, is another edge between the two nodes in the social graph representing the first user and the second user. Additionally, the message itself may be identified and included in the social graph as another node connected to the nodes representing the first user and the second user.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In another example, a first user may tag a second user in an image that is maintained by the social networking system <b>630</b> (or, alternatively, in an image maintained by another system outside of the social networking system <b>630</b>). The image may itself be represented as a node in the social networking system <b>630</b>. This tagging action may create edges between the first user and the second user as well as create an edge between each of the users and the image, which is also a node in the social graph. In yet another example, if a user confirms attending an event, the user and the event are nodes obtained from the user profile store <b>636</b>, where the attendance of the event is an edge between the nodes that may be retrieved from the activity log <b>642</b>. By generating and maintaining the social graph, the social networking system <b>630</b> includes data describing many different types of objects and the interactions and connections among those objects, providing a rich source of socially relevant information.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The web server <b>632</b> links the social networking system <b>630</b> to one or more user devices <b>610</b> and/or one or more external systems <b>620</b> via the network <b>655</b>. The web server <b>632</b> serves web pages, as well as other web-related content, such as Java, JavaScript, Flash, XML, and so forth. The web server <b>632</b> may include a mail server or other messaging functionality for receiving and routing messages between the social networking system <b>630</b> and one or more user devices <b>610</b>. The messages can be instant messages, queued messages (e.g., email), text and SMS messages, or any other suitable messaging format.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The API request server <b>634</b> allows one or more external systems <b>620</b> and user devices <b>610</b> to call access information from the social networking system <b>630</b> by calling one or more API functions. The API request server <b>634</b> may also allow external systems <b>620</b> to send information to the social networking system <b>630</b> by calling APIs. The external system <b>620</b>, in one embodiment, sends an API request to the social networking system <b>630</b> via the network <b>655</b>, and the API request server <b>634</b> receives the API request. The API request server <b>634</b> processes the request by calling an API associated with the API request to generate an appropriate response, which the API request server <b>634</b> communicates to the external system <b>620</b> via the network <b>655</b>. For example, responsive to an API request, the API request server <b>634</b> collects data associated with a user, such as the user's connections that have logged into the external system <b>620</b>, and communicates the collected data to the external system <b>620</b>. In another embodiment, the user device <b>610</b> communicates with the social networking system <b>630</b> via APIs in the same manner as external systems <b>620</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The action logger <b>640</b> is capable of receiving communications from the web server <b>632</b> about user actions on and/or off the social networking system <b>630</b>. The action logger <b>640</b> populates the activity log <b>642</b> with information about user actions, enabling the social networking system <b>630</b> to discover various actions taken by its users within the social networking system <b>630</b> and outside of the social networking system <b>630</b>. Any action that a particular user takes with respect to another node on the social networking system <b>630</b> may be associated with each user's account, through information maintained in the activity log <b>642</b> or in a similar database or other data repository. Examples of actions taken by a user within the social networking system <b>630</b> that are identified and stored may include, for example, adding a connection to another user, sending a message to another user, reading a message from another user, viewing content associated with another user, attending an event posted by another user, posting an image, attempting to post an image, or other actions interacting with another user or another object. When a user takes an action within the social networking system <b>630</b>, the action is recorded in the activity log <b>642</b>. In one embodiment, the social networking system <b>630</b> maintains the activity log <b>642</b> as a database of entries. When an action is taken within the social networking system <b>630</b>, an entry for the action is added to the activity log <b>642</b>. The activity log <b>642</b> may be referred to as an action log.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Additionally, user actions may be associated with concepts and actions that occur within an entity outside of the social networking system <b>630</b>, such as an external system <b>620</b> that is separate from the social networking system <b>630</b>. For example, the action logger <b>640</b> may receive data describing a user's interaction with an external system <b>620</b> from the web server <b>632</b>. In this example, the external system <b>620</b> reports a user's interaction according to structured actions and objects in the social graph.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Other examples of actions where a user interacts with an external system <b>620</b> include a user expressing an interest in an external system <b>620</b> or another entity, a user posting a comment to the social networking system <b>630</b> that discusses an external system <b>620</b> or a web page <b>622</b><i>a </i>within the external system <b>620</b>, a user posting to the social networking system <b>630</b> a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or other identifier associated with an external system <b>620</b>, a user attending an event associated with an external system <b>620</b>, or any other action by a user that is related to an external system <b>620</b>. Thus, the activity log <b>642</b> may include actions describing interactions between a user of the social networking system <b>630</b> and an external system <b>620</b> that is separate from the social networking system <b>630</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The authorization server <b>644</b> enforces one or more privacy settings of the users of the social networking system <b>630</b>. A privacy setting of a user determines how particular information associated with a user can be shared. The privacy setting comprises the specification of particular information associated with a user and the specification of the entity or entities with whom the information can be shared. Examples of entities with which information can be shared may include other users, applications, external systems <b>620</b>, or any entity that can potentially access the information. The information that can be shared by a user comprises user account information, such as profile photos, phone numbers associated with the user, user's connections, actions taken by the user such as adding a connection, changing user profile information, and the like.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The privacy setting specification may be provided at different levels of granularity. For example, the privacy setting may identify specific information to be shared with other users; the privacy setting identifies a work phone number or a specific set of related information, such as, personal information including profile photo, home phone number, and status. Alternatively, the privacy setting may apply to all the information associated with the user. The specification of the set of entities that can access particular information can also be specified at various levels of granularity. Various sets of entities with which information can be shared may include, for example, all friends of the user, all friends of friends, all applications, or all external systems <b>620</b>. One embodiment allows the specification of the set of entities to comprise an enumeration of entities. For example, the user may provide a list of external systems <b>620</b> that are allowed to access certain information. Another embodiment allows the specification to comprise a set of entities along with exceptions that are not allowed to access the information. For example, a user may allow all external systems <b>620</b> to access the user's work information, but specify a list of external systems <b>620</b> that are not allowed to access the work information. Certain embodiments call the list of exceptions that are not allowed to access certain information a &#x201c;block list&#x201d;. External systems <b>620</b> belonging to a block list specified by a user are blocked from accessing the information specified in the privacy setting. Various combinations of granularity of specification of information, and granularity of specification of entities, with which information is shared are possible. For example, all personal information may be shared with friends whereas all work information may be shared with friends of friends.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The authorization server <b>644</b> contains logic to determine if certain information associated with a user can be accessed by a user's friends, external systems <b>620</b>, and/or other applications and entities. The external system <b>620</b> may need authorization from the authorization server <b>644</b> to access the user's more private and sensitive information, such as the user's work phone number. Based on the user's privacy settings, the authorization server <b>644</b> determines if another user, the external system <b>620</b>, an application, or another entity is allowed to access information associated with the user, including information about actions taken by the user.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments, the social networking system <b>630</b> can include a private space module <b>646</b>.
