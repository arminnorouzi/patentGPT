Gaucher disease (&#x201c;GD&#x201d;), in particular, is a rare disease with an incidence of about 1 in 60,000 in the general population and 1 in 850 among Ashkenazi Jewish populations. Worldwide there are about 121,522 Gaucher disease patients and here in the US, approximately 5000 Americans are suffering from this disease.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">GD results from mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene GBA1 causing functional disruption of the encoded lysosomal enzyme, acid beta-glucosidase, leading to excess accumulation of glucosylceramide (GC) mainly in macrophages (M&#x3d5;s) and elevated plasma level of cytokines and chemokines in human GD patients. Acid beta-glucosidase is crucial for the degradation of GC into glucose and ceramide. The excess accumulation of GC in innate and adaptive immune cells within several visceral organs, bone and brain sparks a pro-inflammatory environment resulting in tissue recruitment of several inflammatory immune cells. This pro-inflammatory environment causes tissue damage and promotes clinical GC manifestation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Improved treatments are needed. Currently, the cost to treat an individual with enzyme replacement therapy is significant, in the range of approximately $100,000 to $300,000 per year. Similarly, substrate reduction therapy (e.g., eligustat and miglustat) is equally expensive. While alternative treatments have potential, such as gene therapy, substrate reduction therapy, and alternative enzyme replacement products, such treatments have been hampered by limitations in the understanding of disease pathogenesis and toxicity concerns due to the blood brain barrier and procedural risks (particularly with respect to gene therapy methods).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, there is an urgent need for alternative therapeutic options for the above-noted disease states and disease states of similar etiology. Further alternative treatments are needed for the management of disease complications in GD and other lysosomal storage diseases associated with increased cellular immune inflammation. The instant disclosure satisfies one or more of these needs in the art.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Disclosed are compositions and methods of treating a neurodegenerative disease in an individual. The methods disclose administration of an Integrin &#x3b1;4&#x3b2;1, Very Late Antigen-4 positive neural precursor cell (&#x201c;VLA4+NPC&#x201d;) transfected with a lentivirus overexpressing wild type GCase to an individual having a neurodegenerative disorder.

A therapy of non-invasive transplantation of neural precursor cells for disease states such as neuronopathic Gaucher disease is disclosed.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Gaucher disease is caused by GBA1 mutations leading to functional deficiency of lysosomal acid-&#x3b2;-glucosidase. GBA1 mutations that cause Gaucher disease have been identified as the most common genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease. Applicant has developed a non-invasive, autologous induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based cell and gene therapy for treatment of diseases such as neuronopathic Gaucher disease and Parkinson's disease. A subclass of neural stem and precursor cells (NPCs), including iPSCs-derived NPCs, express VLA4 (Integrin &#x3b1;4&#x3b2;1, Very Late Antigen-4) which allows NPCs to cross the blood-brain-barrier.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Applicant has found that the GBA1 mutation in human Gaucher disease iPSCs can be genetically corrected and iPSC-derived NPCs having a VLA4+ population can be established. Applicant has found that the VLA4+NPCs maintained multipotency and differentiated into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. The non-invasive delivery of iPSC derived VLA4+NPCs benefit individuals having Parkinson's disease by increasing GBA1 gene product, promoting neuroprotection and direct cell replacement through differentiation to functional cell types in the central nervous system.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">A subclass of neural stem and precursor cells (NPCs), including induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived NPCs, express VLA4 (Integrin alpha4betal, Very Late Antigen-4) allows systemically delivered NPCs to cross the blood-brain-barrier via interaction with endothelial VCAM 1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule). Applicant has established multipotent human and mouse iPSC-derived VLA4+NPCs. Mouse iPSC-derived VLA4+NPCs expressing GFP engrafted in neuronopathic Gaucher disease (4L;C*) mouse brain following intravenous injection. GFP positive cells were distributed in brain stem, midbrain, and thalamus in the transplanted 4L;C* brains and were differentiated into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. The NPC transplanted 4L;C* mice showed improved sensorimotor function by gait analysis and delayed neurodegenerative disease progression by the hindlimb clasping test. NPC transplantation significantly prolonged life span of 4L;C* mice. Histological analysis of brain sections by Fluoro-Jade C staining showed significantly reduced neurodegeneration in the brain stem, midbrain, and thalamus of transplanted mice. CNS inflammation, detected by anti-CD68 and anti-GFAP antibodies, was significantly decreased in the brain and spinal cord of transplanted mice. The oxygen consumption rate of NPC treated brain mitochondria was significantly improved compared to vehicle-mice. These results demonstrated the potential efficacy of non-invasive delivery of iPSC-derived NPCs to improve neuropathic phenotype in the mouse model of neuronopathic Gaucher disease. Applicant has thus established the feasibility of non-invasive, autologous cell therapies using iPSC-derived precursor cells to achieve personalized medicine for neuronopathic Gaucher disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one aspect, a method of treating a neurodegenerative disease in an individual in need thereof is disclosed.

Hindlimb clasping is tested by grasping the tail from base and lifting the mouse clear of all surrounding objects. The hindlimb position is observed for 30 seconds. Each mouse at each time point is tested in two trials, 10 mins apart between two trials, giving a score as follows. Score 0, hindlimbs are consistently splayed outward, away from the abdomen; Score 1, one hindlimb is retracted toward the abdomen for &#x3e;50% of 30 seconds; score 2, both hindlimbs are partially retracted toward the abdomen for &#x3e;50% of 30 seconds; and score 3, hindlimbs are entirely retracted and touching the abdomen for &#x3e;50% of 30 seconds. Gait analyses was conducted to determine sensorimotor function. (Fleming, S. M. et al. Early and progressive sensorimotor anomalies in mice overexpressing wild-type human alpha-synuclein. J Neurosci 24, 9434-40 (2004).) Mice were trained to walk through a narrow alley leading into their home-cage. The mice are then brushed with non-toxic paint on the hind paws and placed at the beginning of the alley. As they walk into their home-cage they leave paw prints on the paper underneath. Stride length and base width are determined by measuring the distance between hind paw prints. The 4L;C* and control mice, untreated and non-4L;C* littermates are tested for gait at 40, 50 and over 50 days of age. The investigators performing the functional assessment are blind to the treatment.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0073">Immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence staining is performed on PFA fixed brains and cells. The brain sections are incubated in 0.3% Triton X-100 for 30 min, and treated with 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl in 1&#xd7;PBS for 15 min followed by lx PBS wash. The sections are blocked for 1 hr at RT in Blocking buffer (10% goat serum and 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS). PFA fixed cells are incubated in blocking buffer (5% goat serum and 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 30-60 minutes. Following primary antibodies diluted in 5% goat serum is applied to the cells and brain sections overnight at 4&#xb0; C. Rabbit anti-GFP (1:200, Cell Signaling Technology, 2956), rat anti-CD106 (VCAM-1) monoclonal Antibody (1:100, ebioscience, MR106), mouse anti-SOX2 (1:200, Millipore, AB5603), mouse anti-Nestin (1:100, Millipore, MAB353), mouse anti-integrin alpha 4 (VLA4) (1:100, Cell Signaling Technology, 8440S), mouse anti-TUJ1 (1:200, STEMCELL TECHNOLOGIES, 60052), mouse anti-04 (1:100, Millipore, MAB365), mouse anti-NeuN antibody (1:500, Millipore, MAB377). After washing in PBS (3&#xd7;10 min), the secondary antibodies: goat anti-mouse conjugated with Alexa Fluor&#xae; 594 (1:1000) for SOX2, Nestin, VLA4, Tuj 1, GFAP, and O4 detection, goat anti-rabbit conjugated with Alexa Fluor&#xae; 488 (1:1000) for GFP detection, and goat anti-rat conjugated with Alexa Fluor&#xae; 594 (1:1000) for VCAM detection, are applied. The cell and tissues sections are count-stained for nuclei with DAPI in mounting medium.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0074">Immunohistochemistry. Frozen tissue sections fixed with 4% PFA are incubated with rat anti-mouse CD68 monoclonal antibodies (Serotec, mca1957) (1:3000 in PBS with 5% BSA) and mouse anti-GFAP monoclonal antibody (Roche #7604345). Detection is performed using Research IHC DAB XT and Research IHC Omni-UltraMap HRP XT Discovery XT Staining Module. ABC Vectastain and Alkaline Phosphatase Kit II (black) are used according to the manufacturer's instruction. The slides are counterstained with methylene green. Images are captured using a Zeiss microscope (Axioskop) equipped with SPOT Advance software (SPOT Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.). CD68-positive and GFAP-positive signal in brain sections are analyzed by Fiji software in randomly selected fields (300 mm6210 mm/field) from treated and saline control mice brains. Quantification data of the relative positive signal ratio is performed. Data collected from 10 images for each group).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0075">Fluoro-Jade C (FJC) staining. FJC is a fluorescent dye derived from fluorescein used to label degenerating neurons. (Chidlow, G., Wood, J. P., Sarvestani, G., Manavis, J. &#x26; Casson, R. J. Evaluation of Fluoro-Jade C as a marker of degenerating neurons in the rat retina and optic nerve. Exp Eye Res 88, 426-37 (2009).) FJC staining and imaging analysis is performed on the frozen brain sections (25 &#x3bc;m). Prior to staining, sections are mounted on gelatin coated slides that were prepared by immersion in 1% pig skin gelatin solution (Sigma; gel strength 300, Type A) and dried overnight in an oven at 60&#xb0; C. The sections mounted on gelatin slide are air dried for 30 min in a slide warmer at 50&#xb0; C. Slides bearing tissue sections were first immersed in a solution consisting of 1% sodium hydroxide in 80% ethanol for 5 min, followed by rinsing for 2 min in 70% ethanol, 2 min in distilled water, and incubating in 0.06% potassium permanganate solution for 10 min. The tissue slides are then washed for 1-2 min in water and transferred for 10 min to a 0.0001% solution of FJ C (MILLIPORE, AG325) dissolved in 0.1% acetic acid. The slides are washed through three changes of distilled water for 1 min per change and air dried on a slide warmer at 50&#xb0; C. for 5 min. The air-dried slides are dipped in xylene for 1 min and mounted with DPX (mixture of distyrene, a plasticizer, and xylene) non-fluorescent mounting media (Sigma).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0076">Glycosphingolipids analysis.
