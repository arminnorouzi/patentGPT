However, for example, the target point TP may be located on an extension line of a center line VC of the vehicle V, and may have a predetermined distance of 1 meter to 10 meters in the front-and-rear direction from the wheel centers of front wheels. Note that the target point TP may be offset in the width direction from the center line VC of the vehicle V.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">&#x3c;Front Bar Member&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> will also be referred to. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration example of the front bar member <b>2</b>. The front bar member <b>2</b> is a rod-shaped member provided with the target point TP indicating an installation position of the target T. In arranging the front bar member <b>2</b> with respect to the vehicle V, it is possible to arrange the front bar member <b>2</b> to extend over the vehicle width direction ahead of or behind the vehicle V. The front bar member <b>2</b> includes a main body <b>21</b>, a point forming member <b>22</b> that forms the target point TP, and pins <b>23</b>, <b>24</b>L, and <b>24</b>R engageable with a connection member (to be described later) of the connection unit <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The main body <b>21</b> is a member constituting the framework of the front bar member <b>2</b>, is made up of, for example, a metal material, and can have a hollow and rectangular cross-sectional shape.

In the present embodiment, the point forming member <b>22</b> is provided to be interposed between the left-side part <b>21</b>L and the right-side part <b>21</b>R of the main body <b>21</b>. As an example, the point forming member <b>22</b> may include a convex portion engageable with the hollow part of the main body <b>21</b>, and may be attached to the main body <b>21</b> by engaging therewith. Further, for example, at least one of the left-side part <b>21</b>L and the right-side part <b>21</b>R may have a convex-shaped part, and the point forming member <b>22</b> may include a recess to be engaged with the convex-shaped part. Further, for example, the point forming member <b>22</b> may be provided such that the point forming member <b>22</b> sandwiches the main body <b>21</b> from above, instead of being interposed between the left-side part <b>21</b>L and the right-side part <b>21</b>R.

In the present embodiment, since the reference point <b>400</b>L is provided in the vehicle width direction moving unit <b>406</b>L, the reference point <b>400</b>L can be moved to a predetermined position on the XY plane by the movement of the front-and-rear direction moving unit <b>404</b>L and the vehicle width direction moving unit <b>406</b>L.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">For example, the deviation of the reference point <b>400</b>L from the wheel center WC can be adjusted by moving the front-and-rear direction moving unit <b>404</b>L. In addition, for example, a scale is provided in the vehicle width direction moving unit <b>406</b>L, and the centers of the vehicle V and the reference member <b>4</b> in the vehicle width direction can be aligned by matching the read values of the scales provided in the left and right vehicle width direction moving units <b>406</b>L and <b>406</b>R.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Note that, in the present embodiment, the common pin <b>408</b>L for engaging the connection members <b>60</b>L and <b>62</b>L is provided on the front-and-rear direction moving unit <b>404</b>L. Therefore, even when the front-and-rear direction moving unit <b>404</b>L moves in the front-and-rear direction, the distance between the pin <b>408</b>L and the reference point <b>400</b>L in the front-and-rear direction is kept constant. Accordingly, the distance from the reference point <b>400</b>L to the target point TP in the front-and-rear direction is also kept constant.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the first embodiments, the front-and-rear direction moving unit <b>404</b>L slides along the base portion <b>402</b>L to move in the front-and-rear direction, and the vehicle width direction moving unit <b>406</b>L slides along the front-and-rear direction moving unit <b>404</b>L to move in the vehicle width direction. However, the reference point forming units <b>40</b>L and <b>40</b>R are not limited to the above configuration, and the positions of the reference points <b>400</b>L and <b>400</b>R can be adjustable in a known method. In addition, the reference point forming units <b>40</b>L and <b>40</b>R may include restriction mechanisms that restrict movements of the front-and-rear direction moving units <b>404</b>L and <b>404</b>R and the vehicle width direction moving units <b>406</b>L and <b>406</b>R, after the position adjustments with those units. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the reference point from deviating after the adjustments.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The positioning unit <b>42</b> is a rod-shaped member provided to connect the left and right reference point forming units <b>40</b>L and <b>40</b>R.

Specifically, first, when the positioning unit <b>42</b> abuts on the tires WL and WR, the movement of the base portions <b>402</b>L and <b>402</b>R in the front-and-rear direction, particularly, the forward movement is restricted. Therefore, by determining the positions of the reference points <b>400</b>L and <b>400</b>R by the front-and-rear direction moving units <b>404</b>L and <b>404</b>R in this state, the reference point can be positioned more accurately.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The adjustment by the front-and-rear direction moving units <b>404</b>L and <b>404</b>R after the positioning by the positioning unit <b>42</b> may be performed, for example, by hanging a weight from the wheel center of the tire WL and making the position indicated by the weight coincide with the reference points <b>400</b>L and <b>400</b>R in the front-and-rear direction. In addition, the adjustment by the vehicle width direction moving units <b>406</b>L and <b>406</b>R may be performed by making distances Y<b>2</b> of the reference points <b>400</b>L and <b>400</b>R from the wheels WL and WR coincide with each other to the left and right using a scale or the like.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">&#x3c;Connection Member&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> together with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a view illustrating a configuration example of connection members <b>60</b>L, <b>60</b>R, <b>62</b>L, and <b>62</b>R.
