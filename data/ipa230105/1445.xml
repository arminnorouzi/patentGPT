The powder coating device <b>1</b> includes a powder fluidization tank <b>2</b>, a stand <b>3</b> that supports the powder fluidization tank <b>2</b> on a placement surface, a vibration mechanism <b>5</b> coupled to a bottom member <b>22</b> of the powder fluidization tank <b>2</b>, a level meter <b>7</b> that detects a powder surface height in the powder fluidization tank <b>2</b>, and a control device <b>8</b> that controls the vibration mechanism <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0024">Described below is a case in which a stator W which is a component of a motor installed in a vehicle is used as the workpiece and an insulating powder is used as a resin powder. However, the workpiece and the resin powder are not so limited. Resins that may constitute the insulating powder include, for example, epoxy resin, etc.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0025">The stator W includes a cylindrical stator core W<b>1</b> and a stator coil W<b>2</b> wound in a plurality of slots formed inside the stator core W<b>1</b>. Here, a lower end of the stator coil W<b>2</b> is a coil end W<b>3</b> to be coated with insulating powder.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates the powder fluidization tank <b>2</b> and the stand <b>3</b> of the powder coating device <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0027">The powder fluidization tank <b>2</b> is approximately circular in a top view. The powder fluidization tank <b>2</b> includes a cylindrical trunk <b>21</b>, an approximately disc-shaped bottom member <b>22</b>, a first partition plate <b>23</b> and a second partition plate <b>24</b> that are approximately disc-shaped and provided inside of the trunk <b>21</b>, and a powder storage unit <b>25</b> where insulating powder is stored. Here, the first partition plate <b>23</b> and the second partition plate <b>24</b> are porous plates in which there are formed through holes each having a diameter smaller than the particle size of the insulating powder.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0028">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>, in the bottom member <b>22</b>, eight spacers <b>223</b> are interposed between outer peripheral portions of a first plate <b>221</b> and a second plate <b>222</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> respectively illustrate a side view and a front view. Here, the eight spacers <b>223</b> are arranged at equal intervals.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0029">Materials that may constitute the spacers <b>223</b> include, for example, rigid materials such as stainless steel, etc.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0030">Using a sensor mounted to an edge part <b>21</b><i>a </i>of the trunk <b>21</b> to measure the amplitude with a predetermined frequency and a predetermined excitation force, the amplitude in the Z-axis direction (axis line O direction) decreases as a distance D between a fixed plate <b>33</b> and the powder storage unit <b>25</b>, that is, the height of the spacers, increases, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Therefore, even if the distance from the axis line C in the Y-axis direction (horizontal direction) is great, an increase in amplitude in the Z-axis direction (axial direction) can be suppressed. This results in a smaller difference in blockage rate between pores at the central portion and at the outer peripheral portion of the second partition plate <b>24</b>, making radial flow in the powder surface less likely to occur. In addition, the amplitude in the X-axis direction and the Y-axis direction (horizontal directions) is large, and therefore the insulating powder can be sufficiently fluidized. Here, the amplitude in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is the amplitude at the point in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> where the distance from the axis line in the Y-direction is greatest (the rightmost point), and the leftmost point in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> represents a case in which spacers are not provided. The same tendency of the amplitude at the point in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> where the distance in the Y-axis direction from the axis line is greatest was also observed for other points in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0031">It should be noted that so long as the bottom member <b>22</b> has a plurality of spacers interposed between a first plate member and a second plate member, it is not particularly limited. For example, the spacers <b>223</b> may be interposed between the first plate <b>221</b> and the second plate <b>222</b> at regions other than the outer peripheral portions. In addition, the number of spacers <b>223</b> is not particularly limited.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0032">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref>, a weight <b>224</b> may be provided on the first plate <b>221</b>, whereby the first plate <b>221</b> is sandwiched between the weight <b>224</b> and a connection part <b>582</b> of the vibration mechanism <b>5</b>. When an excitation force E is applied by the vibration mechanism <b>5</b>, displacement occurs centered around a center of gravity C of the powder fluidization tank <b>2</b>, with elastic members <b>363</b> as fulcrums, and by providing the weight <b>224</b>, the center of gravity C of the powder fluidization tank <b>2</b> is lowered (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>). At this time, as illustrated by the simple geometric models, the excitation force E is identical, and therefore a displacement R will be smaller the lower the center of gravity C of the powder fluidization tank <b>2</b> is; in other words, the shorter a distance L between a fulcrum F and the center of gravity C is. This further reduces the amplitude in the Z-axis direction (axis line O direction), resulting in an even smaller difference in blockage rate between pores at the central portion and at the outer peripheral portion of the second partition plate <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0033">The powder storage unit <b>25</b> is defined by the edge part <b>21</b><i>a </i>of the trunk <b>21</b> and the second partition plate <b>24</b>.

In addition, the first air chamber <b>26</b> is supplied with air at a predetermined rate from an air supply device. The air supplied into the first air chamber <b>26</b> flows into the second air chamber <b>27</b> via the first partition plate <b>23</b>, then flows into the powder storage unit <b>25</b> via the second partition plate <b>24</b>. As a result, the insulating powder stored inside the powder storage unit <b>25</b> fluidizes.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0034">The stand <b>3</b> includes a plurality of fixed frames <b>31</b> and <b>32</b>, the fixed plate <b>33</b>, and a plurality of coupling support members <b>36</b>.

The first support plate <b>561</b> and the second support plate <b>562</b> are respectively connected to opposing sides of the housing <b>54</b>. In addition, the distances from the rotation shaft <b>52</b> to the first support plate <b>561</b> and to the second support plate <b>562</b> are equal. In other words, the housing <b>54</b> is sandwiched equally by the first support plate <b>561</b> and the second support plate <b>562</b>, centered about the rotation shaft <b>52</b>. In addition, the housing <b>54</b> is retained by the bracket <b>56</b> so as to be positioned below the fixed plate <b>33</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0044">The coupling member <b>58</b> includes a shaft part <b>581</b> and a coupling part <b>582</b> which are substantially coaxial with the axis line O, and couples the bracket <b>56</b> provided below the fixed plate <b>33</b> to the first plate <b>221</b> provided above the fixed plate <b>33</b>.

The lower end side of the shaft part <b>581</b> is fixed to the third support plate <b>563</b> of the bracket <b>56</b>, and the upper end side is fixed to the coupling part <b>582</b>. In addition, the upper end side of the coupling part <b>582</b> is fixed to the first plate <b>221</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0045">The outer diameter of the circular top surface <b>582</b><i>b </i>of the coupling part <b>582</b> is smaller than the inner diameter of the through hole <b>332</b> formed in the small-diameter plate <b>331</b> of the fixed plate <b>33</b>, and the coupling part <b>58</b> will thus not contact the fixed plate <b>33</b> even when the housing <b>54</b> vibrates.
