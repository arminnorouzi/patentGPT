Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Chip-on-chip (CoC) package includes two electronic components stacked on each other. The stacked electronic components are in electrical communication with each other through wire bonding. The bond wires, however, have high resistance and long transmission path. Therefore, CoC package suffers from signal integrity, particularly in high frequency application. In addition, the limitation of conventional wire bonding signal transmission is that the high impedance caused by the extended transmission path prevents high speed data rate, for example, 100 Gbit/s, 400 Gbit/s, or 1.6 Tbit/s, from realization.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, optical communication is used to replace traditional cable transmission. Optoelectronic devices, such as optical engine, usually require the integration of at least an electronic IC (EIC) and a photonic IC (PIC). The trend tends to stack an EIC, a PIC and a substrate in a vertical direction to reduce power loss. However, after stacking with the EIC, the PIC needs to be integrated with additional optical device(s). Therefore, it is desirable to protect the PIC from being contaminated or damaged before the integration with additional optical device(s) to improve the efficiency of the optoelectronic devices.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some embodiments, an optoelectronic package structure includes a photonic component. The photonic component has an electrical connection region, a blocking region and a region for accommodating a device.

The second component <b>20</b> is disposed over the first component <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, the semiconductor package structure <b>1</b> is an optoelectronic package structure, the first component <b>10</b> is an electronic component (e.g., electronic wafer or die), and the second component <b>20</b> is a photonic component (e.g., photonic wafer or die).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, the second component <b>20</b> has a first region R<b>1</b>, a second region R<b>2</b> and a third region R<b>3</b>. The second region R<b>2</b> is located between the first region R<b>1</b> and the third region R<b>3</b>. The first region R<b>1</b> may be an electrical connection region R<b>1</b> and is configured to electrically connect the first component <b>10</b> and the second component <b>20</b>. The second region may be a blocking region R<b>2</b> and is configured to block a filling material <b>50</b> disposed between the first component <b>10</b> and the second component <b>20</b>. The third region R<b>3</b> may be a region for accommodating a device (e.g., an optical device, but being not limited thereto) and is configured to accommodate the device. In some embodiments, the first region R<b>1</b>, the second region R<b>2</b> and the third region R<b>3</b> are located at a same side of the second component <b>20</b>, and face the first component <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, the second region R<b>2</b> and the third region R<b>3</b> are located at, a lower surface <b>20</b><i>b </i>of the second component <b>20</b>. The lower surface <b>20</b><i>b </i>is an active surface of the second component <b>20</b> and faces an upper surface <b>10</b><i>u </i>(i.e., an active surface) of the first component <b>10</b>. In the present disclosure, a surface of the first component <b>10</b> or a surface of the second component <b>20</b> may have different elevations.

The second component <b>20</b> is electrically connected to the first component <b>10</b> via the bonding pads <b>21</b>. The bonding pads <b>21</b> may be circular, rectangular, square, or in any other suitable shape. The bonding pads <b>21</b> may include metal or alloy, such as copper (Cu), aluminum (Al), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), nickel (Ni), tin (Sn), lead (Pb), silver (Ag), mercury (Hg), gold (Au), a combination thereof, or an alloy thereof.

The blocking pad <b>22</b> is disposed along an edge R<b>1</b><i>e</i><b>1</b> of the first region R<b>1</b>. The blocking pad <b>22</b> may have a shape of strip or any other suitable shape. The second region R<b>2</b> is located between the first region R<b>1</b> and the third region R<b>3</b>. The second region R<b>2</b> separates the third region R<b>3</b> from the first region R<b>1</b>. Specifically, the third region R<b>3</b> is separated from the first region R<b>1</b> by the blocking pad <b>22</b>. The blocking pad <b>22</b> may function as a barrier wall and prevent the filling material <b>50</b>, which is disposed between the first component <b>10</b> and second component <b>20</b> to fill between the bonding pads <b>21</b>, from overflowing to the third region R<b>3</b>. In some embodiments, the blocking pad <b>22</b> may electrically connect the first component <b>10</b> and the second component <b>20</b>.
