Testing is typically performed at the die level on a given wafer device-under-test (DUT), prior to the many die on the wafer being cut and mounted in respective packages to form the associated &#x201c;chips&#x201d;. Test systems are typically operated at an environment that simulates typical operation of the circuit to be tested on the respective wafer DUT. Thus, typical semiconductor-based ICs are tested at a non-cryogenic temperature (e.g., &#x201c;room-temperature&#x201d;) to determine efficacy of the circuit. Similarly, typical superconducting circuits are tested at cryogenic temperatures. Such testing of superconducting circuits at cryogenic temperatures can be both expensive and labor-intensive. For example, for a typical superconducting die test, the wafer DUT is diced into individual chips, placed into special fixtures, and dipped into a liquid helium Dewar, which can be time consuming and helium intensive, and thus not scalable for high volume throughput.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One example includes a cryogenic wafer test system.

The cryogenic wafer test system includes a first chamber that is cooled to a cryogenic temperature in a vacuum. The first chamber includes a wafer chuck configured to accommodate a wafer device-under-test (DUT) comprising a plurality of superconducting die. The cryogenic wafer test system also includes at least one wafer prober arranged in the first chamber. The wafer prober(s) includes electrical probe contacts that are implemented to provide physical contact to electrical contacts of a superconducting die of the plurality of superconducting die to implement a test of the superconducting die. As described herein, the terms &#x201c;electrical contacts&#x201d; and &#x201c;electrical probe contacts&#x201d; correspond to electrical conductor or superconductor contact surfaces on the superconducting die and the wafer prober(s), respectively, that are configured to provide electrical impulses between them for implementing a test. For example, a first portion of the electrical probe contacts can provide electrical impulses (e.g., single flux quantum (SFQ) pulses or reciprocal quantum logic (RQL) pulses) as inputs to the superconducting die via a respective first portion of the electrical contacts, such that the superconducting die can output responsive electrical impulses via a second portion of the electrical contacts to a respective second portion of the electrical probe contacts.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The cryogenic wafer test system also includes a second chamber, such as separated from the first chamber by a radiation barrier. The second chamber can likewise be evacuated, and can be held at a non-cryogenic temperature. The second chamber includes a wafer chuck actuator system configured to provide at least one of translational and rotational motion of the wafer chuck to facilitate alignment and contact of a plurality of electrical contacts of the superconducting die to the respective plurality of electrical probe contacts of the at least one wafer prober.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">As described herein, the terms &#x201c;first chamber&#x201d; and &#x201c;second chamber&#x201d; can refer to two separate portions of a same chamber (e.g., &#x201c;upper chamber portion&#x201d; and &#x201c;lower chamber portion&#x201d;, respectively) that are separated by the radiation barrier, as described in greater detail herein. As also described herein, the term &#x201c;cryogenic&#x201d; describes a temperature that is equal to or less than approximately 5 Kelvin, and the term &#x201c;non-cryogenic&#x201d; describes a temperature that is greater than the cryogenic temperature.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">For example, the wafer prober(s) can be configured as one of a probe card or a plurality of prober arms. For example, the probe card can be arranged in a fixed location in the first chamber, such that the wafer chuck is manipulated via the wafer chuck actuator system to align and contact the electrical contacts of the superconducting die to the electrical contacts of the probe card. As an example, the probe card includes a through-hole to facilitate alignment (e.g., via a vision system) to the superconducting die. As another example, the prober arms can be arranged to have a wedge-shaped distal end on which the electrical contacts can be arranged on a surface to provide contact with the electrical contacts of the superconducting die. For example, each of the prober arms can be separately and independently articulated to facilitate alignment and contact of the electrical contacts of the respective prober arms with the electrical contacts of the superconducting die.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example of a cryogenic wafer test system <b>10</b>. The cryogenic wafer test system <b>10</b> can be configured substantially the same as the cryogenic wafer test system described in Attorney Docket Number NG(ES)-029919 US PRI, which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference. The cryogenic wafer test system <b>10</b> can be configured to perform testing of each of a plurality of superconducting die on a wafer DUT. For example, the wafer DUT can have a minimum diameter of approximately fifteen centimeters, and can include several hundred separate die (e.g., with each die being sized at approximately five mm<sup>2</sup>) to be tested. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the cryogenic wafer test system <b>10</b> includes a first chamber <b>12</b> and a second chamber <b>14</b>, with the second chamber <b>14</b> being located beneath the first chamber <b>12</b>. For example, the first and second chambers <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> can be separated by a radiation barrier that is configured to provide a thermal gradient between the first and second chambers <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. Therefore, the first chamber <b>12</b> can be held to a cryogenic temperature to test the superconducting die and the second chamber <b>14</b> can be held to a non-cryogenic temperature. For example, the first chamber <b>12</b> can be coupled to liquid (e.g., helium) coolant lines <b>16</b> to bring the temperature of the first chamber <b>12</b> down to the cryogenic temperature (e.g., approximately 5 K or lower). As an example, the first and second chambers <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> can both be evacuated, and the radiation barrier can facilitate mechanical interface between the first and second chambers <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example diagram of a cryogenic wafer test system <b>50</b>. The cryogenic wafer test system <b>50</b> can correspond to the cryogenic wafer test system <b>10</b> in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Therefore, reference is to be made to the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in the following description of the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The cryogenic wafer test system <b>50</b> includes a first chamber <b>52</b> and a second chamber <b>54</b> that can correspond, respectively, to the first and second chambers <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. As an example, the first and second chambers <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> can both be evacuated, and the first chamber <b>52</b> is cooled to a cryogenic temperature. The first chamber <b>52</b> includes a wafer chuck <b>56</b> configured to accommodate a wafer DUT comprising a plurality of superconducting die to be tested. The cryogenic wafer test system <b>50</b> also includes at least one wafer prober <b>58</b> arranged in the first chamber <b>52</b>. The wafer prober(s) <b>58</b> includes electrical probe contacts that are implemented to provide physical contact to electrical contacts of a superconducting die of the plurality of superconducting die to implement a test of the superconducting die.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The second chamber <b>54</b> includes a wafer chuck actuator system <b>60</b> configured to provide at least one of translational and rotational motion of the wafer chuck <b>56</b>. Therefore, the wafer chuck <b>56</b> can be manipulated to facilitate alignment and contact of the plurality of electrical contacts of the superconducting die to the respective plurality of electrical probe contacts of the wafer prober(s) <b>58</b>. The translational motion can include motion of the wafer chuck <b>56</b> along three orthogonal axes, and the rotational motion can provide rotation of the wafer chuck <b>56</b> about an axis perpendicular to a planar surface of the wafer DUT. Therefore, the wafer chuck actuator system <b>60</b> is configured to facilitate motion of the wafer DUT to align the electrical contacts of a given one of the superconducting die to the electrical probe contacts of the wafer prober(s) <b>58</b>. Thus, the wafer chuck actuator system <b>60</b> can provide precision contact of the electrical contacts of the respective one of the superconducting die to the electrical probe contacts of the wafer prober(s) <b>58</b> to facilitate the test of the respective one of the superconducting die.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring back to the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the first chamber <b>12</b> can include a substantially transparent viewing window <b>18</b> that can provide an overhead view to the inside the first chamber <b>12</b>. Therefore, the viewing window <b>18</b> can provide a view of the planar surface of the wafer DUT to facilitate the alignment of the wafer DUT to the wafer prober(s) <b>58</b>, and thus the electrical contacts of the wafer DUT to the respective electrical prober contacts of the wafer prober(s) <b>58</b>, via the wafer chuck actuator system <b>60</b>. As an example, the viewing window can be formed of any of a variety of substantially transparent crystalline materials that can facilitate operation in the first chamber <b>12</b> at the cryogenic temperature. As another example, the cryogenic wafer test system <b>10</b> can include an electronic vision system (not shown) that can provide approximately real-time imaging of the first chamber <b>12</b> through the viewing window <b>18</b>. Accordingly, the vision system can further facilitate alignment of the electrical contacts on the surface of the superconducting die to the respective electrical probe contacts on the wafer prober(s) <b>58</b> to allow for real-time adjustments of the position of the wafer DUT via the wafer chuck actuator system <b>60</b> for aligning the electrical contacts to the electrical probe contacts.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring back to the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the second chamber <b>54</b> is demonstrated as separated from the first chamber <b>52</b> by a radiation barrier <b>62</b>. As described herein, the radiation barrier <b>62</b> is configured to provide a thermal gradient between the first and second chambers <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> by occluding direct line radiation from propagating from the second chamber <b>54</b> to the first chamber <b>52</b>. For example, because both the first and second chambers <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> can be evacuated, there is substantially no convection heat transfer that can occur from the second chamber <b>54</b> to the first chamber <b>52</b>. Thus, only radiation can provide heat transfer from the second chamber <b>54</b> to the first chamber <b>52</b>. As a result, by occluding direct line radiation from propagating from the second chamber <b>54</b> to the first chamber <b>52</b>, the radiation barrier <b>62</b> can substantially mitigate heat transfer from the second chamber <b>54</b> to the first chamber <b>52</b>. Therefore, the first chamber <b>52</b> can be held to a cryogenic temperature (e.g., approximately 5 K or lower) to test the superconducting die and the second chamber <b>54</b> can be held to a non-cryogenic temperature. As an example, the first and second chambers <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> can both be evacuated, and the radiation barrier <b>62</b> can facilitate mechanical interface between the first and second chambers <b>52</b> and <b>54</b>. Therefore, the wafer chuck actuator system <b>60</b> can be mechanically coupled to the wafer chuck <b>56</b> through the radiation barrier <b>62</b> to facilitate the translational and/or rotational motion of the wafer chuck <b>56</b> via the wafer chuck actuator system <b>60</b> through the radiation barrier <b>62</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The arrangement of the cryogenic wafer test system <b>50</b> can thus facilitate a more efficient testing environment of superconducting die than typical superconducting test fixtures. For example, by facilitating motion of the wafer chuck <b>56</b>, and thus the wafer DUT, via the wafer chuck actuator system <b>60</b>, the cryogenic wafer test system <b>50</b> can test multiple superconducting die sequentially in an indexed manner on the wafer DUT, as opposed to testing individually cut superconducting die that have been individually cooled via dipping into a liquid Dewar. As a result, by performing tests iteratively on each of the superconducting die on the wafer DUT, the process of testing each of the superconducting die in an indexed manner can be significantly more efficient by saving time between testing of each individual superconducting die, as well as by saving energy and cooling material (e.g., liquid helium) by operating the first chamber <b>52</b> that encapsulates the wafer DUT at the cryogenic temperature. Accordingly, the cryogenic wafer test system <b>50</b> provides for much more efficient testing than typical systems that implement superconducting die testing.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an example diagram <b>100</b> of motion of a wafer chuck.

As an example, the mechanical linkage <b>106</b> can correspond to any of a variety of mechanical and physical connections between the wafer chuck <b>102</b> and the wafer actuator system <b>104</b>. For example, the mechanical linkage <b>106</b> can be configured as a cylindrical or prismatic shaft extending between the wafer chuck actuator system <b>104</b> and the wafer chuck <b>102</b> to provide motion of the wafer chuck <b>102</b> in response to motion of or electrical commands from the wafer chuck actuator system <b>104</b>.
