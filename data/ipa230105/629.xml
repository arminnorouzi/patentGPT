Thus, the SI joint <b>6</b> is defined by (and, hence, comprises) portions of the sacrum <b>2</b> and ilium <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">Generally, the articular surfaces of the sacrum <b>2</b> and the ilium <b>4</b> that define the SI joint <b>6</b> comprise cortical bone <b>8</b>, which is more compact, dense and hard relative to softer trabecular bone <b>10</b>, which, as further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, is disposed in the interior regions of the sacrum and ilium <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B-<b>2</b>D</figref>, the SI joint <b>6</b> generally comprises the shape of an inverted capital letter &#x201c;L&#x201d; (denoted &#x201c;<b>13</b>&#x201d;) lying on its side (rather than a triangle), where the long arm of the inverted &#x201c;L&#x201d; <b>15</b> (i.e., SI joint <b>6</b>) is oriented along the posterior wall of the pelvis <b>11</b> (denoted &#x201c;<b>25</b>&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) and is also oriented relatively straight through its entire course. The sacral floor (denoted &#x201c;<b>21</b>&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>), which is defined by the region between the anterior sacral promontory <b>19</b><i>a </i>and the apex <b>19</b><i>b </i>of the sacrum <b>2</b>, generally slopes downward and laterally at an approximately 30% grade relative to the cephalocaudal axis <b>27</b>.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>C</figref>, the short arm of the inverted &#x201c;L&#x201d; (denoted &#x201c;<b>17</b>&#x201d;) is generally oriented parallel to the transverse plane of the L5-S1 lumbosacral joint and limited superiorly by the sacral ala (denoted &#x201c;<b>23</b>&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>) and the apex of the inverted &#x201c;L&#x201d; (denoted &#x201c;<b>29</b>&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) is positioned below the S2 segment region of the sacrum <b>2</b> (denoted &#x201c;S2&#x201d;) proximate to the S3 segment region of the sacrum <b>2</b> (denoted &#x201c;S3&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0009">As is also well known in the art, the SI joint further comprises articular cartilage, i.e., hyaline and fibrocartilage, and a strong, extensive ligamentous architecture, which stabilizes the SI joint.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">As is further well known in the art, the SI joint performs several seminal biomechanical functions; the seminal functions comprising attenuation of loads exerted on the upper body and distribution of the loads to the lower extremities. The SI joint also functions as a shock absorber for loads exerted on spine.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0011">As is well established, the noted loads and, hence, forces exerted on the SI joint can adversely affect the biomechanical functions of the SI joint, which can, and often will, result in SI joint dysfunction&#x2014;an often-overlooked musculoskeletal pathology associated with lower back pain.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0012">Indeed, SI joint dysfunction is estimated to be the primary cause of lower back pain in 15-30% of subjects afflicted with such pain. However, lower back pain associated with SI joint dysfunction is suspected to be far more common than most healthcare providers realize, since such pain is often associated with other skeletal and musculoskeletal dysfunctions.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0013">SI joint dysfunction, and pain associated therewith, can be caused by various SI joint abnormalities and/or disorders, including traumatic fracture dislocation of the pelvis, degenerative arthritis, sacroiliitis, i.e., an inflammation or degenerative condition of the sacroiliac joint; osteitis condensans ilii, and other degenerative conditions of the SI joint structures.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0014">SI joint dysfunction, and pain associated therewith, is also a common complication associated with spinal deformity and, in many instances spinal deformity correction procedures. Indeed, it is estimated that approximately 75% of subjects that have presented with a spinal deformity and have undergone a spinal deformity correction procedure comprising a spinal stabilization apparatus develop SI joint dysfunction due to increased stress at the SI joint.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0015">As is well known in the art, spinal deformity correction procedures are particularly complex procedures, and achieving adequate spinal deformity correction while avoiding post-operative complications associated therewith is often incredibly challenging.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016">A common seminal complication associated with spinal deformity correction procedures that often results in the development of SI joint dysfunction is pseudarthrosis, i.e., failure of adjacent bone structures to fuse; particularly, adjacent bone structure proximate the distal end of an employed spinal stabilization apparatus. Indeed, pseudarthrosis often necessitates subsequent surgeries to address the failed fusion event.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0017">Since pseudarthrosis typically occurs at the lumbosacral (L5-S1) joint due to the elevated lever arm of proximally fused bone structure regions and associated cantilevering events, spinal stabilization apparatus have recently incorporated spinopelvic stabilization functionality to provide increased stabilization proximate to the lumbosacral joint to abate pseudarthrosis at the lumbosacral joint.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0018">Various spinal stabilization systems having spine and pelvic stabilization functionality (referred to hereinafter as &#x201c;musculoskeletal stabilization systems&#x201d; and &#x201c;spinopelvic stabilization systems&#x201d;) have thus been developed and employed to abate pseudarthrosis.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0019">One commonly employed spinopelvic stabilization system comprises S2-alar-iliac (S2AI) screws, which are positioned in a region between the sacral neuroforamina of S1 and S2 and driven into the ilium to affix the sacrum to the ilium, such as the S2AI screws &#x201c;AI<sub>1</sub>&#x201d; and &#x201c;AI<sub>2</sub>&#x201d; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0020">There are, however, numerous drawbacks and disadvantages associated with the use of S2AI screws; such disadvantages include increased surgical difficulty associated with implantation of the screws, potential pelvic breach upon implantation of the screws, excessive screw bending of the screws in situ, provision of insufficient fixation strength at the SI joint, substantial implant prominence or protrusion, and/or tissue damage.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0021">Indeed, it is estimated that in situ failure of S2AI screws occurs in approximately 10% of spinal deformity correction cases involving spinopelvic stabilization with S2AI screws.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0022">Improved spinopelvic stabilization systems employing S2AI screws, such as the iFuse Bedrock&#x2122; system disclosed in U.S. Pub. No. 2020/0261240 to Mesiwala, et al., and the JCBD systems disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 11,129,718 to Donner, et al., have thus been developed to address the noted disadvantages associated with S2AI screws. Although the noted systems and associated spinopelvic stabilization methods have garnered some success in reinforcing the S2AI screws and, thereby, effectively addressing some of the disadvantages associated with S2AI screws, there similarly remains many disadvantages associated with the systems.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0023">A major disadvantage associated with many of the improved spinopelvic stabilization systems; particularly, the iFuse Bedrock&#x2122; and JCBD systems, is that such systems are quite complex and add additional complexity to spinal deformity correction procedures. It has thus been found that, notwithstanding the level of surgical training and experience that a surgeon may possess, when such S2AI screw-based spinopelvic stabilization systems are employed, there are still substantial incidences of damage to the lumbosacral nerve structures proximate to the SI joint and pelvic breach.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0024">A further disadvantage associated with many of the improved spinopelvic stabilization systems, including the iFuse Bedrock&#x2122; and JCBD systems, is that such S2AI screw-based systems merely reinforce the S2AI screws via additional components, such as additional prostheses. The additional prostheses are typically positioned in the limited space between the neuroforamen of the sacrum and, hence, associated nerve structures proximate thereto, which increases the probability of damaging the nerve structures and inducing post-operative pain.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0025">The additional components also enhance the system complexity and substantially increase the probability of system failure, and, therefore further surgical procedures to address such failure.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0026">A further disadvantage associated with many of the improved spinopelvic stabilization systems, including the iFuse Bedrock&#x2122; and JCBD systems, is that such systems are also often prone to failure due to ineffective engagement of the prostheses in and, thus, to SI joint bone structures and, hence, dislodgement of the prostheses.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0027">It would thus be desirable to provide spinopelvic, i.e., musculoskeletal, stabilization systems apparatus, and methods that substantially reduce or eliminate the disadvantages associated with conventional musculoskeletal stabilization systems, apparatus and methods.</p><p id="p-0030"
