The invention also relates to an aerosol-generating article comprising the formulation for use in an aerosol-generating system, and an aerosol-generating system comprising the formulation and an atomiser.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Aerosol-generating systems for delivering an aerosol to a user typically comprise an atomiser configured to generate an inhalable aerosol from a formulation. Some known aerosol-generating systems comprise a thermal atomiser such as an electric heater that is configured to heat and vaporise the formulation to generate an aerosol. Typical formulations for use in aerosol-generating systems are nicotine formulations, which may be liquid nicotine formulations comprising an aerosol former such as glycerine and/or propylene glycol.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It would be desirable to provide a formulation that exhibits reduced risk of leakage compared to typical formulations when used in an aerosol-generating system.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There is provided a formulation for use in an aerosol-generating system. The formulation may comprise one or more aerosol formers. The formulation may comprise one or more polymers. The one or more polymers may be selected from the group consisting of: polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, polyglycolic acid, polylactic acid, polydioxanone, polycaprolactone, polyethylene, polypropylene glycol and starch. The formulation may have a melting point of between 60 degrees Celsius and 300 degrees Celsius.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is provided a formulation for use in an aerosol-generating system, the formulation comprising: one or more aerosol formers; and one or more polymers selected from the group consisting of: polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, polyglycolic acid, polylactic acid, polydioxanone, polycaprolactone, polyethylene, polypropylene glycol and starch; wherein the formulation has a melting point of between 60 degrees Celsius and 300 degrees Celsius.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is also provided an aerosol-generating article for use in an aerosol-generating system, the aerosol-generating article containing a formulation comprising: one or more aerosol formers; and one or more polymers selected from the group consisting of: polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, polyglycolic acid, polylactic acid, polydioxanone, polycaprolactone, polyethylene, polypropylene glycol and starch; wherein the formulation has a melting point of between 60 degrees Celsius and 300 degrees Celsius.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is also provided an aerosol-generating device comprising: a formulation comprising: one or more aerosol formers; and one or more polymers selected from the group consisting of: polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, polyglycolic acid, polylactic acid, polydioxanone, polycaprolactone, polyethylene, polypropylene glycol and starch; wherein the formulation has a melting point of between 60 degrees Celsius and 300 degrees Celsius.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">There is also provided an aerosol-generating system comprising: a formulation comprising: one or more aerosol formers; and one or more polymers selected from the group consisting of: polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, polyglycolic acid, polylactic acid, polydioxanone, polycaprolactone, polyethylene, polypropylene glycol and starch; wherein the formulation has a melting point of between 60 degrees Celsius and 300 degrees Celsius.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As used herein, the term &#x201c;aerosol-forming substrate&#x201d; relates to a substrate capable of releasing volatile compounds that can form an aerosol. Such volatile compounds may be released by heating the aerosol-forming substrate or by other aerosolising means. The aerosol-forming substrate may be a liquid. The liquid may be such as an e-liquid. The liquid may be a solution. The liquid may be a colloid. The colloid may have discontinuous solid particles dispersed in a continuous liquid. The colloid may have discontinuous liquid particles dispersed in a continuous liquid. The colloid may have discontinuous liquid particles dispersed in a continuous solid.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Unless stated otherwise, percentages by weight of components of the formulation recited herein are based on the total weight of the formulation.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Given that the melting point of the formulation is between 60 degrees Celsius and 300 degrees Celsius, the formulation is not a liquid at standard temperature and pressure. At standard temperature and pressure the formulation may be, for example, a solid or a colloid having a solid continuous phase and a liquid dispersed phase. Therefore, at standard temperature and pressure, the formulation may not easily flow when stored in a reservoir of an aerosol-generating article, aerosol-generating device or aerosol-generating system until the formulation is heated.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Advantageously, due to the melting point of the formulation, the formulation cannot easily leak out of the aerosol-generating article, aerosol-generating device or aerosol-generating system before it is heated during use of the aerosol-generating article, aerosol-generating device or aerosol-generating system. The melting point of the formulation may therefore reduce the risk of leakage during, for example, transportation or storage of the aerosol-generating article, aerosol-generating device or aerosol-generating system containing the formulation. The formulation may therefore increase the shelf-life of the aerosol-generating article, aerosol-generating device or aerosol-generating system.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">When the formulation is heated to between 60 degrees Celsius and 300 degrees Celsius, at least a portion of the formulation may transition, or may begin to transition, to the liquid phase. When the formulation is a liquid it may easily flow and be vaporised into an aerosol by a heater of the aerosol-generating article, aerosol-generating device or aerosol-generating system.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">After use of the aerosol-generating article, aerosol-generating device or aerosol-generating system, when the formulation cools below 60 degrees Celsius, the formulation may transition back to being a solid or a colloid having a solid continuous phase.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Advantageously, this phase transition puts the formulation back into a state in which it cannot easily flow, which means reduces the risk of the formulation leaking or escaping out of the aerosol-generating article, aerosol-generating device or aerosol-generating system between heating cycles.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The formulation may be a solid at standard temperature and pressure.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The formulation may be a colloid at standard temperature and pressure. The colloid may have a solid continuous phase at standard temperature and pressure. The colloid may have a liquid dispersed phase at standard temperature and pressure. In one example, the colloid may have a solid continuous phase and a liquid dispersed phase at standard temperature and pressure.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The formulation may have an aerosol former content of greater than or equal to about 10 percent by weight.

The glycerine may comprise vegetable glycerine.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some preferred embodiments the one or more aerosol formers comprise a majority amount of glycerine. It has been found that glycerine based formulations may provide a better harder solid material. It has also been found that including a minor amount of propylene glycol in glycerine based formulations may provide a less rigid or less brittle solid than glycerine based compositions containing no propylene glycol.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Using sorbitol as at least one of the aerosol formers is advantageous because sorbitol is less hygroscopic compared to other aerosol formers, which may result in the formulation absorbing less water from the environment and being more stable in humid conditions.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Advantageously, including propylene glycol in the formulation results in a solid or colloidal formulation that is less rigid, less brittle, and is easier to form into plugs. These properties improve subsequent processing and handling of the formulation during the manufacturing process.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Advantageously, both glycerine and sorbitol may be less volatile than propylene glycol, which may evaporate in warm conditions.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The one or more aerosol formers may comprise a combination of glycerine and propylene glycol. The one or more aerosol formers may comprise a combination of vegetable glycerine and propylene glycol.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As discussed below, including propylene glycol in the formulation may improve vaporisation of the formulation, which can lead to the production of more aerosol for a given heating cycle.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">By including propylene glycol in a glycerine based formulation that includes nicotine, there may also be an improvement in the nicotine content of the aerosol due to more efficient vaporisation of the nicotine because propylene glycol has a lower boiling point (188&#xb0; C.) compared to glycerine (290&#xb0; C.). However, if there is high amount of propylene glycol in the formulation then the nicotine content of the aerosol decreases because the propylene glycol can be vaporised during a heating cycle. Therefore, it may be advantageous to have a limited amount of propylene glycol in the nicotine formulation.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The ratio of the weight percent glycerine content to the weight percent propylene glycol content of the formulation may be greater than or equal to about 1.

However, when the substance is an acid, the sample is added to the distilled water in the first step. After each addition of an amount of water, the mixture is shaken for 10 minutes and is visually checked for any undissolved parts of the sample. If, after addition of 10 ml of water, the sample or parts of it remain undissolved, the experiment is continued in a 100 ml measuring cylinder. The approximate solubility is given in Table 1 below under that volume of water in which complete dissolution of the sample occurs.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">When the solubility is low, a long time may be required to dissolve a substance and at least 24 hours should be allowed.

For example, the highest weight percent of nicotine is when there is 5 weight percent of propylene glycol in the aerosol former. This improvement may be due to more efficient vaporisation of the nicotine because propylene glycol has a lower boiling point (188&#xb0; C.) compared to glycerine (290&#xb0; C.).</p><p id="p-0210" num="0212">However, if there is high amount of propylene glycol in the formulation (for example 25 percent by weight propylene glycol) then the nicotine content of the aerosol decreases because the propylene glycol can be vaporised during a heating cycle. Therefore, it is advantageous to have a limited amount of propylene glycol in the nicotine formulation.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0213">The exemplary embodiments described above are not intended to limit the scope of the claims.
