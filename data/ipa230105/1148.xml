level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a steerable device, for instance, such device is used as a guide for a catheter or an endoscope for internally investigating a tubular element such as a pipe, a duct or an artery. The device of the invention is particularly suitable for use in the field of surgical investigation inside the body of a subject.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Even though the device is designed for surgical purpose, it can also be used in other areas needing non-destructive control or diagnostic such as pipeline systems for instance.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">There is a wide range of applications where there is a need for using a device inside a pipe, a duct or a tube, for example for the placement of the distal part of a flexible tube in a specific location, for investigation or bringing pharmaceuticals, or functionality at a remote or hard-to-access location.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">When displacing a flexible elongated device in the lumen of a pipe, duct or a tube, it is important for the user to be able to control carefully and precisely the movement and the placement of such device. Placement of such devices within pipes is a known technical issue in oil engineering or in motor engineering. Placement of devices within body tubes, such as for example through the ostium (of a vein, an artery, the gastro-intestinal track . . . etc), is also known in the medical field as being challenging.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the medical field, using surgical or endovascular techniques, one can treat a lot of cardiovascular diseases causing death in the world. One of the pathologies encountered is the myocardial infarction along with peripheral vascular diseases. Through the last decades, the use of catheters and guidewires to reach pathological areas so as to deliver stents or balloons has emerged as an easy-to-implement solution. These endovascular techniques are less invasive compared to conventional surgeries. They come with a decreased recovery time and less post operation complications.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, generally speaking, the surgeon skill and experience are a major success factor in the complex interventions while recent developments aim at facilitating navigation through complex anatomies as independently as possible from those surgeon skill and experience.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To do so, for example, it is known the application WO95/06494 that discloses a flexible elongated device comprising a flexible elongate member with proximal and distal extremities. A shape memory element disposed in the flexible elongate member and capable of assuming martensitic and austenitic states and having first and second portions. A layer of conductive material formed on at least one of said portions. The layer has a conductivity greater than that of the shape memory element. Electrical current is supplied to the shape memory element. The conductive layer serves to conduct current and shunts current flow around that portion of the shape memory element having the layer of conductive material thereon. This disclosure requires however a complex assembly with multiple inner connections inside the elongated device with a high risk of having a disassembly between the shape memory element and its associated inner knot.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">So as to overcome such complexity, lower disassembly risks and improve manufacturability, it is also known the patent application WO2018167300 disclosing a an elongated steerable system for guiding a catheter or an endoscope, comprising: an elongated flexible member comprising, along at least a part of its longitudinal axis, at least one projection which, in transversal section, projects from the elongated flexible member; said at least one projection having a distal end and a proximal end, and defining, in transversal section, two lateral sides projecting from the elongated flexible member; and a wire; wherein said at least one projection comprises at least one transverse retaining and passing means near the distal end of said projection, said retaining and passing means extending transversely to the lateral sides of the projection; and the wire passes through said retaining and passing means alternatively from one lateral side of the projection to the other lateral side of the projection, wherein adherence between the wire and the retaining and passing means retains the wire ensuring the anchorage of the wire to said retaining and passing means.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">These prior art devices are either complex and/or cumbersome and do not offer enough bending ability to navigate inside the lumen of a tube or pipe. The main objective of the invention is to provide a steerable device comprising actuators and fastening means that are easy to produce, compact and repeatable. According to the invention, the steerable device obtained is flexible enough to allow easy navigation inside a lumen, tube or pipe.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">This invention thus relates to a steerable device configured to be advanced in the lumen of a tubular element, said device comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0011">a flexible axially elongated member having proximal and distal ends,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0012">at least one actuating means arranged alongside the periphery of said elongated member,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0013">at least one fastening means configured to fasten at least partially the at least one actuating means to the flexible elongated member distal end, said fastening means being in direct contact with the flexible elongated member,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0014">at least one anti-return means configured to keep the at least one actuating means from sliding alongside the periphery of the flexible elongated member distal end,<br/>characterized in that the at least one anti-return means and the at least one fastening means are in axial abutting contact so as to prevent the at least one actuating means from sliding once actuated.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0012" num="0015">In a preferred embodiment, the at least one actuating means is made of a shape memory alloy such as NiTi alloy. Such alloys are used in the invention in surgical domain for their biocompatibility as well as their low density. The actuated bending motion is obtained by implementing electrical current that induces a phase transformation in the material through the Joule effect. Once the current no longer flows, the actuating means goes back to initial straight position thanks to the assembly spring back force. The higher the current, the higher the bending angle until a threshold.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0016">In a preferred embodiment, the at least one actuating means comprises a spring or a wire that are more practical, lighter and more compact for a small diameter pipe, lumen or tube.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0017">Preferably, the at least one flexible axially elongated member is wire or blade shaped. It may have a cross-section profile under a form selected from star, circular, semicircular, square, rectangular, triangle, pyramidal or any combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0018">In another alternative, the at least one flexible axially elongated member is spring shaped. More preferably, the spring is a helicoidal spring.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0019">Preferably, the at least one flexible axially elongated member is blade shaped so as to improve assembly and to have a preferred common bending plane for the actuators. In an alternative embodiment, the flexible axially elongated member is wire shaped.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0020">In an alternative embodiment, the fastening means is a ligation around the flexible elongated member. Just like for the actuating means, ligations are easy to implement and reduce the spatial congestion.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0021">In an alternative embodiment, the anti-return means is a glue filled tube, the actuating means going through said tube. The advantage of this configuration is that the actuating means are very solidly anchored while the tube end thickness serves as axial abutments for the fastening means.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0022">In a variant, the anti-return means is a crimped tube, the actuating means going through said tube. The advantage of this alternative configuration is that the actuating means are also very solidly anchored while the tube end thickness serves as axial abutments for the fastening means.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0023">Advantageously, another second anti-return means is made integral with the flexible elongated member so as to maintain the fastening means in place. Particularly, said anti-return means being a recess built into the flexible elongated member and configured to host the at least one fastening means. Preferably, the recess extends in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the flexible elongated member. In this case with the anti-return means made integral with the flexible elongated member, the device according to the invention is easy to produce, compact, and presents a low disassembly risk for the anti-return means. In addition, the assembly robustness is improved.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0024">In an exemplary embodiment, the anti-return means is made integral with the actuating means. In this other configuration also, the device according to the invention is easy to produce, compact, and presents a low disassembly risk for the anti-return means</p><p id="p-0022" num="0025">In an exemplary embodiment, the at least one anti-return means is a loop encapsulating at least partially the at least one fastening means or said loop being an abutment for the at least one fastening means. The loop is obtained by modifying the shape of the actuating means. It is also possible to have a configuration where the at least one anti-return means is a knot, a weld or any local reinforcement located at the at least one actuating means distal end. These configurations add simplicity to the low disassembly risk.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0026">Advantageously, the at least one anti-return means is a groove built into the actuating means and configured to host the at least one fastening means. This configuration adds simplicity to the low disassembly risk. Preferably, the groove extends in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the flexible elongated member. The groove can be obtained by an indentation process.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0027">In an advantageous embodiment, the at least one actuating means is inside an electrically isolating material such as a tube or a coating. The material has preferably an electrical and/or temperature isolation effect.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0028">In another advantageous embodiment, the at least one actuating means is arranged alongside the external periphery of the elongated member. In this case, the device assembly is made easier.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0029">In another advantageous embodiment, the at least one actuating means is arranged alongside the internal periphery of the elongated member. In this case, the external diameter is constant and the device according to the invention is less bulky.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0030">The invention has also as an object an assembly method for steerable device according to the invention comprising the steps of:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0031">providing a flexible axially elongated member having proximal and distal ends,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0032">arranging at least one actuating means alongside the periphery of said elongated member,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0033">fastening the at least one actuating means to the flexible elongated member distal end with at least one fastening means,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0034">Providing at least one anti-return means configured to keep the at least one actuating means from sliding alongside the periphery of the flexible elongated member distal end,<br/>characterized in that the at least one anti-return means and the at least one fastening means are in axial abutting contact so as to prevent the at least one actuating means from sliding once actuated.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0028" num="0035">In a preferred embodiment, in the method according to the invention, the at least one actuating means is arranged alongside the external periphery of the elongated member. In this case, the device assembly is made easier.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0036">In another advantageous embodiment, in the method according to the invention, the at least one actuating means is arranged alongside the internal periphery of the elongated member. In this case, the external diameter is constant and the device obtained according to the method of the invention is less bulky.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0037">The assembly method according to the invention may be such that the at least one actuating means is a wire, the at least one fastening means is a ligation and the at least one anti-return means is obtained by increasing the contact pressure between the wire and the ligation , with said ligation going alternatively up and under the wire so as to ligate longitudinally partial parts of the wire with the flexible elongated member.

The actuating means <b>3</b> is a flat wire extending longitudinally while being in facial contact with the elongated member <b>2</b>. It is thin compared to the ligation <b>4</b> diameter. Each of the anti-return means <b>5</b> host ligations <b>4</b> as wires winding around said anti-return means <b>5</b> forming coil windings with their axis being the same as the axis A<b>1</b> of elongation of the elongated member <b>2</b>. The ligation <b>4</b> ties the actuating means <b>3</b> (here, a flat wire) and fastens it to the elongated member <b>2</b> thanks to the grooves made in the actuating means <b>3</b>. The combination of the ligation <b>4</b>, the actuating mean grooves (<b>1</b>B) and potentially the recesses (generally speaking, any kind of anti-return means <b>5</b>) allow to keep the actuating mean <b>3</b> from sliding when actuated for instance by Joule effect when the actuating means <b>3</b> is a shape memory alloy such as NiTi type. In a preferred embodiment, the recess base of the flexible axially elongated member <b>2</b> and the groove base of the actuating means <b>3</b> barely coincide radially as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0057">Regardless of the embodiment, the device <b>1</b> displays a diameter comprised between 200 &#x3bc;m and 5 mm.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0058">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>C</figref>, one can see an exemplary configuration of the device <b>1</b> according to the invention with loops <b>51</b> made integral with the wire <b>30</b> as anti-return means.
