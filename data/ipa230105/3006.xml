Whilst these showerheads may be connected so as to allow some pivoting or rotation of the showerhead, e.g. to change spray angle, the showerheads are mounted in a set position. As opposed to a shower handset connected to a flexible hose and designed to be moved by a user as wished, these showerheads may be referred to as fixed showerheads. As used herein, the term &#x201c;mounting pipe&#x201d; therefore denotes an element able to both support the showerhead so as to hold it in a fixed position (i.e. having sufficient rigidity and structural integrity to maintain its shape even when loaded by water pressure), and to convey water to the showerhead. The mounting pipe may or may not be tubular.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a showerhead mounting pipe for mounting a wall-mounted or ceiling-mounted showerhead, the pipe having two ends, and a bend of at least 45&#xb0; between the ends, and wherein each end of the pipe comprises a connector for a showerhead.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The pipe is arranged to be cut in two for use, with only one of the connectors being used.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The one remaining connector is used to connect a showerhead to the pipe. The other, cut, end of the pipe is connected to a wall or ceiling supply connection (a supply conduit). The connection to a water supply conduit does not use a connector of the pipe, such as a screw thread. Instead, the connection may be made using welding, or a separate connector. In the prior art, pipes with a connector at each end&#x2014;e.g. with two threaded ends&#x2014;are used only in shower installations in which both the showerhead and the supply connection require the pipe to have an integral connector. Such pipes are therefore not arranged to be cut for use, as the cut end would no longer be able to provide the intended function. Further, only one of the two connectors of such a pipe is intended for a showerhead&#x2014;the other is intended for a supply conduit. A pipe with a showerhead connector at each end is appropriate only when there is an intention to cut the pipe. As used herein, the term &#x201c;showerhead connector&#x201d; denotes a connector designed and intended to be connected to a showerhead.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Different users or installers may wish to mount showerheads in different locations, and/or to water supply conduits which are in different locations (e.g. on or within a wall or on or within a ceiling). Two standard mounting arrangements to provide a showerhead fixedly mounted to provide water downwards are: for a ceiling-mounted arrangement, a mounting pipe extending vertically downwards from a ceiling; and for a wall-mounted arrangement, a mounting pipe extending horizontally outward from a wall, and comprising a downward bend.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Manufacturers often do not know the arrangement of a customer's bathroom water supply, and so include in a kit of parts for shower assembly two separate mounting pipes (each with one showerhead connector)&#x2014;both a straight mounting pipe for use with ceiling-mounted arrangements and a curved, or bent, mounting pipe for use with wall-mounted arrangements. This results in significant wastage, with one of the two mounting pipes almost always being discarded, and also an increased total number of parts for inventory management, warehousing and distribution. Alternatively, extra time and effort must be spent in ascertaining which pipe each consumer wants, increasing the number of different types of kits of parts to manage and the risk of mistakes leaving a customer without a useable mounting pipe.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The inventors appreciated that providing a single, double-ended, mounting pipe that can be cut to size and shape for either mounting arrangement might decrease wastage, as only a smaller portion may be disposed of, and facilitate inventory management, warehousing and distribution, as only a single part is needed for either type of shower installation rather than two. Further, as it is normal for a standard mounting pipe to be cut to the correct length for installation by an installer, the single cut required to provide the suitable portion of the double-ended mounting pipe for use does not significantly add to an installer's workload, if at all.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The pipe may have a total of two ends; i.e. the pipe may not branch. The pipe may have a total of two showerhead connectors.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The pipe may comprise only the one bend. The bend may have a constant curvature.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The pipe may be at least substantially L-shaped.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The bend may have an angle of equal to or around 90&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The bend may not be placed centrally along the length of the pipe.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The bend may be closer to one connector than to the other connector. For example, the bend may be closer to a first connector of the connectors than a second connector of the connectors, and the first connector may be intended for wall-mounted showerheads and the second connector may be intended for ceiling-mounted showerheads.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The pipe may comprise one or more markers indicating one or more intended cutting positions or regions. For example, the one or more markers may indicate two different intended cutting positions or regions&#x2014;one for wall-mounted showerheads and the other for ceiling-mounted showerheads. The markers may be integral with the pipe or connected thereto.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Each connector may be or comprise a screw-thread arranged to engagingly receive a screw-thread of a showerhead.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The bend in the pipe may be of at least 60&#xb0;, at least 70&#xb0;, at least 80&#xb0;, or optionally at least 90&#xb0;. The bend may be between 45&#xb0; and 90&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Flexible hoses of the kind used for shower handsets (which are arranged to provide the option of being held and moved manually) are not intended to be covered by the word &#x201c;pipe&#x201d; as used herein. The pipe may be rigid.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of installing a mounting pipe for a wall-mounted or ceiling-mounted showerhead. The method comprises: obtaining a pipe comprising a connector for a showerhead at each end and a bend between the connectors; identifying a suitable portion of the pipe for use, the suitable portion including just one connector of the connectors of the pipe; cutting the pipe to separate the suitable portion from the remainder of the pipe; and attaching a cut end region of the suitable portion of the pipe to a water supply conduit, leaving the connector available for connection to the showerhead.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The water supply conduit is arranged not to require the pipe to have an integral connector. For example, it may be designed to have a pipe welded thereto, and/or may comprise, or be arranged to receive, a separate connector arranged to connect the water supply conduit to the pipe.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The pipe may have two ends&#x2014;a first end and a second end with the pipe extending therebetween. The pipe may also have two connectors&#x2014;one the first end of the pipe and the other at the second end of the pipe, such that the pipe may therefore be described as a double-ended pipe.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The initial, double ended, mounting pipe is therefore cut into two portions as a part of the installation method&#x2014;a suitable portion for mounting a showerhead in a chosen location, and a remaining portion, which may or may not itself be suitable for use as a showerhead mounting pipe. The suitable portion may then be itself referred to as a mounting pipe for the relevant showerhead.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The suitable portion may have a length of at least two thirds of the length of the un-cut pipe.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The showerhead to be mounted may be a wall-mounted showerhead. In such examples, the suitable portion may include a length of the pipe including at least a portion of the bend.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The suitable portion may bend through an angle of at least 60&#xb0;, at least 70&#xb0;, at least 80&#xb0;, or optionally at least 90&#xb0;, between the cut end and the connector.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The suitable portion may or may not include the entirety of the bend in the pipe.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The showerhead to be mounted may instead be a ceiling-mounted showerhead. In such examples, the suitable portion may include a length of the pipe excluding at least the majority of the bend.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The suitable portion may exclude the entirety of the bend in the pipe. The suitable portion may therefore be straight/may bend through an angle of 0&#xb0; between the cut end and the connector.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Alternatively, the suitable portion may bends through a non-zero angle, for example through an angle of more than 0&#xb0; but less than 25&#xb0;, and optionally less than 10&#xb0;, between the cut end and the connector.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The identifying a suitable portion of the pipe for use may comprise selecting a length for the suitable portion based on wall or ceiling design, supply conduit location, and desired showerhead location. For example, the length may be selected such that the cut end is behind or inside the respective wall or ceiling in use.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a kit of parts for shower installation. The kit of parts comprises: a showerhead mounting pipe for mounting a wall-mounted or ceiling-mounted showerhead, the pipe having two ends, and a bend of at least 45&#xb0; between the ends, wherein each end of the pipe comprises a connector for a showerhead; and a showerhead arranged to be connected to one of the connectors of the mounting pipe.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The kit of parts may be provided packaged in a box, e.g. a cardboard box. The box may be marked with instructions (written and/or pictorial) for how use the showerhead mounting pipe.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The showerhead mounting pipe may be as described in the first aspect.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The kit of parts may be used to implement the method of the second aspect.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the following description, like reference numerals are used for like components.
