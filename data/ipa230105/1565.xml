The robot <b>2</b> has a base <b>21</b> and a robot arm <b>22</b> coupled to the base <b>21</b> in a rotationally movable manner. An end effector <b>23</b> is attached to a distal end part of the robot arm <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The robot arm <b>22</b> is a robotic arm having a plurality of arms <b>221</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>223</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>225</b>, <b>226</b> coupled together in a rotationally movable manner. The robot arm <b>22</b> has six joints J<b>1</b> to J<b>6</b>. Of these joints, the joints J<b>2</b>, J<b>3</b>, J<b>5</b> are bending joints and the joints J<b>1</b>, J<b>4</b>, J<b>6</b> are twisting joints. A motor M as a drive source and an encoder E detecting the amount of rotation of the motor M are installed at each of the joints J<b>1</b>, J<b>2</b>, J<b>3</b>, J<b>4</b>, J<b>5</b>, J<b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The end effector <b>23</b> is coupled to the arm <b>226</b>.

The end effector <b>23</b> in this embodiment has a rotationally driven abrasive wheel <b>231</b>. The robot <b>2</b> executes a polishing task to smooth the surface of a target object Q.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The robot <b>2</b> has been described above. However, the configuration of the robot <b>2</b> is not particularly limited. For example, the robot <b>2</b> may be a SCARA robot (horizontal articulated robot), a dual-arm robot, or the like. The robot <b>2</b> may be fixed to a floor or the like and thus immovable. The robot <b>2</b> may be fixed to a moving device such as an automatic guided vehicle (AGV) and thus movable.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The robot control device <b>3</b> controls the driving of the robot system <b>1</b>, based on a command from a host computer (not illustrated). The robot control device <b>3</b> is formed by a computer, for example, and has a processor processing information, a memory communicatively coupled to the processor, and an external interface coupling to an external device.

A teaching support program PP executable by the processor is saved in the memory. The processor can read and execute the teaching support program PP. The teaching support program PP is software supporting the teaching to the robot <b>2</b>. The teaching support device <b>4</b> is hardware where this software is installed.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the teaching support device <b>4</b> has an input accepting unit <b>41</b> accepting an input from a user, and a computing unit <b>42</b> optimizing the attitude of the robot arm <b>22</b> and the position of the end effector <b>23</b>, based on information accepted by the input accepting unit <b>41</b>.

In the movement D, a movement start point and a movement end point are both P<b>0</b> and a plurality of teaching points P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>, P<b>3</b>, P<b>4</b>, P<b>5</b> are set between the movement start point and the movement end point. The robot arm <b>22</b> moves in such a way that the abrasive wheel <b>231</b> passes over the movement start point P<b>0</b>, the teaching point P<b>1</b>, the teaching point P<b>2</b>, the teaching point P<b>3</b>, the teaching point P<b>4</b>, the teaching point P<b>5</b>, and the movement end point P<b>0</b> in this order. In the description below, the movement start point is denoted by P<b>0</b> and the movement end point is denoted by P<b>0</b>&#x2032; in order to distinguish the movement start point and the movement end point from each other.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a movement in which the robot arm <b>22</b> is moved in a trajectory that draws a circle, as in the movement D, the amounts of rotation (angles of rotation) of the joints J<b>1</b> to J<b>6</b> tend to be large and the range of options for the attitude of the robot arm <b>22</b> that can complete the movement D tends to be narrow. Therefore, it is difficult to teach the robot <b>2</b> and teaching support by the teaching support device <b>4</b> is more effective. However, the movement D is not particularly limited. For example, the movement start point and the movement end point may differ from each other.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The teaching support device <b>4</b> optimizes the attitude of the robot arm <b>22</b> in the movement from the movement start point P<b>0</b> to the teaching point P<b>1</b>, in the movement from the teaching point P<b>1</b> to the teaching point P<b>2</b>, in the movement from the teaching point P<b>2</b> to the teaching point P<b>3</b>, in the movement from the teaching point P<b>3</b> to the teaching point P<b>4</b>, in the movement from the teaching point P<b>4</b> to the teaching point P<b>5</b>, and in the movement from the teaching point P<b>5</b> to the movement end point P<b>0</b>&#x2032;, using an LJM function.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The LJM function is a function that decides the attitude of the robot arm <b>22</b> by combining a plurality of parameters P in such a way as to minimize the total amount of rotation of the joints J<b>1</b> to J<b>6</b> in relation to a designated position (target position) as viewed from a reference position (current position). The parameters P are not particularly limited. In this embodiment, five parameters that are highly related to the attitude of the robot arm <b>22</b>, specifically, &#x201c;joint J<b>1</b> Flag&#x201d;, &#x201c;elbow&#x201d;, &#x201c;wrist&#x201d;, &#x201c;joint J<b>4</b> Flag&#x201d;, and &#x201c;joint J<b>6</b> Flag&#x201d;, are employed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As the &#x201c;joint J<b>1</b> Flag&#x201d;, 0 indicating that the angle of rotation of the joint J<b>1</b> of the arm <b>221</b> from the reference position is 0&#xb0; to &#x2212;180&#xb0; or 0&#xb0; to +180&#xb0;, or 1 indicating that the angle of rotation of the joint J<b>1</b> of the arm <b>221</b> from the reference position is &#x2212;180&#xb0; to &#x2212;240&#xb0; or +180&#xb0; to +240&#xb0;, is selected. As the &#x201c;elbow&#x201d;, A indicating that the joint J<b>3</b> is directed forward (to one side), or B indicating that the joint J<b>3</b> is directed backward (to the other side), is selected. As the &#x201c;wrist&#x201d;, NF (No Flip) indicating that a predetermined surface of the arm <b>224</b> faces upward, or F (Flip) indicating that the arm <b>224</b> is reversed to make the predetermined surface face downward, is selected. As the &#x201c;joint J<b>4</b> Flag&#x201d;, 0 indicating that the angle of rotation of the joint J<b>4</b> of the arm <b>224</b> from the reference position is greater than &#x2212;180&#xb0; and equal to or smaller than +180&#xb0;, or 1 indicating that the angle of rotation of the joint J<b>4</b> of the arm <b>224</b> from the reference position is equal to or smaller than &#x2212;180&#xb0; or greater than +180&#xb0;, is selected. Similarly, as the &#x201c;joint J<b>6</b> Flag&#x201d;, 0 indicating that the angle of rotation of the joint J<b>6</b> of the arm <b>226</b> from the reference position is greater than &#x2212;180&#xb0; and equal to or smaller than +180&#xb0;, or 1 indicating that the angle of rotation of the joint J<b>6</b> of the arm <b>226</b> from the reference position is greater than &#x2212;360&#xb0; and equal to or smaller than &#x2212;180&#xb0; or greater than +180&#xb0;, is selected.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">When the teaching point P<b>1</b> is designated as the designated position and the movement start point P<b>0</b> is designated as the reference position as in LJM(P<b>0</b>, P<b>1</b>), the teaching support device <b>4</b> decides the individual parameters P, for example, joint J<b>1</b> Flag=0, elbow=A, wrist=NF, joint J<b>4</b> Flag=0, and joint J<b>6</b> Flag=1, in such a way as to minimize the total amount of rotation of the joints J<b>1</b> to J<b>6</b> when the end effector <b>23</b> moves from the movement start point P<b>0</b> to the teaching point P<b>1</b>, using the LJM function. The teaching support device <b>4</b> similarly decides the individual parameters P with respect to LJM(P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>), LJM(P<b>2</b>, P<b>3</b>), LJM(P<b>3</b>, P<b>4</b>), LJM(P<b>4</b>, P<b>5</b>), and LJM(P<b>5</b>, P<b>0</b>&#x2032;).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Thus, the attitude of the robot arm <b>22</b> during the movement to the teaching point P<b>1</b> is optimized, based on the attitude of the robot arm <b>22</b> at the movement start point P<b>0</b>. The attitude of the robot arm <b>22</b> during the movement to the teaching point P<b>2</b> is optimized, based on the attitude of the robot arm <b>22</b> at the teaching point P<b>1</b>. The attitude of the robot arm <b>22</b> during the movement to the teaching point P<b>3</b> is optimized, based on the attitude of the robot arm <b>22</b> at the teaching point P<b>2</b>. The attitude of the robot arm <b>22</b> during the movement to the teaching point P<b>4</b> is optimized, based on the attitude of the robot arm <b>22</b> at the teaching point P<b>3</b>. The attitude of the robot arm <b>22</b> during the movement to the teaching point P<b>5</b> is optimized, based on the attitude of the robot arm <b>22</b> at the teaching point P<b>4</b>. The attitude of the robot arm <b>22</b> during the movement to the movement end point P<b>0</b>&#x2032; is optimized, based on the attitude of the robot arm <b>22</b> at the teaching point P<b>5</b>. Therefore, the motion of the robot arm <b>22</b> during the movement D becomes smoother. The accuracy of the movement D is improved and the time taken for the movement D is reduced.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to such a method, the attitudes of the robot arm <b>22</b> at the teaching points P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>, P<b>3</b>, P<b>4</b>, P<b>5</b> and the movement end point P<b>0</b>&#x2032; are sequentially optimized, based on the attitude of the robot arm <b>22</b> at the movement start point P<b>0</b>. Therefore, the movement D can be smoothly executed. However, if the robot arm <b>22</b> is set in an inappropriate attitude at the movement start point P<b>0</b>, the subsequent attitude of the robot arm <b>22</b> is optimized, based on the inappropriate attitude. Therefore, there is a risk of, for example, a drop in the task efficiency such as a longer task time, and a contact interference or the like between the robot arm <b>22</b> and the robot <b>2</b> itself due to an inappropriate movement where the contact state between the target object Q and the abrasive wheel <b>231</b> cannot be maintained. In order to optimize the attitude of the robot arm <b>22</b> using the LJM function, it is important that the robot arm <b>22</b> is set in an appropriate attitude at the movement start point P<b>0</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">To this end, the teaching support device <b>4</b> executes a teaching support task S<b>1</b> as described below, so that the user can set the robot arm <b>22</b> in an appropriate attitude at the movement start point P<b>0</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the teaching support task S<b>1</b> includes an information acquisition step S<b>11</b> of acquiring the movement D of the robot arm <b>22</b> and the movement start point P<b>0</b> where the movement D starts, a candidate calculation step S<b>12</b> of calculating a plurality of candidates for the attitude of the robot arm <b>22</b> at the acquired movement start point P<b>0</b>, a rotation state calculation step S<b>13</b> of calculating the states of rotation of the joints J<b>1</b> to J<b>6</b> as of when the robot arm <b>22</b> is moved according to the movement D from the movement start point P<b>0</b>, for each of the plurality of candidates that are calculated, and a reporting step S<b>14</b> of reporting the result of the calculation to the user.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Information Acquisition Step S<b>11</b></heading><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The teaching support device <b>4</b> accepts information about the movement D of the robot arm <b>22</b> and the movement start point P<b>0</b> where the movement D starts, from the user via the input device <b>52</b>.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Candidate Calculation Step S<b>12</b></heading><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The teaching support device <b>4</b> calculates a plurality of candidates for the attitude of the robot arm <b>22</b> at the movement start point P<b>0</b>, based on the movement start point P<b>0</b> acquired in the information acquisition step S<b>11</b>. In this embodiment, the teaching support device <b>4</b> decides the attitude of the robot arm <b>22</b> at the movement start point P<b>0</b>, using a total of four parameters, that is, joint J<b>1</b> Flag, wrist, joint J<b>4</b> Flag, and joint J<b>6</b> Flag, and therefore calculates all the combinations of these four parameters, that is, 2<sup>4</sup>=16 patterns of candidates.

In this embodiment, the result of the calculation is displayed as a list F<b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> on the screen of the monitor <b>51</b>. The list F<b>1</b> shows all the <b>16</b> patterns of candidates. Each parameter P and &#x201c;Result&#x201d; are linked to each candidate. Thus, the result of the calculation can be reported to the user more intelligibly.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">A candidate whose linked &#x201c;Result&#x201d; is &#x201c;x&#x201d; means that the movement D cannot be executed since the amount of rotation of one of the joints J<b>1</b> to J<b>6</b> exceeds the range of motion during the movement D. A candidate whose linked &#x201c;Result&#x201d; is &#x201c;Show&#x201d; means that the movement D can be executed since the amounts of rotation of the joints J<b>1</b> to J<b>6</b> do not exceed the range of motion during the movement D. Therefore, by checking the list F<b>1</b>, the user can easily check which attitude (combination of parameters P) enables the execution of the movement D and can easily teach the robot <b>2</b> after the check. In this way, the teaching support device <b>4</b> reports the list F<b>1</b> to the user and thus supports the user in teaching the robot.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the user selects &#x201c;Show&#x201d;, the teaching support device <b>4</b> displays a graph F<b>2</b> showing a change with time in the amounts of rotation of the joints J<b>1</b> to J<b>6</b> corresponding to the selected candidate, on the screen of the monitor <b>51</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>. Thus, the result of the calculation can be reported to the user more intelligibly. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a graph showing a change with time in the amounts of rotation of the joints J<b>1</b> to J<b>6</b> corresponding to a candidate <b>0</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a graph showing a change with time in the amounts of rotation of the joints J<b>1</b> to J<b>6</b> corresponding to a candidate <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the case of the candidate <b>0</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the rotations of the joints J<b>1</b> to J<b>6</b> are continuous during the movement D. This means that the movement D can be executed more smoothly if the attitude of the robot arm <b>22</b> at the movement start point P<b>0</b> is set according to the parameters P of the candidate <b>0</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Meanwhile, in the case of the candidate <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the rotations of the joints J<b>1</b> to J<b>3</b>, J<b>5</b>, and J<b>6</b> are continuous during the movement D, whereas the rotation of the joint J<b>4</b> is discontinuous. The term &#x201c;discontinuous&#x201d; means that a joint rotates by 180&#xb0; or more when the robot arm moves from one point to the next point during the movement D. The term &#x201c;continuous&#x201d; means otherwise. Therefore, when the attitude of the candidate <b>1</b> is employed as the attitude of the robot arm <b>22</b> at the movement start point P<b>0</b>, the movement D can be executed but needs to be temporarily stopped in the middle and then needs to be resumed after the joint J<b>1</b> is rotated by 180&#xb0; or more to bring the robot arm <b>22</b> into a new attitude. Consequently, the movement D takes a longer time and results in lower task efficiency. Also, as the movement D is temporarily stopped, there is a risk of task failure at the stop site.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Therefore, preferably, the user checks the graph F<b>2</b> corresponding to each candidate, selects one from among candidates where the rotations of all the joints J<b>1</b> to J<b>6</b> are continuous, and teaches the robot <b>2</b>, based on the selected candidate. Thus, the robot <b>2</b> can be made to execute the movement D more smoothly. In this way, reporting not only whether the movement D can be executed or not but also whether the rotations of the joints J<b>1</b> to J<b>6</b> during the movement D are continuous or not, to the user, makes the robot teaching support for the user by the teaching support device <b>4</b> more effective. Therefore, the user can teach the robot <b>2</b> more easily.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Particularly, in this embodiment, the discontinuous rotation of the joint J<b>4</b> is highlighted to be more visible than the continuous rotations of the other joints J<b>1</b> to J<b>3</b>, J<b>5</b>, and J<b>6</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. Therefore, the user can easily determine whether the selected candidate includes a joint with discontinuous rotation or not. The method for highlighting is not particularly limited.

According to such a method, the attitude of the robot arm <b>22</b> at the movement start point P<b>0</b> can be optimized and the result thereof can be reported to the user. Therefore, the user can teach the movement D easily and securely, based on the reported result.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As described above, the robot arm <b>22</b> has the plurality of joints J<b>1</b> to J<b>6</b>. In the rotation state calculation step S<b>13</b>, the state of rotation of each of the joints J<b>1</b> to J<b>6</b> is calculated.
