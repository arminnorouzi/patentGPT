Methods</heading><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The present disclosure also relates to methods for styling hair, for example by temporarily straightening curly or wavy hair by application of the compositions described herein to the hair. The methods generally comprise applying any of the compositions according to the disclosure to the hair.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The compositions may be useful in a variety of settings, either for chemically treated or untreated hair, and/or for natural or unnatural curls. The degree of curliness or curl type of the hair may vary and is not limited. For example, the curls of hair been treated by the compositions disclosed herein may range from slightly wavy to very kinky and coily hair, and may have different textures and colors.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In addition to temporarily straightening the hair, the compositions are surprisingly capable of providing a variety of desirable sensory benefits, for example, moisture, smoothness, softness, shine, and/or anti-frizz properties, to the hair. As such, the compositions are useful in styling (which includes straightening) hair while also caring for hair, conditioning hair, and/or imparting one or more above-described sensory benefits to the hair.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Typically, methods according to the disclosure may include applying an effective amount of a composition disclosed herein to hair having waves or curls, when the hair is dry, wet, damp, or moist. The hair may be either natural or synthetic hair. As used herein, the term &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; refers to an amount sufficient to provide a desired straightening effect to the hair, taking into account the degree of curliness, the length, the volume, and the texture of the hair, and/or an amount sufficient to provide a desired sensory benefit to the hair. In general, from about 0.5 grams to about 50 grams of product is applied to the hair, depending on the specific product formulation, hair length, hair volume, and hair style type. The composition applied to the hair may, for example, be distributed evenly by combing through with fingers or a means such as a comb or the like. The composition may then be dried, for example air-dried or dried with a hair dryer. Heat may optionally be used during drying, but is not required. The composition may be allowed to remain on the hair as a leave-in product for any period of time as needed, for example, a few hours or a few days, or until the next washing or rinsing of the hair. Alternatively, the compositions may be rinsed from the hair after a brief leave-in period, from about a few seconds (e.g. 5, 10, 20, 30, or 60 seconds) to about 10, 20, or 30 minutes, or longer.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, before applying the composition to the hair, the hair may be first cleansed with a commercially available shampoo, and/or rinsed with water, and/or dried, either partially or completely. The composition may then be applied to the washed and/or rinsed hair when the hair is wet, damp, moist, or dry. In some other embodiments, before applying the composition to dry hair, the hair can optionally be moistened, damped, or wetted by water spray or using a wet towel, or by applying other treatment compositions that make the hair moist, damp, or wet.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">It has surprisingly and unexpectedly been discovered that methods according to the disclosure generally do not require the use of a reducing agent, including a base, or heating the hair in order to achieve a temporary straightening effect. As such, in some embodiments, the method does not include using a reducing agent or a base, and/or does not including heating the hair.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In various embodiments, the methods of treating hair with the compositions according to the disclosure impart the benefits described above to the hair, without a greasy feel or flaking, relative to hair not having been treated with a composition according to the disclosure. The benefits imparted to the hair may remain a desired length of time, such as a few hours, a few days, or until the hair is rinsed or washed.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The compositions described herein are not mascara compositions, i.e. are not intended to be applied to eyelashes and/or eyebrows. The compositions are likewise not makeup compositions, i.e. are not intended to be applied to skin, in particular, to skin on the face, body, or lips. Thus, treatment of, or application to, the hair is intended to be limited to hair on the head, i.e. the scalp of the head, and not eyelashes, eyebrows, body or facial hair, or the like. In such embodiments, a skilled person understands that &#x201c;hair on the head&#x201d; means hair that grows from the scalp of the head, and excludes eyebrows, eyelashes, facial hair, etc.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Having described the many embodiments of the present invention in detail, it will be apparent that modifications and variations are possible without departing from the scope of the disclosure defined in the appended claims. Furthermore, it should be appreciated that all examples in the present disclosure, while illustrating many embodiments of the disclosure, are provided as non-limiting examples and are, therefore, not to be taken as limiting the various aspects so illustrated. It is to be understood that all definitions herein are provided for the present disclosure only.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;having,&#x201d; and &#x201c;including&#x201d; (or &#x201c;comprise,&#x201d; &#x201c;have,&#x201d; and &#x201c;include&#x201d;) are used in their open, non-limiting sense. The phrase &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; limits the scope of a claim to the specified materials or steps and those that do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristics of the compositions.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In this application, the use of the singular includes the plural unless specifically stated otherwise. The singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; &#x201c;the,&#x201d; and &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; are understood to encompass the plural as well as the singular unless the context clearly dictates otherwise, and these expressions, as well as the expression &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; which means &#x201c;at least one,&#x201d; are expressly intended to include the individual components as well as mixtures/combinations thereof. Likewise, the term &#x201c;a salt thereof&#x201d; also relates to &#x201c;salts thereof.&#x201d; Thus, where the disclosure refers to &#x201c;an element selected from the group consisting of A, B, C, D, E, F, a salt thereof, or mixtures thereof,&#x201d; it indicates that that one or more of A, B, C, D, or F may be included, one or more of a salt of A, a salt of B, a salt of C, a salt of D, a salt of E, or a salt of F may be included, or a mixture of any two of A, B, C, D, E, F, a salt of A, a salt of B, a salt of C, a salt of D, a salt of E, and a salt of F may be included. However, it is to be understood that such language also includes embodiments where G, H, I, etc., are present, as long as at least one of A, B, C, D, E, F, or a salt thereof, is also present.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; should be understood to include both the conjunctive and the disjunctive. For example, &#x201c;A and/or B&#x201d; means &#x201c;A and B&#x201d; as well as &#x201c;A or B,&#x201d; and expressly covers instances of either, without reference to the other. For example, a composition that comprises &#x201c;at least one acid buffer and/or at least one phosphate buffer&#x201d; means that the disclosure includes compositions comprising one or more acid buffers or one or more phosphate buffers, as well as compositions comprising one or more acid buffers and one or more phosphate buffers. As a further example, disclosure of &#x201c;methods of styling the hair, straightening the hair, and/or reducing frizz of the hair&#x201d; includes methods of styling the hair or methods of straightening the hair or methods of reducing frizz of the hair, as well as methods of styling the hair and straightening the hair, methods of styling the hair and reducing frizz of the hair, methods of styling the hair and straightening the hair and reducing frizz of the hair, etc.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">As used herein, the phrases &#x201c;and mixtures thereof,&#x201d; &#x201c;and a mixture thereof,&#x201d; &#x201c;and combinations thereof,&#x201d; &#x201c;and a combination thereof,&#x201d; &#x201c;or mixtures thereof,&#x201d; &#x201c;or a mixture thereof,&#x201d; &#x201c;or combinations thereof,&#x201d; &#x201c;or a combination thereof,&#x201d; and variations thereof are used interchangeably to denote that the listing of components immediately preceding the phrase, such as &#x201c;A, B, C, D, or mixtures thereof&#x201d; signify that the component(s) may be chosen from A, from B, from C, from D, from A+B, from A+B+C, from A+D, from A+C+D, etc., without limitation on the variations thereof. Thus, the components may be used individually or in any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">For purposes of the present disclosure, it should be noted that to provide a more concise description, some of the quantitative expressions given herein are not qualified with the term &#x201c;about.&#x201d; It is understood that whether the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; is used explicitly or not, every quantity given herein is meant to refer to the actual given value, and it is also meant to refer to the approximation to such given value that would reasonably be inferred based on the ordinary skill in the art, including approximations due to the experimental and/or measurement conditions for such given value. All ranges and amounts given herein are intended to include sub-ranges and amounts using any disclosed point as an end point. Thus, a range of &#x201c;1% to 10%, such as 2% to 8%, such as 3% to 5%,&#x201d; is intended to encompass ranges of &#x201c;1% to 8%,&#x201d; &#x201c;1% to 5%,&#x201d; &#x201c;2% to 10%,&#x201d; and so on. All numbers, amounts, ranges, etc., are intended to be modified by the term &#x201c;about,&#x201d; whether or not so expressly stated. Similarly, a range given of &#x201c;about 1% to 10%&#x201d; is intended to have the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; modifying both the 1% and the 10% endpoints. The term &#x201c;about&#x201d; is used herein to indicate a difference of up to +/&#x2212;10% from the stated number, such as +/&#x2212;9%, +/&#x2212;8%, +/&#x2212;7%, +/&#x2212;6%, +/&#x2212;5%, +/&#x2212;4%, +/&#x2212;3%, +/&#x2212;2%, or +/&#x2212;1%. Likewise, all endpoints of ranges are understood to be individually disclosed, such that, for example, a range of 1:2 to 2:1 is understood to disclose a ratio of both 1:2 and 2:1.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Further, unless expressly stated otherwise or when the context of the disclosure clearly dictates otherwise, the language &#x201c;the at least one X may be present in an amount ranging from Y % to Z %&#x201d; is to be understood to mean that the total amount of X's present in the composition ranges from Y % to Z %, inclusive of the endpoints. For example, &#x201c;the at least one polyphenol may be present in an amount ranging from about 0.01% to about 10%&#x201d; means that the total amount of polyphenols present ranges from about 0.01% to about 10%, inclusive of both 0.01% and 10%.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">&#x201c;Active material&#x201d; as used herein with respect to the percent amount of an ingredient or raw material, refers to 100% activity of the ingredient or raw material.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">All amounts given herein are relative to the amount of active material, unless otherwise indicated.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Unless otherwise indicated, all percentages herein are by weight, relative to the total weight of the composition.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">All percentages, parts and ratios herein are based upon the total weight of the compositions of the present disclosure, unless otherwise indicated.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">As used herein, the term &#x201c;treat&#x201d; (and its grammatical variations, such as &#x201c;treating&#x201d;) refers to the application of the compositions of the present disclosure onto the surface of the hair on the head.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;applying a composition onto hair&#x201d; and variations thereof is intended to mean contacting the hair with at least one of the compositions of the disclosure, in any manner. It may also mean contacting the hair in an effective amount.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">As used herein, the term &#x201c;styling&#x201d; is intended to include &#x201c;shaping&#x201d; and &#x201c;straightening.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">As used herein, the term &#x201c;curly hair&#x201d; refers to any hair including a curl, and &#x201c;wavy hair&#x201d; refers to any hair including a wave. The curl and/or wave may be natural or unnatural, i.e., formed by chemical treatment or physical treatment of the hair. The degree of curliness and/or waviness of the hair may vary and is not limited.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">A &#x201c;leave-in&#x201d; composition or product refers to a hair-treatment composition that is not rinsed and/or washed away with water or acceptable solvent after the application of the composition onto the hair; instead, the composition is allowed to remain on the hair for a period of time as desired, such from 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, up to 8 hours, overnight, or as long as needed, until next time of washing or rinsing the hair.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">As used herein, the term &#x201c;polyol&#x201d; refers to an organic molecule comprising at least two free hydroxyl groups.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The terms &#x201c;substantially without&#x201d; or &#x201c;essentially without&#x201d; as used herein means the specific material may be used in a manufacturing process in small amounts that do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristics of the compositions according to the disclosure. The terms may also mean that the specific material is not used in a manufacturing process but may still be present in a raw material that is included in the composition.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">As used herein, unless expressly stated otherwise, the term &#x201c;substantially free&#x201d; or &#x201c;essentially free&#x201d; means the specific material may be present in small amounts that do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristics of the compositions according to the disclosure. For instance, there may be less than 2% by weight of a specific material added to a composition, based on the total weight of the compositions (provided that an amount of less than 2% by weight does not materially affect the basic and novel characteristics of the compositions according to the disclosure. Similarly, the compositions may include less than 2%, less than 1.5%, less than 1%, less than 0.5%, less than 0.1%, less than 0.05%, or less than 0.01%, or none of the specified material. Furthermore, all components that are positively set forth in the instant disclosure may be negatively excluded from the claims, e.g., a claimed composition may be &#x201c;free,&#x201d; &#x201c;essentially free&#x201d; (or &#x201c;substantially free&#x201d;) of one or more components that are positively set forth in the instant disclosure. The term &#x201c;substantially free&#x201d; or &#x201c;essentially free&#x201d; as used herein may also mean that the specific material is not added to the composition but may still be present in a raw material that is included in the composition.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">As used herein, the term &#x201c;salts&#x201d; refers to throughout the disclosure may include salts having a counter-ion, in either ionized or un-ionized form. It is to be understood that, with regard to salts of acids described herein, it is intended to encompass the use of a salt of the acid as an ingredient added to a composition according to the disclosure, or to the salt of the acid that forms when the acid is used as an ingredient in a composition according to the disclosure (in ionized or un-ionized form).</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">As used herein, the term &#x201c;synthetic&#x201d; means a material that is not of natural origin.

Composition C1 had a viscosity upon preparation that was very low (water thin), which did not change over time. Each of inventive compositions 1A-1C had an initial viscosity (day 0) that was suitable for application to the hair, and a change in viscosity over time that was acceptable to demonstrate that the compositions were stable, with composition 1C demonstrating the greatest stability.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0099">In addition, each of compositions 1A-1C and C1 was evaluated visually over a 10-day period. Comparative composition C1 showed that some solids precipitated out at day 5, which were visible at the bottom of the container, demonstrating that composition C1 has the least stability. Inventive compositions 1A and 1B had small amounts of solids suspended in the solutions at day 9, but no precipitate was noticeable on the bottom of the container. Inventive composition 1C was the most stable, with no solid precipitate visible either in the solution or at the bottom of the container still by day 10.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="1">Example 3&#x2014;Testing on Hair</heading><p id="p-0104" num="0100">Compositions 1B and C1 were tested on a mannequin head with curly hair. First, the hair was washed and conditioned with a standard shampoo and conditioner, and then excess water was removed with a towel. Next, either composition 1B or C1 was applied to one-half of the mannequin head in an amount of 7.5 grams per half-head, and distributed through the hair by hand, after which the swatches were dried with a rollerball dryer at a temperature of about 40-45&#xb0; C. for a period of about 60 minutes.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0101">Once the hair was dry, the hair was combed with the fingers to break the film that had formed on the hair after drying. The hair treated with both compositions 1B and C1 demonstrated effective straightening of the hair, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, TO shows the treated hair after the compositions have been applied, while still wet, T1 shows the treated hair after the compositions have dried on the hair, and T2 shows the treated hair after it is combed with the fingers to break the film formed upon drying.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0102">It was noted that the straightening effect of composition 1B, with a significantly lower concentration of tannic acid, was as effective as that of composition C1, which is believed to be due to the additional components in composition 1B. Further, the hair treated with composition 1B had improved sensorial properties compared to the hair treated with composition C1, such as slip and glide, as well as smoothness and frizz-control of the treated hair.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0103">The above Examples demonstrate that compositions according to the disclosure provide effective temporary straightening benefits to curly hair, while at the same time providing sensorial benefits such as smoothness and frizz-control to the hair. Further, compositions according to the disclosure have improved stability compared to compositions not according to the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0104">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the compositions and methods according to the disclosure without departing from the spirit or scope of the disclosure. Thus, it is intended that the disclosure cover such modifications and variations and their equivalents.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-01-27" num="01-27"><claim-text><b>1</b>-<b>27</b>.
