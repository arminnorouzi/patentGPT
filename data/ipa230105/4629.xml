id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to a method and an apparatus for authenticating a handwritten signature for user authentication using the input handwritten signature. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a method and an apparatus for authenticating a handwritten signature on the basis of multiple authentication algorithms, the method and the apparatus performing determination by combining results of analysis performed by the authentication algorithms of different types, thereby improving the accuracy of handwritten signature authentication.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A signature is someone's name, assumed name, a proof that someone has made a record on a document, or a mark for identity, and is handwritten by a person. The signature is used for user identification in payment for financial transactions with credit cards or transactions of movable/immovable property, sanctions for various documents processed in companies, and issuance of certificates at government offices.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the meantime, as the use of online services deepens due to the development and wide use of information and communication technologies, various user authentication technologies have been developed and used to prevent unauthorized access to various online services and personal information.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, user authentication technologies may be classified into knowledge-based, ownership-based, and individual characteristic-based authentication techniques.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The knowledge-based authentication technique is a technique for performing authentication based on information, such as a password or a personal identification number (PIN), which a user remembers.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The ownership-based authentication technique is a technique for authenticating a user by using various media that the user owns, for example, a smart card, a token, and a one-time password (OTP).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The individual characteristic-based authentication technique is a technique for authenticating a user on the basis of individual biometric characteristics, such as a fingerprint, an iris, a palm print, a voice print, and a face image.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Among these techniques, the knowledge-based authentication technique is easy to guess using personal information. In addition, it is easy to crack the technique with software such as a cracking tool, and when a randomly set password is used, it is difficult to remember the password. Regarding the ownership-based authentication technique, the security of the media needs to be secured and there is also the inconvenience of owning the media.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, the individual characteristic-based authentication technique uses a user's individual characteristics, so the user is provided with great convenience and illegal use is prevented. Recently, accuracy is improved with the development of technology, so there is a rapidly increasing interest in the technique.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As characteristic information of a user, the individual characteristic-based authentication technique uses biometric information, such as a fingerprint, an iris, a voice print, and a face image, and behavior information, such as a voice pattern, a gait, a speaking speed, and an input posture or speed.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Similarly, even for handwritten signatures that users write by their hands, personal characteristics of the users are included, so authentication based on individual characteristics is possible. An authentication technology using a handwritten signature may be applied in a face-to-face situation as well as a non-face-to-face situation, or may be applied to online and offline processing.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Examples of the handwritten signature authentication technique include the following methods: an image comparison method in which consistency in the shape in the handwritten signature image is checked, and a behavior characteristic comparison method in which when a signatory writes the handwritten signature, handwritten signature behavioral characteristic data of signatory's signature writing behavior features is compared.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In general, in a handwritten signature authentication system to which the image comparison method is applied, if even a third party imitates only the image shape of the handwritten signature, it may be determined that the handwritten signature is matched. Therefore, unfortunately, it is easy for a third party to use a signature by stealth. Because of this problem with image comparison, the behavior characteristic comparison method rather than the image comparison method is applied to the handwritten signature authentication system.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the handwritten signature authentication technology based on behavioral characteristics, authentication is performed by extracting behavioral characteristics that occur in a signatory's signature habits when a handwritten signature is written. Therefore, illegal use is more effectively prevented than in the image comparison method. However, there is a probability that authentication fails despite an authorized signature or that an imitated signature is recognized as an authorized signature of a user. Therefore, it is necessary to increase accuracy of authentication enough to accurately distinguish a handwritten signature imitated through forgery, theft, or copying from a user's authorized handwritten signature.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In particular, in the handwritten signature authentication technology, when a false rejection rate (FRR) that is a ratio of authentication failure despite of an authorized signature is reduced, a false acceptance rate (FAR) that is a ratio of authentication success of an imitated signature is increased. Conversely, when the false acceptance rate is reduced, the false rejection rate is increased. Therefore, it is difficult to satisfy both the false rejection rate and the false acceptance rate.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Accordingly, the present disclosure is directed to providing a method and an apparatus for authenticating a handwritten signature on the basis of multiple authentication algorithms, wherein with respect to the input handwritten signature, whether authentication of the handwritten signature succeeds is finally determined by combining results of analysis performed by the authentication algorithms of two different types, so that a false rejection rate and a false acceptance rate are simultaneously satisfied and the accuracy of a result of authentication is thus improved.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the present disclosure, there is provided a method for authenticating a handwritten signature on the basis of multiple authentication algorithms: receiving, at a characteristic extraction step, the handwritten signature to be authenticated, and extracting a plurality of pieces of signature behavioral characteristic information;
