The hydrogen storage vessel <b>62</b> is intended to provide an extended supply of hydrogen to the reactor <b>20</b> for continued operation without being limited to daylight hours during which water is predominantly released from the water capture generator <b>12</b>. That is, the hydrogen storage vessel <b>62</b> provides an effective buffer in storing hydrogen for supply to the reactor <b>20</b>. This hydrogen storage capability is consistent with operation of the electrolyser <b>16</b> during predominantly daylight hours when powered by the solar PV panels such as <b>28</b><i>a/b </i>and <b>30</b><i>a/b </i>and the associated inverter <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0050">In this configuration the renewable methanol production module <b>10</b> includes an equipment platform <b>70</b> at which the electrolyser <b>16</b>, the reactor <b>20</b>, the inverter <b>32</b>, the carbon dioxide extractor <b>50</b>, the heat exchanger <b>52</b>, the water storage vessel <b>58</b> and the hydrogen storage vessel <b>62</b> are located. The equipment platform <b>70</b> is in this embodiment located between the first and second solar framework structures <b>36</b> and <b>40</b>. The pair of water heater panels <b>26</b><i>a/b </i>are mounted to a water capture framework structure <b>72</b> located adjacent the equipment platform <b>70</b>. In this example the water capture framework structure <b>72</b> is of substantially the same configuration as and aligned with the second solar framework structure <b>40</b>. It will be understood that this configuration provides the pair of water capture modules <b>26</b><i>a/b </i>with increased solar exposure in a similar manner to the solar PV panels such as <b>28</b><i>a/b. </i></p><p id="p-0049" num="0051">The carbon dioxide extractor <b>50</b> of this embodiment may be operatively coupled to one or more batteries (not shown) for extended operation without being limited to sunlight hours. In this configuration the inverter <b>32</b> is arranged to provide electricity for charging of the batteries. The electricity produced from the batteries may be used predominantly outside daylight hours for not only heating the MOF or other adsorbent structure of the carbon dioxide extractor <b>50</b> for releasing carbon dioxide but also to power pumps and/or fans (not shown) associated with the carbon dioxide extractor <b>50</b>. The carbon dioxide extractor <b>50</b> is otherwise powered during daylight hours by the solar PV panels such as <b>28</b><i>a/b </i>and <b>30</b><i>a/b </i>via the associated inverter such as <b>32</b>. This means the carbon dioxide extractor can potentially operate 24/7 in producing carbon dioxide for supply to the reactor <b>20</b> which likewise can operate around the clock. Although not illustrated, the carbon dioxide extractor may be operatively coupled to a solar hot water heater for heating of the adsorbent structure to release the adsorbed carbon dioxide.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0052">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> there is according to another aspect of the invention a renewable methanol production system <b>100</b> generally comprising:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0053">1. a water capture module <b>120</b> for directly capturing water from air to provide water in a liquid form;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0054">2. an electrolysis module <b>140</b> for electrolysis of the liquid water to produce hydrogen;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0055">3. an exothermic reactor <b>160</b> for reacting the hydrogen from the electrolysis module <b>140</b> with carbon dioxide to produce renewable methanol.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0051" num="0056">In this embodiment the water capture module <b>120</b> is in the form of a direct air capture module including a metal-organic framework (MOF) or other adsorbent designed to capture or adsorb water from the air.

The direct capture of water and/or carbon dioxide from atmosphere may be different to the MOF or other technologies of the preferred embodiment. For example, the direct capture of water from air may be effected by refrigeration using a reverse cycle air-conditioning system which is effective in releasing water from air in a liquid form. In this variation, the waste heat from the exothermic reaction may be harnessed in refrigeration of the air to release the liquid water. In another example, evacuated tubes may be used as an alternative heat source for releasing carbon dioxide from the adsorbent material of the carbon dioxide extractor. In the context of the production of renewable methanol, the liquid water from the reactor need not be recirculated to the electrolysis module.
