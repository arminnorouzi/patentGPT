In particular, in operating a high-load and large-capacity machine, an application of the hydraulic system is essential, and a system error due to a failure of any one element may lead to large human and material losses.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In this regard, various types of hydraulic trip systems have been introduced, but in particular, a circuit for implementing a generally used 2 out of 2- or 2 out of 3- type trip system among the trip systems is complex, and in order to implement the circuit, multiple elements each performing different functions are required.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, the trip system should always maintain a controlled state and operate on a trip signal that occurs intermittently. However, in a long-term system maintenance state, when a valve malfunctions in a situation other than a normal trip signal due to a defect, which is caused by a solenoid failure or sticking thereof, unnecessary loss occurs.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, the present disclosure
