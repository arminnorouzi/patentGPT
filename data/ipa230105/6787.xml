Typical wireless communication systems may employ multiple-access technologies capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources (e.g., bandwidth, transmit power, and/or the like). Examples of such multiple-access technologies include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, single-carrier frequency-division multiple access (SC-FDMA) systems, time division synchronous code division multiple access (TD-SCDMA) systems, and Long Term Evolution (LTE). LTE/LTE-Advanced is a set of enhancements to the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) mobile standard promulgated by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A wireless communication network may include a number of base stations (BSs) that can support communication for a number of user equipment (UEs). A user equipment (UE) may communicate with a base station (BS) via the downlink and uplink. The downlink (or forward link) refers to the communication link from the BS to the UE, and the uplink (or reverse link) refers to the communication link from the UE to the BS. As will be described in more detail herein, a BS may be referred to as a Node B, a gNB, an access point (AP), a radio head, a transmit receive point (TRP), a new radio (NR) BS, a 5G Node B, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The above multiple access technologies have been adopted in various telecommunication standards to provide a common protocol that enables different user equipment to communicate on a municipal, national, regional, and even global level. New radio (NR), which may also be referred to as 5G, is a set of enhancements to the LTE mobile standard promulgated by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). NR is designed to better support mobile broadband Internet access by improving spectral efficiency, lowering costs, improving services, making use of new spectrum, and better integrating with other open standards using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with a cyclic prefix (CP) (CP-OFDM) on the downlink (DL), using CP-OFDM and/or SC-FDM (e.g., also known as discrete Fourier transform spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM)) on the uplink (UL), as well as supporting beamforming, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna technology, and carrier aggregation. However, as the demand for mobile broadband access continues to increase, there exists a need for further improvements in LTE and NR technologies. Preferably, these improvements should be applicable to other multiple access technologies and the telecommunication standards that employ these technologies.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some aspects, a method of wireless communication, performed by a first user equipment (UE), may include transmitting a first set of periodic signals associated with a first set of spatial relationships in a first set of periodic signal transmission occasions associated with a first periodicity; and transmitting one or more second sets of periodic signals with a second set of spatial relationships in one or more second sets of periodic signal transmission occasions associated with a second periodicity, wherein the one or more second sets of periodic signal transmission occasions occur before a next first set of the periodic signal transmission occasions.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some aspects, a first UE for wireless communication may include memory and one or more processors coupled to the memory.

For example, device-to-device communications, such as sidelink communications, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications, and/or the like, may enable relay UEs to provide extended coverage to remote UEs. This may enable power-savings by the remote UEs by reducing a transmit power to communicate with the BS, reducing a signaling that the remote UEs are to monitor, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A relay UE may transmit a periodic signal to the remote UE to maintain communication with the remote UE. For example, the relay UE may transmit a discovery signal to enable the remote UE to identify the relay UE for use in communicating with a BS or with the relay UE, itself. Additionally, or alternatively, the relay UE may transmit periodic signals for sidelink beam management, for providing synchronization information (e.g., a primary synchronization signal (PSS), a secondary synchronization signal (SSS), and/or the like), and/or the like. The relay UE may transmit the periodic signals in accordance with a duty cycle with a fixed periodicity. In each set of transmission occasions, the relay UE may transmit a set of periodic signals using a set of spatial relationships to enable one or more remote UEs to identify the relay UE. The spatial relationships may include, for example, a certain beam and/or a certain quasi co-location relationship (QCL) type D for a transmission, signal, and/or a channel.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">However, in some cases, the relay UE may be serving a relatively small quantity of remote UEs. For example, in a wearable device context, a smart phone-type of relay UE may service a single smart watch-type of remote UE. As a result, the relay UE may transmit some of the set of periodic signals with some of the set of spatial relationships or beams without a remote UE being available for reception.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Some aspects described herein enable dual-duty cycles for periodic signal transmission in device-to-device communications. For example, a relay UE may use a first duty cycle with a first periodicity for transmitting a first set of periodic signals (e.g., a full set of discovery signals) and may use a second duty cycle with a second periodicity for transmitting a second set of periodic signals (e.g., a subset of the full set of discovery signals). In this way, the relay UE enables a reduced utilization of network resources and a reduced transmitting energy by avoiding transmission of all configured periodic signals with all configured spatial relationships at each transmission opportunity. Moreover, the remote UE may reduce energy consumption by measuring and/or responding to fewer periodic signals.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Various aspects of the disclosure are described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings. This disclosure may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to any specific structure or function presented throughout this disclosure. Rather, these aspects are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the disclosure to those skilled in the art. Based at least in part on the teachings herein one skilled in the art should appreciate that the scope of the disclosure is intended to cover any aspect of the disclosure disclosed herein, whether implemented independently of or combined with any other aspect of the disclosure. For example, an apparatus may be implemented or a method may be practiced using any number of the aspects set forth herein.

These apparatuses and techniques will be described in the following detailed description and illustrated in the accompanying drawings by various blocks, modules, components, circuits, steps, processes, algorithms, and/or the like (collectively referred to as &#x201c;elements&#x201d;). These elements may be implemented using hardware, software, or combinations thereof. Whether such elements are implemented as hardware or software depends upon the particular application and design constraints imposed on the overall system.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">It should be noted that while aspects may be described herein using terminology commonly associated with 3G and/or 4G wireless technologies, aspects of the present disclosure can be applied in other generation-based communication systems, such as 5G and later, including NR technologies.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a wireless network <b>100</b> in which aspects of the present disclosure may be practiced. The wireless network <b>100</b> may be an LTE network, a 5G or NR network, and/or the like. The wireless network <b>100</b> may include a number of BSs <b>110</b> (shown as BS <b>110</b><i>a</i>, BS <b>110</b><i>b</i>, BS <b>110</b><i>c</i>, and BS <b>110</b><i>d</i>) and other network entities. A BS is an entity that communicates with user equipment (UEs) and may also be referred to as a base station, a NR BS, a Node B, a gNB, a 5G node B (NB), an access point, a transmit receive point (TRP), and/or the like. Each BS may provide communication coverage for a particular geographic area. In 3GPP, the term &#x201c;cell&#x201d; can refer to a coverage area of a BS and/or a BS subsystem serving this coverage area, depending on the context in which the term is used.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A BS may provide communication coverage for a macro cell, a pico cell, a femto cell, and/or another type of cell. A macro cell may cover a relatively large geographic area (e.g., several kilometers in radius) and may allow unrestricted access by UEs with service subscription. A pico cell may cover a relatively small geographic area and may allow unrestricted access by UEs with service subscription. A femto cell may cover a relatively small geographic area (e.g., a home) and may allow restricted access by UEs having association with the femto cell (e.g., UEs in a closed subscriber group (CSG)). A BS for a macro cell may be referred to as a macro BS. A BS for a pico cell may be referred to as a pico BS. A BS for a femto cell may be referred to as a femto BS or a home BS. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a BS <b>110</b><i>a </i>may be a macro BS for a macro cell <b>102</b><i>a</i>, a BS <b>110</b><i>b </i>may be a pico BS for a pico cell <b>102</b><i>b</i>, and a BS <b>110</b><i>c </i>may be a femto BS for a femto cell <b>102</b><i>c</i>. A BS may support one or multiple (e.g., three) cells. The terms &#x201c;eNB&#x201d;, &#x201c;base station&#x201d;, &#x201c;NR BS&#x201d;, &#x201c;gNB&#x201d;, &#x201c;TRP&#x201d;, &#x201c;AP&#x201d;, &#x201c;node B&#x201d;, &#x201c;5G NB&#x201d;, and &#x201c;cell&#x201d; may be used interchangeably herein.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some examples, a cell may not necessarily be stationary, and the geographic area of the cell may move according to the location of a mobile BS. In some examples, the BSs may be interconnected to one another and/or to one or more other BSs or network nodes (not shown) in the wireless network <b>100</b> through various types of backhaul interfaces such as a direct physical connection, a virtual network, and/or the like using any suitable transport network.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Wireless network <b>100</b> may also include relay stations. A relay station is an entity that can receive a transmission of data from an upstream station (e.g., a BS or a UE) and send a transmission of the data to a downstream station (e.g., a UE or a BS). A relay station may also be a UE that can relay transmissions for other UEs. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a relay station <b>110</b><i>d </i>may communicate with macro BS <b>110</b><i>a </i>and a UE <b>120</b><i>d </i>in order to facilitate communication between BS <b>110</b><i>a </i>and UE <b>120</b><i>d</i>. A relay station may also be referred to as a relay BS, a relay base station, a relay, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Wireless network <b>100</b> may be a heterogeneous network that includes BSs of different types, e.g., macro BSs, pico BSs, femto BSs, relay BSs, and/or the like. These different types of BSs may have different transmit power levels, different coverage areas, and different impacts on interference in wireless network <b>100</b>. For example, macro BSs may have a high transmit power level (e.g., 5 to 40 Watts) whereas pico BSs, femto BSs, and relay BSs may have lower transmit power levels (e.g., 0.1 to 2 Watts).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">UEs <b>120</b> (e.g., <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b</i>, <b>120</b><i>c</i>, <b>120</b><i>d</i>, <b>120</b><i>e</i>) may be dispersed throughout wireless network <b>100</b>, and each UE may be stationary or mobile. A UE may also be referred to as an access terminal, a terminal, a mobile station, a subscriber unit, a station, and/or the like. A UE may be a cellular phone (e.g., a smart phone), a personal digital assistant (PDA), a wireless modem, a wireless communication device, a handheld device, a laptop computer, a cordless phone, a wireless local loop (WLL) station, a tablet, a camera, a gaming device, a netbook, a smartbook, an ultrabook, a medical device or equipment, biometric sensors/devices, wearable devices (smart watches, smart clothing, smart glasses, smart wrist bands, smart jewelry (e.g., smart ring, smart bracelet)), an entertainment device (e.g., a music or video device, or a satellite radio), a vehicular component or sensor, smart meters/sensors, industrial manufacturing equipment, a global positioning system device, or any other suitable device that is configured to communicate via a wireless or wired medium.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Some UEs may be considered machine-type communication (MTC) or evolved or enhanced machine-type communication (eMTC) UEs. MTC and eMTC UEs include, for example, robots, drones, remote devices, sensors, meters, monitors, location tags, and/or the like, that may communicate with a base station, another device (e.g., remote device), or some other entity.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A relay UE, such as UE <b>120</b><i>a</i>, may relay communications between a BS (e.g., BS <b>110</b><i>a</i>) and a remote UE (e.g., remote UE <b>120</b><i>e</i>). In some aspects, the relay UE may relay all communications between the remote UE and the BS. In some aspects, the relay UE may relay a portion of communications, such that the remote UE is in direct communication with the BS for another portion of communications, as shown.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">A wireless node may provide, for example, connectivity for or to a network (e.g., a wide area network such as Internet or a cellular network) via a wired or wireless communication link. Some UEs may be considered Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, and/or may be implemented as may be implemented as NB-IoT (narrowband internet of things) devices. Some UEs may be considered a Customer Premises Equipment (CPE). UE <b>120</b> may be included inside a housing that houses components of UE <b>120</b>, such as processor components, memory components, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In general, any number of wireless networks may be deployed in a given geographic area. Each wireless network may support a particular RAT and may operate on one or more frequencies. A RAT may also be referred to as a radio technology, an air interface, and/or the like. A frequency may also be referred to as a carrier, a frequency channel, and/or the like.
