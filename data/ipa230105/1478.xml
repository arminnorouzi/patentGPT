In particular, tool inserts in the form of cutting elements comprising PCD material are widely used in drill bits for boring into the earth to extract oil or gas. The working life of superhard tool inserts may be limited by fracture of the superhard material, including by spalling and chipping, or by wear of the tool insert.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Cutting elements such as those for use in rock drill bits or other cutting tools typically have a body in the form of a substrate which has an interface end/surface and a superhard material which forms a cutting layer bonded to the interface surface of the substrate by, for example, a sintering process. The substrate is generally formed of a tungsten carbide-cobalt alloy, sometimes referred to as cemented tungsten carbide and the superhard material layer is typically polycrystalline diamond (PCD), polycrystalline cubic boron nitride (PCBN) or a thermally stable product TSP material such as thermally stable polycrystalline diamond.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Polycrystalline diamond (PCD) is an example of a superhard material (also called a superabrasive or ultra hard material) comprising a mass of substantially inter-grown diamond grains, forming a skeletal mass defining interstices between the diamond grains. PCD material typically comprises at least about 80 volume % of diamond and is conventionally made by subjecting an aggregated mass of diamond grains to an ultra-high pressure of greater than about 5 GPa, and temperature of at least about 1,200&#xb0; C., for example. A material wholly or partly filling the interstices may be referred to as filler or binder material.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">PCD is typically formed in the presence of a sintering aid such as cobalt, which promotes the inter-growth of diamond grains. Suitable sintering aids for PCD are also commonly referred to as a solvent-catalyst material for diamond, owing to their function of dissolving, to some extent, the diamond and catalysing its re-precipitation. A solvent-catalyst for diamond is understood be a material that is capable of promoting the growth of diamond or the direct diamond-to-diamond inter-growth between diamond grains at a pressure and temperature condition at which diamond is thermodynamically stable. Consequently the interstices within the sintered PCD product may be wholly or partially filled with residual solvent-catalyst material. Most typically, PCD is often formed on a cobalt-cemented tungsten carbide substrate, which provides a source of cobalt solvent-catalyst for the PCD. Materials that do not promote substantial coherent intergrowth between the diamond grains may themselves form strong bonds with diamond grains, but are not suitable solvent-catalysts for PCD sintering.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Cemented tungsten carbide which may be used to form a suitable substrate is formed from carbide particles being dispersed in a cobalt matrix by mixing tungsten carbide particles/grains and cobalt together then heating to solidify. To form the cutting element with a superhard material layer such as PCD or PCBN, diamond particles or grains or CBN grains are placed adjacent the cemented tungsten carbide body in a refractory metal enclosure such as a niobium enclosure and are subjected to high pressure and high temperature so that inter-grain bonding between the diamond grains or CBN grains occurs, forming a polycrystalline superhard diamond or polycrystalline CBN layer.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some instances, the substrate may be fully cured prior to attachment to the superhard material layer whereas in other cases, the substrate may be green, that is, not fully cured. In the latter case, the substrate may fully cure during the HTHP sintering process. The substrate may be in powder form and may solidify during the sintering process used to sinter the superhard material layer.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Ever increasing drives for improved productivity in the earth boring field place ever increasing demands on the materials used for cutting rock. Specifically, cutting tools with improved resistance to various failure mechanisms such are required to achieve faster cut rates and longer tool life.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Cutting elements or tool inserts comprising PCD material are widely used in drill bits for boring into the earth in the oil and gas drilling industry. Rock drilling and other operations require certain mechanical properties such as high abrasion resistance, impact resistance, erosion and corrosion resistance and high fracture toughness.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Cutters formed of the most wear resistant grades of PCD material bonded to cemented carbide substrates usually suffer from a catastrophic fracture before the cutter has worn out as, during the use of these cutters, cracks grow until they reach a critical length at which catastrophic failure can occur, namely when a large portion of the PCD and/or cemented carbide substrate breaks away. These long, fast growing cracks encountered during use of conventionally sintered PCD cutters may result in short tool life.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Furthermore, despite their high strength, polycrystalline diamond (PCD) materials are usually susceptible to impact fracture due to their low fracture toughness. Improving fracture toughness without adversely affecting the material's high strength and abrasion resistance which are critical for the material's ability to cut through rock, for example, is a challenging task.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Polycrystalline diamond (PCD) is a super-hard, also known as superabrasive, material comprising a mass of inter-grown diamond grains and interstices between the diamond grains. PCD may be made by subjecting an aggregated mass of diamond grains to an ultra-high pressure and temperature. A material wholly or partly filling the interstices may be referred to as filler material. PCD may be formed in the presence of a sintering aid such as cobalt, which is capable of promoting the inter-growth of diamond grains and can also act as a tough, ductile and impact-resistance binder ensuring a certain level of PCD fracture toughness. The sintering aid may be referred to as a catalyst/binder material for diamond, owing to its function of dissolving diamond to some extent and catalysing its re-precipitation. A catalyst/binder for diamond is understood to be a material that is capable of promoting the growth of diamond or the direct diamond-to-diamond inter-growth between diamond grains at a pressure and temperature condition at which diamond is thermodynamically stable as well as to bound diamond grains together forming a superhard and tough material. Consequently, the interstices within the sintered PCD product may be wholly or partially filled with residual catalyst/binder material. PCD may be formed on a WC&#x2014;Co cemented carbide substrate, which may provide a source of cobalt catalyst/binder for the PCD.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">PCD may be used in a wide variety of tools for cutting, machining, drilling or degrading hard or abrasive materials such as rock, metal, ceramics, composites and wood-containing materials. For example, PCD elements may be used as cutting elements on drill bits used for boring into the earth in the oil and gas drilling industry. Such cutting elements for use in oil and gas drilling applications are typically formed of a layer of PCD bonded to a cemented carbide substrate.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A known problem with respect to the fabrication of conventional PCD cutting elements is related to the formation of numerous precipitates of WC, in the form of platelets, at the interface of the body of PCD material with the cemented carbide substrate, which are typically referred to in literature as &#x201c;WC plumes&#x201d;. The presence of such plumes at the interface leads to reduced performance of the PCD cutting elements in different applications. A common viewpoint on a reason for the formation of WC plumes is the presence of high amounts of tungsten dissolved in the binder of conventional cemented carbide substrates. It is well known that the solubility of tungsten in the liquid Co-based binder of cemented carbides is indirectly proportional to the total carbon content (I. Konyashin. Cemented Carbides for Mining, Construction and Wear Parts, Comprehensive Hard Materials, Elsevier Science and Technology, Editor-in-Chief V. Sarin, 2014, 425-251), so that a lower carbon content in cemented carbides corresponds to a higher amount of tungsten dissolved in the carbide binder. When liquid Co-based binders start infiltrating the PCD layer during sintering they become saturated with carbon, due to its diffusion from the PCD layer, and an excessive amount of tungsten dissolved in the binder precipitates as platelet-like WC plumes at the PCD/carbide interface.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another major problem experienced with conventional PCD cutters is the relatively low erosion/corrosion resistance of the carbide substrate of the cutter to which the PCD layer is attached. This may result in the carbide substrate being eroded and/or dissolved very quickly during the drilling process due to the impact of mud forming on the carbide substrate from the coolants used in the drilling process and containing abrasive particles. A worn and eroded carbide substrate cannot support the PCD layer attached thereto, with the result that the whole cutter may fail.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">There is therefore a need for a PCD composite construction comprising a body of PCD material bonded to a substrate that has good or improved mechanical properties such as fracture toughness and impact resistance, and good or improved erosion and/or corrosion resistance, as well as a method of forming such composites.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Viewed from a first aspect there is provided a polycrystalline diamond construction comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0018">a body of polycrystalline diamond (PCD) material;

Whilst not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, a possible explanation may be that the applicants have found that carbon solubility in the liquid binders at ultra-high pressures significantly increases and when a large amount of free carbon/SP<sup>2</sup>-hybridised carbon/SP<sup>3</sup>-hybridised carbon is present in the microstructure in form of large graphite inclusions as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>a </i></figref>before the second sintering stage, these may be dissolved in the liquid binder during the second sintering stage, that is during the PCD sintering stage. As a result of solidification after the PCD sintering stage, the excess of carbon precipitates in the substrate in the form of extremely fine and uniformly distributed particles, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>b </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i></figref>, which very surprisingly do not appear to adversely impact the mechanical properties of the PCD construction.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0100">Additionally, it was found that the formation of the WC plumes may be suppressed by in and by the example methods of forming example PCD constructions.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0101">Also, it is believed that the example methods and in particular addition of the mass of carbon prior to sintering may have desirable sintering aid properties. Whilst not wishing to be bound by theory, a possible explanation may be that, the if the liquid binder is saturated or oversaturated with carbon during PCD press sintering, its melting point is reduced according to the W&#x2014;Co&#x2014;C and W&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;C phase diagrams as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b></figref> and <b>6</b> (see B.

As a result, a rate of the solid-state densification of diamond grits obtained before binder melting when increasing the temperature of PCD press sintering is reduced compared to conventional sintering techniques of conventional PCD constructions and infiltration of the PCD table by the liquid binder may occur earlier in the sintering cycle than in conventional sintering techniques leading to improved sintering.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0102">While various examples have been described with reference to a number of examples, those skilled in the art will understand that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof and that these examples are not intended to limit the particular examples disclosed.
