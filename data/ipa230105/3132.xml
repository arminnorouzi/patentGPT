to the general field of the manufacture of blades in composite material comprising a metal leading edge, for gas turbine aeroengine.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">PRIOR ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The presence of a metal leading edge on a blade in composite material of a gas turbine aeroengine provides protection for the composite blade assembly against foreign object impacts such as bird strikes. This is particularly the case for the mobile fan blades of a gas turbine aeroengine which are exposed to ingestion of birds, hail, ice etc.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The manufacture of said blade first comprises the production of a &#x201c;blade body&#x201d; in composite material comprising a fibrous reinforcement densified with a matrix generally obtained from a thermosetting (TS) or thermoplastic (TP) resin.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Once the blade body in composite material is obtained, a protective metal leading edge must be assembled onto the foremost edge thereof. For this purpose, the metal strip produced by mechanical methods such as stamping, forming or electro-forming for example, is bonded onto the foremost edge of the blade in composite material. This operation can be performed in a mould to ensure bonding of the metal strip. Examples of blades in composite material provided with a metal leading edge are described in particular in documents US 2007/092379 and US 2016/0167269.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Added leading edges are generally fabricated in titanium for reasons of weight savings. While titanium has good mechanical strength, the high-speed impact of a foreign object, in particular a bird, on a leading edge in titanium nevertheless causes deformation (bending) thereof. One solution can be to increase the stiffness of the leading edge by increasing the thickness thereof, or to use a denser material. However, in this case, the overall weight of the leading edge is significantly increased and hence also the centrifugal force to which the composite material of the blade is subjected, in particular at the root shank thereof which is a critical area of the blade for static stresses.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Description of the invention</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore the main object of the present invention to propose a method for manufacturing a blade in composite material provided with a metal leading edge which does not have the aforementioned disadvantages.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the invention, this object is reached by means of a method for manufacturing a blade in composite material having an added metal leading edge, for gas turbine aeroengine, the method comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0008">producing a blade body in composite material comprising, in longitudinal direction a blade root part, a shank part and an airfoil body part, the airfoil body part extending in longitudinal direction between the shank part and an airfoil body tip, and in transverse direction between a foremost edge portion and rear edge portion;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0009">manufacturing, via additive manufacturing, a leading edge extending in longitudinal direction between a lower end, intended to be present at the shank part of the blade body in composite material, and an upper end intended to be present at the tip of the airfoil body part;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0010">bonding the manufactured leading edge onto the foremost edge portion of the airfoil body of the blade body in composite material,</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0009" num="0011">characterized in that the leading edge comprises a first portion in a first metal material and extending from the lower end of the leading edge as far as an intermediate position located between the lower end and upper end of the leading edge, and a second portion in a second metal material extending from the intermediate position as far as the upper end of said leading edge, the second metal material having greater density than the density of the first metal material.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0012">In this manner, a blade in composite material is obtained provided with a leading edge having variable density, the leading edge having the greatest density and hence the greatest stiffness in the upper part of the blade corresponding to that part of the blade that is most sensitive to foreign object impacts.

The airfoil body <b>130</b> also comprises a lower surface <b>133</b> and upper surface <b>134</b> and a tip <b>135</b>. The leading edge <b>200</b> is composed of a strip in metal material bonded onto a foremost edge portion <b>136</b> of the airfoil body <b>130</b>. With the exception of the leading edge <b>200</b>, the blade <b>30</b> is in composite material.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0035">The method for manufacturing the blade starts by producing a blade body in composite material obtained from a fibrous reinforcement densified with a matrix. By &#x201c;blade body&#x201d;, it is meant herein a blade body entirely in composite material comprising most of the constituent parts of the final blade namely the blade root, shank and airfoil body such as described in the foregoing, with the exception of the leading edge which is composed of a metal strip added onto the blade body as described in detail below.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0036">The blade body is produced from a fibrous preform able to be obtained in different manners known to persons skilled in the art. Typically, the preform can be obtained directly by three-dimensional (3D) weaving of yarns (formed of carbon fibres for example) or by lay-up of two-dimensional fibrous fabrics. The manufacture of a fan blade in composite material obtained from a fibrous reinforcement formed by three-dimensional weaving and densified with a matrix is particularly described in document US 2005/084377. In the example described herein, the fan blade preform is obtained by 3D weaving of carbon fibre yarns.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0037">In known manner, the blade preform is impregnated with a liquid composition containing a precursor of the matrix material. The precursor is usually in the form of a polymer such as a resin optionally diluted in a solvent. The preform is placed in a mould which can be hermetically sealed with a housing having the shape of the moulded blade body and able to be of twisted shape in particular corresponding to the final shape of the airfoil body with aerodynamic profile. The mould is closed and the liquid matrix precursor is injected e.g. an epoxy resin into the entire housing to impregnate all the fibrous part of the preform. Impregnation of the blade fibrous preform can particularly be obtained with the well-known method of Resin Transfer Moulding&#x2014;RTM.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0038">Conversion of the precursor to a matrix e.g. by curing is performed by heat treatment generally by heating the mould, after removing any solvent, and crosslinking of the polymer, the preform remaining in the mould having a shape matching that of the structure with aerodynamic profile. The matrix can particularly be obtained from epoxy resins such as the high&#x2014;performance epoxy resin sold under the reference PR 520 by CYTEC, or from liquid precursors of carbon or ceramic matrixes.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0039">For the forming of a carbon or ceramic matrix, heat treatment entails pyrolyzing the organic precursor to convert the organic matrix to a carbon or ceramic matrix depending on the precursor used and conditions of pyrolysis. For example, liquid carbon precursors can be resins with relatively high coke content such as phenolic resins, while liquid ceramic precursors of SiC in particular can be resins of polycarbosilane (PCS), or polytitanocarbosilane (PTCS) or polysilazane (PSZ) type. Several consecutive cycles, starting from impregnation up until heat treatment, can be carried out to reach the desired degree of densification.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0040">After formation of the matrix, the part is released from the mould. It is finally trimmed to remove excess resin and the chamfers are machined. No other machining is necessary since, being moulded, the part meets required dimensions. A blade body <b>10</b> is obtained which, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, comprises a blade root part <b>11</b> corresponding to the blade root <b>110</b> of the blade structure <b>100</b> of the blade <b>30</b> described in the foregoing, a shank part <b>12</b> corresponding to the shank <b>120</b> of the blade structure <b>100</b> of the blade <b>30</b> and an airfoil body part <b>13</b> corresponding to the airfoil body <b>130</b> of the blade structure <b>100</b> of the blade <b>30</b>, the airfoil body part extending between the shank part <b>12</b> and an airfoil body tip <b>15</b> (corresponding to the tip <b>135</b> of the airfoil body <b>130</b> of the blade structure <b>100</b> of the blade <b>30</b>). The airfoil body part <b>13</b> comprises a foremost edge portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>corresponding to the foremost edge portion <b>136</b> of the airfoil body <b>130</b> of the blade structure <b>100</b> of the blade <b>30</b>. The foremost edge portion<b>13</b><i>a </i>is intended to receive a metal strip to form the leading edge of the final blade.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0041">After, or parallel with, production of the blade body, a near-finished leading edge (metal strip) having the shape and dimensions defined in a theoretical digital model of the leading edge is manufactured by additive manufacturing. Among the known methods for additive manufacturing, the following methods can particularly be used to obtain the leading edge:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0042">metal additive manufacturing process in layers whereby particles are bonded via fusion using a laser source, also known as powder bed additive manufacturing or SLM (Selective Laser Melting) or LBM (Laser Beam Melting),</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0043">Laser Metal Deposition (LMD),</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0044">metal additive manufacturing in layers whereby particles are bonded via fusion using an electron beam&#x2014;&#x201c;Electron Beam Melting&#x201d;.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0037" num="0045">After additive manufacturing, a leading edge is obtained which already has the shape (external geometry) and desired final dimensions (&#x201c;net-shape&#x201d; part). This obviates the need for machining and adapted mechanical polishing operation of the outer wall of the leading edge, these usually being carried out when leading edges are obtained by casting for example and are complex to perform on account of the flexibility of the part. These finishing operations can be replaced here by a surface treatment operation, for example an electrochemical polishing sequence which does not impact the dimensions of the leading edge.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0046">This gives a finished leading edge or metal strip <b>200</b> ready to be assembled onto the blade body <b>10</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The leading edge <b>200</b> comprises an inner wall <b>201</b> intended to be bonded on the foremost edge portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the blade body <b>10</b> and an outer wall <b>202</b> defining the profile of the leading edge of the final blade. The leading edge <b>200</b> also comprises a nose portion <b>203</b> from which there extend two wings <b>204</b> and <b>205</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0047">In the invention, the leading edge <b>200</b> comprises a first portion <b>210</b> in a first metal material. The first portion <b>210</b> extends from the lower end <b>206</b> of the leading edge as far as an intermediate position <b>207</b> located between a lower end <b>206</b> and an upper end <b>208</b> of the leading edge. The leading edge <b>200</b> also comprises a second portion <b>220</b> in a second metal material. The second portion <b>220</b> extends from the intermediate position <b>207</b> as far as the upper end <b>208</b> of the leading edge. By means of additive manufacturing, it is possible to manufacture a leading edge with several different metal materials.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0048">The first portion <b>210</b> extends in longitudinal direction DL over a height H<sub>210 </sub>corresponding to about 30% of total airflow height H<sub>TOT200 </sub>starting from the lower end <b>206</b> of the leading edge. By definition, the minimum radial height of 0% of the leading edge corresponds to the point of intersection between the leading edge of the blade with a disc on which it is intended to be mounted, this point of intersection innerly delimiting the airflow path passing through the fan. Similarly, the maximum radial height of 100% corresponds to that point of the line of the leading edge that is radially the highest.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0049">The first portion <b>210</b> is intended to extend into an area or airflow height (or leading edge height) of the blade where foreign object impact, in particular a bird strike, is not critical since it only causes slight deformation of the leading edge. The first portion <b>210</b> can therefore be composed of a first metal material of average density.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0050">The second portion <b>220</b> extends in longitudinal direction D<sub>L </sub>over a height H<sub>220 </sub>corresponding to 70% of total airflow height H<sub>TOT200 </sub>starting from the intermediate position <b>207</b>. Unlike the first portion <b>210</b>, the second portion <b>220</b> is intended to extend into an area or airflow height of the blade where foreign object impact such as a bird strike is critical. For example, for a fan blade, ingestion of a large-size bird is critical at about 50% of total airflow height while ingestion of an average-sized bird is critical at about 85% of total airflow height. The second portion <b>220</b> is therefore in a second metal material having greater density than the density of the first metal material.

More specifically, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the leading edge <b>200</b> is docked onto the foremost edge portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>present on the airfoil body part <b>13</b> of the blade body <b>10</b> interposing a layer of adhesive or adhesive material <b>40</b> between the inner wall <b>201</b> of the leading edge and the foremost edge portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the blade body <b>10</b>. The layer of adhesive between the leading edge and the foremost edge portion of the blade body can be applied in different manners. In particular it may correspond to an adhesive material sandwiched between the inner wall of the leading edge and the foremost edge portion of the blade body; the whole, once assembled, being placed in a bonding mould which is heated to activate (cure) the adhesive property of the material. A layer of adhesive can also be directly deposited on the inner wall <b>201</b> of the leading edge <b>200</b> and/or on the foremost edge portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the blade body, assembling being performed in a bonding mould able to apply pressure on the elements to be assembled and optionally to carry out bonding heat treatment. A method for bonding a leading edge onto a blade body in composite material is described in particular in document US 2015/151485.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0054">The blade <b>30</b> thus obtained has very good resistance against impacts in the area to be reinforced against ingestion of foreign objects, without significantly penalising the overall weight of the blade having regard to the presence of a portion of lesser density. This also avoids increasing the static stresses generated by centrifugal force at the shank part which is an area of concentration of forces in the composite material blade structure.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a blade <b>50</b> differing from blade <b>30</b> already described, in that the area over which there extends the portion of dense material on the leading edge is reduced at the upper end of the leading edge. More specifically, the blade <b>50</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> comprises a blade structure in composite material <b>300</b> comprising in longitudinal direction D<sub>L </sub>a blade root <b>310</b>, a shank <b>320</b> and an airfoil body <b>330</b> extending in transverse direction D<sub>T </sub>between a leading edge <b>400</b> and a trailing edge <b>332</b>. The airfoil body <b>330</b> also comprises a lower surface <b>333</b>, an upper surface <b>334</b> and a tip <b>335</b>. The leading edge <b>400</b> is composed of a metal strip bonded onto a foremost edge portion <b>336</b> of the airfoil body <b>330</b>. With the exception of the leading edge <b>400</b>, the blade <b>50</b> is in composite material.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0056">The manufacture of the blade body and of the metal strip added onto the blade body to form the trailing edge of the final blade is the same as described previously for blade <b>30</b> and is not further described for reasons of simplification. It is simply noted that the leading edge comprises three portions of different densities.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0057">Conforming to the invention, the leading edge <b>400</b> comprises a first portion <b>410</b> in a first metal material. The first portion <b>410</b> extends from the lower end <b>406</b> of the leading edge as far as a first intermediate position <b>407</b> located between the lower end <b>406</b> and upper end <b>409</b> of the leading edge. The leading edge <b>400</b> comprises a second portion <b>420</b> in a second metal material. The second portion <b>420</b> extends from the first intermediate position <b>407</b> as far as a second intermediate position <b>408</b> located between the lower end <b>406</b> and upper end <b>409</b> of the leading edge above the first intermediate position in longitudinal direction D<sub>L</sub>. The leading edge <b>400</b> also comprises a third portion <b>430</b> in a third metal material. The third portion <b>430</b> extends from the second intermediate position <b>408</b> as far as the upper end <b>409</b> of the leading edge <b>400</b>. By means of additive manufacturing, it is possible to manufacture a leading edge with several different metal materials.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0058">The first portion <b>410</b> extends in longitudinal direction D<sub>L </sub>over a height H<sub>410 </sub>corresponding to about 30% of total airflow height H<sub>TOT400 </sub>starting from the lower end <b>406</b> of the leading edge. The third portion <b>430</b> extends over a height H<sub>430 </sub>corresponding to about 10% of total airflow height H<sub>TOT400 </sub>starting from the second intermediate position <b>408</b>. The first and second portions are intended to extend into an area or airflow height of the blade where foreign object impact, in particular a bird strike, is not critical. The first and third portions <b>410</b> and <b>430</b> can therefore respectively be composed of the first and third materials of average density. The first and third metal materials can be the same or different.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0059">The second portion <b>420</b> extends in longitudinal direction D<sub>L </sub>over a height H<sub>420 </sub>corresponding to 60% of total airflow height H<sub>TOT400 </sub>starting from the first intermediate position <b>407</b>.
