When such surface features <b>414</b> are included on the lower surface of the agitator magnet holder <b>408</b><i>a</i>, the agitator magnet holder <b>408</b><i>a </i>and agitator <b>409</b> are able to accelerate quicker, and ultimately reach higher rotational speeds, without excessive turbulence, and/or rotation of the base magnet holder <b>407</b><i>a </i>relative to the agitator magnet holder <b>407</b><i>a</i>. Such surface features <b>414</b> are believed to help break up surface tension of the puck of liquid or slurry that forms between the agitator magnet holder <b>408</b><i>a </i>and the lower cap mounted on the brew basket. These features are also believed to create turbulence in the liquid under the agitator magnet holder <b>408</b><i>a</i>, thereby leading to less drag.

More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref> illustrates an embodiment where each of the base magnets positioned in the base magnet holder <b>407</b><i>a </i>is oriented with a first polarity opposite a second polarity of the agitator magnets positioned in the agitator magnet holder <b>408</b><i>a</i>. In this regard, each base magnet is magnetically attracted to a corresponding agitator magnet, such that rotation of the base magnet holder <b>407</b><i>a </i>by a motor results in corresponding rotation of the agitator magnet holder <b>408</b><i>a</i>, and thus, the agitator <b>409</b>. In other words, the agitator magnet holder <b>408</b><i>a </i>and agitator <b>409</b> are &#x201c;magnetically connected&#x201d; or &#x201c;magnetically coupled&#x201d; to the base magnet holder <b>407</b><i>b</i>, even if separated by a small distance. As shown, negative polarity oriented base magnets are positioned in the base magnet holder <b>407</b><i>a</i>, while positive polarity oriented agitator magnets are positioned in the agitator magnet holder <b>408</b><i>a</i>. In other embodiments, positive polarity oriented base magnets may be positioned in the base magnet holder <b>407</b><i>a</i>, while negative polarity oriented agitator magnets may be positioned in the agitator magnet holder <b>408</b><i>a</i>. In these embodiments, the number negative polarity oriented base magnets in the base magnet holder <b>407</b><i>a </i>equals the number of positive polarity oriented agitator magnets in the agitator magnet holder <b>408</b><i>a</i>. Alternatively, the number of positive polarity oriented base magnets in the base magnet holder <b>407</b><i>a </i>equals the number of negative polarity oriented agitator magnets in the agitator magnet holder <b>408</b><i>a</i>. In these embodiments, the agitator magnet holder <b>408</b> and the base magnet holder <b>407</b><i>a </i>may rotate relative to one another, while maintaining magnetic attractions between respective agitator magnets and base magnets. As will be appreciated, the number of base magnets and the number of agitator magnets may be less than or greater than the number illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref> illustrates another embodiment where each base magnet is magnetically attracted to a corresponding agitator magnet, but where the polarity orientations of the magnets positioned in the base magnet holder and in the agitator magnet holder alternate. That is, positive polarity oriented magnets are positioned adjacent to two negative polarity oriented magnets, and negative polarity oriented magnets are positioned adjacent to two positive polarity oriented magnets. In this embodiment, the number of negative polarity oriented base magnets in the base magnet holder <b>407</b><i>a </i>equals the number of positive polarity oriented agitator magnets in the agitator magnet holder <b>408</b><i>a</i>, while the number of positive polarity oriented base magnets in the base magnet holder <b>407</b><i>a </i>equals the number of negative polarity oriented agitator magnets in the agitator magnet holder <b>408</b><i>a</i>. In these embodiments, rotation of the agitator magnet holder <b>408</b><i>a </i>relative to the base magnet holder <b>407</b><i>a</i>, and visa versa, results in misaligned magnetic polarities, such that the base magnets in the base magnet holder <b>407</b><i>a </i>repel the agitator magnets in the agitator magnet holder <b>408</b><i>a</i>, thereby tending to limit or prevent rotation of the agitator magnet holder <b>408</b><i>a </i>and the base magnet holder <b>407</b><i>a </i>relative to one another. This configuration leads to a stronger &#x201c;magnetic connection&#x201d; between the agitator magnet holder <b>408</b><i>a </i>and the base magnet holder <b>407</b><i>a</i>, and thus, smoother rotation of the agitator magnet holder <b>408</b><i>a </i>and agitator <b>409</b> mounted thereon. More specifically, the magnet polarity orientations shown and described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref> are more tolerant of any misalignment between the axis of rotation of the base magnet holder <b>407</b><i>a </i>and the agitator magnet holder <b>408</b><i>a</i>, such that less noise (i.e, from vibrations, motor noise, frictional contact, etc.) is generated with this configuration, for example, as opposed to the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>. Additionally, as compared to other configurations, in this configuration, any misalignment of the axis of rotation of the base magnet holder <b>407</b><i>a </i>and the agitator magnet holder <b>408</b><i>a </i>is less likely to lead to &#x201c;magnetic disconnection&#x201d; between the base magnet holder <b>407</b><i>a </i>and the agitator magnet holder <b>408</b><i>a </i>when based magnet holder <b>407</b><i>a </i>is rotated, especially at higher speeds, or when the brew basket <b>202</b> is heavily loaded with brewing ingredients. As will be appreciated, the number of base magnets and the number of agitator magnets may be less than or greater than the number illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>. However, the total number of base magnets and the total number of agitator magnets is preferably an even number.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref>, on the other hand, illustrates an embodiment where the polarity orientations of the base magnets positioned in the base magnet holder <b>407</b><i>a </i>have the same polarity orientations as the agitator magnets positioned in the agitator magnet holder <b>408</b><i>a</i>. As shown, the base magnets positioned in the base magnet holder <b>407</b><i>a </i>and the agitator magnets positioned in the agitator magnet holder <b>408</b><i>a </i>may be oriented relative to one another with positive polarities. In other embodiments, the matching polarities may be negative. In embodiments where the polarity orientations of the base magnets match the polarity orientations of the agitator magnets, like that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref>, the orientation of the base magnet holder <b>407</b><i>a </i>relative to the agitator magnet holder <b>408</b><i>a </i>tends to be &#x201c;offset,&#x201d; such that the base magnets are not aligned with the agitator magnets, like those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-B</figref>. Due to the repulsion between the base magnets and the agitator magnets in these embodiments, the relative position of the base magnet holder <b>407</b><i>a </i>and the agitator magnet holder <b>408</b><i>a </i>tends to maintain the orientation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref> when the base magnet holder <b>407</b><i>a </i>is rotated by a motor.

More specifically, an objective of the present disclosure is to provide a liquid brewing device with an agitator that, when rotated, interfaces with liquid to generate a strong stirring or mixing action, while not requiring transmission of too much torque from the motor and base magnet holder <b>407</b><i>a</i>, such that the agitator magnet holder <b>408</b><i>a </i>loses &#x201c;magnetic connection&#x201d; with the base magnet holder <b>407</b><i>a</i>. This objective is achieved at least partially through provision of: 1) the agitator <b>409</b>, having three vanes or blades extending in a direction radially outward from a central axis of the agitator <b>409</b>, where the vanes extend from an inner radius, spaced from the central axis, to an outer radius, at the outer edge of the agitator <b>409</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-B</figref>); 2) the surface features <b>414</b> formed on the lower surface of the agitator magnet holder <b>408</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref>); and, 3) the magnet polarity orientations shown and described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In a preferred embodiment, the agitator magnet holder and agitator are constructed of a lightweight (preferably lubricous) plastic, while the lower cap is constructed of a thin metal, like stainless steel. In this regard, any contact between the agitator magnet holder and the lower cap will result in minimal friction. Additionally, the lower cap does not generate buoyancy (as compared to a plastic), that would result in an upward force on the brew basket. Moreover, the thin cap permits the agitator magnets positioned in the agitator magnet holder to be positioned closer to the base magnets, as compared to a thicker cap.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">One beneficial use of the brewing devices <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> described herein involves the ability for the user to calibrate the extraction level of the liquid brew during use. Following an initial brewing period, the user is able to remove the pitcher <b>202</b>, <b>303</b> from the base <b>201</b>, <b>301</b> while the brew basket <b>203</b>, <b>303</b> and agitator <b>209</b>, <b>309</b>, <b>409</b> remain undisturbed in the pitcher <b>202</b>, <b>302</b>. The user can then observe the optical saturation level through the pitcher <b>202</b>, <b>302</b> or pour a sample of the liquid out of the pitcher <b>202</b>, <b>302</b> and taste for preference. If the user prefers a stronger liquid extract, he or she may place the pitcher <b>202</b>, <b>302</b> back onto the base <b>201</b>, <b>301</b> and resume agitation, without accessing the interior volume of the pitcher <b>202</b>, <b>303</b>. This can be done as many times as necessary to achieve optimal extraction, without having to disturb the inner-workings of the liquid brewer, which could cause a mess, or involve a significant time expenditure.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">An additional beneficial use of the brewing devices <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> is that the brewed liquid flows freely out of the brew basket <b>203</b>, <b>303</b> into the interior volume of the pitcher <b>202</b>, <b>302</b> and out of the outlet <b>204</b><i>a</i>, <b>304</b><i>a </i>without having to manipulate the brew basket <b>203</b>, <b>303</b> or agitator <b>209</b>, <b>309</b>, <b>409</b> contained therein.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Yet another additionally beneficial use of the brewing devices <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> is that ice may be placed in the pitcher <b>202</b>, <b>302</b>, in the space between the brew basket <b>203</b>, <b>303</b>, and the pitcher <b>202</b>, <b>302</b>, without impacting or impeding rotation of the agitator magnet holder <b>408</b><i>a </i>and agitator <b>409</b>, positioned inside the brew basket <b>203</b>, <b>303</b>, and without disrupting the stirring or agitation of the liquid occurring within the brew basket <b>203</b>, <b>303</b>.

Meanwhile, the user may dispose of the spent brewing ingredients contained in the brew basket <b>203</b>, <b>303</b>, and may separate the agitator <b>209</b>, <b>309</b>, <b>409</b> from the brew basket <b>203</b>, <b>303</b> for cleaning.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In any of the embodiments described herein, a base <b>501</b> (or bases <b>205</b>, <b>305</b>) may house a motor <b>506</b> (or motors <b>206</b>, <b>306</b>) in communication with a user interface <b>550</b>, a power source <b>560</b>, a motor load detection sensor or circuitry <b>570</b>, a controller <b>580</b>, and a memory <b>590</b>, as illustrated in the functional block diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. As previously described, the motor <b>506</b> may be any suitable AC or DC motor, and the power source <b>560</b> may be a standard electric cord connected to a wall outlet, or a battery.

The controller <b>580</b> may increase or decrease motor power or speed based on the load on the motor <b>506</b> detected by the load detection sensor or circuitry <b>570</b>. For example, if the controller <b>580</b>, in conjunction with the load detection sensor or circuitry <b>570</b>, determines that the load on the motor is high, potentially due to blockage or resistance to rotation of the agitator, the controller may increase the power to the motor <b>506</b>.

In order to achieve such objective, in some embodiments, the liquid brewing devices disclosed herein are operated in a manner consistent with active cold brewing processes, while at the same time, limiting the amount and intensity of agitation, to thereby reduce the breakdown of liquid brewing ingredients to a size small enough to permit undesirable passage through the mesh structure of the brew baskets containing the brewing ingredients, which can negatively affecting the quality of the brewed liquid. In this regard, rather than continuously running the motors of the liquid brewing devices disclosed herein at some predetermined power and/or speed for some fixed length of time, or indefinitely, the liquid brewing devices may be tuned and programmed to perform liquid brewing programs according to specific liquid brewing ingredients (e.g. coffee grounds having specific average ground sizes, loose leaf teas, powders, etc.), user preferences (e.g., flavor intensity levels, optical saturation, etc.), desired brewing times (e.g., ranging from 60 seconds to 60 minutes, or more), and/or any combinations thereof. These liquid brewing programs may have one or more phases, including both active phases, where an agitator is rotating, and inactive phases, where the agitator is not rotating, or rotating at significantly reduced speeds.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">For example, in response to selection of a brewing program stored in the memory <b>590</b> by a user via the user interface <b>550</b>, the controller <b>580</b> may execute the brewing program, causing the motor <b>506</b> to run at a predetermined power or speed, for a predetermined period of time, thereby rotating the agitator (e.g., agitator <b>209</b>, <b>309</b>, <b>409</b>) to &#x201c;mix and wet&#x201d; the brewing ingredients in the liquid contained in the corresponding pitcher, and initiate flavor extraction from the brewing ingredients.
