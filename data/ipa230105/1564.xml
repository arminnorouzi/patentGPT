More particularly, the present disclosure relates to foldable and lockable grabber tools.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">There are a wide variety of tools designed for picking up objects or manipulating objects from a distance. One common application for such tools is use by maintenance workers to pick-up debris for subsequent disposal. A tool with an elongate handle allows manipulation of the object without the need to bend over or to directly handle the material. Such tools are also useful for individuals that have physical handicaps that may impede their ability to bend over and reach the ground. There are also numerous household applications for such tools including retrieval of materials from high shelves or from under furniture. Another common application for such tools is for changing light bulbs from recessed lighting fixtures. Another entire class of devices that operate in a similar manner and perform a similar function as the pick-up tools described above are marketed as toys. Other tools may have blades on the distal end for cutting that may be used for a wide range of uses including those tools used in the surgical field and tools used for trimming high branches.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Common elements that are shared by such devices include an elongate shaft having a handle on one end and engagement elements on the opposite end, an actuation member on the handle a linkage from the actuation member to the engagement elements. Actuating the actuation member causes the engagement elements to operate. Releasing the actuation member allows the engagement elements to release. The engagement elements may include arrangements such as claws, arms, scoops, calipers, tongs, blades, cups, or the like.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the nature of such grabbing or reaching tools results in elongate tools that can be hard to carry and/or store, due to their extended length and size. Some grabber devices may include a hinge mechanism at the middle of the device. However, the hinge mechanism inherently results in portions of the tool that are moveable relative to each other. If one section moves relative to the other, the tool may not operate as intended. Alternatively, multiple sections may be separated from each other via threading or a press-fit or a peg and hole arrangement.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Moveable sections requires the user to manually move the sections toward the extended position or manually assemble the sections. However, such arrangements also require the user to correctly attach the sections together, and relies on the knowledge of the user for such assemblies or arrangements.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Some arrangements include fixing mechanisms that hold the parts together, but the user must manually engage these fixing mechanisms, and a failure to correctly engage the fixing mechanism can likewise lead to de-coupling or inoperability.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, improvements can be made to foldable grabber tools.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention relates to a new self-opening arrangement and self-locking arrangement for a foldable grabbing tool. The invention allows the user to release proximal and distal sections of the grabber tool when the grabber device is in a folded state. Upon releasing the proximal and distal sections, they automatically unfold from a folded state to an expanded state. Upon reaching the expanded state, the sections automatically lock relative to each other, blocking the ability of the tool to be returned to the folded state. The hinge mechanism can be actuated to unlock the tool from its expanded state, thereby allowing the tool be folded back to its folded arrangement. Without actuating the hinge mechanism, the tool cannot be folded.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a grabber tool according to an aspect of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of the grabber tool shown folded about a hinge mechanism;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an exploded view of a handle of the grabber tool;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a bottom view in elevation of a switch element used with a locking feature;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective view of the switch element;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an exploded view of the hinge mechanism of the grabber tool having an automatic locking mechanism;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is an end view of the exterior section of a hinge pin used with the hinge mechanism;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a side view the exterior segment of the hinge pin;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>C</figref> provide a schematic illustration of a varying shape of a channel of the hinge mechanism at different angular positions of the hinge mechanism;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B</figref> illustrates the hinge pin in both a locked and unlocked state and being biased toward the locked state; and</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates a cable that connects an actuation mechanism to the engagement elements of the grabber tool.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, according to an aspect of the disclosure, an elongate grabber tool <b>8</b> is depicted in an extended position. Grabber tool <b>8</b> incorporates engagement elements <b>10</b> on a distal end of a elongate rod <b>12</b>, and a pistol grip <b>14</b> on the opposite proximal end. A trigger <b>16</b> is provided adjacent to pistol grip <b>14</b> for manipulation by a user's fingers. As shown on the side of pistol grip <b>14</b>, a switch <b>18</b> is provided that effects a locking feature of the engagement elements of the device. At a medial point on elongate hollow rod <b>12</b> is hinge <b>20</b> that allows elongate rod <b>12</b> to fold. The hinge <b>20</b> may include a hinge mechanism <b>105</b> with a hinge pin <b>150</b> that automatically locks the tool <b>8</b> in an extended arrangement, as described in further detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>10</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts the rod <b>12</b> in a folded position wherein the distal end of elongate rod <b>12</b> is folded back on the top side and adjacent to pistol grip <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one aspect, rod <b>12</b> may be rotated and held about its longitudinal axis relative to the pistol grip, such that the distal end of the rod <b>12</b> is folded back to the side of the pistol grip, rather than the top, and such that the engagement members at the end o the tool may be oriented different relative to the grip. The rod <b>12</b> may be secured to the side of the pistol grip via a projection at the distal end of the rod <b>12</b> that is snap-fit into a corresponding recess on the side of the grip. Other securement mechanisms may also be used, such as a hook and loop arrangement, magnets, a hook and eye-loop latch, or the like.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, trigger <b>16</b> extends from and is connected to the handle at axis or pivot point <b>30</b> that is located near the top of the pistol grip <b>14</b>. A connecting pin <b>32</b> transects handle side <b>25</b><i>a</i>, the trigger half <b>16</b><i>a</i>, trigger half <b>16</b><i>b </i>and handle side <b>25</b><i>b</i>. Trigger <b>16</b> extends through a slot or opening provided between the forward sides of pistol grip <b>14</b> and allows for limited pivotal movement with respect to the axis <b>30</b>. As seen on trigger side <b>16</b><i>b</i>, a cavity is provided to retain a nipple (not shown) which is provided on the end of a cable <b>300</b> that connects trigger <b>16</b> to the engagement elements <b>10</b> on the distal end of the tool. The engagement elements <b>10</b>, which are biased apart by spring members <b>31</b> are drawn together by pulling connector members <b>29</b> toward the handle <b>14</b> via the central cable <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Control surface <b>35</b> is an arcuate notched surface that is integral with trigger half <b>16</b><i>a </i>(as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) and on which is provided a series of saw-tooth notches <b>38</b>. A similar control surface <b>35</b> may be integrally formed with trigger half <b>16</b><i>b </i>in addition to trigger half <b>16</b><i>a</i>. For the purposes of discussion, the control surface <b>25</b> on trigger half <b>16</b><i>a </i>will be described. The arc of control surface <b>35</b> is formed so that each saw tooth extension is approximately equidistant to the pivot point <b>30</b>. The notches <b>38</b> are adapted to receive the end projections <b>40</b> of a stop member <b>42</b>. Stop member <b>42</b> is engaged or disengaged by the fore-and-aft manipulation of switch <b>44</b>. Stop member <b>42</b> also is provided with a pin member <b>48</b> that is engaged by switch <b>44</b>. Stop member <b>42</b> can be disengaged by either movement of the switch in the opposite direction or by application of a force against the trigger that will push the stop member from its position. Stop member <b>42</b> is locked into place and in engagement with notches <b>38</b> on the arcuate control surface <b>35</b> by use of a mechanical locking engagement wherein switch <b>44</b> stays in position by frictional engagement.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref> depict the rear/inner side of switch <b>44</b>, which faces and engages with stop member <b>42</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> extensions <b>60</b>, <b>61</b>, <b>62</b> and <b>63</b> have projections that bend away from the extensions so that the switch <b>44</b> will snap fit into opening <b>50</b> on the side of grip <b>16</b> and be retained within the opening <b>50</b>, while allowing fore-and-aft sliding movement. For example, surface <b>70</b> of projection <b>60</b> will engage the interior surface of the handle side <b>25</b><i>a </i>adjacent to the opening <b>50</b>. Since the projections only extend toward the top and bottom of the switch, the arrangement allows for the sliding movement of the switch <b>44</b> within opening <b>50</b>. Walls <b>65</b> and <b>67</b> define groove <b>72</b> into which the pin member <b>48</b> of stop member <b>42</b> is received. Accordingly, sliding movement of switch <b>44</b> causes the side walls <b>65</b> and <b>67</b> to move pin <b>48</b> up-and-down, thereby causing the stop member <b>42</b> to move up or down and in or out of engagement with the control surface <b>35</b>. When the stop member <b>42</b> is moved down into engagement with the control surface <b>35</b>, the trigger <b>16</b> is held in place according to its position at the time the stop member <b>42</b> engages the control surface, thereby maintaining the cable in tension at a corresponding position.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In operation, a user can use the device in a manner that allows free movement of engagement members <b>10</b> according to a variable actuation of the trigger <b>16</b> (such that a release of the trigger will allow a release of the tension in the cable and opening of the engagement members <b>10</b>) or, by manipulation of the switch <b>44</b> can cause the stop member <b>42</b> to engage the notches <b>38</b> on the trigger <b>16</b> and therefore lock the movement of the engagement members <b>10</b> when the trigger is released by the user. The stop member can be disengaged by pulling on the trigger <b>16</b>, which forces the teeth <b>40</b> of stop member <b>42</b> out of engagement with the corresponding teeth <b>38</b> on control surface <b>35</b>. Additionally, the teeth <b>40</b> may also be disengaged from the opposite teeth <b>38</b> on control surface <b>35</b> by lateral movement of switch <b>44</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">While an integral saw-toothed notched control surface <b>35</b> is depicted as a preferred embodiment, it is contemplated that other arrangements could be advantageously employed to lock the trigger. For example, a side view of the control surface could resemble a round or square waveform that has an opposite and complementary profile of teeth provided on a stop member. In a further contemplated embodiment, the control surface may be comprised of a series of cavities that have sidewalls oriented transverse to the control surface and the stop member includes an extension that can be received in the cavities. For example, in this alternative contemplated embodiment, a series of annular cavities are provided on the control surface that can receive a peg that extends from the stop member. In yet further contemplated embodiments of the invention the stop member is made of conical shaped projections or pyramid shaped projections that are received in opposite and complementary shaped cavities. The above alternative arrangements may permit similar release via movement of trigger <b>16</b> in the actuation direction or movement of the switch <b>44</b> in a direction opposite the locking direction.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The trigger locking arrangement according to the invention uses only a few parts and can therefore be economically manufactured and assembled. As described herein, the locking feature further allows for the stop member <b>42</b> to engage the control surface <b>35</b> along substantially the entire range of motion of the control surface <b>35</b> and range of the trigger <b>16</b>. The switch <b>44</b> for the lock can be manipulated by the user's thumb while the handle <b>25</b> of the device is held in the user's hand.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">While the controller or actuation member depicted in the preferred embodiment is a trigger designed to be engaged by multiple fingers of the user, the applicant contemplates that alternative arrangements of the trigger or controller may also be provided. For example, in an alternative embodiment the trigger may be manipulated by a user's single finger. In yet another contemplated alternative embodiment, the trigger may be displaced on the rear side of the stationary handle. Further, while in the preferred embodiment the engagement elements are opposite engagement cups, it is also contemplated that other engagement elements may also be used and that may depend on the intended application.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In accordance with an another aspect of the disclosure, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>10</b>B</figref>, the elongate rod <b>12</b> is provided in two sections, a distal section <b>101</b> and a proximal section <b>103</b>. The distal section <b>101</b> is attached to the engagement members <b>10</b> and the proximal section is attached to the handle or grip <b>16</b>. The distal section <b>101</b> and the proximal section <b>103</b> are connected by a hinge structure <b>105</b> that enables the rod <b>12</b> (and therefore the device) to be folded and unfolded. Hinge <b>105</b> includes a forward hinge section <b>111</b> composed of opposite sides <b>111</b><i>a </i>and <b>111</b><i>b </i>and a rearward section <b>120</b> composed of opposite sides <b>120</b><i>a </i>and <b>120</b><i>b</i>. Sections <b>11</b> and <b>120</b> are shown in their combined state as a single unit, and may also be formed as an integral piece, as shown, or as separate pieces that are joined together to define the overall part. Rearward section <b>120</b> may include a shank portion <b>135</b> and flat knuckle sections <b>137</b> and <b>139</b> that extend from shank portion <b>135</b>. A gap or space is disposed between knuckle section <b>137</b> and section <b>139</b> when assembled to define overall rear hinge section <b>120</b>. The gap or space may have an axial dimension about the same distance as the as the width of one of the respective knuckles <b>137</b>, <b>139</b>. This gap or space may accommodate one of the knuckle sections <b>115</b> or <b>118</b>. The other of knuckle sections <b>115</b> or <b>118</b> may be disposed to the side of one of the knuckles <b>137</b>, <b>139</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Other arrangements may also be used to join each of the knuckle sections together, such as two knuckles from one rod section on one axial side and two knuckles from the other section on the other axial side. In another arrangement, two knuckles from one section may be on the outside, with two knuckles from the other section being on the other side. In yet another arrangement, a single knuckle may be used for each of the rod sections, with the single knuckle having a thickness about half the width of the hinge</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The knuckle sections <b>115</b> and <b>118</b> of forward hinge section <b>111</b> (which may also be referred to as forward knuckles) extend from the end of the hinge section <b>111</b> and are positioned alongside the knuckle sections <b>137</b> and <b>139</b> (which may also be referred to as rear knuckles), in one aspect. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B</figref>, knuckle sections <b>115</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>137</b>, and <b>139</b> are interleaved to define an overall width of the knuckle portion of the hinge <b>105</b>. When the rod <b>12</b> is folded and unfolded, the knuckle sections will rotate relative to each other. As further described below, when the rod <b>12</b> is unfolded, the knuckles will be locked relative to each other via hinge pin <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">When assembled, knuckle sections <b>115</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>137</b>, and <b>139</b> are adjacent to one another and define an axial channel <b>152</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B</figref>) that extends transverse to the direction of the elongate rod <b>12</b>. Each of the forward knuckles <b>115</b> and <b>118</b> define a stop surface or wall that is configured to correspond with stop surface or wall defined by the rear knuckles <b>137</b> and <b>139</b>. When the grabber device is rotated into its extended position, walls comes into contact with corresponding walls <b>203</b>, which prevents further rotation in one direction. For example, the walls may be arranged such that the proximal section <b>103</b> and distal section <b>101</b> are stopped from rotating more than 180 degrees relative to each other. Put another way, the sections <b>101</b> and <b>103</b> are stopped from rotation once they become aligned with each other. Of course, if desired, the walls could be arranged to stop the relative rotation between sections <b>101</b> and <b>103</b> at different rotational points, such that that the sections <b>101</b> and <b>103</b> end at an oblique angle relative to each other.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The size and shape of the axial channel <b>152</b> will vary depending on the orientation of the knuckle sections relative to each other. When the sections <b>101</b> and <b>103</b> are at the desired orientation relative to each other, the channel <b>152</b> may have a shape corresponding to the shape of the outer profile of the hinge pin <b>150</b>, so that the hinge pin may be received therein and lock the sections <b>101</b> and <b>103</b> relative to each other. When the rod <b>12</b> is fully unfolded, hinge pin <b>150</b> may be axially moveable to a locked position within the axial channel <b>152</b> that prevents relative movement between the knuckle sections. When the rod <b>12</b> is folded or in a partially folded state, the size and shape of the axial channel <b>152</b> may block the hinge pin <b>150</b> from axial translation into the locked position, thereby allowing the knuckle sections to continue rotating relative to each other toward the fully extended state.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Of course, the shape of the axial channel and the hinge pin may be arranged to permit translation of the hinge pin into the channel (and a corresponding locked state) at intermediate locations of travel between the folded and unfolded state.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B</figref> illustrate the unlocked and locked state of the hinge <b>105</b> in a schematic manner.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>, hinge pin <b>150</b> is permitted to move to the left into the locked position.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>C</figref> illustrate a changing shape of the channel <b>152</b> based on the relative position of the knuckle sections <b>115</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>137</b> <b>139</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>, the hinge <b>105</b> is unlocked, and the channel <b>152</b> has a schematic circular shape extending through the hinge. Accordingly, the non-circular hinge pin <b>150</b> cannot shift. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>, the knuckle sections have rotated relative to each other about 90 degrees, but their channel shapes are not yet aligned, and the overall channel <b>152</b> remains circular. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref>, the knuckle sections have rotated such that the channel sections are aligned, and the channel <b>152</b> has a non-circular &#x201c;keyhole&#x201d; shape, which corresponds to the schematic shape of the hinge pin <b>150</b>, such that the hinge pin <b>150</b> may shift axially to the locked position. It will be appreciated that these shapes of the channel <b>152</b> and hinge pin <b>150</b> are schematic and for illustrative purposes. An exemplary shape of the hinge pin <b>150</b> and knuckle sections defining the channel is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>8</b></figref>, which includes multiple projections and distributes the load around the perimeter of the channel <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one aspect, the hinge pin <b>150</b> is defined by exterior section <b>170</b> and interior section <b>172</b>. Interior section includes rounded head section <b>177</b> on the end of shank section <b>175</b>. Shank section <b>175</b> of interior section <b>172</b> is received in opposite and complementary cavity <b>178</b> that is defined within the exterior section <b>170</b>. In one aspect, the shank section <b>175</b> may have a square cross-section that is received in a corresponding square-shaped cavity. Accordingly, interior section <b>172</b> and exterior section <b>170</b> are rotationally fixed relative to each other. It will be appreciated that other corresponding cross-section shapes, or shapes that rotationally couple the interior section <b>172</b> and exterior section <b>170</b> may also be used.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one aspect, interior section <b>172</b> can be slightly moveable axially relative to the exterior section <b>170</b>, but also axially connected such that interior section <b>172</b> may push or pull exterior section <b>170</b>. In another aspect, the interior section <b>172</b> may be axially fixed to the exterior section <b>170</b>. Exterior section <b>172</b> defines an outer profile <b>181</b> that corresponds in shape to the shape of the axial channel <b>152</b> defined by the knuckle sections <b>115</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>137</b>, <b>139</b> when the rod <b>12</b> is unfolded to its desired locked position.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The exterior section <b>170</b> may include multiple outer profiles at different axial locations, according to an aspect. Accordingly, in a first axial location of the exterior section <b>170</b> relative to the knuckle sections <b>115</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>137</b>, <b>139</b>, the knuckles are moveable relative to each other. In a second axial location, the knuckles <b>115</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>137</b>, <b>139</b> are not moveable relative to each other because the hinge pin <b>150</b> blocks them. Whether the exterior section <b>170</b> is axially shiftable relative to the knuckle sections <b>115</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>137</b>, <b>139</b> depends on the orientation of the knuckle sections relative to each other. Various types of corresponding shapes may be used for this purpose. For the purposes of discussion, a single locked position (at 180 degree orientation between proximal and distal sections <b>103</b>, <b>101</b>) will be illustrated and described.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, exterior section <b>170</b> includes outer profile <b>181</b> in the form of projections <b>181</b> that are disposed at distinct axial portions of the exterior section <b>170</b>. Gaps <b>182</b> are disposed axially adjacent projections <b>181</b>. Gaps <b>182</b> are disposed where the projections are not present, and define a generally circular outer profile, such that the knuckle sections that are axially aligned with the gaps <b>182</b> can rotate about the hinge pin <b>150</b>. However, when the hinge pin <b>150</b> is allowed to shift, the projections <b>181</b> will move into axial alignment with the knuckle sections, blocking rotational movement.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Knuckle sections <b>115</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>137</b>, <b>139</b> each define a recess <b>183</b> having a shape corresponding to the shape of external projections <b>181</b> when viewed axially (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). When the knuckles are aligned in position to be locked, the recesses <b>183</b> are aligned, allowing the external projections <b>181</b> to be received in the recesses <b>183</b>. The recesses <b>183</b> combine to define the overall channel <b>152</b> through the hinge <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In a first axial position of exterior section <b>170</b> (such as unlocked position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>), projection <b>181</b> extends axially into recess <b>183</b> of knuckle section <b>118</b>, but does not extend into recess <b>183</b> of adjacent knuckle section <b>139</b>. Similarly, projection <b>181</b> extends into recess <b>183</b> of knuckle <b>115</b>, but does not extend into recess <b>83</b> of knuckle section <b>137</b>. In this position, knuckle sections <b>137</b> and <b>139</b> may be rotated relative to knuckle sections <b>115</b> and <b>118</b> (and hinge pin <b>150</b>).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Knuckles sections <b>115</b> and <b>118</b>, having projections <b>181</b> of exterior section engaged therewith, will cause exterior section <b>170</b> of hinge pin <b>150</b> to remain rotationally fixed therewith. If the knuckle sections <b>115</b> and <b>118</b> rotate, exterior section <b>170</b> will rotate with them. Thus, the rotation between knuckle sections is relative, and either half (or both) of the hinge <b>105</b> may be the one to move. Similarly, the hinge pin <b>150</b> may be arranged on knuckle sections <b>137</b>, <b>139</b>, and sections <b>115</b>, <b>118</b> may be the sections that selectively engage with the projections <b>181</b> in another aspect.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In a second position (such as the locked position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>) of exterior section <b>170</b>, projections <b>181</b> extends into both knuckles <b>118</b>, <b>139</b> the other projection <b>181</b> extends into both knuckles <b>115</b>, <b>137</b>. Thus, all knuckles are fixed relative to each other via exterior section <b>170</b> and its projections <b>181</b>, thereby locking proximal and distal sections <b>103</b>, <b>101</b> together in place while exterior section <b>170</b> is in the second positon (axially shifted relative to the first position).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to one aspect, exterior section <b>170</b> is biased toward the second position. In one aspect, a spring <b>186</b> is disposed between the head <b>177</b> of interior section <b>172</b> and the side of the hinge <b>105</b>, thereby pulling the exterior section <b>170</b> toward the second position via spring force S.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">When the exterior section <b>170</b> is in the first position, the head section of the exterior section <b>170</b> is spaced away from the hinge <b>105</b>, thereby allowing for travel toward the second position. When the proximal and distal sections <b>103</b>, <b>101</b> are in the extended position and the channel <b>152</b> matches the hinge pin <b>150</b>, the interior section <b>172</b> and exterior section <b>170</b> automatically shift to left due to the spring force S from the spring <b>186</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one aspect, the exterior section <b>170</b> is freely moveable toward the first position from the second position when the bias is overcome, because the projections <b>181</b> can simply exit the recesses <b>183</b> in which they are disposed. However, the exterior section <b>170</b> is not freely moveable toward the second position unless the recesses <b>183</b> are aligned, because the projections <b>181</b> must be inserted into the <b>183</b> recesses. If the recesses <b>183</b> are not aligned, the exterior section <b>170</b> is blocked because the shape of the channel does not correspond to the shape of the projections <b>181</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Due to the bias on the exterior section <b>170</b> toward the second position, the exterior section <b>170</b> does not need to be manually actuated to the second position. On the contrary, the bias on the exterior section <b>170</b> will automatically cause the exterior section to shift to the second position, with the recesses <b>183</b> receiving the projections <b>181</b>, after which the proximal and distal sections <b>103</b> and <b>101</b> are locked in place.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The bias on the exterior section <b>170</b> thereby provides an automatic locking feature to the hinge <b>105</b>. The hinge will lock upon positioning the knuckles <b>115</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>137</b>, <b>139</b> in such a way that recesses <b>183</b> are aligned to define a channel <b>152</b> having a shape that matches the profile of the exterior section <b>170</b> of the hinge pin <b>150</b>. The particular orientation may thereby be arranged depending on the needs of the user. As described herein, the recesses <b>183</b> may be arranged to align only when the rod <b>12</b> is in its fully extended position.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one aspect, the projections <b>181</b> may be in the form of multiple projecting features that are disposed about the exterior section. Additional projections may provide additional rotational stability. The shape of the projections <b>181</b> may be selected and spaced apart in such a way so as to only become fully aligned in the desired rotational orientation. For example, a plurality of teeth <b>181</b><i>a </i>or the like may radiate from the exterior section <b>170</b>. The teeth <b>181</b><i>a </i>may define the projection <b>181</b>. In one aspect, six teeth <b>181</b><i>a </i>may be used for each projection <b>181</b> of the exterior section <b>170</b>. In one aspect, one side of the projection <b>181</b> may be flattened between adjacent teeth <b>181</b><i>a </i>to define a flat surface <b>181</b><i>b</i>. The flat surface <b>181</b><i>b </i>may also be described as the alignment feature <b>181</b><i>b</i>. Alignment feature <b>181</b><i>b </i>will match a corresponding flat surface <b>183</b><i>a </i>on the recesses <b>183</b>. The alignment feature <b>181</b><i>b </i>may be disposed on only one radial side of the projections <b>181</b>, such that rotation of the recesses <b>183</b> will result in alignment at a predetermined angular position corresponding to the desired locked position. Until the flat alignment feature <b>181</b><i>b </i>aligns with alignment feature <b>183</b><i>a </i>of the recess, the projection <b>181</b> and exterior section cannot shift into the locked position.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one aspect, a hinge housing <b>187</b> may be provided. The head sections of the interior section <b>172</b> and exterior section <b>170</b>, respectively, may bear against the outer surfaces of the hinge housing <b>187</b>. The hinge housing may include a closed section (shown on the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) that surrounds one of the proximal section <b>103</b> or distal section <b>101</b>, and may have a u-shape on the opposite end, thereby allowing the proximal and distal sections <b>103</b>, <b>101</b> to fold toward each other in a single direction, and to be blocked from pivoting beyond the fully extended position and ensuring that that exterior section <b>170</b> will automatically translate to the locked position when the device is fully unfolded. The hinge housing <b>187</b> operates in addition to, or as an alternative to, the stop surfaces described above, to prevent a hyperextension condition from occurring.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">With the exterior section <b>170</b> in its locked position, to release the lock, interior section <b>172</b> may be depressed axially toward exterior section <b>170</b>, with the head <b>177</b> contacting the end of exterior section <b>170</b> and forcing exterior section <b>170</b> to its first position. The bias on the exterior section <b>170</b> remains. Accordingly, releasing the head of the interior section <b>172</b> will allow exterior section <b>170</b> to return to the locked second position.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Thus, to fold the device, the rod <b>12</b> is folded while the head <b>177</b> of the interior section <b>172</b> is pressed. Once the device has been at least partially folded, the interior section <b>172</b> may be released, and the exterior section <b>170</b> will be blocked from returning to the locked position because the recesses <b>183</b> are no longer aligned. When the recesses <b>183</b> return to an aligned position, the exterior section <b>170</b> will once against automatically move to the locked position.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In addition to the automatic locking feature, the device is further configured to automatically open when released from its folded state. Actuation cable <b>300</b> extends through the hollow cavity of the proximal and distal sections <b>103</b>, <b>101</b> and through the hinge <b>105</b>. In one aspect, the cable <b>300</b> is disposed on the side of the hinge <b>105</b> that is opposite the direction of folding. Accordingly, when the device is folded, cable <b>300</b> wraps around the outer edge of the hinge ping <b>150</b>. By wrapping around the outer edge of the hinge pin <b>150</b>, the cable <b>300</b> is put in tension, which pulls on connector members <b>29</b> that are attached at the end of the cable <b>300</b>. The connector members <b>29</b> are pulled into distal end of the distal section and springs <b>31</b> put in tension. Thus, a biasing force on the cable <b>300</b> is created when folded. Releasing the distal section <b>101</b> from its folded position thereby allows the springs <b>31</b> to pull the connector members <b>29</b> out of the distal end, which pulls on cable <b>300</b> and drags the distal section <b>101</b> to rotate about the hinge axis. Thus, the tension of the cable <b>300</b> and the springs <b>31</b> will automatically transition the device toward the locked position, where the hinge pin <b>150</b> will automatically lock the device in its extended position. Additional tension may be added to the cable <b>300</b> by pulling the trigger <b>16</b>, which may speed the rate that the rod <b>12</b> transitions to the automatically locked position.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">While the preferred embodiments have been described herein, those skilled in the art will recognize that certain details may be changed without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
