Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia is the most common form of dementia. Other major forms include Lewy body dementia (LBD), vascular dementia (VD), Parkinson's disease (PD) dementia, dementia associated with schizophrenia, and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Although they are pathologically different from each other, they have symptoms that are common and mixed forms often co-exist. Behavioral and psychological symptoms are one of the common symptoms observed across the forms of dementia which represent a heterogeneous group of non-cognitive symptoms and behaviors. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are also known as neuropsychiatric symptoms. BPSD constitutes a major component of the dementia syndrome irrespective of its subtype. It is estimated that BPSD affects up to 90% of all dementia subjects over the course of their illness, and is independently associated with poor outcomes, including distress among patients and caregivers, early and long-term institutionalization, misuse of medication, and increased health care costs. They are clinically as relevant as cognitive symptoms because they strongly correlate with the degree of functional and cognitive impairment. BPSD includes agitation/aggression, aberrant motor behavior, aberrant vocalizations, anxiety, elation, dysphoria, irritability, depression, apathy, disinhibition, delusions, hallucinations, and sleep or appetite changes. Clinical evidences suggest that there is a broad overlap between the behaviorally relevant circuits and networks associated with these symptoms. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) scale is widely used to assess neuropsychological symptoms in patients with dementias.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Psychosis symptoms are common across dementia types with a prevalence of 20% to 70%. In addition to occurring in patients with AD, psychosis also occurs in patients with other dementias of a wide variety of etiologies (<i>J Cell Mol Med </i>2012; 16:995-1012). Among patients with AD psychosis, it is reported that an increased occurrence of severe psychosis is associated with an increased presence of delusions and hallucinations as well as symptoms of agitation/aggression. Currently, no pharmacological treatment is approved for patients with AD psychosis, particularly, patients experiencing severe psychotic symptoms.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Agitation/aggression is highly prevalent in patients with dementia which involves emotional distress for patients and caregivers, risk of institutionalization, and faster rate of disease state progression. Individual items of agitation/aggression, aberrant motor behavior, aberrant vocalizations, irritability/lability, anxiety, and disinhibition from the NPI may represent agitation/aggression. Currently, no pharmacological treatment is approved for the treatment of agitation/aggression in patients with dementia. Apathy is also commonly observed in dementia and is a primary cause of caregiver distress. Apathy is characterized by lack of motivation, decreased initiative, akinesia, and emotional indifference. Currently, no pharmacological treatment is approved for the treatment of apathy in patients with dementia. Depression is also common in the dementia population. Although antidepressants are used for the management, evidence for utility is mixed. A high prevalence of sleep disorders is also observed in demented patients.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Combination of non-pharmacological and careful use of pharmacological interventions is the recommended therapeutic strategy for managing BPSD. Published literature indicates that modest symptomatic benefit is associated with short-term treatment of patients with BPSD using atypical antipsychotic agents like risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole. However, benefits for longer-term treatment are less clear (<i>N Engl J Med. </i>2006; 355(15):1525-1538). Moreover, the modest benefits must be balanced against significant safety concerns associated with these drugs, including risks of accelerated cognitive decline, stroke, and death, particularly with longer-term use. Atypical antipsychotics have been associated with statistically significant acceleration of cognitive deterioration in patients with AD. Pimavanserin, a 5-HT<sub>2A </sub>receptor antagonist which was recently approved for PD psychosis had shown statistically significant effect on Neuropsychiatric Inventory Nursing Home Version (NPI-NH) psychosis scale at week 6, however, no effect was for agitation in AD study (<i>The lancet neurology, </i>2018, 17, 213-222; NCT02992132). Citalopram (30 mg daily dose) for agitation in AD study showed a significant decrease in agitation in 186 patients with AD (<i>JAMA </i>2014; 311:682-91). Worsening of cognition and QT interval prolongation were seen in citalopram treatment group.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Given the modest efficacy of current therapies, there is an urgent need to identify novel pharmacological mechanisms through which one can address the current limitations like side effects, cognitive worsening while treating BPSD.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">WO2015083179 discloses process for large scale production of 1-[(2-bromophenyl)sulfonyl]-5-methoxy-3-[(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)methyl]-1h-indole dimesylate monohydrate.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">WO2017199071 discloses a combination of pure 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptor (5-HT<sub>6</sub>R) antagonists and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of cognitive disorders.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">WO2017199072 discloses a combination of pure 5-HT<sub>6</sub>R antagonists and NMDA antagonist for the treatment of cognitive disorders.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">WO2019008484 discloses the uses of a pure 5-HT<sub>6</sub>R antagonist, specifically 1-[(2-Bromophenyl) sulfonyl]-5-methoxy-3-[(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)methyl]-1H-indole or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. However, this patent application did not disclose the combination of 5-HT<sub>6</sub>R antagonists and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms in patients with dementia.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The 5-HT<sub>6</sub>R antagonists had shown the activity on one of the NPI domain that is apathy (WO2017/194496). There is no information on the potential utility on other important domains of NPI in this said patent WO2017/194496. The NPI domains though are clubbed under single scale but the causative biological reasons for each of these symptoms are different. A person skilled in the art would not expect that if a 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>R antagonist is active in one domain, that means it will show activity in other domains as well. The effect of donepezil is mainly observed in the NPI domain namely apathy (<i>Int J Geriatr Psychiatry. </i>2011 February; 26(2):150-7). Further, donepezil was evaluated for the treatment of agitation/aggression in patients with Alzheimer's disease, however, donepezil failed to show significant effect compared to placebo (<i>N Engl J Med. </i>2007 Oct. 4; 357(14):1382-92).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The NMDA receptor antagonist, memantine is expected to work by blocking the glutamate in the brain (<i>Neurotox Res </i>(2013) 24:358-369) whereas the 5-HT<sub>6</sub>R antagonists work by increasing the glutamate levels in the brain in addition to other mechanisms including increasing acetylcholine levels (<i>Expert Opin Investig Drugs. </i>2015; 24(12): 1515-28). Thus given these contrasting mechanisms it is not anticipated that the combination of a pure 5-HT<sub>6</sub>R antagonist and NMDA receptor antagonist would show coherence or positive effects in their pharmacological activity in the domains of BPSD.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Masupirdine (1-[(2-bromophenyl)sulfonyl]-5-methoxy-3-[(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)methyl]-1H-indole) is a pure 5-HT<sub>6</sub>R antagonist with high selectivity over closely related serotonin subtypes.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The instant invention provides pure 5-HT<sub>6</sub>R antagonist or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt(s) thereof, which treats BPSD in combination with or as an adjunct to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or NMDA receptor antagonist. The present invention is based on the unexpected and surprising finding that the combination of pure 5-HT<sub>6</sub>R antagonist and the compounds which act as acetylcholinesterase inhibitor such as donepezil or NMDA receptor antagonist, memantine addresses in patients with dementia an array of behavioral and psychological symptoms like agitation/aggression, psychosis (delusions and/or hallucinations), anxiety, apathy and sleep disorders and others. Based on these results, one can infer that such combined administration and/or co-treatment of pure 5-HT<sub>6</sub>R antagonist with acetylcholinesterase inhibitor or NMDA receptor antagonist, results in improved therapeutic efficacy in humans. Further, the pure 5-HT<sub>6</sub>R antagonist, masupirdine or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt(s) thereof of the instant invention is more effective in combination with donepezil or memantine in the treatment of BPSD.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention provides a method for the treatment of behavioral and

Masupirdine potentiates the effects of donepezil or memantine on cortical levels of these neurotransmitters indicating that the combination of masupirdine with donepezil or memantine may have potential in the treatment of behavioral and psychiatric disorders.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00001" cdx-file="US20230000859A1-20230105-C00001.CDX" mol-file="US20230000859A1-20230105-C00001.MOL"/><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
