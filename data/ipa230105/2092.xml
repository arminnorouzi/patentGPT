Further, the fluid may damage the vacuum mechanism of the apparatus and/or other parts of the apparatus, thereby degrading a durability of the apparatus.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The embodiments of the present disclosure overcome the above drawbacks by providing the at least one absorbent unit in the fluid collection space to absorb the fluid flowing out of the vacuum bag during the evacuation process. The fluid is thus collected and can be removed e.g. manually by a user or by heating the at least one absorbent unit to evaporate the fluid. Thereby, the generation of bad smell can be avoided. Further, a contamination of the vacuum mechanism of the apparatus and/or other parts of the apparatus can be prevented, whereby a durability of the apparatus can be improved.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a schematic view of an apparatus <b>100</b> for sealing a vacuum bag according to embodiments described herein. The apparatus <b>100</b> can also be referred to as a &#x201c;sealing apparatus&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The apparatus <b>100</b> includes a body <b>110</b> defining at least a part of a reception space <b>120</b>, wherein the reception space <b>120</b> is configured to receive a vacuum bag for sealing, and wherein the body <b>110</b> includes a fluid collection space <b>130</b> for collecting fluid drawn out of the vacuum bag during an evacuation process; and at least one absorbent unit <b>140</b> located in the fluid collection space <b>130</b> to absorb the fluid flowing into the fluid collection space <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The apparatus <b>100</b> may include one or more electrically conductive elements (not shown) configured to seal the vacuum bag. In particular, a current may flow through the one or more electrically conductive elements, such as conductive wires or bars, whereby the one or more electrically conductive elements are heated. The heat provided by the one or more electrically conductive elements melts a part of the vacuum bag and the vacuum bag is sealed thereby.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In order to provide the current, the apparatus <b>100</b> may further include a power source connected to the one or more electrically conductive elements. The power source may be configured to provide a predetermined current which is suitable to heat the one or more electrically conductive elements and melt the part of the vacuum bag without destroying the vacuum bag and/or the vacuum inside of the vacuum bag.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The apparatus <b>100</b> further includes a vacuum mechanism configured to perform the evacuation process of the vacuum bag. In particular, the vacuum mechanism is configured to remove air from the inside of the vacuum bag to generate a technical vacuum before the vacuum bag is sealed e.g. by heat. The vacuum ensures that items placed in the vacuum bag, such as food items, stay longer fresh.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A vacuum is generally understood as a space essentially devoid of matter. The term &#x201c;vacuum&#x201d; as used throughout the present application is particularly understood as a technical vacuum, i.e., a region with a gaseous pressure much less than atmospheric pressure.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The vacuum mechanism may be configured to generate the (technical) vacuum inside of the reception space <b>120</b> and optionally the fluid collection space <b>130</b>.

For example, the reception space <b>120</b> and the fluid collection space <b>130</b> may be connected to form one common reception and fluid collection space. In some embodiments, the fluid collection space <b>130</b> may be provided by at least one recess or depression in the body <b>110</b> and/or the reception space <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">During the evacuation process, fluids may exit the vacuum bag and flow into the reception and fluid collection space, and in particular the fluid collection space <b>130</b>, where the fluid is absorbed by the at least one absorbent unit <b>140</b>. According to some embodiments, which can be combined with other embodiments described herein, the at least one absorbent unit <b>140</b> includes, or is, a sponge. However, the present disclosure is not limited thereto and the at least one absorbent unit <b>140</b> may be made of any other material suitable to absorb fluids.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to some embodiments, which can be combined with other embodiments described herein, the body <b>110</b> includes a first portion <b>112</b> and a second portion <b>114</b>. The first portion <b>112</b> and the second portion <b>113</b> may define the reception space <b>120</b> and/or the fluid collection space <b>130</b> therebetween. The first portion <b>112</b> may be an upper portion and the second portion <b>114</b> may be a lower portion of the body <b>110</b>.

The fluid collection space <b>130</b> may be provided by at least one recess or depression at or in the second portion <b>114</b>, as it is illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. For example, the at least one recess or depression may be provided at or in an upper surface of the second portion <b>114</b> of the body <b>110</b> of the apparatus <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to some embodiments of the present disclosure, the first portion <b>112</b> and the second portion <b>114</b> may be moveable with respect to each other, as it is indicated by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In one example, the first portion <b>112</b> may be moveable and the second portion <b>114</b> may be stationary. In another example, the first portion <b>112</b> may be stationary and the second portion <b>114</b> may be moveable. In yet another example, both the first portion <b>112</b> and the second portion <b>114</b> may be moveable.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The first portion <b>112</b> and the second portion <b>114</b> may have a gap G therebetween which defines the reception space <b>120</b>.

When the vacuum bag or the part of the vacuum bag is inserted in the gap G and the first portion <b>112</b> and the second portion <b>114</b> are moved with respect to each other such that the gap G closes, the vacuum bag may be clamped between the first portion <b>112</b> and the second portion <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The one or more electrically conductive elements may contact the vacuum bag to seal the vacuum bag when the vacuum bag is clamped between the first portion <b>112</b> and the second portion <b>114</b>. A current may flow through the one or more electrically conductive elements, such as conductive wires or bars, whereby the one or more electrically conductive elements are heated. The heat provided by the one or more electrically conductive elements melts a part of the vacuum bag and the vacuum bag is sealed thereby.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">For example, two opposite side walls of the vacuum bag can be pressed together by the first portion <b>112</b> and the second portion <b>114</b> to fix the bag vacuum therebetween. Once the contacts have been established, the current can be supplied by the apparatus <b>100</b> to seal the vacuum bag essentially vacuum-tight by melting a part of the vacuum bag such that the two sidewalls of the vacuum bag adhere to each other.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A</figref> and B show schematic views of an apparatus <b>100</b> for sealing a vacuum bag according to embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to some embodiments, which can be combined with other embodiments described herein, the at least one absorbent unit <b>140</b> is configured to increase a volume thereof when the fluid is absorbed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows a state before the at least one absorbent unit <b>140</b> has absorbed any fluid, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> shows a state after the at least one absorbent unit <b>140</b> has absorbed fluid from the vacuum bag.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The at least one absorbent unit <b>140</b> is bigger in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> than in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>.

Then, the vacuum bag <b>200</b> is evacuated using the vacuum mechanism. Fluid from the vacuum bag <b>200</b> is collected in the fluid collection space and is absorbed by the at least one absorbent unit located in the fluid collection space. When the evacuation process is completed, two opposite sidewalls of the vacuum bag can be adhered to each other e.g. by applying heat.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The present disclosure uses the at least one absorbent unit in the fluid collection space to absorb the fluid flowing out of the vacuum bag during the evacuation process. The fluid is thus collected and can be removed e.g. manually by a user or by heating the at least one absorbent unit to evaporate the fluid. Thereby, the generation of bad smell can be avoided. Further, a contamination of the vacuum mechanism of the apparatus and/or other parts of the apparatus can be prevented, whereby a durability of the apparatus can be improved.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">While the foregoing is directed to embodiments of the disclosure, other and further embodiments of the disclosure may be devised without departing from the basic scope thereof, and the scope thereof is determined by the claims that follow.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
