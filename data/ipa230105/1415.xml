level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to a droplet deformation-based method for delivering a material into cells and a chip for the same, and more specifically, to a droplet deformation-based method for delivering a material into cells and a chip for the same that improve efficiency, economic feasibility, and the like by implementing the delivery of the material into the cells using microdroplets containing a hydrophilic solution containing the cells.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Delivery of a material into cells is one of the most basic experiments in cell engineering. The material is usually delivered using a carrier or by defining nanopores in a cell membrane/nuclear membrane. In viral or Lipofectamine-centered carrier techniques, high-efficiency material delivery is possible when the technique is optimized, but there are problems such as safety, slow delivery velocity, labor/cost-intensive carrier preparation process, low reproducibility, and the like.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">On the other hand, methods (e.g., an electroporation or a microneedle) for defining the nanopores by applying energy to the cell membrane are relatively advantageous as various materials are able to be delivered to various cell lines. However, low cell viability, denaturation of the delivered material, and low throughput resulted from invasiveness of the method are pointed out as major limitations. To solve such problems, use of microfluidic devices capable of treating a large amount of cells is remarkable. Typically, there is a platform that creates a narrow constriction or a bottleneck in a microtubule and defines the nanopores in the cell membrane through physical deformation of the cells that occurs when the cells pass through the bottleneck. However, such approach has major drawbacks such as clogging of the bottleneck itself, inconsistent material delivery efficiency, and the like during the experiment.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, US Patent No. 2014-0287509 (hereinafter, referred to as prior art) discloses a technique for inducing the cell deformation by applying a pressure to the cells by allowing the cells to directly flow through a channel having a bottleneck structure. However, in this case, there is a problem in that the cells clog the bottleneck structure. In addition, the cells are directly in contact with a channel wall to be subjected to stress resulted from friction or the like, so that the cell viability is lowered and the channel clogging occurs. In addition, there are problems that the material delivery is non-uniform because of the non-uniform cell deformation resulted from non-uniform velocity, and the material delivery efficiency is fundamentally low because the delivery occurs only through a diffusion phenomenon. Therefore, it is urgent to develop an innovative next-generation platform for the delivery of the material into the cells that may deliver the various materials uniformly and with high efficiency into the cells while maintaining the great treatment function of the microfluidic device.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Purposes</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, a purpose of the present disclosure is to provide a method and a system that greatly improve a delivery efficiency and a system stability with a material delivery scheme using microdroplets.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solutions</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One aspect of the present disclosure provides a method for delivering a material into cells including generating droplets composed of the material to be delivered and the cells, and deforming the generated droplets to deliver the material to be delivered into the cells.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one implementation, the droplets are generated by allowing a fluid of a first phase containing the cells and the material to flow to a fluid of a second phase immiscible with the fluid of the first phase.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one implementation, the deforming of the droplets includes reducing a diameter of a channel.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one implementation, the deforming of the droplets includes generating vortices in a fluid where the droplets flow.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another aspect of the present disclosure provides a platform for delivering a material into cells including a channel for allowing droplets containing the material to be delivered and the cells to flow therethrough, and deformation means for physically deforming the droplets flowing through the channel to deliver the material to be delivered into the cells.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one implementation, the deformation means is a microchannel having a reduced diameter or a junction where vortices are able to occur due to a collision of fluids.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Still another aspect of the present disclosure provides a method for delivering a material into cells including generating droplets of a hydrophilic solution containing the cells and the material to be delivered in a hydrophobic solution, allowing the hydrophobic solution containing the generated droplets to flow through a channel, primarily deforming the droplets by allowing the hydrophobic solution flowing through the channel to pass through another channel having a smaller diameter than the channel, and secondarily deforming the droplets in the channel after the droplets pass through said another channel, wherein, in the primary deforming and the secondary deforming of the droplets, the cells are not in direct contact with a wall of the channel.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one implementation, in the primary deforming of the droplets, the droplets are squeezed, and at this time, nanopores are defined in a cell membrane of the cells in the droplets. In one implementation, the secondary deforming of the droplets, the droplets are restored to a shape before the primary deforming of the droplets, and at this time, the material to be delivered is delivered into the cells through pores of a cell membrane defined in the primary deforming of the droplets.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one implementation, in the secondary deforming of the droplets, diffusion and convection occur in the droplets, so that a delivery efficiency of the material to be delivered in the droplets into the cells increases. In one implementation, the droplets pass through said another channel at least once.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one implementation, the generating of the droplets of the hydrophilic solution containing the cells and the material to be delivered in the hydrophobic solution includes generating the droplets by allowing the hydrophobic solution in a second direction to flow to the hydrophilic solution flowing in a first direction such that the hydrophilic solution and the hydrophobic solution come into contact with each other. In one implementation, the method further includes accelerating the hydrophobic solution having the droplets generated therein by allowing another hydrophobic solution to flow to the hydrophobic solution having the droplets generated therein.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one implementation, the material to be delivered is at least one selected from a group consisting of a nucleic acid, a protein, a transcription factor, a vector, plasmid, a genetic scissor material, and a nanoparticle.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Still another aspect of the present disclosure provides a microfluidic chip for implementing the method for delivering the material into the cells described above.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one implementation, the microfluidic chip includes a plurality of channels for implementing the method for delivering the material into the cells described above. In one implementation, the channels are defined in parallel with each other.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">TECHNICAL EFFECTS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present disclosure implements the delivery of the material into the cells using the microdroplets containing the hydrophilic solution containing the cells. In this case, the uniform and high-efficiency material delivery into the cells is possible by deforming the cells in the droplets by passing the cells in the microdroplets through the bottleneck or the vortex occurrence point with the reduced diameter at the constant velocity. In addition, it is possible to fundamentally prevent the cell surface from coming into direct contact with the microtubule wall face, thereby fundamentally avoiding the channel clogging phenomenon of the prior art and reducing the stress caused by the friction between the cells and the channel wall. Furthermore, compared to the conventional scheme in which the material is delivered only by the diffusion, in the present disclosure, the high delivery efficiency may be secured as the external material may be delivered through the secondary flow in the microdroplets, which occurs when the cell is restored to the original shape thereof, and the exchange, through the diffusion and the convection, of the fluids with the cell membrane interposed therebetween. In addition, economic feasibility may be secured by making the material delivered into the cells into the microdroplets, and the amount of delivered material may also be controlled through the droplet volume.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Therefore, the method and the system for delivering the material into the cells according to the present disclosure may be applied to all research fields and industries related to cell engineering to implement the material delivery into the cells with an inexpensive and simple scheme with high efficiency and high throughput.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0007" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a droplet change process using a cell delivery platform having a junction according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a droplet change process using a cell delivery platform having a &#x2018;+&#x2019;-shaped junction according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flowchart of a method for delivering a material into cells according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> to <b>7</b></figref> are schematic diagrams of a method and a system for delivering a material into cells according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a method for delivering a material into a cell according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> to <b>7</b></figref> and a channel photograph of each step.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows photographs taken after the lapse of the same time for experimental cases of the prior art and the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows results of a microtubule clogging experiment of the prior art and the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Left and right sides of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> are results of comparing efficiencies of material delivery into the cells of the present disclosure and the prior art with each other.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a photograph of a channel in which the primary deformation and the secondary deformation are continuously repeated according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows results of the cell encapsulation in the microdroplets, the deformation in the bottleneck section, and FITC-Dextran delivery.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a FITC fluorescence signal measurement result for each size of Dextran, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a result of comparing viabilities and delivery efficiencies based on cell line types.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is an experimental result of comparing delivery efficiencies based on a structure and the number of bottleneck channels, and a flow velocity.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is a result of an experiment on mRNA delivery and GFP expression resulted therefrom for a K562 cell.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> is a result of an mRNA delivery efficiency comparison experiment of the present disclosure (DS), the electroporation (a neon transfection system, EP), which is the most commonly used in the field, and lipofectamine (LP).</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS</heading><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Hereinafter, a method for delivering a material into cells and a chip therefor according to the present disclosure will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings and embodiments.

In this case, the material to be delivered and the cells are encapsulated in microdroplets, thereby maximizing a delivery efficiency while minimizing an amount of use of the material to be delivered.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A first reason for the use of the droplets in the present disclosure is that a very small volume (&#x2dc;100 pL/cell) of liquid droplets may be used. In one embodiment of the present disclosure, the amount of material to be delivered is determined depending on a volume of hydrophilic droplets excluding a hydrophobic oil phase volume, so that there is an advantage that only a very small amount of material to be delivered may be used.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In addition, because of the very small droplet volume, the encapsulated cells are placed in a high-concentration material to be delivered environment. When the droplets pass through a section that deforms the droplets, such as a bottleneck or a vortex, the material to be delivered of the high concentration is effectively delivered into the cells because of a secondary flow occurred in the droplets, thereby achieving high delivery efficiency. This enables delivery of a macromolecule (e.g., a larger nanoparticle and a plasmid DNA) into the cells, which was not possible in the prior art.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Furthermore, cell-squeezing, which is the prior art, in which the cells themselves flow into the bottleneck section, has a problem in that it is difficult to achieve a uniform delivery because of a large tube clogging phenomenon in the bottleneck and different velocities of the cells of low weight in the channel. However, the present disclosure may minimize the channel clogging phenomenon using the droplets to encapsulate various debris that clogs the microtubule in the droplets. In addition, the clogging phenomenon may also be minimized because of a difference in hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity between the droplets and the microtubule wall, and the uniform delivery may be achieved because of a constant velocity resulted from a weight/volume of the droplets.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Hereinafter, the present disclosure will be described in more detail through one embodiment of the present disclosure. However, the scope of the present disclosure is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one embodiment of the present disclosure, an experiment was conducted on a K562 cell line for a possible use in cancer immunotherapy in the future. 2,000 kDa FITC-dextran simulating a large protein was used as the material to be delivered, and a microfluidic chip was made using general photolithography and soft lithography methods.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A droplet-based platform for delivering a material into cells according to one embodiment of the present disclosure delivers the material into the cells through three steps: 1) droplet generation (cell encapsulation), 2) droplet deformation (delivery of the material into the cells), and 3) cell recovery.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the present disclosure, the deformation of the droplet is a physical scheme, which may be a scheme using the vortices or the channel diameter.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a droplet change process using a cell delivery platform having a junction according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.

In addition, due to the vortex breakdown that occurs after the vortex generation, the cells in the droplets are deformed secondarily, so that the material to be delivered in the droplets is delivered into the cells.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In another embodiment of the present disclosure, unlike the conventional squeezing scheme, droplets of a hydrophilic solution containing the cells and the material to be delivered are first generated in a hydrophobic solution such as oil, and then, the droplets pass through a channel section (a compression hole or the bottleneck section) where the diameter decreases to deliver the material into the cells.
