For example, manufacturing environments use data to control aspects of the manufacturing process. For example, crops may be grown in a fully controlled environment warehouse. Sensors may be used to supply extensive data on the crops. The sensors may generate data describing biomass, moisture levels, light exposure, and the like. Data from these sensors can be used to control the use of water, light, and electricity and thereby optimize crop output.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Even though the environment can be controlled, human, technological, and biological idiosyncrasies may lead to variance in crop production. Further, even though sensor data can be used to monitor and manage crop production, the data that drives crop production, or manufacturing processes, are disconnected from business decisions such as marketing decisions and investment decisions.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to describe the manner in which at least some of the advantages and features of the invention may be obtained, a more particular description of embodiments of the invention will be rendered by reference to specific embodiments thereof which are illustrated in the appended drawings.

More particularly, at least some embodiments of the invention relate to systems, hardware, software, computer-readable media, and methods for data driven data management operations including business spend operations, manufacturing actuation operations, early-warning data informed operations, or the like.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As used herein, manufacturing is broad and relates to goods, services, biological, and/or other areas of production or other environments. In general, example embodiments of the invention receive input related to manufacturing, changes in production (production variability), local events and/or global events. Manufacturing is intended to encompass, by way of example only and not limitation, agriculture in controlled environments, bioengineering environments, goods, energy production and energy use, smart cities, other sensor enabled environments, and the like. Embodiments of the invention are configured such that this input informs business operations including marketing and investment operations in addition to controlling manufacturing or environment processes.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">For example, data from sensors in a manufacturing environment that is used for controlling manufacturing processes also serves as input to trigger or inform business decisions. The decisions can account for cost structures to ensure that automated investments are in the best interest of the organization. For example, a business may regularly purchase advertisements or marketing for a specific crop. If data from the sensors indicate that the crop will be above average, embodiments of the invention may allow or cause automated marketing investments to change. An increased supply may allow a manufacture to increase sales and revenue and to better control marketing spend. Conventionally, early detection of a bumper crop is disconnected from marketing spend. Embodiments of the invention thus link the data used to inform or control manufacturing processes to inform business decisions.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Embodiments of the invention link an understanding of manufacturing or production data (e.g., sensor data) to business spend to decrease waste, optimize revenue, and the like. The data management operations can use sensor data meant for monitoring manufacturing to act as an early warning to trigger business decisions.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">For example, an entity may grow food in a fully controlled environment. Sensors provide extensive data on crop growth and may be used to monitor or measure electricity use, plant grown, light levels, moisture levels, water usage, temperature, humidity, cultivation schedules, and the like. Extensive work is performed in an effort to control all aspects of the environment and ensure predictable crop rates and production. Embodiments of the invention allow business decision making operations to be performed. By way of example only, the sensor data can be analyzed to determine whether crops are stagnating, under producing, or overproducing. The early detection of excess or lean production can be used to trigger marketing or sales decisions. This allows a business to direct resources in a manner that accounts for the expected crops before the crops are ready for harvest. This allows a business to prepare for or adapt resource allocation, distribution, market locations, and the like early in the manufacturing process.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Embodiments of the invention may also use external input. For example, many businesses are impacted by events such natural disasters or unexpected weather, festivals, or other events that may have an impact (positive or negative) on a product being manufactured even when these events occur remotely with respect to the business. A late freeze or other event in one location, may have an impact on the market as a whole or in other locations or in locations relevant to the business. Embodiments of the invention use, as input, external information about natural disasters, projected weather patterns, festivals, other events that may influence production or consumption or the like to drive business decisions.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A disaster that impacts avocados produced by a competitor or in another geographic location may be used to direct resources to avocado growth. This event could influence revenue, pricing, marketing or the like. Using data relevant to the event as an early warning or indicator of future conditions allows businesses to take advantage of or reduce the impact of these external events. In addition to influencing business decisions such as marketing and spend decisions, the impact that these types of events may have on sales/production/availability can be used to perform operations in the manufacturing environment to increase or decrease yield, conserve or use resources, or the like. Embodiments of the invention allow an entity to prevent or reduce the investment in unsellable goods due to, for example, over production, low demand, or missed revenue opportunities. Similarly, external events may be used to increase production or further optimize production, change distribution plans, change marketing plans and spend, adjust budgets, or the like or combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Conventional mechanisms for business decisions such as marketing spend reside in marketing solutions such as adwords, clickfunnels, and other enterprise tools. Embodiments of the invention, however, link the processes, tools, and data used to measure manufacturing processes to business decisions including marketing and sales.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Many manufacturing environments have actuation capabilities that can increase/decrease production. In crop manufacturing, for example, the yield can be increased using heat/moisture or stopped by cutting electricity. Increasing or decreasing production has an associated cost. Embodiments of the invention allow input to drive business decisions and/or allow manufacturing actuations to be performed. For example, an environmental event that impact the production of avocados may allow a business that has avocados to take business actions and/or manufacturing operations. The environmental event may drive a decision to increase marketing spend and/or manufacturing operations to optimize crop production.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Embodiments of the invention can incorporate information relating to external events that have an economic impact into immediate actuation. Embodiments of the invention provide a link between external events, anticipated events, and actuation.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Embodiments of the invention provide a data management platform that associates sensor data, manufacturing data, business cost and spend data, business process data, and secondary sources. This data can be tagged or labeled with tags. Rules can be operated with respect to the tags. A rules engine may store various definitions including tag values and business decisions related to the detected tags. The rules engine may also define triggers based on the tags or their values. Example decisions may include increasing/decreasing controlled demand, budget allocation, production spend, marketing spend, process decisions, or the like.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> discloses aspects of a data management system. The data management system <b>100</b> is configured to identify information that may be related to or that may impact production and trigger business decision points to divert or adjust spending and/or to trigger manufacturing actuations.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">More specifically, the data management system <b>100</b> integrates the processes, tools, and data used in manufacturing processes into business decisions. The data management system allows business decisions to be based on factors that may impact production or create production variability.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The data management platform <b>100</b> integrates manufacturing processes <b>120</b> with a rules platform <b>122</b>. The rules platform <b>122</b> allows the information used in or generated in the manufacturing processes <b>120</b>, external events, secondary applications, and other sources of data to influence the manufacturing processes <b>120</b>. The rules platform <b>122</b> enables business decisions to be implemented earlier, thereby optimizing an entity's operations and business decisions including production, marketing, and sales decisions.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one example, the data management platform <b>100</b>, which may be implemented in or connected to a manufacturing environment, may include or have access to sensors <b>102</b>. The sensors <b>102</b> deployed in the manufacturing environment may depend on the purpose of the environment. An agriculture manufacturing environment, for example, may include sensors to detect light, heat, humidity, temperature, biomass, growth rates, cameras, and other sensors related to the crop production. Some of this information may be generated by processing sensor output. A environment manufacturing goods may include different collections of sensors that relate to the good being produced or the machines producing the goods.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The manufacturing processes <b>120</b> often begin by ingesting data from sensors <b>102</b> into an analytics platform <b>104</b>. The analytics platform <b>104</b> uses to data to implement manufacturing actuation <b>106</b>. For example, the data from the sensors may indicate that crop growth has slowed, or that soil is too dry, or that the temperature has dropped. This information is used to alter the manufacturing operations. For example, additional water may be used for irrigation, the temperature may be increased, light may be increased, or the like. Generally, the manufacturing actuation <b>106</b> is performed to optimize production.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The manufacturing processes <b>120</b>, by themselves, are conventionally disconnected from sales, marketing, and other spend decisions. Stated differently, in conventional environments, there is a significant time delay before data related to manufacturing or that may impact manufacturing is accounted for in production reports, sales decisions, marking decisions, increased/decreased spend, and the like.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The rules platform <b>122</b> is configured to reduce this delay and allows business decisions and/or manufacturing actuation <b>106</b> to be implemented more quickly or earlier compared to conventional systems. This allows data that may impact production (of the manufacturer and/or other manufacturers) to be acted on earlier. This allows resources to be used more effectively, allows actions to be taken to increase/decrease production, account for market changes, and the like. This also facilitates business decision such as marketing spend or investment spend, budget allocation, and the like.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In this example, data from the sensors <b>102</b> is also ingested into or input into a metadata engine <b>110</b> of a rules platform <b>122</b>. The metadata engine <b>110</b> is configured to create tags for the ingested data. Stated differently, metadata tag or label generation includes generating data content labels (referred to herein as tags). For example, information from a thermometer may be tagged with a various tags including a value tag for the measured temperature, a location tag for the location of the sensor (e.g., row, room building, city). The metadata engine <b>110</b> may collect data over time such that metadata tags can be generated for time series data and the like.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In another example, in an agriculture manufacturing environment (e.g., growing crops), growth rates from lettuce may be tagged as with a value tag, crop type or variety tag, location tag, and the like. The rule-based tagging can account for origin of the sensor data, location of the sensor data, type or species of crop, date planted time of day, and the like or combination thereof. The values of the data can also be tagged. By tagging data, rules can be executed on the tags. For example, a rule may look for temperature values from a particular location that are outside of a predefined range. From a manufacturing perspective, this may allow the manufacturing processes <b>120</b> to determine that the temperature needed for optimal growth needs to be adjusted. The tags generated and applied to the data from the sensors <b>102</b> can vary and can be determined by the manufacturer or set by default. Each sensor may be associated with tags that may be populated in the metadata engine <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The rules engine <b>112</b> may execute rules on the tags. Thus, the tags can be used to detect when the metadata or data from the sensors <b>102</b> meets a rule or a rule specification. This may be a detection of a specific value, a set of values, values within/without a range, variation in values from expected values, or the like. The rules engine <b>112</b> may also perform processing in the context of executing rules. For example, the rules engine <b>112</b> determine a percent variation from the detected value or from a determined or desired value. If the percent variation is a decrease in production and by way of example only, the rule may cause an automated notification to be generated to decrease marketing spend. Thus, the rules engine <b>114</b> can have an impact on business decisions. In addition, the rules engine <b>112</b> may also include rules that are configured to cause manufacturing actuations <b>106</b>. Advantageously, business decisions and manufacturing actuations can be implemented jointly.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The rules engine <b>112</b> may also receive input from secondary applications such as manufacturing and marketing applications. The rules engine <b>112</b> may also detect variance in data from secondary applications <b>114</b>. The rules engine <b>112</b> may also perform external event correlation <b>116</b>. Using application programming interfaces (APIs) or other connectivity, the external event correlation may be able to receive input related to and analyze external events <b>118</b>. For example, the external event correlation <b>116</b> may connect or periodically access a weather database, databases or websites with information that may be relevant to or related to the manufacturing being performed. For example, if avocados are being manufactured, the external events <b>118</b> may include weather or disaster-based resources (e.g., weather forecasts, event impact reporting), websites related to areas where demand is increasing/decreasing, information on events such as festivals that may impact the manufactured produce, or other data sources including a history of supply and demand, or the like.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">These inputs can be used to perform manufacturing actuation <b>106</b> and/or business actuation <b>124</b>. Business actuation <b>124</b> may include notifications regarding spend recommendations (increase/decrease marketing, increase/decrease asset investment, etc.). Manufacturing actuation <b>106</b> may include adjusting production to account for the impact or the potential impact represented by the data from the external events, the sensors <b>102</b>, and/or the secondary applications <b>114</b>. Embodiments are able to be implemented quickly in response to the input to the rules platform <b>122</b> or, more specifically, to the rules engine <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> discloses aspects of a method for performing data driven business actuation. In example, event detection <b>202</b> and metadata detection <b>204</b> are performed. Event detection <b>202</b> may include monitoring external events that may impact production. As previously stated, weather events, disasters, strikes, drought, festivals, demographics, and the like are examples of events or data that may influence business decisions. For example, a geographic area may be monitored for extreme frost, which would impact lettuce production. When this event is detected during a competitive growing season, an early notification to manufacturing to increase lettuce production to accommodate crop shortages may be issued. This may also benefit from higher market pricing, due to the shortage, and increase revenue.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">If an event is an event that impacts distribution, the distribution impact may be assessed. For example, a blizzard (or an anticipated blizzard) may impact a geographical area and result in spoiled or unconsumed goods and lost revenue. The cost/value of rerouting perishable goods to another consumption location when the event is detected or anticipated can be evaluated and a decision can be made regarding whether to revise product distribution. This may allow better pricing to be acquired before competitors can detect a challenge or prevent goods from spoiling, thereby avoiding waste and lost revenue. The event detection <b>202</b> may use event learning engines models such that notifications or business actuations are improved training a model with past events.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one example, the content labeling may be performed on the detected events and other inputs. Next, rules are executed <b>206</b> by a rules engine on the labeled data or on the tags. Notification and/or process triggering <b>208</b> is performed based on the rule execution. For example, in the case of extreme frost, the notification or process triggering may include a business actuation to increase marketing in other areas, to reroute crops to the affected areas, to change pricing, to invest in additional plantings, or the like. The notification or process may also trigger a manufacturing actuation such as increasing crop output. Events such as a bumper crop may result in a business actuation to reduce or stop production if economical, to reduce spending, to seek other markets, or the like.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> discloses aspects of data management and data management operations. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrates manufacturing processes such as generating <b>250</b> sensor data, providing an analytics platform <b>252</b> to receive the data generated by the sensors and generate an output than triggers manufacturing actuation <b>254</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> further illustrates aspects of linking the sensor input (and other input) to business decisions.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The generated sensor data <b>202</b> is ingested by a pipeline <b>209</b>. As the ingested data from the sensors in the pipeline <b>209</b> enters the control plane <b>210</b>, tags can be generated <b>212</b> and assigned to the data being ingested. The rules engine may perform metadata detection <b>214</b> and detect an output variation <b>216</b>. Other outputs may depend on the rules executed against the input. Thus, the output variation detected by the rules engine depends on the rule. Next, the percentage of variation is determined <b>218</b> in one example.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">More generally, one or more rules may be executed on the tags. These rules may generate a percentage variance <b>218</b>. The rules may also generate other outputs. and a cost analysis <b>220</b> may be performed based on the variance <b>218</b> or other outputs. The cost analysis <b>220</b> may be based on the rule. For example, the data from the sensors may indicate that that the production expected (based on weight or other factors) from a certain crop is 50% below normal. This may be based on expected growth, comparisons with previous crops, or the like. As a result a cost analysis <b>220</b> is performed to determine whether the cost of bringing the crop to harvest is profitable <b>224</b> or not profitable <b>222</b>. If profitable <b>224</b>, production triggers <b>226</b> may generate reports to sales or marketing such that these departments can make decisions based on the expected crop, which is below normal in this example. In addition, this may generate updates to manually or automatically update spending for advertisements and sales channels.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">If not profitable <b>222</b>, this may result in output to manufacturing actuation <b>206</b>, which may cease operation with respect to the crop and incur no further expense. As a result, the early indicator can provide information to take actions to achieve savings or that may increase revenue.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In another example, the event correlation engine <b>232</b> may indicate, for the crop that is expected to under produce, that an event at another location has destroyed the same crop. As a result, a 50% crop becomes more valuable to the manufacturer and the business decision may be different when more information is considered. In this instance, it may be more beneficial to devote more resources to the crop and to increase marketing. The event correlation engine <b>232</b> allows the rules engine <b>230</b> to consider external events (e.g., weather patterns, festivals, competitor announcements, crop expectations, expected demand, market conditions) that may impact decision making. Embodiments of the invention can more quickly adapt to these conditions.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The event correlation engine <b>232</b> may include an impact assessment engine <b>234</b> and an event learning engine <b>236</b>. The impact assessment engine <b>232</b> may be a model configured to correlate the impact of an event to accuracy. The impact learning engine <b>236</b> is configured to perform actual outage monitoring and to provide feedback to improve learning.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> discloses aspects of event correlation. The method <b>300</b> may initially begin by detecting <b>302</b> an event. For example, the event correlation engine may receive event data via an API. Once the event is detected, a geographic filter <b>304</b> is performed. The geographic filter may determine whether the event could impact any location relevant to the business. The method <b>300</b> continues if any relevant location is identified and a threat assessment <b>306</b> is performed. The threat assessment <b>306</b> may identify the nature of the event (e.g., destructive (e.g., freeze) or productive (e.g., festival). The radius or geographic impact of the event and a time frame may also be determined.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The event correlation engine may have a database that stores events. Events may be associated with metadata including type, severity, impact potential, and the like. Thus, an entry may be created for a new event and could be compared to previous similar events. Secondary sources may be used for correlation where available. Thus, a threat assessment <b>306</b> is performed.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">For each area of impact, an impact analysis <b>308</b> may be performed. This may include determining a potential consumption impact assessment. For example, the assessment may determine whether rerouting is required, whether routing or distribution capability is available, the time to move and the cost to move the product. This allows a cost analysis to be performed in view of the event.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">A potential production impact assessment may also be performed. The cost of production, the time to production, the cost to manufacture is evaluated, and the consumption distribution is evaluated. This allows a cost/opportunity analysis to be performed.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The method <b>300</b> then may perform a threshold monitoring <b>310</b>. If the threshold, time, cost analysis does not meet requirements, an audit record is generated <b>312</b>. If the event does not occur, no action <b>314</b> is taken. If the threshold, time, and cost analysis satisfy requirements, notifications <b>312</b> are triggered. For example, a change in production is estimated to increase sales by 9%. If the threshold is 10%, no actuation is triggered. If a planned festival is estimated to increase sales by 10%, this is over a 10% threshold and results in potential business actuation (e.g., an increase in social media spending to target event attendees) or potential manufacturing actuation (increasing production on item to be sold at the event).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The thresholds evaluated can vary. From a cost analysis perspective, the inputs may need to impact sales by 10% before an actuation is triggered. However, the threshold could also be set with respect to other factors such as geography. If an event, for example, impacts a certain percentage of land used to grow a particular product, then an actuation may be initiated. However, the threshold is typically set with respect to spend, cost, sales, revenue, profit, or the like or combination thereof. If the input (sensor input, event input, etc.) suggests that one of these factors is expected to change by more than a threshold value, actuations may be initiated.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Thus, embodiments of the invention allow events (and potential events) to serve as early warnings to trigger or initiate business decisions. Anticipating the cost (e.g., revenue, loss, opportunity) to be evaluated early (e.g., before an event occurs or when the event occurs) allows an entity to reduce or minimize losses, change spending for marketing, sales, and other business costs, change budget allocations, allocate resources, reconfigured distributions, and the like. An entity may also be able to initiate manufacturing actuations. This may include ceasing or reducing production, which can prevent further costs from being incurred. This may also include attempting to optimize existing production or increase production. These decisions are informed by data driven information from various sources including manufacturing data, event data, secondary application data, and the like or combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> discloses aspects of an event correlation engine or portion thereof. The system <b>400</b> may evaluate an event to determine a similarity correlation <b>402</b>. The system <b>400</b> may perform the similarity correlation <b>402</b> by be performed based on event source <b>404</b>. This may include evaluating a probability <b>406</b> of the severity. The event may be required to satisfy a threshold probability before action is taken. The impact type <b>408</b> is also determined. The impact type may identify a radius of impact and an estimation of the time to impact from the initial alert. The ability to make business decisions with more lead time may lead to better results. The event source <b>404</b> may also be evaluated in terms of a past event <b>410</b>. For example, how did the probability change over time and what was the actual outcome of the past event <b>410</b>. These aspects can be executed as a loop of continuous improvement such that the event correlation engine can continually improve.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one example, the event correlation engine <b>400</b> may learn such that events can be identified more and more in advance. This can provide a competitive advantage as business spend can be adjusted earlier and the business can have more time to implement any execution actions such as preparing for production, preparing for distribution, securing distribution routes, identifying markets for distribution, and the like.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The similarity correlation <b>402</b> may also include a proactive active dictionary <b>412</b> that associates event type with source thresholds and probabilities. For example, proactive actions are identified based on event thresholds. If an event crosses a threshold such as a severity threshold, a geographic area threshold, a revenue threshold, a sales threshold, a loss threshold, or the like, actions can be predefined or recommended. Actions <b>416</b> can also be identified by threshold and by priority. Thus, depending on the threshold and/or the priority, actions can be recommended. For example, actuations with respect to crops that have a short growing season may have a higher priority than crops with a longer growing season. Planting schedules, combined with event timing or expected event timing, may be used to prioritize actuations. Actuations may impact the business as a whole or be targeted to specific products (e.g., specific crops).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The recommended threshold correlation <b>418</b> may be evaluated across thresholds. If an event is critical, an action may be initiated. These thresholds and actions can be evaluated based on past events. In this example, a loop of improvement may also be implemented such that accuracy improves over time.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In generally, the event correlation engine may have a database of dictionary that stores information about past events and their outcomes. When a new event is identified, information may be gathered and a model may be able to generate an inference based on the model, which was trained on past events and past outcomes. The inference or prediction may be a notification to perform a particular business action. The model can be configured to generate various inferences based on the event.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Generally, embodiments of the invention receive input from events and/or related to anticipated events, manufacturing sensors, and other secondary sources to inform business decisions.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The following is a discussion of aspects of example operating environments for various embodiments of the invention.
