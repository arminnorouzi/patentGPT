As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the puller is composed of two parts, which are a claw <b>11</b> and a clamp <b>12</b>. The claw <b>11</b> is of split type and includes two sub-claws. Opposite faces of the two sub-claws are provided with threads. The clamp <b>12</b> is configured to tightly hold the two sub-claws together. In using, the puller <b>1</b> is closed and placed into the valve seat, and then the leading screw <b>3</b> is screwed into the threads of the claw of the puller. In the process of screwing in the leading screw, the two sub-claws in the puller are gradually opened, so that a flanging <b>111</b> of the sub-claw of the puller is clamped onto a lower end face of the valve seat <b>5</b>. The hydraulic driving device <b>2</b> pulls the leading screw <b>4</b> to move upwards, thus driving the valve seat <b>5</b> to be pulled out of a valve box <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The inventors of the present disclosure found that, when using the above-mentioned pulling tool, there are the following shortcomings or deficiencies:</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">(i), the claw of the puller consists of two parts which have a large gap there-between and cannot form a complete circle. Therefore, in using, the threads inside the claw may be stuck, which makes it difficult to screw in the leading screw. In the process of operation, if it is difficult to screw in the leading screw, the number of the threads engaged between the leading screw and the puller is very small. In such case, pulling the valve seat will cause serious damages to the leading screw and the threads in the puller so that the puller cannot be used any longer.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">(ii), an inner diameter of an inner hole of the valve seat is fixed, and thus the flanging at the lower end of the claw of the puller cannot be thickened. This is because thickening the flanging will make it unable to place the puller into the inner hole of the valve seat. When the valve seat is pulled by using the claw with the above structure, it is easy for the tool to be damaged due to a breakage of the flanging, so the service life of the puller is short.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a puller, a claw, and a usage method of the puller.

In the embodiment of the present disclosure, because the size of the pulling part in the second direction y is smaller than or equal to that of the second notch part <b>712</b><i>c </i>in the second direction y, one claw can be placed into the inner hole of the valve seat to be pulled through the second notch part of the other claw under the circumstance that the other claw has been placed in the inner hole of the valve seat. Then the limiting parts of the two claws are aligned, a leading screw is inserted between the two claws to push apart the pulling parts of the two claws and is engaged with the pulling parts through threads. Finally, the valve seat to be taken out is taken out through an upward movement of the leading screw. In this way, the two claws of the embodiment of the present disclosure are respectively placed in the valve seat without a clamp, and the two claws are convenient to be disassembled and assembled with lower cost. Moreover, the limiting parts of the two claws are abutted against the upper end face of the valve seat to implement achieve a limiting function, so that the random engagement of the threads can be avoided. Additionally, because the size of the pulling part in the second direction is smaller than or equal to that of the second notch part in the second direction, the pulling part can be installed vertically and downwardly, so that it can be made thicker, thereby improving the strength of the pulling part, reducing the risk of breakage and greatly prolonging the service life.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b><i>a </i></figref>illustrates the case where the size of the pulling part <b>711</b> in the second direction y is equal to the size of the second notch part <b>712</b><i>c </i>in the second direction y.

For example, a radius of the circle formed by the circular arcs of the two first notch parts is greater than or equal to a radius of the cross section of the leading screw. For example, the shape of the second notch part of the claw in the embodiment of the present disclosure may be a rectangle, so that one claw having a limiting part whose size in the second direction y is smaller than that of the second notch part of the other claw can pass through the second notch part of the other claw so as to be assembled with the other claw under the circumstance that the other claw has been arranged in the inner hole of the valve seat.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the shape of the second notch part may be a first rectangle.
