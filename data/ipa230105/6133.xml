for manufacturing the display device according to this embodiment.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the method for manufacturing the display device according to this embodiment, a thin-film-transistor layer <b>2</b> is formed on a substrate <b>4</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>. Specifically, on the substrate <b>4</b>, a control electrode CE, an inorganic insulating film <b>16</b>, a semiconductor layer <b>12</b>, conductive electrodes Dx and Dy, and an interlayer insulating film <b>21</b> are formed in the stated order. The control electrode CE functions as a gate electrode. The inorganic insulating film <b>16</b> functions as a gate insulating film. One of the conductive electrodes Dx and Dy functions as a source electrode, and the other as a drain electrode.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The substrate <b>4</b> can be made of either a glass substrate, or a flexible base material containing, as chief component, such a resin as polyimide. The substrate <b>4</b> may have an upper face covered with a barrier film (e.g. silicon nitride and silicon oxide) to block such foreign objects as water and oxygen.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Each of the control electrode CE and the conductive electrodes Dx and Dy is a. monolayer metal film made of at least one of such metals as, for example, aluminum, tungsten, molybdenum, tantalum, chromium, titanium, and copper. Alternatively, each electrode is a multilayer metal film made of these metals. The inorganic insulating film <b>16</b> can be either, for example, a silicon oxide film or a silicon nitride film. Alternatively, the inorganic insulating film <b>16</b> can be a multilayer film including these films. The semiconductor layer PS is formed of, for example, oxide semiconductor and low-temperature polysilicon (LIPS). The interlayer insulating film <b>21</b> is made of such applicable organic materials as polyimide, acrylic resin, and epoxy resin. Such materials have a planarization effect. These resins may be photosensitive.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">After that, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, the interlayer insulating film <b>21</b> undergoes an ashing process, and the conductive electrodes Dx and Dy are exposed.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">At Step S<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>, a metal mask Mf is disposed in contact with the interlayer insulating film <b>21</b>, in order to expose the conductive electrode Dx and shield the conductive electrode Dy. A first lower electrode F<b>1</b> is formed by such techniques as sputtering, vapor deposition, and coating. The first lower electrode F<b>1</b>, which reflects light, is a multilayer stack of, for example, indium tin oxide (ITO) and either silver (Ag) or an alloy containing Ag. The first lower electrode F<b>1</b> may be made of such materials as <b>120</b>, Al, and Mg. After the first lower electrode F<b>1</b> is deposited, the metal mask Mf is removed. Note that, instead of disposing the metal mask Mf, a resist pattern may be formed by photolithography.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">After that, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(<i>d</i>)</figref>, a planarization film <b>23</b> is deposited to cover the first lower electrode F<b>1</b>. The planarization film <b>23</b> can be made of, for example, applicable organic materials such as polyimide, acrylic resin, and epoxy resin. The thickness of the planarization film <b>23</b> on the first lower electrode F<b>1</b> is equal to the sum of the thicknesses of a first lower functional layer and a first light-emitting layer to be described later.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">At Step S<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(<i>e</i>)</figref>, the planarization film <b>23</b> undergoes an ashing process using a metal mask Ms, and a recess H<b>1</b> is formed to overlap the first lower electrode F<b>1</b>. The ashing process is carried out until the first lower electrode F<b>1</b> is exposed. Hence, an edge portion of the first lower electrode F<b>1</b> is covered with the planarization film <b>23</b>, and a non-edge portion of the first lower electrode F<b>1</b> is exposed. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(<i>e</i>)</figref>, the recess H<b>1</b> does not overlap a channel portion of the semiconductor layer <b>12</b> because planarization is important. However, the recess H<b>1</b> shall not be limited to such a configuration. For example, if high definition is requested, the first lower electrode F<b>1</b> and the recess H<b>1</b> may overlap the channel portion of the semiconductor layer <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">At Step S<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>, while the metal mask Ms is disposed, a first lower functional layer U<b>1</b> is formed in the first recess H<b>1</b> to have a thickness lower than a depth Hd of the first recess H<b>1</b>. The first lower functional layer U<b>1</b> can be formed by such techniques as sputtering, vapor deposition, and coating.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The first lower functional layer U<b>1</b> includes at least a carrier transport layer. Examples of materials to form the carrier transport layer as a hole-transport layer include: such oxides as Cr, Ni, Mg, Mo, W, and La; a H-VI semiconductor compound that is p-type doped or a III-V semiconductor compound that is p-type doped; and an inorganic substance or an organic substance that transports holes. Examples of materials to form the carrier transport layer as an electron-transport layer include ZnO, MgO, ZnMgO, TiO<sub>2</sub>, MoO<sub>3</sub>, WO<sub>3</sub>, and a II-VI semiconductor compound that is n-type doped, or a III-V semiconductor compound that is n-type doped. Note that the electron-transport layer has a thickness of preferably 200 nm or less. This is because if the thickness exceeds 200 nm, a series resistance component becomes too large to ignore.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The first lower functional layer U<b>1</b> may include a carrier injection layer in addition to the carrier transport layer. A work function of the carrier injection layer is preferably greater than, or equal to, a work function of the first lower electrode F<b>1</b>. The work function (or an ionization potential) of the carrier injection layer is smaller than, or equal to, an ionization potential of the carrier transport layer. Such a carrier injection layer allows efficient injection of carriers from the first lower electrode F<b>1</b> into the carrier transport layer. Note that, instead of disposing the metal mask Ms, a resist pattern may be formed by photolithography.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Then, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, after the first lower electrode F<b>1</b> is deposited, the metal mask Ms is removed. A step height between an upper face of the planarization film <b>23</b> and an upper face of the first lower functional layer U<b>1</b> defines a thickness of a first light-emitting layer to be described later. This step height is determined by the depth Hd of the first recess H<b>1</b> and the thickness of the first lower functional layer U<b>1</b>. The depth Hd of the first recess H<b>1</b> can be controlled by a time period of the ashing process that the planarization film <b>23</b> undergoes. The thickness of the first lower functional layer U<b>1</b> can be controlled highly precisely by a deposition condition or a deposition rate. if the first lower functional layer U<b>1</b> is deposited by, for example, sputtering, a deposition rate of approximately 20 nm/20 min can be easily achieved. When the deposition rate is controlled by seconds, the thickness of the layer can be controlled on the order of 0.1 nm without introducing a special technique.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">At Step S<b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>d</i>)</figref>, a first screen SC<b>1</b>, which has an opening K<b>1</b> corresponding to the first recess H<b>1</b>, is disposed in contact with the planarization film <b>23</b> so that the opening K<b>1</b> overlaps the first recess. The first screen SCI and the first lower functional layer U<b>1</b> are coated with an ink containing quantum dots (a first light-emitting layer E<b>1</b> in liquid form). Hence, a remaining portion of the first recess H<b>1</b> (a portion without the first lower functional layer U<b>1</b>) and the opening K<b>1</b> are filled with the ink (the first light-emitting layer E<b>1</b> in liquid form).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The opening K<b>1</b> of the first screen SC<b>11</b> is sized to preferably contain therein the first recess H<b>1</b> in plan view. If the opening K<b>1</b> is as large as the first recess H<b>1</b>, the ink might be scraped out of the first recess H<b>1</b> in a squeegeeing process that follows. This problem occurs because, when the squeegee moves, stress concentrates on an end portion of the opening K<b>1</b> of the first screen SC<b>1</b>. The problem can be solved when the opening K<b>1</b> where the stress concentrates is separated from the first recess H<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">After that, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>, a squeegee SK is slid in contact with the first screen SC<b>1</b> to squeegee the ink (the first light-emitting layer E<b>1</b>). Hence, the ink in the opening of the first screen SC <b>1</b> stays, while the ink on the top of the first screen is removed. After the squeegeeing, the first screen SC<b>1</b> is removed as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The ink is made of a solvent in which the quantum dots are dispersed. Thus, when the squeegee SK strokes the first screen SC<b>1</b>, the ink might be removed by dilatancy. To prevent the ink from being removed, a particle volume concentration; that is, a proportion of the total volume of the quantum dots contained in the ink per unit volume, is desirably 45% or less, a viscosity of the ink is preferably 500 Pa&#xb7;sec or below, and a speed of the stroke is preferably 10 m/sec or slower.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref> schematically show how dilatancy works for the ink containing quantum dots <b>31</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a graph illustrating a relationship between shear rate and ink viscosity. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> illustrates a state of the ink applied to the screen The ink includes a solvent <b>32</b> containing the quantum dots <b>31</b>. When the squeegee strokes the screen, shearing force acts on the ink. Hence, the quantum dots <b>31</b> move away, and are immediately spaced apart, from one another. Hence, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, the increasing space between the quantum dots <b>31</b> leaves a region <b>33</b> creating a negative pressure among the quantum dots <b>31</b>. Because of the negative pressure among the quantum dots <b>31</b>, the solvent <b>32</b> around the quantum dots <b>31</b> is sucked into the space between the quantum dots <b>31</b>. Accordingly, the ink loses its fluidity. When the ink loses its fluidity and becomes adhesive, the ink forms a lump. Hence, the light-emitting layer is delaminated. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> a limitation of the dilatancy depends on the ink viscosity, the particle volume concentration, and the shear rate. As long as the limitation of the dilatancy is within the area of the hatching, the delamination of the light-emitting layer can be mostly prevented.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Note that a degree of the adhesiveness varies depending on the particle volume concentration of the ink. The ink is fused with the printing surface by an anchor effect due to microtexturing on the printing surface, and by electrostatic adsorption due to the van der Waals force. If the particle volume concentration of the ink is small, the fusion strength is greater than the adhesiveness.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">After that, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>, the squeegee SK is slid in contact with the planarization film <b>23</b> to squeegee the first light-emitting layer E<b>1</b> again. Here, a region where no first light-emitting layer E<b>1</b> is found is all flat, and the squeegee can stroke as does so on the screen. Hence, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>(<i>d</i>)</figref>, a portion of the first light-emitting layer E<b>1</b> remains in the first recess H<b>1</b>, and the rest of the first light-emitting layer E<b>1</b> is removed.

Hence, a light-emitting element X is formed to include the first lower electrode F<b>1</b>, the first lower functional layer U<b>1</b>, the first light-emitting layer E<b>1</b>, the first upper functional layer J<b>1</b>, and the upper electrode <b>25</b>. The upper electrode <b>25</b> is a metal thin film made of, for example, an alloy of magnesium and silver, and is transparent to light.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The light-emitting element X is a quantum-dot light-emitting diode (QLED) including the first light-emitting layer E<b>1</b> containing quantum dots. Holes and electrons recombine together in the first light-emitting layer E<b>1</b> by a drive current between the first lower electrode F<b>1</b> and the upper electrode <b>25</b>, which forms an excitors. While the excitors transforms from the conduction band level to the valence band level of the quantum dots, light is released. Note that the first lower electrode F<b>1</b> may act as an anode. The upper electrode <b>25</b> may act as a cathode. The first lower functional layer U<b>1</b> may be made of a material at least transporting the holes. The first lower electrode F<b>1</b> may act as a cathode. The upper electrode <b>25</b> may act as an anode. The first lower functional layer U<b>1</b> may be made of a material at least transporting the: electrons.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In this embodiment, the depth Hd of the first recess formed in the planarization film <b>23</b> and the film thickness of the first lower functional layer U<b>1</b> can define the thickness of the first light-emitting layer E<b>1</b>. Such a feature makes it possible to form the light-emitting layer thinner than the screen, which has been impossible by screen printing.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The thickness of the screen is limited by mechanical strength required for printing, materials, and pixel sizes. Hence, the screen cannot be as thin as, or thinner than, approximately 500 &#x3bc;m. Hence, a conventional screen printing technique cannot form a light-emitting layer thinner than approximately 500 &#x3bc;m. if the light-emitting layer has a thickness of approximately 500 &#x3bc;m, carriers to be injected are neither uniform nor highly dense across the thickness. Consequently, the light emission efficiency cannot increase.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Moreover, this embodiment eliminates the need of a vacuuming process to be used for a conventional light-emitting element manufacturing method. Such a feature can reduce the costs of, and the time for, manufacturing a light-emitting element.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Furthermore, the ink removed by the squeegeeing is recovered and reused. Such a feature makes it possible to use an expensive light-emitting material economically and efficiently. In addition, the surface of the first screen SCI is provided with liquid repellent finishing. Such a feature can increase efficiency in recovery of the ink. A technique to provide the liquid repellent finishing may involve, for example, processing the surface of the first screen SC<b>1</b> with fluorine to decrease chemical activity.
