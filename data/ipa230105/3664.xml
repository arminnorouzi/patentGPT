FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an inspection method for inspecting containers such as bottles and an inspection apparatus for inspecting containers such as bottles.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Inspection methods and inspection apparatuses are sufficiently known from prior art. These inspection apparatuses typically comprise one or more inspection devices, such as cameras, which can record images of containers moved past them. It is known, for example, to record a side view of the container and/or a bottom view of the container and/or a view of the mouth of the container in order to be able to detect any fouling of the container or even damage before the container is supplied to further treatment steps. On the one hand, this can be advantageous in the manufacture of the containers, but on the other hand, it can also provide advantages when recycling containers that have already been used. In the case of newly manufactured containers, it can thus be ensured that undesirable malfunction does not occur in the manufacturing process of the container. When recycling containers, it can be ensured that the containers are still intact and/or are not contaminated with fouling that is difficult or impossible to remove (e.g. corks or the like that have dropped in).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Determining whether such fouling is present is typically done by comparing the recorded image with a reference image. The reference image typically represents the undamaged and/or non-contaminated container or a relevant part of the container (mouth, base, etc.).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">While this comparison typically produces good results for the individual container, it is subject to systemic weaknesses. For example, if the camera lens is dirty or fogged up, then the same fouling can be indicated for a series of consecutive containers, or fouling may not be detected at all.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to eliminate these problems, test containers are typically passed through the inspection apparatus at regular intervals and the images of these test containers recorded are compared with reference images. For this purpose, the test containers have fouling applied to them, for example, at certain points. If this is not detected or if &#x201c;fouling&#x201d; is additionally detected at other points, then this indicates that the inspection device is not operating properly. In addition, there are safety mechanisms that, in the event that the same &#x201c;fault&#x201d; (e.g. fouling at the same spot) is discovered for a series of consecutive containers, information is output that the inspection device probably has a fault or even that the inspection apparatus is caused to halt.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">While these methods generally provide good results when inspecting the containers, the use of test containers involves considerable effort for detecting any faults in the inspection device. In addition, there is the possibility that a number of containers that have not been properly inspected will either be treated as undamaged or are incorrectly sorted out.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="2">Object</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Proceeding from the known prior art, the technical object to be satisfied is therefore to specify an inspection method and an inspection apparatus for inspecting containers with which reliable inspection of the containers and reliable detection of faults in the inspection device are made possible.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="2">Solution</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the invention, this object is satisfied by an inspection method and an inspection apparatus.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The inspection method according to the invention for inspecting containers, such as bottles, comprises that an image of a container moved past an inspection device be recorded by an inspection device and the recorded image be compared with a reference image, where the reference image is formed from a number of previously recorded images of containers moved past the inspection device, and it is determined in dependence of the comparison of the recorded image with the reference image whether the inspection device is operational.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The reference image is therefore determined from the images previously recorded. If a newly recorded image deviates from the reference image (e.g. due to the inspection device being fogged up unintentionally), this can thus be detected. At the same time, the use of test containers is superfluous or can be carried out at significantly longer time intervals than before so that the throughput can be increased.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Furthermore, the method can comprise determining from the reference image and from the recorded image a parameter that is characteristic of the operationality of the inspection device, and where it is determined in dependence of a difference between the parameter determined from the reference image and the parameter determined from the recorded image whether the inspection device is operational.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Characteristic parameters for the operationality of the inspection device are typically independent of the container and relate, for example, to parameters that indicate that the inspection device (when configured in the form of a camera) is fogging up or that there is dirt in or on the lens. These parameters can also be detected or derived from images recorded for different containers. This embodiment ensures that the analysis of the operationality of the inspection device is based on a container-independent parameter, and the operationality of the inspection device is therefore analyzed independently of any fouling of the containers.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The characteristic parameters can there either be parameters that arise from an image pixel by pixel. When fouling of the optics of the inspection device is detected, for example, a number of pixels that represent the fouling can be identified. Alternatively, however, characteristic parameters can also represent parameters or information arising from a (statistical) evaluation of an image and are then independent of information associated with a specific pixel. For example, the entropy of the image, the contrast or the definition of the image are variables that are independent of specific pixel values. They can also be understood to be characteristic parameters.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The invention is in fact applicable in principle in the same way to characteristic parameters obtainable pixel by pixel as well as to characteristic parameters which require (statistical) evaluation of the entire image. In particular, the average values mentioned hereafter (as characteristic parameters) can be determined either on a pixel basis (i.e. a respective average value for the same pixel can be determined from a plurality of images) or on the basis of a pixel-independent variable (entropy, contrast, image definition for every image, averaged over all images).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">It can be provided in a further development of this embodiment that the characteristic parameter comprises at least one of contrast, image definition, image content, information content of the image. The operationality of the inspection device can be determined particularly advantageously by using these characteristic parameters.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Furthermore, if the difference in terms of the value is greater than a predefined threshold value, then the inspection device can be determined to be non-operational and/or if the difference in terms of the value is smaller than the predefined threshold value, then the inspection device can be determined to be operational. If, for example, the lens of an inspection device configured as a camera fogs up, then the contrast deteriorates considerably over a certain period of time. This becomes evident in the change in the corresponding parameter in the recorded images and therefore also in the reference image. By taking the respective threshold value into account, it can then be determined whether a deterioration in the ability of the inspection device to inspect is present.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment, the reference image is determined as the average value of the number of images previously recorded. Since averaged values are less susceptible to spontaneous changes in the images (which are typically characteristic of fouling), this averaging to obtain the reference image can ensure that information that is substantially container-independent and thereby characteristic of the inspection device is used.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a further development of this embodiment, the number of previously recorded images is n and the reference image or at least one value a characterizing the reference image is determined from</p><p id="p-0020" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <msubsup>   <mo>&#x2211;</mo>   <mrow>    <mi>i</mi>    <mo>=</mo>    <mn>1</mn>   </mrow>   <mi>n</mi>  </msubsup>  <mfrac>   <msub>    <mi>a</mi>    <mi>i</mi>   </msub>   <mi>n</mi>  </mfrac> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0021" num="0000">and where a new reference image is determined when a new image is recorded, where the characteristic value of the new image is a<sub>n+1 </sub>and where a new value characterizing the reference image is determined from</p><p id="p-0022" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00002" num="00002"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <msubsup>   <mo>&#x2211;</mo>   <mrow>    <mi>i</mi>    <mo>=</mo>    <mn>2</mn>   </mrow>   <mrow>    <mi>n</mi>    <mo>+</mo>    <mn>1</mn>   </mrow>  </msubsup>  <mfrac>   <msub>    <mi>a</mi>    <mi>i</mi>   </msub>   <mi>n</mi>  </mfrac> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0023" num="0000">or where the new value characterizing the reference image is determined from</p><p id="p-0024" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00003" num="00003"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <mo>(</mo>   <mrow>    <mfrac>     <mrow>      <mi>n</mi>      <mo>-</mo>      <mn>1</mn>     </mrow>     <mi>n</mi>    </mfrac>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mrow>     <msubsup>      <mo>&#x2211;</mo>      <mrow>       <mi>i</mi>       <mo>=</mo>       <mn>1</mn>      </mrow>      <mi>n</mi>     </msubsup>     <mfrac>      <msub>       <mi>a</mi>       <mi>i</mi>      </msub>      <mi>n</mi>     </mfrac>    </mrow>   </mrow>   <mo>)</mo>  </mrow>  <mo>+</mo>  <mrow>   <mfrac>    <mn>1</mn>    <mi>n</mi>   </mfrac>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mrow>    <msub>     <mi>a</mi>     <mrow>      <mi>n</mi>      <mo>+</mo>      <mn>1</mn>     </mrow>    </msub>    <mo>.</mo>   </mrow>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0025" num="0019">As already mentioned, the characteristic value a<sub>i </sub>can either be a value that can be determined for each pixel (e.g. its color values) or the characteristic value a<sub>i </sub>(also characteristic parameter) can be a value that can only be determined from a (statistical) evaluation of the entire image information and is therefore (largely) independently of the values of individual pixels or is a value from which conclusions can no longer be drawn about the values of specific pixels in the image. These would be contrast, image definition, brightness and so on.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0020">With this embodiment, the calculation of the characteristic value also becomes insensitive to isolated events such as the actual fouling of a container.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0021">Furthermore, it can be provided that the inspection device records an image of each container moved past the inspection device and the recorded image is compared with the reference image. Since every container has to be inspected anyway, the images recorded in the process can also be used advantageously for (permanent) verification of the operationality of the inspection device.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0022">It is further preferred that the containers are no test containers. Since such use of test containers is no longer required, the throughput of the inspection apparatus is increased.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0023">In a further embodiment, the method further comprises recording an image of a test container moved past the inspection device and comparing the recorded image of the test container with the reference image to obtain a first comparison result and comparing a test image associated with the test container with the reference image to obtain a second comparison result. The occasional use of such test containers can ensure that even the slightest deterioration in the quality of the inspection device can be detected, thereby ensuring the high quality of the inspection at all times.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0024">In a further development of this embodiment, the method also comprises comparing the first comparison result with the second comparison result, where it is determined on the basis of this comparison whether the inspection device is operational. Since the test image or the image associated with the test container shows a definitively clean and undamaged container, the two comparisons provided can ensure that any impaired operationality of the inspection device is reliably detected.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0025">The inspection apparatus according to the invention for containers, such as bottles, comprises an inspection device and an evaluation device connected to the inspection device, where the inspection device is configured to record an image of a container moved past the inspection device and to transmit the recorded image and/or at least part of the information of the image to the evaluation device, where the evaluation device is configured to compare the recorded image with a reference image, where the reference image is formed from a number of previously recorded images of containers moved past the inspection device, and where the evaluation device is configured to determine in dependance of the comparison of the recorded image with the reference image whether the inspection device is operational and where the inspection apparatus for performing an inspection method is formed according to one of the preceding embodiments.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0026">The advantages of the inspection method according to the invention are realized with this apparatus.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0027">It can be provided that the inspection device comprises a camera and a light source, where a container is moved past between the camera and the light source by way of a transport device and the camera is arranged such that it can record an image of the container which is illuminated by the light source.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0028">The recording of translucently irradiated containers and corresponding images can be advantageous for detecting as much fouling or damage as possible.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an embodiment of an inspection apparatus for carrying out the inspection method according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a flow chart for carrying out an inspection method according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a flow chart of a further embodiment using test containers.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0038" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an inspection apparatus <b>104</b> in a container treatment system (not shown in more detail). In the embodiment presently shown, inspection apparatus <b>104</b> is arranged between two container treatment machines <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> that are arranged one after the other in the direction of transport of the containers. In principle, the container treatment machines can be any conceivable container treatment machine. First container treatment machine <b>101</b> upstream of inspection apparatus <b>104</b> can be, for example, a container cleaning machine. Container cleaning machines are commonly used to remove fouling from recyclable containers, such as glass bottles. After passing through the container cleaning machine, an inspection apparatus <b>104</b> can advantageously be arranged for verifying prior to a further treatment step (e.g. in a further container treatment machine <b>102</b> configured as a filler) whether the containers have then been completely cleaned as expected and/or have no damage, such as fractured glass.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0033">Alternatively, container treatment machine <b>101</b> can also be a machine that is somehow related to the manufacture of a container. In particular, this can be a blow molding machine, a stretch blow molding machine in general, a mold filling machine or the like.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0034">Inspection apparatus <b>104</b> is preferably arranged between a container treatment machine <b>101</b> associated with the manufacture and/or cleaning of the containers and the further container treatment machine <b>102</b>. The latter, i.e. container treatment machine <b>102</b>, can preferably be a filler or a capper or a labeler. Further container treatment machine <b>102</b> particularly preferably comprises in the direction of transport of the containers a filler, a capper (both can also be integrated into one container treatment machine), a labeler, and/or a direct printing machine for applying one or more decorative elements onto the containers.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0035">A packer can then also be formed further downstream, for example, as part of the container treatment machine.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0036">In principle, the invention is not restricted with regard to the arrangement of the inspection apparatus according to the invention in a container treatment system comprising upstream or downstream container treatment machines and the above explanations are to be understood to be only by way of example. In fact, the inspection apparatus according to the invention can be arranged in any container treatment system where inspection apparatuses are commonly used.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0037">In any case, inspection apparatus <b>104</b> comprises an inspection device <b>141</b> which is presently illustrated as a camera. Optionally, it can also be provided that inspection apparatus <b>104</b> comprises a light source, such as diffuser light source <b>143</b>, which is arranged with regard to the containers on the side opposite to camera <b>141</b>. In this way, the diffuser light source shines through containers <b>130</b> arranged in transport device <b>143</b> and the camera subsequently records as an image the containers through which the light respectively passed through. A diffuser light source provides the advantage that the illumination of the containers is always uniform so that any unwanted imaging of the light source can be prevented.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0038">In the embodiment presently shown, the transport device is configured, for example, as a transport belt or as the centering device receiving the containers (for example, comprising a stand plate and a centering bell). The images of the containers recorded are therefore always side views in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In principle, however, inspection apparatuses are known from prior art with which an inspection of the mouth region and/or an inspection of the base of the containers is also possible. The inspection apparatus according to the invention can also be configured accordingly, so that inspection of the mouth region or the base is also possible. This can typically be implemented by using suitable mirrors, for example, which redirect the diffuser light source such that the mouth region or base region is illuminated and/or the base region or the mouth region is imaged in the inspection device or camera <b>141</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0039">As an alternative to transport device <b>143</b> described, the transportation of the containers can also be carried out in a suspended or just standing manner Suspended transportation is particularly advantageous when the base region is to be inspected. Standing transportation only, without the use of a centering device is advantageous for inspecting the mouth region.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0040">According to the invention, the inspection apparatus typically comprises a control unit, such as a computer. This control unit is understood in particular to be an evaluation device with which the images of containers recorded by inspection device <b>141</b> can be evaluated.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0041">While the inspection device has presently been described as comprising a camera <b>141</b> and a light source, in particular a diffuser light source <b>142</b>, has also been described, other embodiments are also conceivable. In particular, all the options for inspecting containers known in prior art can be implemented within the scope of the inspection apparatus according to the invention, since the inspection apparatus according to the invention requires that &#x201c;images&#x201d;, i.e. some kind of visual information of the containers to be inspected, be recorded.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0042">While the inspections of glass bottles are typically carried out using the inspection apparatuses and the inspection method according to the invention, the invention is not restricted in this regard. Other types of containers can also be inspected, and the invention is in particular not restricted to the shape of containers as &#x201c;bottles&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an embodiment of the method according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the method according to the invention in the form of a flow chart.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0045">The method begins with a first step <b>201</b>, in which an image of a container currently being moved past inspection device <b>141</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in transport device <b>143</b> is recorded with the aid of the inspection device. This can be, for example, an image that was recorded in the range of the electromagnetic spectrum visible to humans Other parts of the spectrum can also be used for recording an image. For example, the recording can also comprise a part of the infrared and/or the ultraviolet and presently in particular the X-ray spectrum. The invention is not restricted in this regard.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0046">The image recorded in this manner is then compared (by way of evaluation device <b>150</b>) with a reference image stored in a memory of the evaluation device. According to the invention, this reference image is generated from a number of previously recorded images of containers moved past the inspection device. &#x201c;Previously&#x201d; in this context means that the images were recorded prior to the current image. The number of previously recorded images on which the reference image is based can be fixed. For example, the last 300 images can always be used to calculate the reference image. It is not necessary for the previously recorded images to be immediately consecutive images of immediately consecutive containers. For example, only the image of every second container can also be used for determining the reference image from a series of such images of every second container.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0047">In particular, the reference image can have been or be determined from the average value of the preceding images. The average value a<sup>(n) </sup>with regard to a certain property a<sub>i </sub>of the individual image points or pixels results for the respective pixel from the following formula:</p><p id="p-0054" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00004" num="00004"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <msup>    <mi>a</mi>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mi>n</mi>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </msup>   <mo>=</mo>   <mrow>    <msubsup>     <mo>&#x2211;</mo>     <mrow>      <mi>i</mi>      <mo>=</mo>      <mn>1</mn>     </mrow>     <mi>n</mi>    </msubsup>    <mfrac>     <msub>      <mi>a</mi>      <mi>i</mi>     </msub>     <mi>n</mi>    </mfrac>   </mrow>  </mrow>  <mo>,</mo> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0055" num="0048">where can be the value of a specific pixel in the i<sup>th </sup>image and n the number of images. The average value therefore indicates the average value of the property (e.g. blue color value) of the pixel over all images n that were recorded or taken into account. The average value a<sup>(n) </sup>therefore indicates the average value of the property (e.g. blue color value) of the pixel over all images n that were recorded or taken into account. An entire &#x201c;reference image&#x201d; can therefore be determined from the previous images by repeating this process for each pixel.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0049">The procedure presently described would be used, for example, for a pixel-by-pixel determination of the values a that are relevant for each pixel. This can be used to differentiate between spots on a lens and container fouling. The spot of the lens will find a correspondence in the values a<sup>(n) </sup>for the pixels imaging that spot, because a spot on the lens is present over a long period of time and therefore over a plurality of images (possibly even all). Spots on individual containers, on the other hand, only appear on one image, such as image number k, but not on the other images at the same location and therefore at the same pixels, so that such container-specific fouling is strongly suppressed by averaging to determine the reference image.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0050">Alternatively or additionally, however, other properties (also referred to as characteristic parameters) that do not result in a pixel-based assignment of values can also be used. This applies to contrast, image definition, entropy and the like. Although these quasi &#x201c;macroscopic&#x201d; variables are calculated from all pixel values, a specific value of the contrast, however, no longer allows for any conclusions to be drawn about the pixel values of individual, specific pixels. These variables are therefore only statistical variables that can be associated with entire images.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0051">However, formally the same formula above is used to determine the characteristic parameter.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0052">In this embodiment, determining the above average value (if a<sub>i </sub>is, for example, the contrast of image i) causes a &#x201c;statistic of a statistic&#x201d; so that the statistically determined values (such as contrast) of each image can be statistically evaluated together with the other images. For example, determining the average value of the contrast over a plurality of n images can be used to determine an average contrast which considers the random, non-systemic changes in contrast (i.e. not representing fouling of the lens) from image to image in a manner less pronounced than systemic trends such as lens fogging. This average value can then be used to examine the contrast of a currently recorded image. If the contrast deviates significantly from the preceding average, then this can be an indication of the lens fogging up.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0053">It is understood that the calculation of the &#x201c;reference image&#x201d; (which should also be understood to comprise the characteristic parameters) does not require a complete calculation of an image. For the calculation of a &#x201c;reference image&#x201d; for verifying the operationality of the inspection device, it is sufficient, for example, if the characteristic parameter or value or the property, as described above, is determined from a plurality of recorded images and is compared with a currently recorded image. For example, only contrast values can be created as &#x201c;reference images&#x201d;. The images from which these contrast values were determined can, but do not need to, be stored.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0054">Regardless of which properties are presently used, the invention provides that the comparison of the recorded image with the reference image then either delivers information that the reference image corresponds to the recorded image approximately within a certain limit value or threshold value (e.g. standard deviation). It can there be provided that a deviation of the current image from the reference image (or the above average value) by 0.5% is to be regarded as still matching the reference image. This value is not mandatory. Absolute deviations can also be specified as threshold values, or other relative deviations.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0055">If it is now determined in step <b>203</b> (regardless of the selection of the limit value or threshold value) that the image of the container recorded matches the reference image, then the image of the container currently recorded can then be used to calculate a new reference value or a new reference image in step <b>231</b>. This step is not mandatory, but is advantageously carried out in order to take account of any changes in the recording of the images that are caused by the aging of the inspection device and are not related to a deterioration of the inspection device that has occurred,</p><p id="p-0063" num="0056">Operations can then continue using this new reference image <b>205</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0057">As has already described been above, it can also be provided alternatively that the reference image is not updated by every image of every container recorded, but rather only every image of every second container is used for updating the reference image. In such a case, step <b>231</b> would then not occur for every container.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0058">Operations are subsequently continued <b>205</b> with the possibly new reference image, so that the method finally returns to step <b>201</b> and the image of a further container is recorded in order to inspect it.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0059">While the method described in the preceding steps is aimed at detecting any malfunctions of the inspection device, it is of course provided in parallel that the image recorded by the inspection device is analyzed to determine whether the container has fouling and/or damage. This takes place in a known manner independently of the method described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0060">In particular, step <b>202</b> of comparing the recorded image with the reference image comprises a comparison with regard to a parameter that is characteristic of the operationality of the inspection device, which parameter is determined, firstly, from the reference image and, secondly, from the recorded image in order to determine, based on a comparison of parameters thus determined, whether the inspection device works reliably. This parameter can be, for example, the overall contrast that is obtained in the recorded image or the reference image, the image definition of these two images, or the image content as well as the overall information content of the image (presently also analogously the entropy of the image). These values are typically independent of the current container image with regard to existing fouling or fractured glass, since the contrast is substantially determined, firstly, by the light source and, secondly, by the inspection device. Changes in the contrast of the recorded image compared to the reference image can therefore mean, for example, that the lens of a camera used as an inspection device fogs up. Certain constants in the image content can instead indicate that the lens itself is dirty instead of the containers being fouled.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0061">With regard to the reference image with which the recorded image is compared, it can be provided, for example, that this reference image is determined from the average value of the previously recorded images. This can be done in particular with regard to a value or parameter a<sup>(n) </sup>characterizing the reference image, as already mentioned above. If this value is, for example, the contrast, then it can be determined by averaging the contrasts a<sub>i </sub>obtained in the previous images.

The discarding of the currently recorded image in step <b>223</b> takes place for the reason that it is known at this point in time that a malfunction of the inspection device is probably or definitely given and the current image of the container was recorded with this malfunction. Using this correspondingly systematically faulty image to determine an updated reference image would lead to incorrect results in the subsequent analysis of the images subsequently recorded with regard to the operationality of the inspection device.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0067">In addition, it can be provided that a defined number of previously recorded images is likewise discarded and the reference image is recalculated based on the images recorded before that time. This can be advantageous in the event that the malfunction of the inspection device developed over a certain period of time (e.g. the lens of the container fogged up), but this malfunction was only so pronounced from a certain container that it led to a lack of conformity of the image of that container recorded compared with the reference image. In this way, falsifications of the reference image can be kept to a minimum.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0068">However, step <b>223</b> is only optional.

If this deviation continues to increase and subsequently reaches, for example, 1% of the reference value, for example, of the previously calculated average value for the contrast based on the reference image, then the container treatment system and in particular the inspection device can be halted in an automated manner, i.e. its operation can be interrupted and the operator can be requested to perform cleaning immediately.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0094">Other implementations of these specific embodiments, basically based on a degree of deviation of a currently measured value from an expected value and/or limit value and/or an (entire) reference image such that a threshold or a threshold value is exceeded, can presently also be considered.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00001" nb-file="US20230003665A1-20230105-M00001.NB"><img id="EMI-M00001" he="4.91mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003665A1-20230105-M00001.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00002" nb-file="US20230003665A1-20230105-M00002.NB"><img id="EMI-M00002" he="4.91mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003665A1-20230105-M00002.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00003" nb-file="US20230003665A1-20230105-M00003.NB"><img id="EMI-M00003" he="5.67mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003665A1-20230105-M00003.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00004" nb-file="US20230003665A1-20230105-M00004.NB"><img id="EMI-M00004" he="4.91mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003665A1-20230105-M00004.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00005" nb-file="US20230003665A1-20230105-M00005.NB"><img id="EMI-M00005" he="7.79mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003665A1-20230105-M00005.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00006" nb-file="US20230003665A1-20230105-M00006.NB"><img id="EMI-M00006" he="7.79mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003665A1-20230105-M00006.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00007" nb-file="US20230003665A1-20230105-M00007.NB"><img id="EMI-M00007" he="4.91mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003665A1-20230105-M00007.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00008" nb-file="US20230003665A1-20230105-M00008.NB"><img id="EMI-M00008" he="4.91mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003665A1-20230105-M00008.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00009" nb-file="US20230003665A1-20230105-M00009.NB"><img id="EMI-M00009" he="5.67mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003665A1-20230105-M00009.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
