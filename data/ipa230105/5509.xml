level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0029">&#x3c;About Present Technology&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0030">The present technology improves creation efficiency of music content by automatically determining a display sequence of display information regarding an audio signal of a track and a time position of a marker on the basis of at least one of the audio signal of each track or other information in a creation tool for music content.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0031">First, as an embodiment of the present technology, an example will be described in which a display sequence of time-series display information regarding the audio signal of the track is determined (changed) on the basis of at least one of the audio signal of each track or other information.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0032">In this case, for example, the creation efficiency can be further improved by determining the display sequence of the display information according to a time section designated by a user who is a creator of the music content.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0033">Furthermore, information used for determining the display sequence of the display information can be set by the user, for example. Thus, it is possible to achieve determination of the display sequence that matches the user's intention and improve usability of the creation tool.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0034">Note that, in the following, a case where a music content including audio signals of a plurality of tracks is produced will be described as an example, but the present technology can be applied to any content as long as the audio content includes a plurality of audio signals.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0035">Hereinafter, embodiments to which the present technology is applied will be described with reference to the drawings.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0036">In general, a user produces a music content including audio signals of a plurality of tracks using the creation tool.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0037">Here, the audio signal of one track is, for example, an audio signal for reproducing a sound of an arbitrary audio object such as a musical instrument or a vocal, and the audio signal may be a signal of one channel, such as a signal of an R channel.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0038">For example, on an editing screen of the creation tool for music content, waveform information and the like of audio signals of a plurality of respective tracks constituting the music content are arranged and displayed in a predetermined display sequence as time-series display information regarding the audio signals of the tracks.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0039">Specifically, for example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, waveform information of the audio signal of one track, that is, a time waveform is displayed as display information in a portion of an information display area R<b>11</b> that is one rectangular area long in the horizontal direction on the editing screen.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040">Similarly, waveform information of the audio signal of another track different from the track corresponding to the information display area R<b>11</b> is displayed as display information in a portion of an information display area R<b>12</b> provided adjacent to a lower side of the information display area R<b>11</b> in the diagram.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">Here, the horizontal direction indicates time, and the right direction in the diagram is a future direction of time.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">On the editing screen of the creation tool, a plurality of other information display areas is also provided on a lower side of the information display area R<b>12</b> in the diagram in an arranged manner, and the waveform information of the audio signal of the track is displayed in these information display areas.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">Hereinafter, an order (display sequence) in which the time-series display information regarding the audio signal of the track such as the waveform information of the audio signal of the track is arranged is referred to as a track display sequence.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">In such the creation tool for music content, the user can produce the music content by performing work such as waveform editing and effect addition in units of tracks, that is, independently for each track while viewing the editing screen.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">At this time, for example, if the user can change the track display sequence so that the display information of each of a plurality of respective tracks having similar features is arranged adjacent to each other on the editing screen, creation efficiency of the music content can be improved.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">For example, in the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, from an upper end portion to a lower end portion of the editing screen, the waveform information of each track is arranged and displayed in the order of earliness of start timings of sound units of the audio signals of the tracks.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">Here, when attention is paid to a track in which the waveform information is displayed in the information display area R<b>11</b> and a track in which the waveform information is displayed in the information display area R<b>12</b> adjacent to the information display area R<b>11</b>, start timings of sound units in the audio signals of these two tracks are substantially the same.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">For example, in a case where the work of collectively editing the tracks that appear in order from the head of the music content is performed, if the waveform information of the tracks is arranged and displayed in an order of start timings of sound units of the audio signals as in the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, efficiency of editing work can be improved.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">Similarly, for example, if the display information of respective tracks such as the waveform information is arranged and displayed in a sequence based on some features of the track, it is possible to improve efficiency of work of collectively editing the plurality of tracks having similar features.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">For example, the user often changes the track display sequence on the basis of the start timing of the sound unit of the audio signal, the sound pressure of the audio signal, and other information regarding the audio signal of the track.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">Here, the other information regarding the audio signal of the track is, for example, musical instrument information, priority information, reverberation information, sound information, position information, and the like of the audio signal (audio object) of the track.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">As described above, if the track display sequence is changed, display information such as waveform information of a plurality of tracks having some similar features can be arranged close to each other on the editing screen.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">This makes it easier for the user to recognize the arrangement positions of tracks having similar features as compared with a case where display information of a plurality of tracks having similar features is not arranged nearby.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">Furthermore, the

Furthermore, the distance constituting the position information is a distance from the reference position to the sound source.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0135">It is conceivable to determine the track display sequence on the basis of such position information for each track.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0136">For example, if the track display sequence is determined so that the horizontal angles constituting the position information are in ascending order, the waveform information and the like are displayed on the upper end portion side of the editing screen as the track of the sound source localizes in a direction closer to the front of the listener, which is more easily perceived by the listener.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0137">Therefore, the user can proceed with the editing work from the track of the sound source that is more easily perceived by the listener, and the creation efficiency of the music content can be improved.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0138">Furthermore, for example, if the track display sequence is determined so that the temporal change amount of the position information is in descending order, the waveform information and the like are displayed on the upper end portion side of the editing screen as the track of the sound source moves faster. Therefore, the user can proceed with the editing work from the track of the sound source moving faster, and the creation efficiency of the music content can be improved.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0139">Note that the position information of each track may be manually set (designated) by the user in the creation tool for music content, or may be automatically set on the basis of the musical instrument information, the reverberation information, the sound information, the priority information, the channel information, the audio signal, and the like of the track.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0140">Specifically, for example, a decision tree or the like in which the musical instrument information, the reverberation information, the sound information, the priority information, and the channel information of the track are input and position information of the track is output may be prepared in advance by learning.
