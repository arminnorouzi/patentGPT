id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application relates to wireless communications and more particularly to modeling wireless traffic and for using wireless traffic information, e.g., in making hardware deployment decisions.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Various sources of network traffic information are available. For example, access points such as base stations may track and report data usage information, e.g., for network management and/or billing reasons. In the case where a base station operator is contracted with to provide services from multiple customers of a contracting party, the contracting party may receive information on network usage, based on base station usage by the contracting party, but may or may not have precise information about the location of the base stations for which use information is provided. In addition, wherein usage information corresponding to a base station indicates that the wireless device was in the coverage area of the base station which reported the usage, where the wireless device was within the base station coverage area is likely unknown from the base station usage information. Accordingly, base station usage information while providing some information can leave a lot of uncertainty with regard to wireless device data usage with respect to precise device location information which can be important when considering where to deploy additional access points, e.g., base stations. For example, when planning to deploy base stations, e.g., small cells, to reduce the load on a service provider's network and shift it to the contracting party's own network detailed information about the location of user devices and data usage information may be needed making base station usage information by itself insufficient in many cases for reliably modeling data traffic to a level different than that of the reporting network, e.g., to facilitate small cell location planning and deployment.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition to base station usage information, another source of data usage information can be, and sometimes is, an application running on one or more mobile devices which track device data usage. Android devices often support such data usage applications while iOS devices and/or Apple often block the reporting and/or sharing of data usage to wireless service providers.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such wireless device provided data usage information can be useful but may not accurately track the actual data usage from a network perspective and may differ from base station reported usage for a variety of reasons. In addition, since only a subset of devices using a network, e.g., Android devices, may provide data usage information there is often a discrepancy between total base station reported data usage and the amount of data usage reported by wireless devices. Furthermore, the time periods for which data usage are reported by wireless devices may or may not coincide clearly with base station reported data usage time periods and in many cases the data usage tracking and reporting periods used by wireless devices and base stations will differ.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition to reporting data usage, at least some individual devices may report their location at various points in time, e.g., based on various events at an individual wireless device. Unfortunately, wireless devices often provide their location information in response to different events than those that trigger data usage reporting. This makes it difficult to correlate wireless device provided data usage information to wireless device provided location information.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">If the above issues weren't enough to make traffic modeling based on data usage information difficult, for the traffic models to be useful in considering where particular sets of hardware, e.g., access points such as small base stations, should be deployed, it may be important to take into consideration that an access point being deployed may be or is likely to service some types of traffic but not others. For example, outdoor access points which use signaling which has difficulty penetrating walls may be able to service wireless data traffic from outdoor devices but not indoor wireless devices. However base stations which use signaling, e.g., cellular LTE signaling capable of penetrating walls, may be able to service both indoor and outdoor traffic. Accordingly, in some but not all cases, it can be useful if distinctions could be made when modeling traffic in an area whether the traffic is from an indoor or outdoor device.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">From the above it should be appreciated that differences between the sources of traffic model information present numerous technical problems with regard to the use of such data to generate traffic models which are sufficiently reliable for network planning and/or making decisions as to where to place wireless network components in a hardware and/or cost efficient manner.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of the above, it should be appreciated that there is a need for methods and/or apparatus which can be used to model and/or predict wireless traffic in one or more geographic areas. It would be desirable if the methods and/or apparatus could use a variety of different data traffic sources in making the model and/or if the methods or apparatus could take into consideration the fact that data and/or location reporting periods may be different. Accordingly, it should be appreciated that traffic modeling methods that can be used to facilitate efficient hardware deployment of access points, e.g., base stations, and/or other network elements are both important and useful.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Methods and apparatus and apparatus for processing and reconciling data traffic utilization information from a variety of sources including client devices and service provider networks are described.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The described methods take into consideration that wireless devices tracking usage data may not accurately reflect the amount of usage measured by network devices. This may be because of overhead the client devices are not aware of or because different measurement techniques or accounting metrics are used by the service provider network. The methods and apparatus may, and sometimes do, take into consideration that while some client devices, e.g., android devices, may track and report usage and/or location information through the use of an application which provides such information to the network service provider, such information may not be readily available from other devices such Apple iOS devices. The described data tracking and location assignment methods are used in some embodiments to determine hardware placement, e.g., access point and/or base station placement.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Data usage reported by client devices which support a connection manager application is scaled based on the amount of data a network service provider reports being used. Location information provided by the client devices is then allocated based on client device provided location information to geographic locations.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Depending on whether a distinction is to be made between indoor and outdoor traffic, in some embodiments once data usage has been assigned to locations, data usage corresponding to indoor location may be intentionally excluded from further consideration. Such an implementation is useful when deciding where to position access points or base stations intended to capture outdoor data traffic. One such situation may be, and sometimes is, when attempting to determine traffic which may be served by a CBRS device which services outdoor devices but is unlikely to capture traffic from indoor devices.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Once the data traffic from wireless devices, e.g., client devices such as UEs, that provide both location and data usage information has been assigned to locations, the traffic information if further processed to allocate it to geospatial areas, e.g., hex shaped areas, sometimes also referred to as bins, since one bin is used to collect data traffic information for one corresponding hex shaped area in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Data usage and/or the amount of data allocated to bins can be, and sometimes is, adjusted to take into consideration traffic due to devices which do not provide data and location information. This is done by taking into consideration service provider reported traffic corresponding to devices which do not supply their data and location information, e.g., because they do not support a connection manager application.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Data usage can be, and sometimes is, generated on a daily basis and then for an extended period of time, e.g., a year. Smoothing of data over the extended period of time may be used to obtain a more realistic estimate of data usage in geospatial regions despite daily fluctuations in data traffic.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Based on estimated data traffic, decisions with regard to where to place network hardware can be, and sometimes are, made. In this way base stations or other devices can be placed by a first network provider at locations where they are likely to be able to service an amount of traffic which can make the deployment effective in terms of hardware utilization particularly where the goal is to move some traffic away from a second service provider network onto a first service provider network to avoid costs and/or service issues associated with customers having to use the second service provider network to obtain service.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The methods and apparatus are well suited for determining access point/base station placement in cases where a MVNO seeks to start building out a physical network of its own to reduce the need for the MVNO's customers to use a partner, e.g., second service provider network, to obtain service.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">While various techniques and methods for determining traffic utilization are described to facilitate access point location selection and placement, the methods and apparatus can be used for a wide variety of applications including making other hardware or capacity related acquisition or placement decisions.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">An exemplary method of using wireless data usage information from a variety of sources, in accordance with some embodiments, includes: accessing a first set of client device connection manager data (CDCM) usage records including data usage information corresponding to a first plurality of wireless devices and a first time period, said data usage information being data usage information that was measured by wireless devices in said first plurality of wireless devices; normalizing the first set of CDCM usage records for the first time period by scaling the CDCM usage records on an individual device basis based on per device usage information for the first time period indicated in a first set of second service provider data usage records provided by a second network used by the first plurality of devices; assigning data usage indicated by the normalized CDCM data usage records to locations; determining one or more wireless network device placement locations based on the assigned data usage to location information; and deploying a wireless network device at one of the determined wireless network device placement locations.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Numerous variations on the described methods and apparatus are possible and while several embodiments are described in detail is should be appreciated that the full set of detailed steps need not be used in all embodiments with many of the features and determinations being useful even if not used with the other features and steps.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The detailed description

A session is defined as the period between when mobile device connects and disconnects from a tower.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Each record contains the (Basic Service Set Identifier) BSSID of the tower.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Each record contains International Mobile Equipment Identity Number (IMEI) of the device. The record contains no location information (not even information regarding the location of the tower). The second service provider usage records (e.g. PRRs) are considered truth regarding total usage by device.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Connection Manager (CM) events will now be described. Connection Manager (CM) is an application that runs on first service provider mobile devices that collects quality of service telemetry data from client devices. This information is sent back to a first service provider management node as a collection of events (messages transmitting information on specific activities) via normal internet protocols. Events that represent instantaneous actions (start of a cellular connection, a location update, etc.) contain the devices latitude and longitude at the time the event occurred. Events that represent time integrated information (total usage over a period of time) do not contain location information.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">For simplicity, in the discussion that follows all events that contain location information will be referred to as location events, and all events containing usage information will be referred to as usage events.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The usage events in CM have known limitations in terms of reporting total usage. That is, the usage reported by CM is known to both over report and under report usage.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The reported CM usage is believed to be consistent for a device. That is, if CM reports that a device used twice as much information in one location as another, then it probably did, but the absolute usage is probably not correct.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The CM events contain a device identifier that can be linked to the devices IMEI.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The CM Cellular events contain the BSSID of the tower that the device was communicating with.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">CM is only installed on Android devices. There are no CM events from iOS customers.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">An exemplary scenario will now be described. In this scenario it will be shown how the second service provider network, e.g. MNO, data usage records, e.g.,. PRRs, and first service provider network CM Event records will be used to estimate expected spatial distribution of first service provider network customers usage along a road <b>302</b> running between two towns. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is drawing <b>300</b> which illustrates an exemplary geographic area including road <b>302</b>, cell tower &#x3b1; <b>304</b>, coverage area <b>306</b> for cell tower &#x3b1;, cell tower &#x3b2; <b>308</b>, coverage area <b>310</b> for cell tower &#x3b2;, a cluster of houses (A <b>312</b>, B <b>314</b>, C <b>316</b>, D <b>318</b>, E <b>320</b>).</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In this set up, each house in the cluster of houses (house A <b>312</b>, house B <b>314</b>, house C <b>316</b>, house D <b>318</b>, and house E <b>320</b>), each has a single first service provider network customer. The customers in house A <b>312</b> and house B <b>314</b> use Android devices (and thus are covered by CM) and the customers in house C <b>316</b>, house D <b>318</b> and house E <b>320</b> use iOS devices. Every morning a member from each household gets up and goes to work, taking the main road <b>302</b> either North West or South East.

For this process it is sufficient to know their location accurately enough to place them with a specific county, which can be determined by taking the median latitude and longitude of all the CM location events associated with the tower. It should also be noted that the coverage area (<b>306</b>, <b>308</b>) for towers (&#x3b1; <b>304</b> and &#x3b2; <b>308</b>), respectively, are not known, and in general are neither continuous nor mutually exclusive.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">For simplicity we treat this process as being done globally. For processing purposes, in some embodiments, it is done on a county-by-county basis. Input data can be, and sometimes is, filtered by using the latitude/longitude locations of the CM events and the approximate locations of the towers.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">For this exemplary scenario, assume everyone uses only a navigation app that transmits and receives continuously during their trip, and that everyone travels at a constant rate so that the expected usage from each customer should be constant per unit length along the road.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Also assume, with no loss of generality, that the cellular devices from customers A-E are the only devices in the analysis, and that towers &#x3b1; <b>304</b> and &#x3b2; <b>308</b> are the only towers in the analysis. Given that there is only one device and customer per house, all devices and customers will be labeled with their house letter. For example, customer A, lives in house A, and uses cellular device A.

Each record includes a sequence number, a timestamp, an event type indicating usage event or location event, a device ID, a BSSID. The location event records further include latitude and longitude information, while the event type records further include RX and TX usage information. Note that for this example, the event structure and field names have been simplified. Also, note that although cellular devices A and B are actually consuming the same amount of data, their CM events show different data usage. In the usage events, rx is the amount of data downloaded and tx is the amount of data uploaded. The total usage is the sum of these two field.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates exemplary second service provider network, e.g. MNO, usage records, e.g., PRR records, <b>600</b> including usage records <b>602</b> from tower a <b>304</b> and usage records <b>604</b> from tower &#x3b2; <b>308</b>. Each record includes a session id, a timestamp, a device identifier, a BSSID, receive usage information, and transmit usage information. Note that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, CM event records <b>500</b> from the first service provider network reports there are only event records from customers A and B (which correspond to android devices with an installed CM application); however, there are no CM events from customers C, D and E (which correspond to iOS devices without the CM application). However, in the second service provider (MNO) usage report records <b>600</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, usage is reported for each of the customers A, B, C, D and E.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0102">The following description is relevant to step <b>204</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and steps <b>2048</b>, <b>2050</b>, <b>2052</b>, <b>2054</b>, <b>2056</b>, <b>2058</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0103">The first step in normalization is to adjust the usage reported in the CM events such that the usage from different devices are correctly scaled relative to each other. This will allow us to use this information to build a usage density distribution, basically a two-dimensional representation of the relative amount of data used in each location.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0104">To normalize the data the usage, e.g., all the data usage, reported in connection manager are summed for each device for each day. See drawing <b>700</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> which illustrates the sum of usage in the CM events for device A and device B, which is 73401020 and 24467008, respectively. Similarly, the usage from each device on each day is calculated from the second service provider network usage reports. In our example, each device has only a single session, but this sum could easily be done, and sometimes is done, across multiple sessions.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0105">The result is two tables, one with the usage in CM per device per day, and the other is the usage in the second service provider usage reports per device per day. These tables are then are inner joined on device and day and the ratio of second service provider (MNO) reported usage to the CM reported usage is calculated. This quantity is hereafter referred to as the normalization factor.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0106">Note, owing to the inner join, only devices that show up on both CM reports and the second service provider usage reports will have a normalization factor. Also, since the devices in CM reports are a subset of the devices in the second service provider (MNO) reports (those running the Android operating system), the normalization factor is effectively only calculated for CM devices.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>RF</mi>   <mrow>    <mi>d</mi>    <mo>,</mo>    <mi>T</mi>   </mrow>  </msub>  <mo>=</mo>  <mfrac>   <mrow>    <msub>     <mo>&#x2211;</mo>     <mrow>      <mo>&#x2200;</mo>      <mtext> </mtext>      <mi>i</mi>     </mrow>    </msub>    <msubsup>     <mi>U</mi>     <mrow>      <mi>d</mi>      <mo>,</mo>      <mi>T</mi>      <mo>,</mo>      <mi>i</mi>     </mrow>     <mi>PRR</mi>    </msubsup>   </mrow>   <mrow>    <msub>     <mo>&#x2211;</mo>     <mrow>      <mo>&#x2200;</mo>      <mtext> </mtext>      <mi>j</mi>     </mrow>    </msub>    <msubsup>     <mi>U</mi>     <mrow>      <mi>d</mi>      <mo>,</mo>      <mi>T</mi>      <mo>,</mo>      <mi>j</mi>     </mrow>     <mi>CM</mi>    </msubsup>   </mrow>  </mfrac> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0106" num="0107">The above equation may be referred to as Equation 1 and is a definition of the normalization factor (RF) for device d and day T.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0108">In Equation 1 the sums in the numerator and denominator are over all records in the second service provider usage reports (referred to as PRR) and usage events in CM reports for device d and day T respectively, and:</p><p id="p-0108" num="0109">U<sub>d,T,i</sub><sup>PRR</sup>&#x2014;the usage in the ith record in the second service provider usage reports (PRRs) for device d and day T</p><p id="p-0109" num="0110">U<sub>d,T,j</sub><sup>CM</sup>&#x2014;the usage in the jth usage event in the CM records for device d and day T</p><p id="p-0110" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00002" num="00002"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <msub>    <mi>RF</mi>    <mrow>     <mi>A</mi>     <mo>,</mo>     <mrow>      <mn>2021.01</mn>      <mtext>.01</mtext>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </msub>   <mo>=</mo>   <mrow>    <mfrac>     <mrow>      <mn>125</mn>      <mo>,</mo>      <mn>829</mn>      <mo>,</mo>      <mn>120</mn>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mtext>   </mtext>      <mi>bytes</mi>     </mrow>     <mrow>      <mn>73</mn>      <mo>,</mo>      <mn>401</mn>      <mo>,</mo>      <mn>020</mn>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mtext>   </mtext>      <mi>bytes</mi>     </mrow>    </mfrac>    <mo>=</mo>    <mn>1.714</mn>   </mrow>  </mrow>  <mo>&#x2062;</mo>  <mtext></mtext>  <mrow>   <msub>    <mi>RF</mi>    <mrow>     <mi>B</mi>     <mo>,</mo>     <mrow>      <mn>2021.01</mn>      <mtext>.01</mtext>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </msub>   <mo>=</mo>   <mrow>    <mfrac>     <mrow>      <mn>125</mn>      <mo>,</mo>      <mn>829</mn>      <mo>,</mo>      <mn>120</mn>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mtext>   </mtext>      <mi>bytes</mi>     </mrow>     <mrow>      <mn>24</mn>      <mo>,</mo>      <mn>467</mn>      <mo>,</mo>      <mn>008</mn>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mtext>   </mtext>      <mi>bytes</mi>     </mrow>    </mfrac>    <mo>=</mo>    <mn>5.143</mn>   </mrow>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0111" num="0111">The above shows an example calculation for the Normalization Factor's for Device A and B for the exemplary date (day) 2021-01-01.

Because it is difficult for the signal from CBRS radios to penetrate the walls of buildings, in some embodiments, e.g., an embodiment in which CBRS network device (e.g., CBSD base station) placement locations are to be determined, it is desirable to eliminate any usage that occurred indoors from our model. To accomplish this, in some embodiments, a data to geospatial mapping tool such as, e.g. the ESRI Big Data Tool (BDT) is used.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0138">BDT has a batch function that given a point on the surface of the planet (latitude, longitude), and a polygon, will return a Boolean value indicating whether the point is inside the polygon. The polygon in this case would be the footprint of a building and, being inside the footprint, would indicate that the usage occurred inside the building. Building footprint data can be, and sometimes is, obtained from numerous proprietary and open-source providers. In some but not necessarily all embodiments the BDT returns an identifier of the polygon the point is in. If the point is not inside a polygon, then BDT returns null. Since we are not concerned with the particular building the point is in, we convert this to a Boolean value to indicate whether the data usage is inside or outside a building.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0139">For our example above, no activity occurs in the buildings A-D (<b>312</b>, <b>314</b>, <b>316</b>, <b>318</b>), and no usage is eliminated.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0140">Spatial Aggregation will now be described. Spatial aggregation serves two purposes in this process. First, it sets the spatial scale for our analysis, i.e., features smaller than the aggregation bin size will be ignored. Second, it spatially smooths the signal. Our usage measurements are all point locations, and without some form of spatial smoothing the usage density estimates will be zero almost everywhere.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0141">The following description is relevant to step <b>212</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and step <b>2080</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>.

Time Averaging will now be described.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0148"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> includes drawing <b>1400</b> which shows a depiction of the daily usage density derived from the rationalized CM events on 2021-01-01. Usage density legend <b>1402</b> indicates that as the dot density increases, the usage density increases. No dots <b>1402</b> indicates a usage density value of 0.00; dot density level <b>1406</b> indicates a usage density of 0.05; and dot density level <b>1408</b> indicates a usage density value of 0.10. As can be seen, the usage has been allocated to our location measurements, but still retains artifacts of the collection process. That is, usage is aggregated during collection and locations are reported at a limited number of discrete points.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0149">To address this we leverage the fact that the usage and location events are effectively sent at random times. What this means is that we can treat the daily distribution as a random set of samples from some underlying distribution. The more samples we collect, i.e., the longer we collect data, the better knowledge we have of the underlying distribution. The standard way of dealing with this problem in signal analysis is with ensemble averaging.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0150"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a drawing <b>1500</b> which illustrates how ensemble averaging is capable of recovering an underlying signal <b>1502</b> from a series of noisy measurements <b>1504</b>.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0151">A complication to this is that we are attempting to make this estimate at a time when user population is growing very dramatically. As a result, if we simply weight all the data evenly, our distribution will reflect only the very end of the collection period, which may be subject seasonal or exogenous fluctuations (e.g., there is significantly more outdoor activity during warm periods than cool ones). On the other hand, as the number of users grows, so does the number of samples, which should also provide a better a measure of the underlying distribution.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0152">In an attempt to strike a balance between these two concerns, in some embodiments the exemplary method include time averaging the daily density distributions and weighting each day by the number of CM events collected for that day. Thus, noisy daily distributions are, in some embodiments, combined into the final distribution. Usage scaling and projection will now be described. The filtering, aggregation and averaging step has left us with a usage density distribution. That is, we know, given that usage occurs, where it is likely to occur and in what proportions. To estimate the value of the spectrum, we will need to know absolute amount of usage that is likely to occur in each location.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0153">To get this, we return to the second service provider data usage records, e.g., the PRRs, that contain the total usage across each the first service providers client devices (e.g., android UE devices with CM, and iOS UE devices without CM), regardless of whether they are running the Connection Manager application or not. We will use this to form a projection of what we expect the total usage to be on any particular day (sometimes referred to as a characteristic total usage for the target date (C), and multiply the usage density distribution, P(X,Y), by this value C to get the total usage distribution, f(X,Y).</p><p id="p-0146" num="0154">Or to put it more precisely:</p><p id="p-0147" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>f</i>(<i>x, y</i>)=<i>C*</i>&#x3c1;(<i>x, y</i>)&#x2003;&#x2003;Equation 1<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Where</heading><p id="p-0148" num="0000"><ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0155">(x, y) is the usage distribution (the distribution we want)</li>        <li id="ul0009-0002" num="0156">&#x3c1;(x, y) is the usage density distribution (the quantity calculated above).</li>        <li id="ul0009-0003" num="0157">C Is a scale factor is that converts the density to total valid usage on the day of interest</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0149" num="0158">Scaling will now be described. Ultimately, we want to estimate the total valid usage (from each of the first service provider customers) using the second service provider (MNO) usage records (e.g., PRRs). In order to do that though, we need to correct the PRRs for the fact that not all usage captured in the PRRs occurs outdoors (our definition of valid in this situation). Luckily, we can get this from our Normalized CM usage.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0159">Recall that in the filtering and spatial aggregation section, it was described how the rationalized CM usage is labelled as occurring indoors or outdoors, and assigned to a spatial bin (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>). Returning to table <b>1200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, table <b>1200</b> is used to calculate the indoor and outdoor fraction per day by grouping by the indoor value and day, and summing the usage, then dividing by the total regularized usage for that day. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a drawing of example table <b>1600</b> which shows indoor/outdoor fractions per day.

Date indicates the day of interest. Indoor flag&#x2014;is a Boolean value indicating whether the row refers to an indoor or an outdoor fraction (indoor=true signifies indoor fraction, while indoor=false signifies an outdoor fraction). Fraction indicates the fraction of usage for the day of interest. Daily_total indicates the total CM normalized usage for the day. Ref_usage__b is the amount of normalized usage that is either indoor or outdoor according to the indoor flag.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0160">We then return to the second service provider network usage records, e.g., PRRs.

The final step in determining the scaling factor C is to project estimated outdoor usage on the day of interest. The reason that we use a projection, rather than just taking the usage from the table in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, is that there is a significant day-to-day variation in the usage due to environmental (warm vs cold days), seasonal factors (weekdays vs weekends), and exogenous factors (like sporting events, or political rallies).</p><p id="p-0155" num="0164">Since this value is to be used for estimates of new base station (e.g., CBSD) deployment, we want our value for C to be representative of typical usage on the day of interest, rather than be affected by the outside temperature or day of the week chosen.
