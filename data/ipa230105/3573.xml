The invention further relates to a measuring system for carrying out such a method.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The noise of vehicle transmissions is no longer masked by the engine noise in motor vehicles with hybrid drive or fully electric drive. Gear noise caused by the rolling of gear pairs in a transmission can therefore be perceived by vehicle occupants and be perceived as annoying. In the course of the trend towards hybrid drives or all-electric drives, the investigation of the noise behavior of gears has developed in recent years from a marginal discipline of university research to an important quality feature in the industrial production of transmissions.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It has been shown that simply reducing the deviations of a toothing from its nominal geometry, as determined in conventional individual defect testing, does not necessarily lead to better noise behavior of the toothing in noise testing or rolling element testing. Thus, when considering the individual defect testing, a toothing that is conspicuous for noise can be manufactured more precisely than a toothing that is not conspicuous for noise. For the manufacture of toothings, there is therefore a requirement on the one hand to comply with the specified manufacturing tolerances and on the other hand to additionally meet the noise behavior specifications.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The noise of a toothing is generated by the tooth contact, i.e. the rolling of the tooth flanks. To analyze the dominant frequencies of a noisy toothing, a noise measured during the rolling of a toothing is converted into an order spectrum, e.g. with the aid of the Fourier transform.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition to the tooth meshing orders, such an order spectrum also exhibits so-called &#x201c;ghost orders&#x201d;, which cannot be influenced by the toothing design and result from manufacturing errors. Dominant ghost orders can be caused, for example, by clamping errors, tool errors, defective bearings or the axial feed within a machine tool. It can be seen, for example, that wobbling of a tool during the production of the toothing maps a periodically recurring deviation from the nominal geometry on the tooth flanks. This deviation can be measured geometrically with precise coordinate measuring machines.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In many cases, a correlation can be established between waviness that can be geometrically detected on the surfaces of the tooth flanks and the acoustically detected dominant ghost orders. Thus, with the help of the geometric detection of surface waviness of a toothing, a potentially critical noise behavior of a toothing and/or the condition of a machine tool can be concluded.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As input data for determining surface waviness and other toothing deviations, it is advantageous to acquire measurement data on the topography of the individual tooth flanks of a toothing as complete as possible. However, the complete measurement of the topography of each individual tooth flank is time-consuming and difficult to represent in industrial series production.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure is therefore based on the technical problem of specifying an improved method for measuring and evaluating deviations of a toothing, which in particular enables a reliable analysis of surface waviness with a short cycle time or measuring duration. Furthermore, a measuring system for carrying out such a method is to be specified.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The technical problem described above is solved in each case by the independent claims. Further embodiments of the disclosure result from the dependent claims and the description below.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to a first aspect, the disclosure relates to a method comprising the steps of: providing a toothing having a plurality of teeth with tooth flanks; measuring two or more teeth of the toothing, wherein the following steps are performed for each of the two or more teeth: measuring a segment of at least one tooth flank of the tooth and wherein the measuring is performed optically by means of an optical measuring device, extrapolating the measured segment to an extrapolated segment; evaluating deviations of the extrapolated segments of the two or more teeth.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In particular, the method enables segments of the tooth flank, such as profile lines and/or the topography of the tooth flanks of the toothing, to be recorded quickly by performing the measurement optically and also by measuring only segments of the tooth flank that are extrapolated and then evaluated.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The method is based on the knowledge that in particular systematic deviations of the tooth flanks in the non-measured regions continue in a manner comparable to the measured areas and can therefore be extrapolated. It can therefore be assumed, for example, that a waviness which is measured in the area of a tooth center and which can be attributed, for example, to a bearing damage of a machine tool, will continue in the same way in the marginal areas of the tooth flank.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The extrapolation can be carried out, for example, with the aid of a known nominal geometry of the toothing, wherein, for example, measured waviness or deviations of the measured actual geometry of the toothing are transferred to non-measured regions of the actual geometry by superimposing the measured waviness or deviations of the actual geometry on the nominal geometry in the non-measured regions.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">When reference is made in this case to extrapolated segments, these extrapolated segments include both the optically measured values or measuring points of the tooth flank and the values or points added by extrapolation, which are treated as measured values or measuring points in the evaluation.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">It may be provided that the segment of the tooth flank comprises a section of a profile line of the tooth flank or consists of a section of a profile line of the tooth flank, and the extrapolation of the measured segment to the extrapolated segment comprises extrapolating the section of the profile line to an extrapolated profile line. The extrapolated segment may therefore be an extrapolated profile line.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">It may further be provided that a length of the section of the profile line measured at the tooth flank is shorter than a tooth height of the tooth, wherein a length of the extrapolated profile line is greater than the length of the measured section of the profile line from which the extrapolated profile line has been extrapolated.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">When reference is made in this case to extrapolated profile lines, these extrapolated profile lines include both the optically measured values or measuring points of the tooth flank and the values or points added by extrapolation, which are treated as measured values or measuring points in the evaluation.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">It may be provided that the segment of the tooth flank comprises or consists of a section of a flank line of the tooth flank, and the extrapolation of the measured segment to the extrapolated segment comprises extrapolating the section of the flank line to an extrapolated flank line. The extrapolated segment may therefore be or comprise an extrapolated flank line.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">When reference is made in this case to extrapolated flank lines, these extrapolated flank lines include both the optically measured values or measuring points of the tooth flank and the values or points added by extrapolation, which are treated as measured values or measuring points in the evaluation.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">It may be provided that the segment of the tooth flank comprises a partial area of the tooth flank or consists of a partial area of the tooth flank and the extrapolation of the measured segment to the extrapolated segment comprises the extrapolation of the partial area to an extrapolated partial area. The extrapolated segment may therefore be or comprise an extrapolated partial area. The partial area may have been optically measured, for example, using a measurement grid or by measuring a plurality of sections of profile lines and/or sections of flank lines.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">When reference is made in this case to extrapolated partial areas, these extrapolated partial areas include both the optically measured values or measuring points of the tooth flank and the values or points added by extrapolation, which are treated as measured values or measuring points in the evaluation.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The extrapolated partial area may also have interpolated values.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Sections of profile lines, sections of flank lines or partial areas of the tooth flank can be detected by means of the optical measuring system, for example, in such a way that a large number of individual measuring points are detected along the sections to be measured or distributed over the corresponding partial area. For this purpose, a resolution or a number of measuring points to be detected per unit of length or area to be detected can be specified.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In particular, a program can be used to evaluate the deviations, which requires as input data a larger area measured on the respective tooth flank than the optically measured segments of the tooth flanks would allow, in which the extrapolated segments are evaluated with this program. Insofar as the measured segments have, for example, sections of profile lines, an evaluation program can be used, for example, which usually requires tactilely recorded, complete profile lines or topography data as input data, but instead uses the optically recorded and extrapolated profile lines as input data.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">When reference is made in this case to deviations, these concern deviations of the manufactured actual geometry of the toothing from a specified nominal geometry of the toothing.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">When reference is made in this case to toothing, it refers in particular to a gear of a toothed gearing that is set up for transmitting and converting speeds and torques between rotating shafts. For example, such a gear may be a ring gear or a pinion of a bevel gear pair or a spur gear with straight or helical teeth of a cylindrical gear pair. Alternatively, the toothing may be a gear of a face gear pair used for positive transmission of a drive power between two shafts in the manner of a coupling.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">When reference is made in this case to an optical measuring device, this optical measuring device comprises in particular an optical measuring system for optical distance measurement, such as a confocal chromatic distance sensor, a laser triangulation system or the like.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">It may be provided that the evaluation of deviations comprises a determination of systematic deviations, wherein, in particular, a waviness analysis of the extrapolated segments, such as the extrapolated profile line, is performed. The waviness analysis may comprise a determination of a direction of surface waviness of the extrapolated segments, in particular extrapolated profile lines. Alternatively or additionally, the waviness analysis may comprise a frequency analysis of surface wavinesses of the extrapolated segments, in particular extrapolated profile lines.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">It may be provided that at least one section of at least one or more further profile lines of the tooth flank are measured. It may therefore be provided that two or more sections of profile lines of a tooth flank are measured.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">It may be provided that at least one section of a profile line is measured on all tooth flanks of the toothing. It may be provided that two or more sections of two or more profile lines can be measured on all tooth flanks of the toothing.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Alternatively or additionally, it may be provided that the length of a section of the profile line is more than 30% of the tooth height of the tooth, in particular more than 30% of a tooth height of the tooth reduced by a height of a tip relief and/or a height of the tooth root.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In particular, it may be provided that an optical measuring device is used whose measuring range covers more than 30% of the tooth height of the tooth, in particular more than 30% of a tooth height of the tooth reduced by a height of a tip relief and/or a height of the tooth root.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Alternatively or additionally, it may be provided that the length of the section of the profile line is less than 70% of the tooth height of the tooth, in particular less than 70% of a tooth height of the tooth reduced by a height of a tip relief and/or a height of the tooth root.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In particular, it may be provided that an optical measuring device is used whose measuring range covers less than 70% of the tooth height of the tooth, in particular less than 70% of a tooth height of the tooth reduced by a height of a tip relief and/or a height of the tooth root.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Alternatively or additionally, it may be provided that the section of the profile line lies within an active area of the tooth flank, and a length of the section of the profile line is less than a length of the active area of the tooth flank measured in the profile direction, wherein the active region of the tooth flank is the region that is in contact with a mating flank during operation of the gear when rolling.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Alternatively or additionally, it may be provided that an extrapolated topography of the tooth flank can be determined and this extrapolated topography is evaluated. An extrapolated topography can therefore be calculated from a plurality of sections, e.g. the profile lines of a flank, which is then subjected to a waviness analysis to determine surface waviness. In particular, a plurality of extrapolated profile lines is first determined for each flank.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">When reference is made in this case to an extrapolated topography, this extrapolated topography includes both the optically measured values or measuring points of the tooth flank and the values or points added by the extrapolation, which are treated as measured values or measuring points in the evaluation.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The extrapolated topography may also have interpolated values.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to a further embodiment of the method, it may be provided that two or more regions of the teeth are measured in a tactile manner, in particular four or more regions of the teeth are measured in a tactile manner, in particular exactly four regions or exactly eight regions of the teeth are measured in a tactile manner.

The tactile measurement serves in particular to verify the extrapolated profile lines.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In particular, the plausibility and/or the accuracy of the extrapolation can be checked. In particular, the extrapolation can be improved or adapted on the basis of the tactile measurement data.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">It may be provided that the optical measuring device has a confocal chromatic distance sensor, wherein the confocal chromatic distance sensor in particular has a measuring range selected from a range of 2 mm to 4 mm, in particular has a measuring range of 2.5 mm.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">To enable rapid measurement, it may be provided that the gear rotates in front of the optical measuring device during measurement, in particular at a constant angular velocity.
