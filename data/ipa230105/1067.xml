Extracorporeal blood treatment is typically used to extract undesirable matter or molecules from the patient's blood and add desirable matter or molecules to the blood. Extracorporeal blood treatment is used with patients unable to effectively remove matter from their blood, such as when a patient has suffered temporary or permanent kidney failure. These patients and other patients may undergo extracorporeal blood treatment to add or remove matter to their blood, to maintain an acid/base balance or to remove excess body fluids, or to perform extracorporeal gas exchange processes, for example.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For instance, in a haemodialysis treatment a patient's blood and a treatment liquid approximately isotonic with blood flow are circulated in a respective compartment of haemodialyser, so that, impurities and undesired substances present in the blood (urea, creatinine, etc.) may migrate by diffusive transfer from the blood into the treatment liquid. The ion concentration of the treatment liquid is chosen so as to correct the ion concentration of the patient's blood. In a treatment by haemodiafiltration, a convective transfer by ultrafiltration, resulting from a positive pressure difference created between the blood side and the treatment-liquid side of the membrane of a haemodiafilter, is added to the diffusive transfer obtained by dialysis.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Hemoperfusion, oxygenation or decarboxylation treatments are also known.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A vascular access is used to remove the patient's blood so that it is filtered through the blood treatment unit (dialyzer, filter) and then returned to the patient. In case of chronic treatments, the vascular access may be arterio-venous. Two needles may be inserted into the vein, one to draw blood and one to return it.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The orientation of the needles takes the normal flow of the blood into account. The &#x201c;arterial&#x201d; needle draws blood from the &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; location while the &#x201c;venous&#x201d; needle returns blood &#x201c;downstream&#x201d;. In case of acute treatments, the vascular access may be veno-venous, i.e. using a double-lumen catheter inserted in a central vein. The blood treatment unit comprises pressure monitoring devices, as to check, for example, for circuit obstructions.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">Background of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the field of extracorporeal blood treatments and therapies, some problems reported by users are issues at the vascular access. Access Extremely Negative (AEN) is one of the most encountered alarm in the field, mainly linked to catheter tip stuck against blood vessel's wall or, more rarely, to clots obstructing the access way of the catheter. When this alarm relates to catheter positioning inside the vein, the nurse has to get the access pressure back closer to an atmospheric level, e.g. through the use of a Y-connector connected to the access line, unstick the catheter tip from the vein wall and then try to move the catheter inside the vein and resume the treatment.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another drawback is that at the end of the treatment, when blood is to be returned to the patient, one operator has to disconnect the patient access and connect a saline bag to the set's access line, in aseptic conditions, and another operator has to operate on the monitor of the machine in non-aseptic conditions.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, two operators are needed for one patient.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another drawback is that, as per the blood return described above, both saline and blood recirculation procedures currently require sterile and non-sterile interventions and the manual connection of supplementary devices (Y-connector, saline bag).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In all the cases detailed above, the operator has to handle the vascular access, to disconnect and eventually reconnect the same to the patient. All this implies operator workload and increased probability of occurrence for non-aseptic handling.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Furthermore, the use of a Y-connector connected to the access line involves further risks. On the access side, the user may forget to clamp the Y saline line prior to resuming the treatment. In case of blood pump stop and slightly negative patient access pressure, the saline bag content would be sucked into the catheter, causing air ingress leading to set clotting (or potentially air embolism).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Additional modules, configured to be placed in-line between the blood treatment apparatus and the patient vascular access and configured to divert the flow of blood without necessarily disconnecting the patient, are also known.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">For instance, document U.S. Pat. No. 3,626,938 discloses a shunt valve device which is designed to be mounted permanently on a body member of a person and permanently connected to the artery and vein of the person. The device is provided with valve means for selectively connecting the artery and vein to an artificial kidney or the like. The device further has rotary shunt means for directing the flow of blood back to the body member when the device is not operatively connected to the artificial kidney.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Document U.S. Pat. No. 5,894,011 discloses a device for selectively controlling the direction of blood flow to and from the patient during hemodialysis. The device comprises two interlocking disks that rotate in relation to each other without separating. The two disks have fluid fittings that allow the blood lines attached to the patient to connect to one of the disks and the blood inlet and outlet for the hemodialysis machine to connect to the other. The center of each fluid fitting is a channel that aligns to a corresponding channel in the other disk. The disks rotate between two fixed relative positions, referred to herein as preferred alignments. The preferred alignments are such that the line drawing blood from the patient in the first preferred alignment becomes the line returning blood to the patient in the second preferred alignment, and the line returning blood to the patient in the first preferred alignment becomes the line drawing blood from the patient in the second preferred alignment. A bypass channel allows blood to flow from the outlet to the inlet of the hemodialysis machine when the device is in neither of its two preferred alignments.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">These devices allow a limited number of flow path configurations and, due to their structure and geometry of the ducts, may cause pressure drops and/or clotting.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a fluid diverting device for an apparatus for extracorporeal treatment of blood, wherein the fluid diverting device is configured to divert the flow of blood or other fluid/s in order to perform a plurality of procedures (e.g. all the steps of the treatment, pre and post treatment and possible troubleshooting procedures) without necessarily disconnecting the patient.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is an object of the present invention to provide a fluid diverting device which may be easily interposed between the apparatus for extracorporeal treatment of blood and the patient, featuring various functional components and able to be set in a plurality of configurations to perform the plurality of procedures.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In particular, it is an object providing a fluid diverting device able to provide easy and safe AEN troubleshooting, blood return at the treatment end, blood recirculation, saline recirculation.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is a further object providing a fluid diverting device allowing to control its configurations in automated manner.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">It is also an object of the present invention to provide a fluid diverting device enabling offering the device features as a supplemental option with respect to the apparatus.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">It is a further object providing a fluid diverting device allowing a single person to handle the patient's vascular access in safe manner and in aseptic conditions.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">It is a further object providing a fluid diverting device offering the possibility to have some commands located conveniently nearby the patient access.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">It is a further object providing a fluid diverting device offering the possibility to operate disinfection procedures in aseptic conditions.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">It is a further object providing a fluid diverting device which is structurally simple, cost effective and reliable.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">It is a further object providing a fluid diverting device able to prevent clotting and/or to avoid high pressure losses and/or requiring minimal amounts of fluid needed for flushing said fluid diverting device.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">At least one of the above objects is substantially reached by a fluid diverting device for an apparatus for extracorporeal treatment of blood and by an apparatus for extracorporeal treatment of blood according to one or more of the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A fluid diverting device for an apparatus for extracorporeal treatment of blood, an apparatus for extracorporeal treatment of blood and a method for diverting a flow of liquid and/or blood in an apparatus for extracorporeal treatment of blood according to aspects of the invention and capable of achieving one or more of the above objects are here below described.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A 1<sup>st </sup>aspect concerns a fluid diverting device for an apparatus for extracorporeal treatment of blood.
