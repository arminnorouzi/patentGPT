The adjacent interior zone <b>14</b> may for example comprise one more galley, storage area, lavatory and/or passage depending on the configuration of the aircraft. In the illustrated example, one side of the zone <b>14</b> comprises an exterior door <b>18</b>A and associated passage <b>19</b>A, and a lavatory <b>20</b>, while the other side comprises an exterior door <b>18</b>B and associated passage <b>19</b>B, and a storage unit <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0042">At least one passenger seating installation <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B embodying one aspect of the invention is provided in the cabin <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a preferred embodiment in which there are two instances <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B of the seating installation, separated by an aisle <b>25</b>. In alternative embodiments (not illustrated) there may be only one instance of the passenger seating installation, or there may be more than two instances, and there may be more than one aisle, either of which may depend on the size and/or desired configuration of the aircraft. The cabin <b>12</b> has a longitudinal direction L, commonly referred to as the fore-and-aft direction, and the, or each, aisle typically runs in the longitudinal direction L. The direction of travel T of the aircraft is aligned with the longitudinal direction L and is in the &#x201c;fore&#x201d; direction, i.e. right-to left as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>. Each seating installation <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B typically comprises a plurality of seats <b>26</b> usually arranged in a column that extends in the longitudinal direction L. The seats <b>26</b> of each seating installation <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B may be provided in one or more row, each row comprising one or more seats <b>26</b>. Each row typically runs transversely of the cabin <b>12</b>, i.e. perpendicularly or obliquely to the longitudinal direction L, but may alternatively run obliquely with respect to the longitudinal direction L. In the illustrated embodiment, each row comprises a single seat <b>26</b>A <b>26</b>B. In embodiments, where the row(s) and/or column(s) have more than one seat <b>26</b>, the seats <b>26</b> are typically the same, or substantially the same, as each other, and are typically oriented in the same or similar manner.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0043">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, only one seat <b>26</b>A, <b>26</b>B of each seating installation <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B is shown. In particular, the seat <b>26</b>A, <b>26</b>B is a front seat that is located adjacent the respective bulkhead <b>16</b>A, <b>16</b>B. Each seat <b>26</b> faces in a direction F, the direction F therefore also being the direction in which a passenger (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>) faces when seated. In the illustrated embodiment, the direction F is a forward direction in the sense that it is generally or partly in the direction of (forward) travel T of the aircraft, i.e. in the &#x201c;fore&#x201d; direction of the fore-and-aft direction L. As such, a seated passenger faces generally forwards in the aircraft. In alternative embodiments (not illustrated), the direction F may be a rearward direction in the sense that it is generally or partly in the opposite direction to the direction of travel T of the aircraft, i.e. in the &#x201c;aft&#x201d; direction of the fore-and-aft direction L. As such, a seated passenger faces generally rearward in the aircraft.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0044">In preferred embodiments, the direction F is obliquely disposed to the longitudinal direction L, or longitudinal axis, of the cabin <b>12</b>. For example, the direction F may be at an angle of between 30&#xb0; and 60&#xb0; (inclusive) to the longitudinal direction L although smaller or larger angles may be implemented depending on the requirements of the application. In the illustrated embodiment, the direction F extends inward of the cabin <b>12</b> (towards the aisle <b>25</b> in this example) in a generally forward direction that is oblique to the fore-and-aft direction L. Alternatively, the direction F may extend inward of the cabin <b>12</b> (e.g. towards the aisle <b>25</b>) in a generally rearward direction that is oblique to the fore-and-aft direction, or outwardly of the cabin <b>12</b> (e.g. towards the cabin wall or fuselage) in a generally forward direction that is oblique to the fore-and-aft direction L, or outwardly of the cabin <b>12</b> (e.g. towards the cabin wall or fuselage) in a generally rearward direction that is oblique to the fore-and-aft direction L.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0045">In the illustrated embodiment, the first and second instances of the seating arrangement <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B are located on opposite sides of the aisle <b>25</b>, and the respective direction F of the seating arrangements <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B extends obliquely towards the aisle <b>25</b> in a generally forward direction.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0046">More generally, the cabin <b>12</b> may be a single aisle cabin, or a multi-aisle cabin in which one or more seating installations embodying the invention may be located between any aisle and the fuselage, or other vehicle body structure, or between any two aisles, and may be oriented such that their respective direction F extends obliquely away from or towards an aisle, or away from or towards an outer boundary such as the fuselage, and/or forwardly or rearwardly of the aircraft or other vehicle. Different instances of the seating installation may be oriented in different directions within the same cabin. The actual orientation and arrangement of the seating arrangement(s) in any given cabin may depend on the size of the cabin and/or on the requirements of the aircraft operator. Moreover, while the invention is particularly suited for use with aircraft, the invention may alternatively be embodied in the context of other passenger-carrying vehicles, e.g. trains, buses or boats.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0047">In preferred embodiments, each seat <b>26</b> is operable between an upright state (as illustrated) and a reclined state (not illustrated). It is further preferred that in a fully reclined position of the reclined state the seat <b>26</b> forms a bed. By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows the seat <b>26</b>A in its upright state with its back rest <b>30</b>, seat pan <b>32</b> and foot rest <b>34</b> in an upright configuration for supporting a passenger in a seated position. In the fully reclined position the back rest <b>30</b>, seat pan <b>32</b> and foot rest <b>34</b> adopt a reclined configuration in which they provide a flat or substantially flat surface (which may be parallel or substantially parallel with the floor of the cabin <b>12</b>) that serves as a bed. The seat may be configurable to adopt other reclined positions between the upright state and the fully reclined position. The seat <b>26</b> may be articulated in any convenient manner to allow it to operate between the upright and reclined states. The seat <b>26</b> may be actuated using any convenient actuation means (not shown) for moving the seat <b>26</b> between the upright and reclined states. In the illustrated embodiment, the seat <b>26</b> moves forwards when reclining and moves rearwards when moving to the upright state.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0048">Typically, each seat <b>26</b> is in a provided a passenger accommodation zone <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B that includes one or more structures, utilities and/or other features for use by a respective passenger. In the illustrated embodiment, each passenger accommodation zone <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B contains a single seat <b>26</b>A, <b>26</b>B, but in alternative embodiments, each passenger accommodation zone may include more than one seat <b>26</b>. In preferred embodiments, the passenger accommodation zone <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B includes a foot well <b>42</b> for each seat <b>26</b>. The foot well <b>42</b> is located forward of the respective seat <b>26</b> in the direction F, and is typically aligned with the respective seat in the direction F. Preferably, when the seat <b>26</b> is in its reclined state, especially when fully reclined to form a bed, at least part of the foot rest <b>34</b> extends into the foot well <b>42</b>. Optionally, the foot well <b>42</b> contains a platform <b>45</b> for receiving the passenger's feet, especially when lying on the fully reclined seat <b>26</b>. The arrangement may be such that, when the seat <b>26</b> is in its fully reclined position, the platform <b>45</b> serves as an extension of the bed provided by the seat <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0049">The passenger accommodation zone <b>40</b> typically includes any one or more of the following: one or more console <b>44</b>; one or more table (not shown), which may be fixed or deployable; one or more arm rest <b>46</b>; one or more monitor <b>48</b>, which may be fixed or deployable; one or more passenger control unit (PCU).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0050">In preferred embodiments, the seating installation <b>24</b> includes a seat surround structure <b>50</b> for each seat <b>25</b>. The seat surround structure <b>50</b> may comprise one or more wall, divider, partition and/or other structure, preferably arranged to provide privacy for the respective passenger. The seat surround structure <b>50</b> typically defines at least part of the boundary of the respective passenger accommodation zone <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0051">In preferred embodiments, a respective doorway <b>52</b> provides access between the aisle <b>25</b> and the respective accommodation zone <b>40</b>. A respective door (not visible) may be provided for opening and closing the doorway <b>52</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the door is part of a door assembly <b>54</b> that includes a housing <b>56</b> for housing the door when the doorway <b>52</b> is open (as illustrated), and from which the door may be deployed (typically in a linear manner by means of one or more sliding mechanism) in order to close the doorway <b>52</b>. The door assembly <b>54</b> may be part of, or integrated with, the respective surround structure <b>50</b>. Preferably, the doorway <b>52</b> is aligned with the aisle <b>25</b>, i.e. is disposed in a plane that is parallel or substantially parallel with the longitudinal direction L. As a result, the accommodation zone <b>40</b> for each seat <b>26</b> has a non-linear central axis when viewed in plan (as can best be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>5</b></figref>). In particular, the part of the accommodation zone <b>40</b> that contains the seat <b>26</b> has a central axis that extends in the direction F, while the part of the accommodation zone <b>40</b> adjacent the doorway <b>52</b> has a central axis that extends perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction L.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0052">When a plurality of the seats <b>26</b>, with their associated passenger accommodation zone <b>40</b>, are arranged in a column that extends along the cabin <b>12</b> in direction L, the oblique orientation of the seats <b>26</b> with respect to the aisle L facilitates using a relatively small pitch (in the direction L) between adjacent seats in the column in comparison with alternative arrangements in which the seats face parallel with or perpendicular to the direction L, while providing sufficient room for passenger comfort and meeting industry requirements, e.g. for the width of the doorway <b>52</b>. The relatively small pitch increases the seat density, i.e. the number of seats that can be installed in a given cabin area. In preferred embodiments, the relatively small pitch between adjacent seats <b>26</b> in the column is facilitated by overlapping adjacent seats and/or their respective accommodation zone <b>40</b> at least in the longitudinal direction L. For example, it can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> that adjacent seats <b>16</b> in the column that at least the adjacent armrests, and optionally part of the seat pans, of adjacent seats <b>16</b> overlap. Advantageously, the foot well <b>42</b> of a given seat <b>26</b> is provided beneath the console <b>44</b> of the seat <b>26</b> in front, which facilitates the reduced inter-seat pitch (see for example <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> from which it can be seen that the foot well <b>42</b>&#x2032; of the seat (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) adjacent the front seat <b>26</b> is provided underneath the console <b>44</b> of the front seat <b>26</b>). This arrangement is facilitated by the non-linear central axis of the accommodation zone <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0053">However, the advantages of overlapping adjacent seats does not apply to the front seat of the column since there is no seat in front of it. Instead, the front seat <b>26</b> is adjacent the bulkhead <b>16</b> which is typically disposed perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction L. However, the oblique orientation of the front seat <b>26</b> causes a seated passenger's head to be closer to the bulkhead <b>16</b> than it would be if the seat <b>26</b> faced in the direction L. Industry standards require that there is sufficient distance between a seated passenger's head and the bulkhead <b>16</b> such that her or his head does not hit the bulkhead <b>16</b> in the event of an accident. It is therefore usual to ensure that there is a sufficient distance between a front seat and a bulkhead or monument to prevent a head collision. However, depending on the relative dimensions of the cabin <b>12</b> and accommodation zone <b>40</b>, the required spacing between the front seat and the bulkhead can reduce the number of seats that can be fitted into the respective column of seats. Even if this results in only one less seat in the column, the resulting loss of revenue to the aircraft operator over the lifetime of the aircraft can be significant. Advantageously, embodiments of the invention allow the front seat <b>26</b> to be located closer to the bulkhead <b>16</b> that is conventionally achieved in order to maximize the number of seats <b>16</b> that can fit longitudinally into the cabin <b>12</b>, as is described in more detail hereinafter.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0054">In preferred embodiments, the bulkhead <b>16</b> comprises a monument. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the bulkhead <b>16</b> comprises a monument, which may be self-supporting (e.g. not supported by an adjacent support structure) and/or a stand-alone unit, or may be supported by an adjacent support structure (not shown). The monument <b>16</b> itself may serve as a bulkhead (in which case there may be no additional support structure or bulkhead structure), or the monument <b>16</b> may be located adjacent, and optionally supported by, an adjacent bulkhead structure (not shown), or may be integrally formed with another bulkhead structure. The monument <b>16</b> may for example be a storage monument, a galley monument and/or a lavatory monument. In any event, the bulkhead <b>16</b> is typically configured to provide one or more compartment (not visible), e.g. for storage and/or for receiving equipment or sanitary ware. Each bulkhead <b>16</b>A, <b>16</b>B has an obverse face <b>58</b> that faces the respective front seat <b>26</b>A, <b>26</b>B. Typically, the obverse face <b>58</b> is planar, or substantially planar. The bulkhead <b>16</b>, in particular the obverse face <b>58</b>, is typically upright, i.e. wall-like. The bulkhead <b>16</b> usually extends transversely of the cabin <b>12</b>. Typically, the obverse face <b>58</b> is disposed, or substantially disposed, in a plane that is perpendicular, or substantially perpendicular to the fore-and-aft direction L, and therefore to the direction of travel T. The direction F in which the respective front seat <b>26</b>A, <b>26</b>B faces is oblique with respect to the respective bulkhead <b>16</b>A, <b>16</b>B, and more particularly with respect to the obverse face <b>58</b> of the bulkhead <b>16</b>A, <b>16</b>B.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0055">In a conventional arrangement in which a passenger faces in the same direction as the direction of travel, the head path of the passenger (i.e. the path along which the passenger's head would travel in the event of an accident) is in the same direction as the passenger faces. However, in preferred embodiments of the invention, because the passenger faces in direction F that is oblique to the longitudinal axis L and therefore correspondingly oblique to the direction of travel T, the head path of the passenger is obliquely disposed to the direction in which he or she faces when seated; in particular, the head path is in the direction of travel T, or at least has a central or main axis that is aligned with the direction of travel T.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates in plan view a head space HS for a passenger P seated in the front seat <b>26</b>A adjacent the bulkhead <b>16</b>A. The size and shape of the head space HS is determined by a range of head paths that it is predicted that the passenger's head H may take in the event of an accident. It is assumed that direction of travel T of the aircraft is in the longitudinal direction L, and is right-to-left as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, i.e. in the &#x201c;fore&#x201d; direction of the fore-and-aft direction. Hence, the seated passenger P faces in a direction that is obliquely disposed to the direction of travel T rather than being aligned with it. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> the passenger P also faces partly or generally in the direction of travel T (i.e. towards the bulkhead <b>16</b>A) but in alternative embodiments (not illustrated) may face generally away from the bulkhead <b>16</b>A. The head space HS may be defined at least in part by a central head path CHP that extends from a head reference point HRP longitudinally, or in the direction of travel T. The head reference point HRP is a notional point representing the position of the seated passenger's head H. The length of the central head path CHP may be determined empirically by testing, preferably taking into account a range of passenger sizes. By way of example, the length of the central head path CHP may typically be between 750 mm to 950 mm. In the illustrated example, the length of the central head path CHP is approximately 845 mm. The head space HS may be further defined laterally by a left boundary head path LHP and a right boundary head path RHP which are located to the left and right of the central head path CHP respectively. The length and direction of the left and right head paths LHP, RHP may be determined empirically by testing, preferably taking into account a range of passenger sizes. In the illustrated example, the left and right head paths LHP, RHP extend from the head reference point HRP at an angle of 20&#xb0; in the azimuth plane with respect to the central head path CHP, although the angle may be larger or smaller (e.g. 10&#xb0;) depending on the embodiment. The upper and lower boundaries of the head space HS may also be determined empirically by testing. The central head path CHP may be used to define the upper boundary since the passenger's head H tends to move downwards in the event of an accident. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> which shows, by way of example, in side view first and second head paths HP<b>1</b>, HP<b>2</b>, which in this example represent the 95<sup>th </sup>percentile of passengers and the 50<sup>th </sup>percentile of passengers respectively, and which may be determined empirically by testing. It will be seen that the head path HP<b>1</b> allows a lower boundary for the head space HS to be determined. In this example, the lower boundary is 718.6 mm above the base of the seat <b>26</b>A, although this value may change from embodiment to embodiment.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0057">It will be apparent from the forgoing that a volumetric head space HS for a seated passenger may be determined based on at least one predicted head path in the event of an accident. Because the seat <b>26</b> faces in a direction F that is oblique to the direction of travel, the head space HS extends from the head reference point HRP in a forward direction (i.e. in the direction of travel T) that is oblique to the direction F in which the seated passenger faces. The head space HS typically has a main or directional axis (which may be represented by the central head path CHP in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) which extends in the longitudinal direction L, or the direction of travel T, or at least in a plane that is parallel with the plane of the longitudinal direction L or the direction of travel T. The size and shape of the head space HS may be determined empirically by testing and/or by calculation as is convenient. The illustrated example shows the seat <b>26</b>A facing generally forwards or towards the bulkhead <b>16</b>. In alternative embodiments, however, the front seat may face generally rearwards or away from the bulkhead <b>16</b> and the same or similar description in relation to the head space HS applies because the front seat still faces in a direction F that is oblique to the direction of travel, and the head space HS extends from the head reference point HRP in a forward direction that is oblique to the direction F in which the seated passenger faces.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0058">To avoid passenger head collisions with the bulkhead <b>16</b>, the front seat <b>26</b> and the bulkhead <b>16</b> must be arranged such that the bulkhead <b>16</b> does not impinge on the head space HS. This may be achieved by locating the front seat <b>26</b> sufficiently far from the obverse face <b>58</b> of the bulkhead <b>16</b> that there is no overlap between the head space HS and the bulkhead <b>16</b> in the longitudinal direction L. However, as outlined above, it is desirable to minimize the distance between the front seat <b>26</b> and the bulkhead <b>16</b> in order to increase seat density in the cabin <b>12</b>. To this end, the bulkhead <b>16</b> is shaped to define a recess <b>60</b>. The recess <b>60</b> is aligned with the head space HS and the front seat <b>16</b> is spaced apart from the bulkhead <b>16</b> at a distance such that an end portion EP of the head space HS (i.e. a portion that is distal the head reference point HRP) is located in the recess <b>60</b>, and preferably does not extend beyond the recess <b>60</b>. As such, the bulkhead <b>16</b> and the head space HS overlap in the longitudinal direction, but only in the space defined by the recess <b>60</b>. In preferred embodiments, the recess <b>60</b> is formed in the obverse face <b>58</b> of the bulkhead. Typically, the recess <b>60</b> is spaced apart from the front seat <b>26</b> (in particular when the seat <b>26</b> is in its upright state) in the direction of travel T (or in the fore direction of the fore-and-aft direction L) and in a direction that is obliquely disposed with respect to the direction F in which a seated passenger faces (whether the direction F is oriented towards or away from the bulkhead <b>16</b>). Preferably, the recess <b>60</b> is aligned with an axis (e.g. the axis CHP) that extends from the seat <b>26</b> (in particular when the seat <b>26</b> is in its upright state) in the direction of travel T. The axis may extend from any suitable reference point of the seat <b>26</b>, preferably a reference point that corresponds with a seated passenger's head and/or torso (in particular when the seat <b>26</b> is in its upright state), e.g. the HRP. Preferably, in the transverse, or lateral, direction, and in the vertical direction, the recess <b>60</b> is located such that it is aligned with the seat <b>26</b> (in particular when the seat <b>26</b> is in its upright state), in particular such that it is aligned with a seated passenger's head and/or torso.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0059">Accommodating the end portion EP of the head space HS in the recess <b>60</b> allows the seat <b>26</b> to be located closer to the bulkhead <b>16</b> than would be the case in the absence of the recess <b>60</b>. The depth of the recess <b>60</b> depends on the longitudinal distance of the seat <b>26</b> from the bulkhead <b>16</b> and the maximum length of the head space HS in the longitudinal direction and may vary from embodiment to embodiment.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0060">It is preferred that the recess <b>60</b> is shaped and dimensioned to match or substantially match the end portion EP of the head space HS. This is particularly advantageous in embodiments where the bulkhead comprises a monument, since minimizing the space defined by the recess <b>60</b> maximizes the space that remains for the monument's primary utility, e.g. storage. In preferred embodiments therefore the recess <b>60</b> does not extend to the ceiling or to the floor of the cabin, nor does it extend across the whole width of the bulkhead <b>16</b>. Typically, the bottom <b>62</b> of the recess <b>60</b> is at a level that is above the level of the seat pan <b>32</b> when the seat <b>26</b> is upright. Typically, the top 64 of the recess <b>60</b> is at a level that is at or below the level of the top of the seat <b>26</b> (e.g. the top of the head rest) when the seat <b>26</b> is in its upright state. In the lateral direction, i.e. parallel with the cabin floor, it is preferred that the recess <b>60</b> does not extend beyond the boundaries of the seat <b>26</b> when the seat is upright. In the illustrated embodiment, the recess <b>60</b> is substantially cuboid in shape, but may take any shape, regular or irregular, that suits the application. For example, the recess <b>60</b> may be formed by providing the bulkhead with a recessed face <b>58</b>A that is offset, or recessed, with respect to the obverse face <b>58</b>, and which may be parallel or substantially parallel with the obverse face <b>58</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0061">In preferred embodiments, the bulkhead <b>16</b> is shaped to define the foot well <b>42</b> for the front seat <b>26</b>. The foot well <b>42</b> may be formed as a recess that opens onto the obverse face <b>58</b> of the bulkhead <b>16</b>. In preferred embodiments, the foot well <b>42</b> is shaped and dimensioned to receive the foot rest <b>34</b> of the front seat <b>26</b> when the front seat <b>26</b> is reclined, in particular when it is reclined to form a bed. The foot well may include a platform <b>45</b> for receiving the passenger's feet, especially when lying on the fully reclined seat <b>26</b>. The preferred arrangement is such that, when the seat <b>26</b> is in its fully reclined position, the platform <b>45</b> serves as an extension of the bed provided by the seat <b>26</b>. To this end, the configuration may be such that the foot rest <b>34</b> is contiguous or substantially contiguous with the platform <b>45</b> when the seat <b>26</b> is fully reclined to form a bed. Preferably, the foot well <b>42</b> is aligned with, and located forward of, the front seat <b>26</b> in the direction F. In preferred embodiments, the foot well <b>42</b> is laterally spaced from the recess <b>60</b> in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction L. Typically, the recess <b>60</b> is located higher in the bulkhead <b>16</b> than the foot well <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0062">In preferred embodiments, a monitor <b>66</b> or other video display device is mounted on the bulkhead <b>16</b>, preferably on the obverse face <b>58</b>. Advantageously, the monitor <b>66</b> is deployable between a stowed state (as illustrated) and a deployed state in which the monitor's screen <b>68</b> faces the front seat <b>26</b> for viewing by a seated passenger. In the deployed state, the monitor <b>66</b> is typically perpendicular or substantially perpendicular to the direction F. In the stowed state, the monitor <b>66</b> is retracted towards and preferably against the bulkhead <b>16</b>, preferably such that its screen <b>68</b> is parallel or substantially parallel with the obverse face <b>58</b>. Any suitable deployment mechanism (not shown) may be provided for moving the monitor <b>66</b> between the deployed and stowed states, the deployment mechanism typically being configured to pivot and/or rotate the monitor between the deployed and stowed states. Preferably, the monitor <b>66</b> is located above the foot well <b>42</b>. Typically, the monitor <b>66</b> is located beside the recess <b>60</b>, i.e. laterally spaced from the recess <b>60</b> in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction L, i.e. in the transverse direction of the cabin.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0063">Advantageously, embodiments of the invention allow a passenger seating <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B to be integrated with a respective front row monument <b>16</b>A, <b>16</b>B (or other bulkhead structure), in particular such that the passenger accommodation zone <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B of a front seat <b>26</b>A, <b>26</b>B is integrated with the monument/bulkhead <b>16</b>A, <b>16</b>B.
