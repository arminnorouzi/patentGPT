Memory may be fabricated in one or more arrays of individual memory cells. Memory cells may be written to, or read from, using digitlines (which may also be referred to as bitlines, data lines, or sense lines) and access lines (which may also be referred to as wordlines). The digitlines may conductively interconnect memory cells along columns of the array, and the access lines may conductively interconnect memory cells along rows of the array. Each memory cell may be uniquely addressed through the combination of a digitline and an access line.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Memory cells may be volatile, semi-volatile, or non-volatile. Non-volatile memory cells can store data for extended periods of time in the absence of power. Non-volatile memory is conventionally specified to be memory having a retention time of at least about 10 years. Volatile memory dissipates and is therefore refreshed/rewritten to maintain data storage. Volatile memory may have a retention time of milliseconds or less. Regardless, memory cells are configured to retain or store memory in at least two different selectable states. In a binary system, the states are considered as either a &#x201c;0&#x201d; or a &#x201c;1&#x201d;. In other systems, at least some individual memory cells may be configured to store more than two levels or states of information.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A capacitor is one type of electronic component that may be used in a memory cell. A capacitor has two electrical conductors separated by electrically insulating material. Energy as an electric field may be electrostatically stored within such material. Depending on composition of the insulator material, that stored field will be volatile or non-volatile. For example, a capacitor insulator material including only SiO<sub>2 </sub>will be volatile. One type of non-volatile capacitor is a ferroelectric capacitor which has ferroelectric material as at least part of the insulating material. Ferroelectric materials are characterized by having two stable polarized states and thereby can comprise programmable material of a capacitor and/or memory cell. The polarization state of the ferroelectric material can be changed by application of suitable programming voltages and remains after removal of the programming voltage (at least for a time). Each polarization state has a different charge-stored capacitance from the other, and which ideally can be used to write (i.e., store) and read a memory state without reversing the polarization state until such is desired to be reversed. Less desirable, in some memory having ferroelectric capacitors the act of reading the memory state can reverse the polarization. Accordingly, upon determining the polarization state, a re-write of the memory cell is conducted to put the memory cell into the pre-read state immediately after its determination. Regardless, a memory cell incorporating a ferroelectric capacitor ideally is non-volatile due to the bi-stable characteristics of the ferroelectric material that forms a part of the capacitor. Other programmable materials may be used as a capacitor insulator to render capacitors non-volatile.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A field effect transistor is another type of electronic component that may be used in a memory cell. These transistors comprise a pair of conductive source/drain regions having a semiconductive channel region there-between. A conductive gate is adjacent the channel region and separated there-from by a thin gate insulator. Application of a suitable voltage to the gate allows current to flow from one of the source/drain regions to the other through the channel region. When the voltage is removed from the gate, current is largely prevented from flowing through the channel region. Field effect transistors may also include additional structure, for example a reversibly programmable charge-storage region as part of the gate construction between the gate insulator and the conductive gate. Regardless, the gate insulator may be programmable, for example being ferroelectric.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>7</b></figref> are diagrammatic cross-sectional views of a portion of a DRAM construction in accordance with some embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a diagrammatic cross-sectional view of a portion of a DRAM construction in accordance with some embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>17</b></figref> are diagrammatic sequential sectional views of predecessor constructions to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>7</b></figref> in a process of forming the construction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>7</b></figref> in accordance with some embodiments of the invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Embodiments of the invention encompass memory circuitry, such as DRAM, and methods used in forming memory circuitry, such as a DRAM.

However, embodiments of the invention encompass other memory cells and other constructions of integrated circuitry independent of whether containing memory cells.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Example transistor devices <b>25</b> individually comprise a pair of source/drain regions, a channel region between the pair of source/drain regions, a conductive gate operatively proximate the channel region, and a gate insulator between the conductive gate and the channel region. Devices <b>25</b> are shown as being recessed access devices, with example construction <b>8</b> showing such recessed access devices grouped in individual pairs of such devices. Individual recessed access devices <b>25</b> include a buried access line construction <b>18</b>, for example that is within a trench <b>19</b> in semiconductive material <b>12</b>. Constructions <b>18</b> comprise conductive gate material <b>22</b> (e.g., conductively-doped semiconductor material and/or metal material, including for example elemental W, Ru, and/or Mo) that functions as a conductive gate of individual devices <b>25</b>. A gate insulator <b>20</b> (e.g., silicon dioxide and/or silicon nitride) is along sidewalls <b>21</b> and a base <b>23</b> of individual trenches <b>19</b> between conductive gate material <b>22</b> and semiconductive material <b>12</b>. Insulator material <b>37</b> (e.g., silicon dioxide and/or silicon nitride) is within trenches <b>19</b> above materials <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>. Individual devices <b>25</b> comprise a pair of source/drain regions <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> in upper portions of semiconductive material <b>12</b> on opposing sides of individual trenches <b>19</b> (e.g., regions <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> being laterally outward of and higher than access line constructions <b>18</b>).

Stippling is diagrammatically shown to indicate primary conductivity-modifying dopant concentration (regardless of type), with denser stippling indicating greater dopant concentration and lighter stippling indicating lower dopant concentration. Conductivity-modifying dopant may be, and would likely be, in other portions of material <b>12</b> as shown.
