Typical wireless communication systems may employ multiple-access technologies capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources (e.g., bandwidth, transmit power, or the like). Examples of such multiple-access technologies include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) systems, time division synchronous code division multiple access (TD-SCDMA) systems, and Long Term Evolution (LTE). LTE/LTE-Advanced is a set of enhancements to the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) mobile standard promulgated by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A wireless network may include one or more base stations that support communication for a user equipment (UE) or multiple UEs. A UE may communicate with a base station via downlink communications and uplink communications. &#x201c;Downlink&#x201d; (or &#x201c;DL&#x201d;) refers to a communication link from the base station to the UE, and &#x201c;uplink&#x201d; (or &#x201c;UL&#x201d;) refers to a communication link from the UE to the base station.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The above multiple access technologies have been adopted in various telecommunication standards to provide a common protocol that enables different UEs to communicate on a municipal, national, regional, and/or global level. NR, which may be referred to as 5G, is a set of enhancements to the LTE mobile standard promulgated by the 3GPP. NR is designed to better support mobile broadband internet access by improving spectral efficiency, lowering costs, improving services, making use of new spectrum, and better integrating with other open standards using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with a cyclic prefix (CP) (CP-OFDM) on the downlink, using CP-OFDM and/or single-carrier frequency division multiplexing (SC-FDM) (also known as discrete Fourier transform spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM)) on the uplink, as well as supporting beamforming, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna technology, and carrier aggregation. As the demand for mobile broadband access continues to increase, further improvements in LTE, NR, and other radio access technologies remain useful.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some aspects described herein relate to a method of wireless communication performed by a transmitter node.

Whether such elements are implemented as hardware or software depends upon the particular application and design constraints imposed on the overall system.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">While aspects may be described herein using terminology commonly associated with a 5G or New Radio (NR) radio access technology (RAT), aspects of the present disclosure can be applied to other RATs, such as a 3G RAT, a 4G RAT, and/or a RAT subsequent to 5G (e.g., 6G).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a wireless network <b>100</b>, in accordance with the present disclosure. The wireless network <b>100</b> may be or may include elements of a 5G (e.g., NR) network and/or a 4G (e.g., Long Term Evolution (LTE)) network, among other examples. The wireless network <b>100</b> may include one or more base stations <b>110</b> (shown as a BS <b>110</b><i>a</i>, a BS <b>110</b><i>b</i>, a BS <b>110</b><i>c</i>, and a BS <b>110</b><i>d</i>), a user equipment (UE) <b>120</b> or multiple UEs <b>120</b> (shown as a UE <b>120</b><i>a</i>, a UE <b>120</b><i>b</i>, a UE <b>120</b><i>c</i>, a UE <b>120</b><i>d</i>, and a UE <b>120</b><i>e</i>), and/or other network entities. A base station <b>110</b> is an entity that communicates with UEs <b>120</b>. A base station <b>110</b> (sometimes referred to as a BS) may include, for example, an NR base station, an LTE base station, a Node B, an eNB (e.g., in 4G), a gNB (e.g., in 5G), an access point, and/or a transmission reception point (TRP). Each base station <b>110</b> may provide communication coverage for a particular geographic area. In the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), the term &#x201c;cell&#x201d; can refer to a coverage area of a base station <b>110</b> and/or a base station subsystem serving this coverage area, depending on the context in which the term is used.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A base station <b>110</b> may provide communication coverage for a macro cell, a pico cell, a femto cell, and/or another type of cell. A macro cell may cover a relatively large geographic area (e.g., several kilometers in radius) and may allow unrestricted access by UEs <b>120</b> with service subscriptions. A pico cell may cover a relatively small geographic area and may allow unrestricted access by UEs <b>120</b> with service subscription. A femto cell may cover a relatively small geographic area (e.g., a home) and may allow restricted access by UEs <b>120</b> having association with the femto cell (e.g., UEs <b>120</b> in a closed subscriber group (CSG)). A base station <b>110</b> for a macro cell may be referred to as a macro base station. A base station <b>110</b> for a pico cell may be referred to as a pico base station. A base station <b>110</b> for a femto cell may be referred to as a femto base station or an in-home base station.

These different types of base stations <b>110</b> may have different transmit power levels, different coverage areas, and/or different impacts on interference in the wireless network <b>100</b>. For example, macro base stations may have a high transmit power level (e.g., 5 to 40 watts) whereas pico base stations, femto base stations, and relay base stations may have lower transmit power levels (e.g., 0.1 to 2 watts).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A network controller <b>130</b> may couple to or communicate with a set of base stations <b>110</b> and may provide coordination and control for these base stations <b>110</b>.

The base stations <b>110</b> may communicate with one another directly or indirectly via a wireless or wireline backhaul communication link.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The UEs <b>120</b> may be dispersed throughout the wireless network <b>100</b>, and each UE <b>120</b> may be stationary or mobile. A UE <b>120</b> may include, for example, an access terminal, a terminal, a mobile station, and/or a subscriber unit. A UE <b>120</b> may be a cellular phone (e.g., a smart phone), a personal digital assistant (PDA), a wireless modem, a wireless communication device, a handheld device, a laptop computer, a cordless phone, a wireless local loop (WLL) station, a tablet, a camera, a gaming device, a netbook, a smartbook, an ultrabook, a medical device, a biometric device, a wearable device (e.g., a smart watch, smart clothing, smart glasses, a smart wristband, smart jewelry (e.g., a smart ring or a smart bracelet)), an entertainment device (e.g., a music device, a video device, and/or a satellite radio), a vehicular component or sensor, a smart meter/sensor, industrial manufacturing equipment, a global positioning system device, and/or any other suitable device that is configured to communicate via a wireless medium.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Some UEs <b>120</b> may be considered machine-type communication (MTC) or evolved or enhanced machine-type communication (eMTC) UEs. An MTC UE and/or an eMTC UE may include, for example, a robot, a drone, a remote device, a sensor, a meter, a monitor, and/or a location tag, that may communicate with a base station, another device (e.g., a remote device), or some other entity. Some UEs <b>120</b> may be considered Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, and/or may be implemented as NB-IoT (narrowband IoT) devices. Some UEs <b>120</b> may be considered a Customer Premises Equipment. A UE <b>120</b> may be included inside a housing that houses components of the UE <b>120</b>, such as processor components and/or memory components. In some examples, the processor components and the memory components may be coupled together. For example, the processor components (e.g., one or more processors) and the memory components (e.g., a memory) may be operatively coupled, communicatively coupled, electronically coupled, and/or electrically coupled.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In general, any number of wireless networks <b>100</b> may be deployed in a given geographic area. Each wireless network <b>100</b> may support a particular RAT and may operate on one or more frequencies. A RAT may be referred to as a radio technology, an air interface, or the like. A frequency may be referred to as a carrier, a frequency channel, or the like. Each frequency may support a single RAT in a given geographic area in order to avoid interference between wireless networks of different RATs. In some cases, NR or 5G RAT networks may be deployed.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some examples, two or more UEs <b>120</b> (e.g., shown as UE <b>120</b><i>a </i>and UE <b>120</b><i>e</i>) may communicate directly using one or more sidelink channels (e.g., without using a base station <b>110</b> as an intermediary to communicate with one another). For example, the UEs <b>120</b> may communicate using peer-to-peer (P2P) communications, device-to-device (D2D) communications, a vehicle-to-everything (V2X) protocol (e.g., which may include a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) protocol, a vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) protocol, or a vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) protocol), and/or a mesh network.

For example, devices of the wireless network <b>100</b> may communicate using one or more operating bands. In 5G NR, two initial operating bands have been identified as frequency range designations FR1 (410 MHz-7.125 GHz) and FR2 (24.25 GHz-52.6 GHz). It should be understood that although a portion of FR1 is greater than 6 GHz, FR1 is often referred to (interchangeably) as a &#x201c;Sub-6 GHz&#x201d; band in various documents and articles. A similar nomenclature issue sometimes occurs with regard to FR2, which is often referred to (interchangeably) as a &#x201c;millimeter wave&#x201d; band in documents and articles, despite being different from the extremely high frequency (EHF) band (30 GHz-300 GHz) which is identified by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) as a &#x201c;millimeter wave&#x201d; band.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The frequencies between FR1 and FR2 are often referred to as mid-band frequencies. Recent 5G NR studies have identified an operating band for these mid-band frequencies as frequency range designation FR3 (7.125 GHz-24.25 GHz). Frequency bands falling within FR3 may inherit FR1 characteristics and/or FR2 characteristics, and thus may effectively extend features of FR1 and/or FR2 into mid-band frequencies. In addition, higher frequency bands are currently being explored to extend 5G NR operation beyond 52.6 GHz. For example, three higher operating bands have been identified as frequency range designations FR4a or FR4-1 (52.6 GHz-71 GHz), FR4 (52.6 GHz-114.25 GHz), and FR5 (114.25 GHz-300 GHz). Each of these higher frequency bands falls within the EHF band.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">With the above examples in mind, unless specifically stated otherwise, it should be understood that the term &#x201c;sub-6 GHz&#x201d; or the like, if used herein, may broadly represent frequencies that may be less than 6 GHz, may be within FR1, or may include mid-band frequencies.

While the signal is traveling over the wireless channel, the signal may be distorted and/or noise may be added to the signal due to various factors. For example, the signal may be subject to attenuation, phase shift, scattering, power decay, large scale fading, small scale fading, interference experienced by the transmitter node, interference experienced by the receiver node, and/or capabilities of the transmitter node and/or the receiver node (e.g., multi-antenna capabilities and/or maximum transmission power), among other examples. Accordingly, in order to adapt transmission parameters and/or reception parameters to ensure that the signal can be received and properly decoded by the receiver node, the transmitter node and/or the receiver node may perform channel estimation to learn characteristics associated with the wireless channel between the transmitter node and the receiver node and correct for any distortion or noise in the wireless channel.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">For example, before each transmission and/or at periodic intervals, the wireless channel between the transmitter node and the receiver node may be learned based on pilot or reference signals that are transmitted over the wireless channel. For example, in order to estimate a downlink channel from a base station to a UE, the base station may transmit a channel state information reference signal (CSI-RS) or another suitable pilot or reference signal to the UE. The UE may then measure or otherwise estimate the downlink channel using the CSI-RS (e.g., based on a correlation between properties associated with the transmitted CSI-RS and properties associated with the received CSI-RS), use the estimated downlink channel to demodulate a downlink signal, and transmit channel state feedback based on the estimated downlink channel to the base station (e.g., in a CSI report). The base station may then use the channel state feedback to adapt one or more transmission parameters for a downlink transmission to occur in a next time instance (e.g., the base station may adapt a modulation order, code rate, precoder, transmission power, and/or other suitable parameters based on a quality or strength of the downlink channel). Furthermore, for an uplink channel, the UE may transmit a sounding reference signal (SRS) to enable the base station to perform uplink channel estimation and demodulate an uplink transmission in a similar manner.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In general, the state associated with a wireless channel (e.g., the characteristics or properties of a wireless channel that are learned from measuring a reference signal) tends to be highly dynamic, as channel estimation may depend on factors such as device mobility affecting the number and/or relative positions of devices within a wireless environment, physical properties of the wireless environment surrounding the transmitter node and the receiver node (e.g., objects that may reflect, scatter, and/or block wireless signals), and/or other factors. Accordingly, in a wireless environment where the presence and/or movement of devices and/or objects dynamically vary, the channel estimate used to adapt transmission parameters and/or improve demodulation performance is neither static nor predictable from one time instance to the next. The transmitter node and the receiver node therefore need to frequently perform channel estimation and/or provide channel state feedback based on reference signal transmissions (e.g., at every time instance, before every transmission, and/or at periodic intervals), which can introduce significant overhead in a wireless network (e.g., requiring frequent reference signal transmissions, measurements, and/or transmission of channel state feedback). Furthermore, channel estimation tends to be a reactive mechanism, where transmission and/or reception parameters are adapted based on current or recent conditions associated with a wireless channel that could potentially no longer exist at the time that a transmission is actually performed.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Accordingly, some aspects described herein relate to adaptive transmission and transmission path selection based on a predicted channel state. For example, in some aspects, a transmitter node may obtain a machine learning model (e.g., a long short-term memory (LSTM), a gated recurrent unit (GRU), or a recurrent neural network (RNN), among other examples) that can be used to predict a future state associated with a wireless channel at a future time instance. A future time instance can include one or more time instants and/or one or more time periods. The transmitter node may then select one or more transmission parameters for a transmission to occur at the future time instance and/or one or more transmission paths over which to send the transmission based on the predicted state of the wireless channel at the future time instance. For example, at a current time instance, the transmitter node may infer or otherwise predict the state of the wireless channel at a future time instance based on weights associated with the machine learning model, a current state associated with the wireless channel, and one or more previous states associated with the wireless channel. In this way, the transmitter node may proactively adapt transmissions based on the channel state that is predicted to occur at the future time instance and/or select the optimal transmission path(s) to a destination node to receive the transmission, which may reduce signaling overhead and/or delays associated with channel estimation that is dependent on reference signal transmissions. Furthermore, in some aspects, adaptive transmission and transmission path selection based on a predicted channel state may be particularly well-suited to wireless environments where channel conditions are semi-static and/or applications that have ultra-low latency requirements that cannot be satisfied when there is a need to perform channel estimation based on reference signal transmissions.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an in-vehicle wireless environment in which a wireless channel may have a semi-static configuration based on various devices having fixed positions and/or predictable motion patterns. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the in-vehicle wireless environment may include a head unit <b>310</b>, a telematics control unit (TCU) <b>320</b>, an antenna module <b>330</b>, a tethered phone <b>340</b> that may provide screen mirroring via the head unit <b>310</b> and/or telephony functions via the head unit <b>310</b> or the TCU <b>320</b>, a rear seat entertainment unit <b>350</b> to stream content, a camera <b>360</b> that can capture images of the environment around the vehicle, a brought-in device <b>370</b> that may connect to a wireless local area network (WLAN) hotspot provided by the head unit <b>310</b>, the TCU <b>320</b>, and/or the antenna module <b>330</b>, and/or other devices (e.g., sensors that may monitor a state of the vehicle and/or the environment around the vehicle and/or actuators that may control one or more systems in the vehicle). In general, the devices that transmit and receive wireless signals in the in-vehicle wireless environment may have fixed and/or relatively stationary positions, whereby the wireless channels experienced by the transmitting and receiving devices tends to be semi-static. Furthermore, in some wireless environments (e.g., an industrial IoT (IIoT) environment), devices and/or objects in the wireless environment may have highly predictable motion patterns (e.g., a robot arm that moves to pick up an object at a first location and put down the object in a different location). Accordingly, in some aspects, model-based channel prediction may be used in semi-static wireless environments, where devices can learn the characteristics of the wireless channel and predict the state of the wireless channel for future time instances with a high level of accuracy because the number, relative positions, and/or motion patterns of devices is fixed or predictable.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Furthermore, as described herein, model-based channel prediction may provide proactive mechanisms to adapt transmission parameter, whereas existing channel estimation techniques tend to be reactive based on reference signal transmissions. In this way, the model-based channel prediction may improve performance for applications that require ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC). For example, in an in-vehicle wireless environment, internal mechanisms that involve wireless communication between in-vehicle systems (e.g., brake transmission control, engine transmissions, intra-sensor communications) may have a URLLC requirement. Furthermore, URLLC requirements may be applicable in IIoT environments that involve highly precise and coordinated movements among devices. In these (and other) applications that have a URLCC requirement, reactive channel estimation techniques based on reference signal transmissions, where channel estimation and/or feedback is needed for every transmissions, are not optimal or practical due to the delays that are incurred using reactive channel estimation techniques. Accordingly, in some aspects, the model-based channel prediction techniques described herein may ensure that packets are deterministically delivered when transmitted the first time (e.g., minimizing reliance on retransmissions based on negative acknowledgement (NACK) feedback) while maximizing spectral efficiency. Additionally, or alternatively, in cases where there are multiple possible paths from a transmitter node to a destination node (e.g., there are one or more intermediate nodes that can be used to relay a transmission from the transmitter node to the destination node via one or more hops), the model-based channel prediction techniques described herein may enable the transmitter node to select one or more paths over other possible paths based on the predicted channel state that is likely to occur in each link.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As indicated above, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is provided as an example.

For example, in some aspects, the machine learning model may be an LSTM model in which each neuron or LSTM unit includes a cell that remembers values over arbitrary time intervals in addition to an input gate, an output gate, and a forget gate that regulate information flow into and out of the cell. In another example, the machine learning model may be a GRU, which is generally similar to an LSTM model except that a GRU does not have an output gate, which may improve performance on smaller and/or less frequent datasets. In another example, the machine learning model may be an RNN, which is an artificial neural network in which connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence.

Furthermore, as described herein, the assisting node may indicate one or more architectural parameters for the machine learning model. For example, in some aspects, the architectural parameters may include a number of layers associated with the machine learning model, activation functions used in different layers, weights associated with the different layers, drop-out parameters, architectural connection parameters for one or more gates (e.g., cell gates and/or forget gates), and/or inputs to an inference algorithm, among other examples.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, and by reference number <b>420</b>, the transmitter node may use the machine learning model to predict a future state associated with a wireless channel at a future time instance.

For example, at a current time n, the one or more inputs that relate to the current state or the previous state(s) of the wireless channel may include one or more measurements (e.g., an RSSI or RSRP) associated with received signals, a number of sensed devices in a vicinity of the transmitter node (e.g., a number of sensed UEs based on decoded sidelink control information (SCI)), a number of sensed devices in the vicinity of the transmitter node that are moving at a speed that satisfies (e.g., is greater than or equal to) a threshold, and/or a geographical area that indicates where the transmitter node is located (e.g., based on a zone identifier or a circular region with a preconfigured radius with the transmitter node at the center of the circular region), among other examples.

In general, as described herein, the map information that indicates the multiple possible transmission paths and the predicted channel states may be based on relative locations of the transmitter node, the destination node, and any intermediate nodes in the vicinity of the transmitter node and the destination node.

More generally, the transmitter node may use more than one transmission path (e.g., the direct path and one or more indirect paths, or multiple indirect paths) to create diversity because the value of the predicted channel state indicates poor channel conditions. Accordingly, in some aspects, the value of the predicted channel state may be used to determine a diversity order, which may indicate a number of transmission paths over which the transmitter node performs a groupcast to increase path diversity (e.g., a diversity order of two (2) may indicate that two (2) alternate paths are to be used for the groupcast transmission of the packet). In other examples, the transmitter node may transmit the packet to one or more intermediate nodes that are within a threshold distance based on the predicted channel state having a value in a certain range, and the intermediate node(s) may forward the packet to the destination node via one or more hops, or the transmitter node may transmit the packet to the destination node over the direct path only based on the predicted channel state having a value that satisfies a threshold indicating strong channel conditions.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In this way, the transmitter node may select the best transmission path(s) to increase a probability that the packet will successfully arrive at the destination node based on the predicted channel conditions and the availability of one or more intermediate nodes that can relay the packet to the destination node.
