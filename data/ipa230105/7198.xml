More specifically, the present disclosure relates to an imaging element that detects an image plane phase difference and a method for manufacturing the imaging element.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, an imaging element that performs autofocus has been used. For example, an imaging element is used that performs autofocus by arranging phase difference pixels that detect an image plane phase difference to detect a focal position of a subject, and adjusting a position of an imaging lens according to the detected focal position. At this time, the phase difference pixels include a pair of pixels. Light components transmitted through different positions of the imaging lens, for example, a right side and a left side of the imaging lens, are each incident on the pair of phase difference pixels to perform imaging, and an image signal is generated for each phase difference pixel. A phase difference of an image based on each of the generated image signals is detected, so that the focal position can be detected. A method of dividing the light component transmitted through the imaging lens into two in this way is called pupil division.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As such an imaging element, an imaging element is used in which an on-chip lens common to two adjacent pixels is arranged to form phase difference pixels, so that the pupil division is performed. By condensing light components from a subject on the two pixels through the commonly arranged on-chip lens, it is possible to apply, to these pixels, light components transmitted through different positions of an imaging lens. For example, an imaging element has been proposed in which a first microlens and a film covering the first microlens are formed for each pixel, and a second microlens is formed on a surface of a film of a focus detection pixel (see, for example, Patent Document 1). In this conventional technology, the microlenses and the focus detection pixel correspond to the on-chip lens and the phase difference pixel, respectively. Furthermore, the film on a surface of the first microlens is used as an etching stopper when the second microlens is formed by etching.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2016-001682</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the above-described conventional technology, a condensing point is adjusted in order to improve autofocus performance of the focus detection pixel. To perform the adjustment of the condensing point, the on-chip lens and the film are formed on the phase difference pixel, and then a second on-chip lens that commonly covers on-chip lenses of two phase difference pixels is formed. As described above, in the above-described conventional technology, there is a problem that since the on-chip lenses of the phase difference pixels are formed by two steps of forming the on-chip lens, the steps of forming the on-chip lens are complicated.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure has been made in view of the above-described problem, and an object of the present disclosure

An imaging element <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes a pixel array unit <b>10</b>, a vertical drive unit <b>20</b>, a column signal processing unit <b>30</b>, and a control unit <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The pixel array unit <b>10</b> is formed by arranging pixels <b>100</b> in a two-dimensional lattice shape. Here, each of the pixels <b>100</b> generates an image signal according to an applied light component. The pixel <b>100</b> includes a photoelectric conversion unit that generates an electric charge according to the applied light component. The pixel <b>100</b> further includes a pixel circuit. This pixel circuit generates an image signal based on the electric charge generated by the photoelectric conversion unit. The generation of the image signal is controlled by a control signal generated by the vertical drive unit <b>20</b> described later. In the pixel array unit <b>10</b>, signal lines <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> are arranged in an X-Y matrix. The signal line <b>11</b> is a signal line that transmits the control signal for the pixel circuit of the pixel <b>100</b>, is arranged for each row of the pixel array unit <b>10</b>, and is commonly wired to the pixels <b>100</b> arranged in each row. The signal line <b>12</b> is a signal line that transmits the image signal generated by the pixel circuit of the pixel <b>100</b>, is arranged for each column of the pixel array unit <b>10</b>, and is commonly wired to the pixels <b>100</b> arranged in each column. These photoelectric conversion units and pixel circuits are formed on a semiconductor substrate.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The vertical drive unit <b>20</b> generates the control signal for the pixel circuit of the pixel <b>100</b>. The vertical drive unit <b>20</b> transmits the generated control signal to the pixel <b>100</b> via the signal line <b>11</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The column signal processing unit <b>30</b> processes the image signal generated by the pixel <b>100</b>. The column signal processing unit <b>30</b> processes the image signal transmitted from the pixel <b>100</b> via the signal line <b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The processing in the column signal processing unit <b>30</b> corresponds to, for example, analog-digital conversion that converts an analog image signal generated in the pixel <b>100</b> into a digital image signal. The image signal processed by the column signal processing unit <b>30</b> is output as an image signal of the imaging element <b>1</b>. The control unit <b>40</b> controls the entire imaging element <b>1</b>. The control unit <b>40</b> controls the imaging element <b>1</b> by generating and outputting control signals that control the vertical drive unit <b>20</b> and the column signal processing unit <b>30</b>.

The phase difference pixels <b>300</b> are pixels for detecting an image plane phase difference. The phase difference pixels <b>300</b> are arranged adjacent to each other on the left and right, for example, to perform pupil division. A plurality of such phase difference pixels <b>300</b> adjacent to each other on the left and right is linearly arranged in the pixel array unit <b>10</b>. Image signals generated by the plurality of phase difference pixels <b>300</b> are output from the imaging element <b>1</b> and processed by a device such as a camera that uses the imaging element <b>1</b>. Specifically, the image signals generated by the phase difference pixels <b>300</b> adjacent to each other on the left and right generate images by light components transmitted through a right side and a left side of an imaging lens. When a phase difference in these images is detected, a focal position of a subject is detected, and a position of the imaging lens is adjusted on the basis of the detected focal position, so that autofocus is executed.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Furthermore, the phase difference pixel adjacent pixels <b>200</b> are pixels arranged adjacent to the two phase difference pixels <b>300</b> so as to surround a periphery of the two phase difference pixels <b>300</b>.

A curved surface is formed convexly from this bottom surface to form a lens shape, so that incident light components are condensed. Furthermore, the phase difference pixels <b>300</b> and the phase difference pixel adjacent pixels <b>200</b> are formed to have substantially the same shape as the pixels <b>100</b>. Dotted lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> represent the phase difference pixel adjacent pixels <b>200</b> and the phase difference pixels <b>300</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the common on-chip lens <b>310</b> is formed to have a shape with an area smaller than a total area of the two phase difference pixels <b>300</b>. Furthermore, the common on-chip lens <b>310</b> is formed as a hexagon in which long sides of a rectangular shape formed with the two phase difference pixels <b>300</b> are divided into two parts and taper toward short sides of the rectangular shape, and is formed to have a bottom surface that approximates an ellipse. In addition, the common on-chip lens <b>310</b> is formed to have a shape in which a size in the long side direction described above is reduced. By forming the common on-chip lens <b>310</b> to have such a shape, it is possible to improve the separation accuracy of pupil division in the phase difference pixels <b>300</b> and improve the detection accuracy of the phase difference.

Elements such as the photoelectric conversion units are formed in a well region <b>151</b> formed in the semiconductor substrate <b>150</b>. For convenience, it is assumed that the semiconductor substrate <b>150</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> forms a p-type well region <b>151</b>. An n-type semiconductor region <b>152</b> is formed for each pixel in the p-type well region <b>151</b>. A photodiode is formed by a p-n junction formed at an interface between the n-type semiconductor region <b>152</b> and the p-type well region <b>151</b> around the n-type semiconductor region <b>152</b>. This photodiode corresponds to the photoelectric conversion unit. In the semiconductor substrate <b>150</b>, separation portions <b>153</b> are arranged at the boundary of the pixels <b>100</b> and the like. Each of the separation portions <b>153</b> includes an insulating film or the like, and electrically separates the pixels <b>100</b> and the like.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The wiring region <b>160</b> is a region where wiring of the pixel circuits and the like is formed. This wiring region includes a wiring layer <b>162</b> and an insulating layer <b>161</b>. The wiring layer <b>162</b> is a wiring that includes metal or the like and transmits a signal such as an image signal. The insulating layer <b>161</b> insulates the wiring layer <b>162</b>.

As the color filters <b>141</b>, color filters <b>141</b> through which a red light component, a green light component, and a blue light component are transmitted can be used. The light-shielding films <b>142</b> are arranged at the boundary of the color filters <b>141</b> adjacent to each other to block the incident light components obliquely transmitted through the color filters <b>141</b>. Arranging the light-shielding films <b>142</b> can prevent color mixing. Each of the light-shielding films <b>142</b> can include a material having a light-shielding property, for example, metal such as aluminum or tungsten.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The flattening film <b>130</b> is a film that flattens surfaces of the pixels <b>100</b> and the like. This flattening film <b>130</b> can include a resin or the like, and can include the same material as the on-chip lenses <b>110</b> and the like described later.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The on-chip lenses <b>110</b>, the adjacent on-chip lenses <b>210</b> and <b>215</b>, and the common on-chip lens <b>310</b> are lenses that condense the incident light components on the pixels <b>100</b> and the like as described above. The on-chip lenses <b>110</b> condense the incident light components on the vicinity of surfaces of the n-type semiconductor regions <b>152</b> of the pixels <b>100</b>. Similarly, the adjacent on-chip lenses <b>210</b> and <b>215</b> condense the incident light components on the vicinity of surfaces of the n-type semiconductor regions <b>152</b> of the phase difference pixel adjacent pixels <b>200</b>.

For this purpose, it is necessary to arrange a condensing position of the common on-chip lens <b>310</b> at the center of the two phase difference pixels <b>300</b> and reduce a region where the light components are condensed to a circular region. Therefore, the common on-chip lens <b>310</b> is formed to have a size smaller than a region where the two phase difference pixels <b>300</b> are combined, and a curvature of the common on-chip lens <b>310</b> is increased to form a hemispherical shape.

Furthermore, the adjacent on-chip lenses <b>210</b> and <b>215</b> are formed to have the same depth as the end portion <b>301</b> of the common on-chip lens <b>310</b>.
