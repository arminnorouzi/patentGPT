They are used in automotive industry and in particular in the truck industry. DE 10 2017 004 436 A1 discloses for example such an electromechanical brake actuator having a cam disc and a push rod, which have coupling surfaces in contact with each other, which slide or roll against each other for direct transmission of the drive torque between cam disc and push rod.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In brake actuators of the aforementioned type, an electric motor provides a driving torque upon receiving a brake signal provided, for example, by a foot pedal. The driving torque is transmitted by a rotational movement of the cam disc to a push rod. Advanced by the rotational movement of the cam disc, the push rod moves towards its extended position to transmit a braking force to a braking disc.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In such a brake actuator, the push rod and the cam disc are operatively coupled such that the rotational movement of the cam disc causes a linear movement of the push rod. Furthermore, the rotational movement of the cam disc causes a pivoting movement in a predefined angle range. This inclination results in stresses and friction acting on the casing when the push rod is moving between its retracted and extended position, thereby potentially reducing the otherwise obtainable service life of the brake actuator.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, it has been an object of the present disclosure to provide a brake actuator that overcomes the aforementioned challenges as much as possible. In particular, it has been an object to provide a brake actuator having an increased wear resistance and increased service life.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, the present disclosure solves the underlying problem for a brake actuator of the initially mentioned type by providing that a guiding member, in particular a bushing, is mounted to the casing, wherein the guiding member is configured to guide the movement of the push rod in a longitudinal direction. The present disclosure is based upon the realization that such a guiding member provides an increased wear resistance thereby protecting the casing against stresses and friction. Accordingly, in such a brake actuator a cost-efficient material can be chosen for the casing.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a particularly preferred embodiment, the guiding member has a first contact surface, and the push rod has a corresponding second contact surface that is in sliding contact with the first contact surface. By having such contact surfaces, a low friction guiding of the movement of the push rod in the longitudinal direction is provided. Such contact surfaces can, for example, have special coatings in order to reduce the friction and to increase the wear resistance.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Preferably, the first contact surface is curved, preferably being part-cylindrical or cylindrical. By providing a curved contact surface, sharp edges and the like are avoided, thereby increasing the wear resistance and consequently the service life.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably, the second contact surface has a corresponding curvature, preferably being part-spherical. By providing that the second contact surface has a curvature corresponding to the curvature of the first contact surface, the guidance of the push rod is further improved and the wear resistance and consequently the service life is increased, as sharp edges and the like at the second contact surface are also avoided.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a further preferred embodiment, the guiding member has at least one slot extending in the longitudinal direction and configured to receive the cam disc at least partially. By providing a slot, the arrangement of the casing, the guiding member, and the cam disc is more compact and the required space for the brake actuator is reduced. Further, the guiding member provides a sufficient guidance for the push rod, as the slot has no significant influence on the sliding contact of the guiding member and the push rod.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the slot is a first slot and the guiding member further has a second slot extending in longitudinal direction, wherein the second slot is arranged opposite to the first slot, and wherein the first and second slots are configured to receive the cam disc at least partially.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, the first and second slots have a width that corresponds to the thickness of the cam disc. Hence, the contact surface for guiding push rod can be maximized, as the width of the slot reducing the contact surface is only as large as required for receiving the cam disc.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, the guiding member is at least partially arranged in the casing. By arranging the guiding member at least partially in the casing, the arrangement is more compact and the guiding member can easily be integrated in the casing.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, the guiding member is mounted to the casing in a non-positive connection, preferably in a press fit. Thus, the present disclosure advantageously recognizes that a non-positive connection is a cost-effective, secure, and easy-to-handle solution to mount the guiding member to the casing. In particular, a press fit is easy to manufacture and can be integrated in the brake actuator by pressing the guiding member into the casing before inserting the push rod in the casing.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a further preferred embodiment, the brake actuator further includes a return spring operatively coupled to the push rod, and effective to urge the push rod towards its retracted position. By providing such a return spring, the present disclosure advantageously recognizes that the guidance of the push rod, and especially of a rod portion of the push rod that extends in the longitudinal direction, is improved. Further, the push rod will automatically rest in its retracted position until a driving torque is applied by the electric motor.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Preferably, the guiding member has a first face end facing the cam disc and a second face end facing away from the cam disc, and the guiding member further includes a projection of the second face end extending radially inwards. Such a projection provides a sufficient mounting and/or supporting interface. As the projection extends radially inwards, the guiding member is more compact.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, the return spring is mounted inside the guiding member against the projection. Thus, the projection provides a spring seat for the return spring. By mounting the return spring in the guiding member, the movement of the return spring for expanding and retracting is guided by the guiding member. Furthermore, a more compact arrangement of the return spring and the guiding member is provided, thereby reducing the installation space of the brake actuator.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferably, the guiding member is formed partially or completely of a material having a high strength and a low friction coefficient, preferably steel or high strength polymer. Hence, the wear resistance and consequently the service life is further improved.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a further preferred embodiment, the brake actuator includes a pivot lever configured for applying a braking force on a brake disc, wherein the pivot lever and the push rod are engaged such that the linear movement of the push rod advances a pivoting movement of the lever. Such a lever provides a sufficient transmission of the linear movement of the push rod, due to the rotational movement of the cam disc, to a braking disc by urging a pair of braking pads towards the braking disc.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present disclosure has been described in a first aspect with respect to a brake actuator. In a second aspect, the invention also relates to the use of a guiding member for a brake actuator according to the preferred embodiments of the present disclosure described above, wherein the casing has a first mounting interface, and the guiding member has a second mounting interface that corresponds to the first mounting interface, wherein the second mounting interface is configured to be engaged with the first mounting interface for mounting the guiding member to the casing.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to the second aspect, the present disclosure solves the initially mentioned problem in that the guiding member is used to guide the movement of the push rod in the longitudinal direction. By using such a guiding member, the wear resistance is improved, thereby increasing the service life of such a brake actuator. The examples and preferred embodiments of the brake actuator of the first aspect as described above are also the preferred examples and preferred embodiment of the use of a guiding member for such a brake actuator and vice versa.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">For a more complete understanding of the present disclosure, the present disclosure will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a sectional view of a brake actuator according to a first embodiment in a retracted position,</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a sectional view of the brake actuator according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in an extended position,</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a sectional view of a brake actuator according to a second preferred embodiment,</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective sectional view of the brake actuator according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>,</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a front view of the brake actuator according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, and</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a sectional side view of the brake actuator according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The brake actuator <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> includes a casing <b>10</b>, a cam disc <b>20</b> rotatable mounted to the casing <b>10</b>, a push rod <b>30</b>, and a guiding member <b>40</b> mounted to the casing <b>10</b>, wherein the push rod <b>30</b> is received in the guiding member <b>40</b>.
