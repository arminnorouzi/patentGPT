These are in detail:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0008">Progressive loading of implants (increasing occlusal loading to allow adaptation of the implant-bone interface);</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0009">Resin for shaping the occlusal complex;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0010">Intramobile cylinder element of IMZ implants;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0011">Cementing implant-supported restorations with variably compensating cement layer; and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0012">Use of soft plastic secondary components as fixation for removable prostheses.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0005" num="0013">Because these compensatory mechanisms do not have a preferred direction, their effectiveness is questionable and some have disappeared from clinical practice again.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0014">Several fixation types, also known as attachment types, are available for anchoring removable prostheses:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0015">Bar</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0016">Ball anchor</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0017">Magnet</li>        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0018">Locator</li>        <li id="ul0006-0005" num="0019">Telescope (individually milled cylinder or cone telescope/prefabricated cone telescope).</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0007" num="0020">Single standing anchors (attachments) allow greater flexibility in prosthesis fabrication, as non-optimal implant positions can be compensated. They also allow better cleaning by the patient. Traditionally, at least two implants are required to anchor a prosthesis. If these are not parallel to each other, there is increased wear at the interface of a male anchoring part (male part attachment) and a female anchoring part (female part attachment).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0021">Although prefabricated telescopes are available in the form of cone telescopes, telescopes are predominantly milled individually, which makes them expensive to manufacture. With telescopes on natural teeth, there is a reduction in retention force during the initial wearing phase as the teeth move into the positions predetermined by the telescopes. This does not happen or does not happen to a sufficient extent with implants, which leads to problems in setting a pull-off force that is adequate for the patient and uniform on all telescopes. This phenomenon is also due to inaccuracies in the transfer of implant positions as well as their ankylotic fixation. In vitro experiments carried out in the context of the present invention showed that the pull-off force of two interlocked telescopes was lower when they were fixed on resiliently supported implants compared to situations with rigidly supported implants.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0022">Further investigations and tests carried out in the context of the invention have shown that in the case of rigid attachments (anchoring), in addition to loads due to the deformation of the mandible, the momentum loading of the implants under chewing load on the prosthesis saddles is critical. Here magnets offer advantages as anchoring elements, as they lead to decoupling of implant and prosthesis.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0023">However, due to corrosion processes and low retention force, magnets have not become established. Resilience telescopes, which have a compensating mechanism due to an incorporated free space between the primary and secondary crowns, behave comparably favorably, but are difficult to manufacture. Consequently, a clinical study showed a lower after-care effort with resilience telescopes than with the use of ball anchors. That momentum loads are critical can be deduced from another clinical study in which two implants in the maxilla were used with telescopes to anchor a prosthesis and performed significantly worse compared to the use of natural abutments. In the mandible, due to the better bone quality, the clinical results seem to be better when using two implants with any attachments (anchoring), i.e. the bone seems to be able to tolerate the momentum loads there.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0024">As another known, comparatively new form of therapy for the edentulous mandible a single implant placed centrally in the anterior region, which is only intended to increase the positional stability of the prosthesis, is advocated. However, rocking of the prosthesis over the implant must be avoided. The anchorings or anchoring devices (attachments) described above are also used here. The implant is inserted as far anteriorly as possible in order to have only one direction of movement of the prosthesis, namely dorsal sinking. Eccentric implant positions, such as the otherwise frequently used canine region, are avoided, although anatomical reasons, such as the occurrence of a neurovascular canal in the center of the mandible, make these preferable.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0025">It is therefore the task of the present invention to create an anchoring device for removable, implant-supported dental prostheses according to the preamble of claim <b>1</b>, which prevents overloading of the implant and the peri-implant bone and compensates for disparallelities.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0026">This task is solved by the features of claim <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0027">Advantageously, by providing an elastic connection element between the male anchoring part and the connection to the implant, an elastic connection can be created between these two components. The arrangement is chosen in such a way that a vertical change in position between the implant and anchoring or prosthesis is not possible, or at least hardly possible, while lateral changes in position and changes in angle are, however, easily possible.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0028">An in vitro study carried out in the context of the present invention has shown that the loading situation of the peri-implant bone is more favorable when using one or two implants in the mandible with such elastic anchoring elements for prosthesis retention than with anchorings that do not have an elastic connection element between male part and base.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0029">Particularly with the previously explained use of one or two implants for prosthesis retention, prosthesis displacement occurs under chewing load. A further advantage of the present invention consists in an adjustable restoring force of the anchoring device, which restoring force is in particular adjustable via the diameter of the connection element. When the prosthesis is unloaded, this leads to a return to its bearing congruent rest position. The connection element can also compensate for greater abutment disparallelism than is possible with known anchoring devices.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0030">The arrangement of the elastic connection element can be done in the following way:<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0031">between the base, in particular its implant connection geometry, and the male anchoring part, wherein the connection element can also be designed as a separately available product;</li>        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0032">the entire anchoring device may be of elastic construction, in particular of a shape memory alloy;</li>        <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0033">the connection element can form the male anchoring part and is connected to the implant connection geometry of the base.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0018" num="0034">The dependent claims deal with advantageous further embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0035">In particular, the connection element may be wire-shaped and, in a particularly preferred embodiment, the material of the connection element is a shape memory alloy. A particularly preferred material for the shape memory alloy is nickel-titanium (NiTi).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0036">In another particularly preferred embodiment, it is possible to adjust the restoring force of the connection element using different diameter sizes of the connection element.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0021" num="0037">Further details, advantages and features of the present invention will be apparent from the following description of embodiments based on the drawing.
