id="p-0002" num="0001">Surgical adhesives designed to interface with tissues, especially for internal use, must be biocompatible, easy to apply, and able to adhere to biological tissues under wet, dry, clean and/or biofouled conditions. These requirements, however, greatly limit the application of surgical adhesives in biomedical applications, with current commercially available surgical adhesives presenting one or more of undesirable strength, toxicity, difficult workflow, and/or requiring clean, dry surfaces for optimal performance.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Severe traumatic craniomaxillofacial (CMF) fracture commonly occurs due to high energy trauma such as motor vehicle accidents, sports injuries, war injuries, and physical assault. Many of these fractures require surgical stabilization and/or reconstructed. Current adhesives that may be used to stabilize CMF and other fractures suffer from one or more of the following deficiencies: high water solubility, weak bond strength, a curing time that is either too slow or too fast, irreversible rigid curing that does not allow proper reduction, and a lack of biocompatibility. Therefore, there exists a need for new bioadhesives.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention features adhesive devices for holding objects (e.g., bone fragments) fixed in position with respect to each other.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a first aspect, the invention features a method for stabilizing bone fragments in a body, the method comprising the steps of:</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">(i) forming a first anchor on a first bone fragment by (a) heating an adhesive composition to form a softened adhesive composition and contacting the softened adhesive composition to the first bone fragment, and (b) permitting the softened adhesive composition to cool to form the first anchor affixed to the first bone fragment;</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">(ii) forming a second anchor on a second bone fragment by (a) heating an adhesive composition to form a softened adhesive composition and contacting the softened adhesive composition to the second bone fragment, and (b) permitting the softened adhesive composition to cool to form the second anchor affixed to the second bone fragment;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">wherein the adhesive composition has a tackifying temperature of at least 40&#xb0; C. (e.g., at least 42&#xb0; C., at least 45&#xb0; C., at least 50&#xb0; C., at least 55&#xb0; C., or between from 40&#xb0; C. to 55&#xb0; C.), and</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">wherein the first anchor and the second anchor are connected to a support structure for stabilizing the bone fragments.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the support structure is a flexible support comprising a biodegradable and biocompatible polymer linking the first anchor to the second anchor. In some embodiments, the support structure, the first anchor, and the second anchor are formed from a tape comprising (x) a non-adhesive top layer that is the support structure, and (y) a bottom layer that is adhesive when softened to form the first anchor and the second anchor.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the adhesive composition is not water soluble (e.g., has a water solubility at 25&#xb0; C. of less than 30 mg/L, 25 mg/L, 20 mg/L, or 15 mg/L). In other embodiments, the adhesive composition is water soluble (e.g., has a solubility in water at 25&#xb0; C. of greater than 30 mg/L or 50 mg/L).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the adhesive composition comprises an inorganic particulate additive heat transfer agent. In some embodiments, the heat transfer agent (e.g., sodium chloride, iron(III) phosphate dihydrate, iron(III) citrate monohydrate, hydroxyapatite, tetracalcium phosphate, and sodium carbonate, or a combination thereof (e.g., hydroxyapatite)) is present in an amount that permits the softened adhesive composition to cool and harden in 120 seconds or less (e.g., 10 seconds or less). In some embodiments, the heat transfer agent is present in an amount that permits the adhesive composition to soften within 120 seconds or less of applying energy (e.g., within 10 seconds or less). In particular embodiments, the heat transfer agent is present in an amount that permits the adhesive composition to soften within 10 seconds or less of applying energy to the non-adhesive top layer. In some embodiments, the adhesive composition comprises about 0.5-60% (w/w) heat transfer agent (e.g., 7.5&#xb1;2.5%, 10&#xb1;5%, 15&#xb1;5%, 20&#xb1;5%, 25&#xb1;10%, 37.5&#xb1;5%, 50&#xb1;10%, or 35-60% (w/w)).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the adhesive composition comprises a polymer having the structure of formula (I) (as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>)</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">wherein</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">n is an integer from 0 to 4 (e.g., n=1, 2, 3, or 4);</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Block B comprises an oligomer derived from a polyester, polyether, polalkylene glycol, polysilicone, or polycarbonate with a MW&#x3c;10,000 g/mol (e.g., 2&#xb1;1 KDa, 4&#xb1;2 KDa, 5&#xb1;2.5 KDa, or 8&#xb1;2 KDa);</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Block A comprises an optionally substituted C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6 </sub>alkylene, wherein Block A is derived from a diisocyanate crosslinker;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Block W comprises an optionally substituted C<sub>0</sub>-C<sub>3 </sub>alkyl-benzene-diol or optionally substituted C<sub>0</sub>-C<sub>3 </sub>alkyl-benzene-triol;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Linker L&#x2032; comprises a carbamate; and</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Linker L comprises a urea.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, Block B comprises an oligomer derived from a polyester, polalkylene glycol, polysilicone, or polycarbonate.

For example, an adhesion section (or adhesion side) of the disclosure can be softened after exposure to energy (e.g., within 120 seconds or less (e.g., within 10 seconds or less)); the adhesion section (or adhesion side) may then rigidify (i.e., stiffen) within 120 seconds or less (e.g., within 10 seconds or less). The rigidification of the adhesion section (or adhesion side) which fixes two (or more) bone fragments with respect to each other allows bone fractures to heal.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0113">As used herein, the term &#x201c;soften&#x201d; refers to a decrease in the stiffness of the material or substance. For example, a device or an adhesion side of the disclosure can soften after exposure to energy; within 120 seconds or less (e.g., 10 seconds or less), the softened adhesion side can flow, conforming to the geometry of a biological tissue or other substrate.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0114">As used herein, the term &#x201c;tackifying temperature&#x201d; refers to a temperature at which an adhesive blend or compound goes from non-flowable to string forming when contacted with a glass pipette tip. The adhesive blend or compound may decrease in stiffness (e.g., a reversible phase transition temperature). For example, a device or an adhesion side of the disclosure can soften once it reaches the tackifying temperature (e.g., the device or the adhesion side of the disclosure).</p><p id="p-0144" num="0115">The term &#x201c;subject,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to a human or non-human animal (e.g., a mammal such as a non-human primate, horse, cow, pig, or dog).</p><p id="p-0145" num="0116">As used herein, the term &#x201c;support structure&#x201d; refers to a portion of a device of the disclosure that physically supports an adhesive section. For example, the device of the invention can be composed of 40-100% of one or more of a non-adhesive polymer (e.g., as a support). The support structure can be found between two adhesion sections. For example, the support structure can be one side of the device (e.g., the support side).</p><p id="p-0146" num="0117">As used herein, the term &#x201c;support side&#x201d; refers to a support structure positioned as a backing for the adhesion side of a device of the invention.

The disclosed device is useful for attaching to bone or to secure a material to a tissue in order to provide stability or support. The disclosed device may eliminate or reduce the need to use staples, sutures, tacks, screws, or the like to secure or repair damaged tissues (or bone), or to secure implants within the body.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Devices</heading><p id="p-0162" num="0132">A device of the disclosure can be used to hold two or more objects (e.g., bone fragments, ligaments, tendons) fixed with respect to each other. The device of the disclosure can be made of a gradient of a mixture of one or more adhesives (e.g., polymer(s) having the structure of formula (I) described herein) and one or more fillers (e.g., non-adhesive polymers).</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Gradient of Adhesive(s), Filler(s), and Heat Transfer Agent(s)</heading><p id="p-0163" num="0133">The device of the disclosure may have varying compositions in different sections of the device. For example, the device can include at least two sections: (i) at least one adhesion section (e.g., a section of the device composed of: 30-100% (w/w) of one or more adhesives (e.g., polymer(s) having the structure of formula (I) as described herein), 0-70% (w/w) of one or more fillers (e.g., non-adhesive polymer(s)), and 0.5-60% (w/w) of one or more of heat transfer agent(s))) which adheres to at least one of the objects (e.g. tissues, such as, e.g., bone fragments, ligaments, tendons, etc.); and (ii) at least one support structure (e.g., a section of the device composed of: 40-100% (w/w) of one or more fillers (e.g., a non-adhesive polymer), and 0-60% (w/w) zero or more adhesives and zero or more heat transfer agents). The support structure may be formed from an anchoring material such as, e.g., polycaprolactone. The adhesion section (e.g., a section of the device composed of a sufficiently high amount of adhesive(s)) may be non-tacky at room temperature, and may be softened upon exposure to energy, such as, e.g., infrared radiation, or radiofrequency (RF)). The softened adhesion section can conform to the shape of the object (e.g., a bone fragment) it contacts. Once the energy exposure is ceased, the adhesion section will cool and rigidify, thus binding the object (e.g., a bone fragment) it contacts. The process may be repeated for the second object (and for the third, fourth, fifth object, or however many objects there are to secure to the preceding objects). This reversible softening feature of the adhesion section is advantageous so as to facilitate ease of handing, placement, workflow and control of device application.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0134">The adhesion section and support structure may be arranged to make sides of the device: an adhesion side (where the adhesion section is a coating of one or more adhesives admixed with one or more fillers) can contact and adhere two or more objects (e.g., bone fragments), and a support side that backs the adhesion side. In this case, energy (e.g., infrared radiation, radiofrequency (RF)) may be delivered to the support side of the device through which heat can transfer to the adhesion side (which contacts the object(s)) without significant deformation of the support structure. This selective softening of the adhesive component relative to the support component is advantageous so as to retain the strength and/or performance of the support structure.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0135">The adhesion section (or adhesion side) may be composed of an admixture of adhesives (e.g, polymer(s) having the structure of formula (I) as described herein) and fillers that may be varied to alter properties of the device of the disclosure such as, e.g., adhesion strength, tackifying temperature, cytotoxicity, tensile strength, time of rigidification, surface fouling resistant properties, brittleness, and viscosity.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0136">The support structure (or support side) may be composed of an admixture of fillers and adhesives that may be varied to alter properties of the support, such as, e.g., porosity (e.g., having pores or texture in which an adhesive may fill), brittleness (e.g., the support structure (or support side) preferably can bend or twist 90&#xb0; without flaking), flexibility, surface fouling properties, and tensile strength.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0137">A device (and its components, e.g., the adhesive polymers and non-adhesive polymers that make up the adhesion section (and adhesion side) and support structure (and support side)) of the disclosure may be optionally biodegradable and optionally biocompatible.

Furthermore, the adhesive or admixture of adhesives may be optionally bioresorbable. An adhesive or admixture of adhesives of the disclosure can have water solubilities less than 30 mg per L of water.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0157">Generally, adhesives for use in biomedical devices as found in the prior art all teach of the assembly of irreversible crosslinked networks by virtue of large polymeric assemblies either use or are formed chemically from the monomers (e.g. US20140311673A1, WO2017044896A1, WO2014158288A1, US20120029559A1, US20160346424A1, WO2016134304A1, PCT/CA2020051781). They either teach that low molecular weight molecules with low viscosity must be used for flowing before cure or, when large solid polymeric materials are used, solvents or other diluents are necessary to make them flowable. The use of solvents in biomedical adhesives, however, introduces unnecessary toxicity and/or impedes the curing and bonding of the adhesive. Further, flowable systems are susceptible to runoff or leaching of reactive adhesive components and/or oxidants away from the site of application, and/or retention of unreacted species, all of which can present as inflammatory responses in vivo.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0158">Compared to the prior art, the adhesives of formula I are not dependent upon in situ curing reactions for adhesion, and are not susceptible to adhesive leaching/runoff from the application site which can result in undesired side reactions and inflammatory complications. Further, the nature of Block B also means that these adhesives are not particularly prone to swelling and, therefore, inflammatory complications due to the swelling of the device in vivo. The reversible softening properties of the adhesives at temperatures close to physiological temperatures also introduces the benefits of not requiring solvent for surface wetting, of being non-tacky at room temperature, thereby facilitating facile workflow, and of not requiring high temperatures for adhesive softening so as to mitigate the risk of tissue necrosis.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Filler</heading><p id="p-0194" num="0159">A device of the disclosure can contain a varying amount (or gradient) of one or more fillers. A filler can be non-adhesive materials or substances that may be added to alter properties of the device of the disclosure such as, e.g., adhesion strength, tackifying temperature, cytotoxicity, tensile strength, time of rigidification, and viscosity. For example, a filler can be, e.g., polycaprolactone (PCL), polydioxanone (PDX), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (P3HB), poly lactic acid (PLA), polyglycolide (PGA), poly-4-hydroxybutyrate (P4HB), polyethylene carbonate (PEC), polypropylene carbonate (PPC), poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC), polysulfone, polyethylene glycol (PEG), or a copolymer thereof. Preferably, the support structure (or support side) can contain one or more of polycaprolactone (PCL), polydioxanone (PDX), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), or poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (P3HB), and a copolymer thereof. More preferably, the support structure will present a melting temperature at least 20&#xb0; C. higher than that of the adhesive component (e.g., at least 20&#xb0; C., 25&#xb0; C., 30&#xb0; C., 35&#xb0; C., 40&#xb0; C., 45&#xb0; C., 50&#xb0; C., 55&#xb0; C., 60&#xb0; C., 65&#xb0; C., 70&#xb0; C., 75&#xb0; C., 80&#xb0; C., 85&#xb0; C., 90&#xb0; C., 95&#xb0; C., 100&#xb0; C., 105&#xb0; C., 110&#xb0; C., 115&#xb0; C., 120&#xb0; C., 125&#xb0; C., 130&#xb0; C., 135&#xb0; C., 140&#xb0; C., 145&#xb0; C., or 150&#xb0; C. higher than that of the adhesive component). Even more preferably, the support structure will present a melting temperature of at least 100&#xb0; C. higher than that of the adhesive component.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0160">A filler or admixture of fillers of the disclosure may be optionally biodegradable and optionally biocompatible. Furthermore, the filler or admixture of fillers may be optionally bioresorbable.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Heat Transfer Agent</heading><p id="p-0196" num="0161">An adhesion section (or adhesion side) can contain one or more of a heat transfer agent (e.g., a compound that may accelerate the formation of a softened adhesive) in the adhesion section or the adhesion side of the device. The heat transfer agent may be a salt, such as, e.g., sodium chloride, iron(III) phosphate dihydrate, iron(III) citrate monohydrate, hydroxyapatite, tetracalcium phosphate, or sodium carbonate.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Softening and Rigidification of the Device</heading><p id="p-0197" num="0162">An adhesion section (or adhesion side) can reversibly soften (e.g., decrease in stiffness) or rigidify (e.g., increase in stiffness) when exposed to energy (e.g., infrared radiation, radiofrequency (RF)) or when cooled (e.g., cooling at ambient temperature without exposure to the energy described herein), respectively. The adhesion section (or adhesion side) is softened if the adhesive or admixture of adhesives has undergone a phase transition from solid to softened state (rigid to malleable state), and can form strings of softened polymer when contacted with a glass pipette tip. Once softened, the adhesion section (or adhesion side) can be contacted with one or more of the objects to be affixed. The softened adhesion section (or adhesion side) can subsequently rigidify within 120 seconds (or less) (e.g, less than 10 seconds) once the adhesion section (or adhesion side) is no longer exposed to energy (e.g., infrared radiation, RF). Preferably, the disclosed adhesion section (or adhesion side) has a tackifying temperature of 40&#xb0; C. or greater.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">Dimensions of the Device</heading><p id="p-0198" num="0163">The device of the disclosure may have a thickness between 0.02-1.5 mm (e.g., 0.3&#xb1;0.2 mm). Depending on the application and mass of the tissue/bone to be stabilized, this thickness will vary accordingly. For example, a thinner device may be used for soft tissue applications (e.g., 0.05 mm thick) whereas a thicker device may be used for bone stabilization (e.g., 1.0 mm thick). Accordingly, the time required to soften the adhesion section (or adhesion side) will be proportional to the thickness of the device. Furthermore, the time required to rigidify will also be proportional to the thickness of the device.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0164">The device of the disclosure may be prepared as a sheet (having all the components of a device described herein (e.g., an adhesion section, a support structure)) up to 100 mm long and 100 mm wide (e.g., 60 mm&#xd7;60 mm).

The adhesive or the admixture of adhesives described herein can bind to objects (e.g., tissues that are wet or dry) as described herein. Once bound, the adhesive or the admixture may remain bound to the object(s) in the presence of aqueous media (e.g., blood). For example, a device of the disclosure can bind two (or more) objects in the presence of blood (e.g., horse blood or sheep blood).</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">Uses and Methods of Treatment</heading><p id="p-0201" num="0166">The disclosed device is useful for attaching to objects (e.g., bone), or to secure an object to another object (e.g., a material to a tissue) in order to provide stability or support.

A bone fragment may be contacted with an adhesion section (or adhesion side) of the device. Another bone fragment may be in contact with the same adhesion section (or adhesion side), or a second adhesion section of the device. The contacted adhesion section may then be softened using an energy source such as, e.g., infrared radiation, radiofrequency (RF). After cooling, the adhesion section will solidify and bind to the bone fragment. The process may then be repeated for each adhesion section and bone fragment contact area. The bound device can thus stabilize the fracture, and maintain physiological alignment necessary for bone union.

Support Side Preparation</heading><p id="p-0229" num="0200">Filaments of polymer blends were created using micro-compounding procedure. Briefly, polymers were dried under vacuum at room temperature overnight prior to use. For films composed of blends of polymers, the polymers were first compounded into filaments using a 10 mL Xplore Twin Screw Micro-compounder at a temperature suitable to melt the polymer (115-220&#xb0; C. based on the polymers being compounded) for approximately 5 min at 200 rmp. Polymers were extruded into filaments and pelleted.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0201">Pellets were dried under vacuum and then compression molded into thin films on a Carver Automated heated press at 1000 kg. Briefly, platens were heated to a suitable melting temperature. Filaments are cut into &#x2dc;3 cm lengths to a specific mass, depending on the size of sheet to be pressed. Teflon liners and molds were used to prevent the polymer melt from sticking to the steel platens. Teflon liners were textured in order to impart a texture in the resulting sheet. Teflon molds range in thickness from 0.1-0.5 mm. Molding was done by layering steel sheet, Teflon liner, Teflon mold and polymer material, Teflon liner, and steel sheet. The lamellar molding sandwich was placed on the bottom platen and raised to &#x2dc;1 mm below the top platen. The polymer was melted without any applied force for 10 minutes. After melting, force was increased to &#x2dc;100-300 kg manually. Once the force dropped to &#x2dc;0-100 kg, hydraulic pressure was released to allow any air bubbles to dissipate. Force was then increased in auto mode at 15% speed to 600 kg for 5 minutes. The lamellar mold set up was transferred to a 37&#xb0; C. and allowed to cool naturally before removing the sheet from the mold. The sheet was trimmed to remove excess material and stored in a desiccator prior to use.

After etching, textured Teflon sheets were cleaned with isopropanol and compressed air to remove excess material. One polymer sheet was pressed onto the newly etched Teflon liner and removed in order to further clean the textured liner prior to use. Feature dimensions were tuned using more passes or higher power as necessary, but generally measured 100-200 &#x3bc;m in depth.

In brief, 0.200 g adhesive samples of were dried under vacuum at 40&#xb0; C. over 48h and then weighed to obtain their initial dried mass. 25.0 mL of deionized water was added to each sample, and samples were incubated at room temperature (approximately 21&#xb0; C.) for 48h with intermittent mixing. After 48h, the aqueous phase was decanted, lyophilized, and then vacuum dried overnight at 40&#xb0; C. in order to determine the mass of material extracted into the water. The ratio of extracted material to the mass of aqueous solution was used to estimate aqueous solubility of each adhesive. The swelling of the residual adhesive, taken as the mass percent of water gained relative to initial adhesive mass, was determined by removing excess water with a kimwipe prior to massing the sample post-incubation.

Without wishing to be bound by theory, this occurs if the polymer filler positively impacts the physical and/or mechanical properties of the adhesive, thereby functioning as a second phase strengthener. For example, polymer fillers with too low (e.g. PLC7015) or too high (e.g. LG824s, L210s HA) softening temperatures restrict the performance of the adhesive layer to below that of the control adhesive (no fillers) itself. Higher molecular weight polymers present improved tensile resistance (e.g. PCL50 versus PCL14, PBA), whilst flexible polymers (e.g. PBA) contribute to improved peel performance. Inorganic fillers, e.g. HA, do not provide the same level of second phase strengthening as the compatible polymer fillers do. Without wishing to be bound by theory, inorganic particulates are typically void fillers, whereas polymer fillers contribute to improved elongation/tensile properties on account of their long chain entanglement interactions.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0218">Polymers which are not miscible with the adhesive compounds (evidenced from distinct adhesive and polymer Tg domains on DSC thermograms), e.g. LG824s and L210s HA, also do not work well, likely because their phase strengthening mechanism is reduced to primarily void filling in the absence of the chain entanglement and the associated intermolecular interactions which are facilitated by phase mixing of the polymer phase with the adhesive compounds. This is corroborated by BT128 which shows that the highest scores are obtained when another adhesive compound with suitable mechanical and/or physical properties is incorporated into the adhesive layer as the polymer filler component.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0219">Polymer fillers which increase the overall hydrophilicity of the adhesive layer, e.g. PF127, will increase the swelling capacity and/or solubility of the adhesive layer, leading to the eventual failure of bone tape via detachment from bone and/or the side support. On the other hand, polymer fillers which decrease the hydrophilicity of the adhesive layer (e.g. PCL) are desirable to mitigate against bone tape failure due to water ingress in vivo.</p><heading id="h-0038" level="1">Example 13.

In these situations, the challenge is the application of the bone tape without introducing defects into the support side component that would compromise the tensile strength of the device post-surgery. This is especially true for polymers such as PCL with significant crystalline content that undergo rapid melt at temperatures close to or below the tackifying temperature of the adhesive layer. This also applies to polymers which present polymorphic phase transitions and/or which contain multiple polymorphs with phase transitions at or below the tackifying temperature of the adhesive formulation; e.g., PDX presents a final melt temperature at 110&#xb0; C., but also undergoes several polymorphic transitions inclusive of a melt-mediated recrystallization between room temperature and 50&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0227">Polymers which melt/soften at too high temperatures relative to the tackifying temperature of the adhesive formulation (e.g. PLC9517) also present application challenges which translate into compromised device performance. For these systems, the significantly higher temperatures required to soften the support side component in order for it to conform to the shape of the bone surface and thus facilitate the full wetting of the bone surface by the adhesive component actually results in flow out of the adhesive from beneath the bone tape device, leading instead to a compromised device with poor adhesion characteristics. A similar challenge is also observed in polymers with too high elastic moduli (E<sub>tensile</sub>&#x3e;0.5 GPa; e.g. LG824s, PLC8516), which generally require heating well above their glass transition temperatures in order to improve their flexibility enough so that they could sufficiently contour to the shape of the bone.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0228">Generally, polymers with desired melting profile, tensile strength, and/or elastic modulus could be obtained upon blending of individual polymers, e.g. Polymers 3 and 6 in Table 7 above. We note that support compositions which do not comprise PCL or copolymers containing PCL generally do not adhere well to the adhesive layer. For example, pure PDX backings (Polymer 2) result in delamination of the adhesive layer when the tape is flexed. In a polymer blend, despite being incompatible with nearly all other polymers, PCL contributes to a lower softening temperature, compatibility with the adhesive layer, and strength retention due to its hydrophobicity. Table 9 presents the strength retention profiles of select PCL-containing blends tested over 7 weeks at physiological temperatures (37&#xb0; C.).</p><p id="p-0268" num="0229">The mechanical properties of polymer blends were measured over the course of seven weeks under physiological conditions to assess their utility for long term use in in vivo settings.
