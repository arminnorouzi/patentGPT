Patent Application No. 10201911248T, filed Nov. 27, 2019, which is incorporated herein by reference in the entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">2 BACKGROUND OF THE TECHNOLOGY</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2.1 Field of the Technology</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present technology relates to one or more of the screening, diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, prevention and amelioration of respiratory-related disorders. The present technology also relates to medical devices or apparatus, and their use, and more particularly to methods and systems for detecting improper patient interface positioning associated with the medical devices or apparatuses and/or guiding the patient to position and/or adjust to correct fitting position of the patient interface.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2.2 Description of the Related Art</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">2.2.1 Human Respiratory System and its Disorders</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The respiratory system of the body facilitates gas exchange. The nose and mouth form the entrance to the airways of a patient.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The airways include a series of branching tubes, which become narrower, shorter and more numerous as they penetrate deeper into the lung. The prime function of the lung is gas exchange, allowing oxygen to move from the inhaled air into the venous blood and carbon dioxide to move in the opposite direction. The trachea divides into right and left main bronchi, which further divide eventually into terminal bronchioles. The bronchi make up the conducting airways, and do not take part in gas exchange. Further divisions of the airways lead to the respiratory bronchioles, and eventually to the alveoli. The alveolated region of the lung is where the gas exchange takes place, and is referred to as the respiratory zone. See &#x201c;<i>Respiratory Physiology</i>&#x201d;, by John B. West, Lippincott Williams &#x26; Wilkins, 9th edition published 2012.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A range of respiratory disorders exist. Certain disorders may be characterised by particular events, e.g. apneas, hypopneas, and hyperpneas.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Examples of respiratory disorders include Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), Cheyne-Stokes Respiration (CSR), respiratory insufficiency, Obesity Hyperventilation Syndrome (OHS), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Neuromuscular Disease (NMD) and Chest wall disorders.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), a form of Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB), is characterised by events including occlusion or obstruction of the upper air passage during sleep. It results from a combination of an abnormally small upper airway and the normal loss of muscle tone in the region of the tongue, soft palate and posterior oropharyngeal wall during sleep. The condition causes the affected patient to stop breathing for periods typically of 30 to 120 seconds in duration, sometimes 200 to 300 times per night. It often causes excessive daytime somnolence, and it may cause cardiovascular disease and brain damage. The syndrome is a common disorder, particularly in middle aged overweight males, although a person affected may have no awareness of the problem. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,944,310 (Sullivan).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Cheyne-Stokes Respiration (CSR) is another form of sleep disordered breathing. CSR is a disorder of a patient's respiratory controller in which there are rhythmic alternating periods of waxing and waning ventilation known as CSR cycles. CSR is characterised by repetitive de-oxygenation and re-oxygenation of the arterial blood. It is possible that CSR is harmful because of the repetitive hypoxia. In some patients CSR is associated with repetitive arousal from sleep, which causes severe sleep disruption, increased sympathetic activity, and increased afterload. See U.S. Pat. No. 6,532,959 (Berthon-Jones).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Respiratory failure is an umbrella term for respiratory disorders in which the lungs are unable to inspire sufficient oxygen or exhale sufficient CO<sub>2 </sub>to meet the patient's needs. Respiratory failure may encompass some or all of the following disorders.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A patient with respiratory insufficiency (a form of respiratory failure) may experience abnormal shortness of breath on exercise.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Obesity Hyperventilation Syndrome (OHS) is defined as the combination of severe obesity and awake chronic hypercapnia, in the absence of other known causes for hypoventilation. Symptoms include dyspnea, morning headache and excessive daytime sleepiness.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) encompasses any of a group of lower airway diseases that have certain characteristics in common. These include increased resistance to air movement, extended expiratory phase of respiration, and loss of the normal elasticity of the lung. Examples of COPD are emphysema and chronic bronchitis. COPD is caused by chronic tobacco smoking (primary risk factor), occupational exposures, air pollution and genetic factors. Symptoms include: dyspnea on exertion, chronic cough and sputum production.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Neuromuscular Disease (NMD) is a broad term that encompasses many diseases and ailments that impair the functioning of the muscles either directly via intrinsic muscle pathology, or indirectly via nerve pathology. Some NMD patients are characterised by progressive muscular impairment leading to loss of ambulation, being wheelchair-bound, swallowing difficulties, respiratory muscle weakness and, eventually, death from respiratory failure. Neuromuscular disorders can be divided into rapidly progressive and slowly progressive: (i) Rapidly progressive disorders: Characterised by muscle impairment that worsens over months and results in death within a few years (e.g. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in teenagers); (ii) Variable or slowly progressive disorders: Characterised by muscle impairment that worsens over years and only mildly reduces life expectancy (e.g. Limb girdle, Facioscapulohumeral and Myotonic muscular dystrophy). Symptoms of respiratory failure in NMD include: increasing generalised weakness, dysphagia, dyspnea on exertion and at rest, fatigue, sleepiness, morning headache, and difficulties with concentration and mood changes.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Chest wall disorders are a group of thoracic deformities that result in inefficient coupling between the respiratory muscles and the thoracic cage. The disorders are usually characterised by a restrictive defect and share the potential of long term hypercapnic respiratory failure. Scoliosis and/or kyphoscoliosis may cause severe respiratory failure. Symptoms of respiratory failure include: dyspnea on exertion, peripheral oedema, orthopnea, repeated chest infections, morning headaches, fatigue, poor sleep quality and loss of appetite.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A range of therapies have been used to treat or ameliorate such conditions. Furthermore, otherwise healthy individuals may take advantage of such therapies to prevent respiratory disorders from arising. However, these have a number of shortcomings.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">2.2.2 Therapies</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Various respiratory therapies, such as Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy, Non-invasive ventilation (NIV), Invasive ventilation (IV), and High Flow Therapy (HFT) have been used to treat one or more of the above respiratory disorders.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">2.2.2.1 Respiratory Pressure Therapies</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Respiratory pressure therapy is the application of a supply of air to an entrance to the airways at a controlled target pressure that is nominally positive with respect to atmosphere throughout the patient's breathing cycle (in contrast to negative pressure therapies such as the tank ventilator or cuirass).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy has been used to treat Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). The mechanism of action is that continuous positive airway pressure acts as a pneumatic splint and may prevent upper airway occlusion, such as by pushing the soft palate and tongue forward and away from the posterior oropharyngeal wall. Treatment of OSA by CPAP therapy may be voluntary, and hence patients may elect not to comply with therapy if they find devices used to provide such therapy one or more of: uncomfortable, difficult to use, expensive and aesthetically unappealing.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) provides ventilatory support to a patient through the upper airways to assist the patient breathing and/or maintain adequate oxygen levels in the body by doing some or all of the work of breathing. The ventilatory support is provided via a non-invasive patient interface. NIV has been used to treat CSR and respiratory failure, in forms such as OHS, COPD, NMD and Chest Wall disorders. In some forms, the comfort and effectiveness of these therapies may be improved.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Invasive ventilation (IV) provides ventilatory support to patients that are no longer able to effectively breathe themselves and may be provided using a tracheostomy tube. In some forms, the comfort and effectiveness of these therapies may be improved.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">2.2.2.2 Flow Therapies</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Not all respiratory therapies aim to deliver a prescribed therapeutic pressure. Some respiratory therapies aim to deliver a prescribed respiratory volume, by delivering an inspiratory flow rate profile over a targeted duration, possibly superimposed on a positive baseline pressure. In other cases, the interface to the patient's airways is &#x2018;open&#x2019; (unsealed) and the respiratory therapy may only supplement the patient's own spontaneous breathing with a flow of conditioned or enriched gas. In one example, High Flow therapy (HFT) is the provision of a continuous, heated, humidified flow of air to an entrance to the airway through an unsealed or open patient interface at a &#x201c;treatment flow rate&#x201d; that is held approximately constant throughout the respiratory cycle. The treatment flow rate is nominally set to exceed the patient's peak inspiratory flow rate. HFT has been used to treat OSA, CSR, respiratory failure, COPD, and other respiratory disorders. One mechanism of action is that the high flow rate of air at the airway entrance improves ventilation efficiency by flushing, or washing out, expired CO<sub>2 </sub>from the patient's anatomical deadspace. Hence, HFT is thus sometimes referred to as a deadspace therapy (DST). Other benefits may include the elevated warmth and humidification (possibly of benefit in secretion management) and the potential for modest elevation of airway pressures. As an alternative to constant flow rate, the treatment flow rate may follow a profile that varies over the respiratory cycle.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Another form of flow therapy is long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) or supplemental oxygen therapy. Doctors may prescribe a continuous flow of oxygen enriched gas at a specified oxygen concentration (from 21%, the oxygen fraction in ambient air, to 100%) at a specified flow rate (e.g., 1 litre per minute (LPM), 2 LPM, 3 LPM, etc.) to be delivered to the patient's airway.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">2.2.2.3 Supplementary Oxygen</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">For certain patients, oxygen therapy may be combined with a respiratory pressure therapy or HFT by adding supplementary oxygen to the pressurised flow of air. When oxygen is added to respiratory pressure therapy, this is referred to as RPT with supplementary oxygen. When oxygen is added to HFT, the resulting therapy is referred to as HFT with supplementary oxygen.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">2.2.3 Respiratory Therapy Systems</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">These respiratory therapies may be provided by a respiratory therapy system or device. Such systems and devices may also be used to screen, diagnose, or monitor a condition without treating it.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A respiratory therapy system may comprise a Respiratory Pressure Therapy Device (RPT device), an air circuit, a humidifier, a patient interface, an oxygen source, and data management.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Another form of therapy system is a mandibular repositioning device.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">2.2.3.1 Patient Interface</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A patient interface may be used to interface respiratory equipment to its wearer, for example by providing a flow of air to an entrance to the airways. The flow of air may be provided via a mask to the nose and/or mouth, a tube to the mouth or a tracheostomy tube to the trachea of a patient. Depending upon the therapy to be applied, the patient interface may form a seal, e.g., with a region of the patient's face, to facilitate the delivery of gas at a pressure at sufficient variance with ambient pressure to effect therapy, e.g., at a positive pressure of about 10 cmH<sub>2</sub>O relative to ambient pressure. For other forms of therapy, such as the delivery of oxygen, the patient interface may not include a seal sufficient to facilitate delivery to the airways of a supply of gas at a positive pressure of about 10 cmH<sub>2</sub>O. For flow therapies such as nasal HFT, the patient interface is configured to insufflate the nares but specifically to avoid a complete seal. One example of such a patient interface is a nasal cannula.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Certain other mask systems may be functionally unsuitable for the present field. For example, purely ornamental masks may be unable to maintain a suitable pressure. Mask systems used for underwater swimming or diving may be configured to guard against ingress of water from an external higher pressure, but not to maintain air internally at a higher pressure than ambient.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Certain masks may be clinically unfavourable for the present technology e.g. if they block airflow via the nose and only allow it via the mouth.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Certain masks may be uncomfortable or impractical for the present technology if they require a patient to insert a portion of a mask structure in their mouth to create and maintain a seal via their lips.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Certain masks may be impractical for use while sleeping, e.g. for sleeping while lying on one's side in bed with a head on a pillow.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The design of a patient interface presents a number of challenges. The face has a complex three-dimensional shape. The size and shape of noses and heads varies considerably between individuals. Since the head includes bone, cartilage and soft tissue, different regions of the face respond differently to mechanical forces. The jaw or mandible may move relative to other bones of the skull. The whole head may move during the course of a period of respiratory therapy.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As a consequence of these challenges, some masks suffer from being one or more of obtrusive, aesthetically undesirable, costly, poorly fitting, difficult to use, and uncomfortable especially when worn for long periods of time or when a patient is unfamiliar with a system. Wrongly sized masks can give rise to reduced compliance, reduced comfort and poorer patient outcomes. Masks designed solely for aviators, masks designed as part of personal protection equipment (e.g. filter masks), SCUBA masks, or for the administration of anaesthetics may be tolerable for their original application, but nevertheless such masks may be undesirably uncomfortable to be worn for extended periods of time, e.g., several hours. This discomfort may lead to a reduction in patient compliance with therapy. This is even more so if the mask is to be worn during sleep.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">CPAP therapy is highly effective to treat certain respiratory disorders, provided patients comply with therapy. If a mask is uncomfortable, or difficult to use a patient may not comply with therapy. Since it is often recommended that a patient regularly wash their mask, if a mask is difficult to clean (e.g., difficult to assemble or disassemble), patients may not clean their mask and this may impact on patient compliance.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">While a mask for other applications (e.g. aviators) may not be suitable for use in treating sleep disordered breathing, a mask designed for use in treating sleep disordered breathing may be suitable for other applications.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">For these reasons, patient interfaces for delivery of CPAP during sleep form a distinct field.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">2.2.3.1.1 Seal-Forming Structure</heading><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Patient interfaces may include a seal-forming structure. Since it is in direct contact with the patient's face, the shape and configuration of the seal-forming structure can have a direct impact the effectiveness and comfort of the patient interface.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A patient interface may be partly characterised according to the design intent of where the seal-forming structure is to engage with the face in use. In one form of patient interface, a seal-forming structure may comprise a first sub-portion to form a seal around the left naris and a second sub-portion to form a seal around the right naris. In one form of patient interface, a seal-forming structure may comprise a single element that surrounds both nares in use. Such single element may be designed to for example overlay an upper lip region and a nasal bridge region of a face. In one form of patient interface a seal-forming structure may comprise an element that surrounds a mouth region in use, e.g. by forming a seal on a lower lip region of a face. In one form of patient interface, a seal-forming structure may comprise a single element that surrounds both nares and a mouth region in use. These different types of patient interfaces may be known by a variety of names by their manufacturer including nasal masks, full-face masks, nasal pillows, nasal puffs and oro-nasal masks.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">A seal-forming structure that may be effective in one region of a patient's face may be inappropriate in another region, e.g. because of the different shape, structure, variability and sensitivity regions of the patient's face. For example, a seal on swimming goggles that overlays a patient's forehead may not be appropriate to use on a patient's nose.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Certain seal-forming structures may be designed for mass manufacture such that one design fit and be comfortable and effective for a wide range of different face shapes and sizes. To the extent to which there is a mismatch between the shape of the patient's face, and the seal-forming structure of the mass-manufactured patient interface, one or both must adapt in order for a seal to form.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">One type of seal-forming structure extends around the periphery of the patient interface, and is intended to seal against the patient's face when force is applied to the patient interface with the seal-forming structure in confronting engagement with the patient's face. The seal-forming structure may include an air or fluid filled cushion, or a moulded or formed surface of a resilient seal element made of an elastomer such as a rubber. With this type of seal-forming structure, if the fit is not adequate, there will be gaps between the seal-forming structure and the face, and additional force will be required to force the patient interface against the face in order to achieve a seal.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Another type of seal-forming structure incorporates a flap seal of thin material positioned about the periphery of the mask so as to provide a self-sealing action against the face of the patient when positive pressure is applied within the mask. Like the previous style of seal forming portion, if the match between the face and the mask is not good, additional force may be required to achieve a seal, or the mask may leak. Furthermore, if the shape of the seal-forming structure does not match that of the patient, it may crease or buckle in use, giving rise to leaks.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Another type of seal-forming structure may comprise a friction-fit element, e.g. for insertion into a naris, however some patients find these uncomfortable.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Another form of seal-forming structure may use adhesive to achieve a seal.

RPT devices typically comprise a pressure generator, such as a motor-driven blower or a compressed gas reservoir, and are configured to supply a flow of air to the airway of a patient. In some cases, the flow of air may be supplied to the airway of the patient at positive pressure.

The use of a humidifier with an RPT device and the patient interface produces humidified gas that minimizes drying of the nasal mucosa and increases patient airway comfort. In addition in cooler climates, warm air applied generally to the face area in and about the patient interface is more comfortable than cold air. Humidifiers therefore often have the capacity to heat the flow of air was well as humidifying it.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059">A range of artificial humidification devices and systems are known, however they may not fulfil the specialised requirements of a medical humidifier.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">Medical humidifiers are used to increase humidity and/or temperature of the flow of air in relation to ambient air when required, typically where the patient may be asleep or resting (e.g. at a hospital).

Most stationary forms of exercise like tread mills and stationary bicycles, however, are too strenuous for these patients. As a result, the need for mobility has long been recognized. Until recently, this mobility has been facilitated by the use of small compressed oxygen tanks or cylinders mounted on a cart with dolly wheels. The disadvantage of these tanks is that they contain a finite amount of oxygen and are heavy, weighing about 50 pounds when mounted.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">Oxygen concentrators have been in use for about 50 years to supply oxygen for respiratory therapy. Traditional oxygen concentrators have been bulky and heavy making ordinary ambulatory activities with them difficult and impractical. Recently, companies that manufacture large stationary oxygen concentrators began developing portable oxygen concentrators (POCs). The advantage of POCs is that they can produce a theoretically endless supply of oxygen. In order to make these devices small for mobility, the various systems necessary for the production of oxygen enriched gas are condensed. POCs seek to utilize their produced oxygen as efficiently as possible, in order to minimise weight, size, and power consumption. This may be achieved by delivering the oxygen as series of pulses or &#x201c;boli&#x201d;, each bolus timed to coincide with the start of inspiration. This therapy mode is known as pulsed or demand (oxygen) delivery (POD), in contrast with traditional continuous flow delivery more suited to stationary oxygen concentrators.</p><heading id="h-0018" level="1">2.2.3.6 Data Management</heading><p id="p-0066" num="0064">There may be clinical reasons to obtain data to determine whether the patient prescribed with respiratory therapy has been &#x201c;compliant&#x201d;, e.g. that the patient has used their RPT device according to one or more &#x201c;compliance rules&#x201d;. One example of a compliance rule for CPAP therapy is that a patient, in order to be deemed compliant, is required to use the RPT device for at least four hours a night for at least 21 of 30 consecutive days. In order to determine a patient's compliance, a provider of the RPT device, such as a health care provider, may manually obtain data describing the patient's therapy using the RPT device, calculate the usage over a predetermined time period, and compare with the compliance rule. Once the health care provider has determined that the patient has used their RPT device according to the compliance rule, the health care provider may notify a third party that the patient is compliant.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065">There may be other aspects of a patient's therapy that would benefit from communication of therapy data to a third party or external system.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0066">Existing processes to communicate and manage such data can be one or more of costly, time-consuming, and error-prone.</p><heading id="h-0019" level="1">2.2.3.7 Mandibular Repositioning</heading><p id="p-0069" num="0067">A mandibular repositioning device (MRD) or mandibular advancement device (MAD) is one of the treatment options for sleep apnea and snoring. It is an adjustable oral appliance available from a dentist or other supplier that holds the lower jaw (mandible) in a forward position during sleep. The MRD is a removable device that a patient inserts into their mouth prior to going to sleep and removes following sleep. Thus, the MRD is not designed to be worn all of the time. The MRD may be custom made or produced in a standard form and includes a bite impression portion designed to allow fitting to a patient's teeth. This mechanical protrusion of the lower jaw expands the space behind the tongue, puts tension on the pharyngeal walls to reduce collapse of the airway and diminishes palate vibration.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0068">In certain examples a mandibular advancement device may comprise an upper splint that is intended to engage with or fit over teeth on the upper jaw or maxilla and a lower splint that is intended to engage with or fit over teeth on the upper jaw or mandible. The upper and lower splints are connected together laterally via a pair of connecting rods. The pair of connecting rods are fixed symmetrically on the upper splint and on the lower splint.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069">In such a design the length of the connecting rods is selected such that when the MRD is placed in a patient's mouth the mandible is held in an advanced position. The length of the connecting rods may be adjusted to change the level of protrusion of the mandible. A dentist may determine a level of protrusion for the mandible that will determine the length of the connecting rods.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070">Some MRDs are structured to push the mandible forward relative to the maxilla while other MADs, such as the ResMed Narval CC&#x2122; MRD are designed to retain the mandible in a forward position.

PSG typically involves the placement of 15 to 20 contact sensors on a patient in order to record various bodily signals such as electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), electrooculograpy (EOG), electromyography (EMG), etc. PSG for sleep disordered breathing has involved two nights of observation of a patient in a clinic, one night of pure diagnosis and a second night of titration of treatment parameters by a clinician. PSG is therefore expensive and inconvenient. In particular it is unsuitable for home screening/diagnosis/monitoring of sleep disordered breathing.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0076">Screening and diagnosis generally describe the identification of a condition from its signs and symptoms. Screening typically gives a true/false result indicating whether or not a patient's SDB is severe enough to warrant further investigation, while diagnosis may result in clinically actionable information. Screening and diagnosis tend to be one-off processes, whereas monitoring the progress of a condition can continue indefinitely. Some screening/diagnosis systems are suitable only for screening/diagnosis, whereas some may also be used for monitoring.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0077">Clinical experts may be able to screen, diagnose, or monitor patients adequately based on visual observation of PSG signals. However, there are circumstances where a clinical expert may not be available, or a clinical expert may not be affordable. Different clinical experts may disagree on a patient's condition. In addition, a given clinical expert may apply a different standard at different times.</p><heading id="h-0022" level="1">3 BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE TECHNOLOGY</heading><p id="p-0082" num="0078">The present technology is directed towards providing medical devices used in the screening, diagnosis, monitoring, amelioration, treatment, or prevention of respiratory disorders having one or more of improved comfort, cost, efficacy, ease of use and manufacturability.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0079">A first aspect of the present technology relates to apparatus used in the screening, diagnosis, monitoring, amelioration, treatment or prevention of a respiratory disorder.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0080">Another aspect of the present technology relates to methods used in the screening, diagnosis, monitoring, amelioration, treatment or prevention of a respiratory disorder.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0081">An aspect of certain forms of the present technology is to provide methods and/or apparatus that improve the compliance of patients with respiratory therapy.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0082">One form of the present technology comprises a device comprising: a display; a camera; memory; and a processing system including at least one hardware processor coupled to the display, the camera, and the memory, the processing system configured to: receive one or more images including a patient with a patient interface configured to engage with at least one airway of a patient and supply breathable gas received from a continuous positive air pressure (CPAP) device to the patient; analyse the received one or more images; and based on the analysis, display, on the display, feedback for improving the fit and/or operation of the patient interface.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0083">Another aspect of the present technology relates to a respiratory pressure therapy system for providing continuous positive air pressure to a patient via a patient interface configured to engage with at least one airway of the patient.

There is an arbitrarily large number of measures that are exactly proportional to ventilation if the flow rate shape is constant.</p><heading id="h-0081" level="1">5.4.3.2.4 Determination of Inspiratory Flow Limitation</heading><p id="p-0322" num="0325">In one form of the present technology, the central controller <b>4230</b> executes an inspiratory flow limitation determination algorithm <b>4324</b> for the determination of the extent of inspiratory flow limitation.</p><p id="p-0323" num="0326">In one form, the inspiratory flow limitation determination algorithm <b>4324</b> receives as an input a respiratory flow rate signal Qr and provides as an output a metric of the extent to which the inspiratory portion of the breath exhibits inspiratory flow limitation.</p><p id="p-0324" num="0327">In one form of the present technology, the inspiratory portion of each breath is identified by a zero-crossing detector. A number of evenly spaced points (for example, sixty-five), representing points in time, are interpolated by an interpolator along the inspiratory flow rate-time curve for each breath. The curve described by the points is then scaled by a scalar to have unity length (duration/period) and unity area to remove the effects of changing breathing rate and depth. The scaled breaths are then compared in a comparator with a pre-stored template representing a normal unobstructed breath. Breaths deviating by more than a specified threshold (typically 1 scaled unit) at any time during the inspiration from this template, such as those due to coughs, sighs, swallows and hiccups, as determined by a test element, are rejected. For non-rejected data, a moving average of the first such scaled point is calculated by the central controller <b>4230</b> for the preceding several inspiratory events. This is repeated over the same inspiratory events for the second such point, and so on. Thus, for example, sixty five scaled data points are generated by the central controller <b>4230</b>, and represent a moving average of the preceding several inspiratory events, e.g., three events. The moving average of continuously updated values of the (e.g., sixty five) points are hereinafter called the &#x201c;scaled flow rate&#x201d;, designated as Qs(t). Alternatively, a single inspiratory event can be utilised rather than a moving average.</p><p id="p-0325" num="0328">From the scaled flow rate, two shape factors relating to the determination of partial obstruction may be calculated.</p><p id="p-0326" num="0329">Shape factor 1 is the ratio of the mean of the middle (e.g. thirty-two) scaled flow rate points to the mean overall (e.g. sixty-five) scaled flow rate points. Where this ratio is in excess of unity, the breath will be taken to be normal. Where the ratio is unity or less, the breath will be taken to be obstructed. A ratio of about 1.17 is taken as a threshold between partially obstructed and unobstructed breathing, and equates to a degree of obstruction that would permit maintenance of adequate oxygenation in a typical patient.</p><p id="p-0327" num="0330">Shape factor 2 is calculated as the RMS deviation from unit scaled flow rate, taken over the middle (e.g. thirty two) points. An RMS deviation of about 0.2 units is taken to be normal. An RMS deviation of zero is taken to be a totally flow-limited breath. The closer the RMS deviation to zero, the breath will be taken to be more flow limited.</p><p id="p-0328" num="0331">Shape factors 1 and 2 may be used as alternatives, or in combination. In other forms of the present technology, the number of sampled points, breaths and middle points may differ from those described above.

Furthermore, even if the patient interface <b>3000</b> is initially properly set up, over time adjustments may be needed that require specialised knowledge. However, medical professionals may not always be available to assist patients in setting up or adjusting the patient interface <b>3000</b>. This may be the case where the patient interface <b>3000</b> associated with the medical device is being used in the home of the patient <b>1000</b>. Without being able to properly set up or adjust the patient interface, the patient <b>1000</b> may experience discomfort and stop using the patient interface <b>3000</b> and/or receive less effective treatment.</p><p id="p-0380" num="0393">In various forms of the present technology there is provided an application for guiding a patient <b>1000</b> on wearing a patient interface <b>3000</b> associated with a medical device (e.g., an RPT device <b>4000</b>), detecting proper and/or improper patient interface positioning, and/or guiding the patient to adjust the patient interface <b>3000</b> to correct fitting position of the patient interface <b>3000</b>.</p><p id="p-0381" num="0394">Leveraging augmented reality, the patient may be connected with knowhow on headgear sizes and fitting based on various fitting range studies conducted on different patient ranges for various components of the patient interface <b>3000</b> and/or components coupled to the patient interface <b>3000</b>. This provides a large database which can be tapped into through a virtual-to-physical interface to aid with patient interface <b>3000</b> fitting through efficient headgear sizing and tightening without regards to location of the patient.</p><p id="p-0382" num="0395">As discussed in more detail below, the virtual solution provides a system (e.g., a camera system) to: scan a patient's facial profile, capture key points of facial structure as various data points, and send data to a data bank for analysis (e.g., using cloud technology).</p><p id="p-0383" num="0396">The virtual solution provides the use of existing database (e.g., from the manufacturer's, distributor's, and/or clinician's mask and/or headgear selector tool) to determine key data points on patient's facial structure. The patient's facial structure may be cross referenced with one or more predetermined components of the patient interface <b>3000</b> (e.g., headgear strap type and/or length) to calculate for desired component settings (e.g., length and tightening of headgear adjustment). Data may be provided to a patient's device (e.g., a mobile device and/or the RPT devices <b>4000</b>) to instruct the patient in making the determined component setting (e.g., show amount of tightening required on headgear to achieve good fit of the mask system).</p><p id="p-0384" num="0397">Headgear fitting can be achieved through one or more options including: one or more physical markings on a headgear for manual positioning; physical markers on headgear to determine one or more stretch marks that change to show stretch forces; and/or use current facial measurements to determine length to stretch and fit the headgear, overlay estimated tightening unto patient's facial structure and/or provide visual and audible cues for when the patient has reached the estimated amount of headgear adjustment.</p><p id="p-0385" num="0398">In some examples, to ensure that an adequate seal is achieved, the virtual solution may be integrated with the prescribed flow generator via communication technologies such as Bluetooth or WiFi to determine leakage during therapy.</p><p id="p-0386" num="0399">Examples of the present technology overcome one or more limitations of conventional approaches to patient interface selection, fitting and/or adjustment. For example, conventional approaches provide a user guide in a printed form that may be hard for some patients to understand from pictures and words. Also, patients may need to travel down to a clinician's office for mask fitting or the clinician may need to travel to the location of the patient. This takes up more time and effort from the patient as they need to arrange an appointment (which may take time to organise e.g. sometimes days to weeks to arrange) and travel to the office to receive instructions.</p><p id="p-0387" num="0400">In addition, even after an initial fitting session with the assistance of a clinician, the patient will be left on their own at home to replicate the fitting. If there is a change in the headgear fit or the patient forgets how to replicate the adjustments (e.g., after washing), the patient may either have to arrange another appointment or figure it out on their own, which might lead to improper fitting of the mask system and reduced efficacy of the therapy. Improving the ease of usage of the mask system/headgear will also help to improve compliance and retain patients in therapy.</p><p id="p-0388" num="0401">In addition, if there is a change in the facial profile of the patient (e.g., result of losing weight or gaining weight) the fitting of the headgear will need to change accordingly. If patients are not able to adjust the fit on their own, they will have to obtained updated instructions on refitting the mask e.g. by revisiting the clinician's office.</p><p id="p-0389" num="0402">Examples of the present technology provide for a video and virtual solution that patients can access in the ease of their home, streamlining the process of mask fitting and allowing the patient to start their therapy faster than conventional solutions.</p><heading id="h-0107" level="2">5.7.1.1 Guided Patient Interface Fitting Based on Established Baseline</heading><p id="p-0390" num="0403">According to one form of the present technology, the patient interface fitting is performed based on a baseline.

In some examples, stretch marks on the patient interface (e.g., straps and/or mask cushion) may be analysed to determine the level of stretch within certain portions of the patient interface e.g. determining that certain portions are over stretched and/or are stretched more than other portions of the patient interface.</p><p id="p-0424" num="0437">In some examples, the analysis may include comparing baseline images to the images captured of the patient with patient interface <b>3000</b> when they are experiencing issues. In this example, the images may be compared to determine changes in positioning of the patient interface <b>3000</b> relative to one or more features of the patient's face, changes in the relative positioning of one feature of the patient interface (e.g., a first strap) to another feature of the patient interface (e.g., a second strap). Before images are compared, the captured images may be processed (e.g., scaled, background removed) to improve the analysis. Captured images may be scaled such that the patient's features in the captured image correspond in size to the patient's features in the baseline images.</p><p id="p-0425" num="0438">In some examples, the analysis may include analysing the received audible and/or text (with or without analysing the images) to determine the source of the discomfort or ineffective supply of breathable gas, and to provide a solution to the identified issues. In other examples, the analysis may include leak detection data obtained from sensors to provide adjustment feedback for better fit.</p><p id="p-0426" num="0439">The results of the analysis may be displayed by the application (Step <b>7026</b>). The results of the analysis may include advice to the user on how to correct the identified issue with the patient interface <b>3000</b>. The results of the analysis may include identification of differences in positioning of the patient interface <b>3000</b> between the baseline images and the captured images. The application may display instructions for correcting the position of the patient interface <b>3000</b> such that the patient interface <b>3000</b> is provided in a position provided in the baseline images. For example, the displayed instructions may include text, images, and/or animations indicating how to adjust a length of a strap on one side of the face so that the strap exerts a pressure on the side of the seal forming structure that is approximately equal to pressure exerted on an opposite side of the seal forming structure by the strap on another side of the face.</p><p id="p-0427" num="0440">The displayed analysis results may include displaying the captured images and one or more indicators showing locations where the patient interface can be adjusted to improve comfort and/or fit. The indicators may include text, symbols, shading, and/or outlines of patient interface edges to indicate the location of the source of issue. The indicator may be user selectable, to provide more information about the identified issues. The indicator may include a plurality of numbers indication locations where the patient interface can be adjusted, the numbers being ordered based on the degree of expected improvement in comfort and/or fit.</p><p id="p-0428" num="0441">Once it has been determined that there are no issues with the patient interface (No in Step <b>7020</b>), the program may go to a resolved state (Step <b>7030</b>). The resolved state may be maintained until one or more of the following occurs:<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0442">a user indicates that an issue is being experienced with the patient interface,</li>        <li id="ul0010-0002" num="0443">a determination is made that a new patient interface is being used (e.g., based on detecting a new patient interface is coupled to the RPT device <b>4000</b>),</li>        <li id="ul0010-0003" num="0444">data from one or more of the sensors indicate that there is incorrect positioning of the patient interface <b>3000</b>,</li>        <li id="ul0010-0004" num="0445">a predetermined amount of time has passed after entering the resolved state,</li>        <li id="ul0010-0005" num="0446">after the RPT device <b>4000</b> has been used for a predetermined amount of time after entering the resolved state, or</li>        <li id="ul0010-0006" num="0447">after the RPT device <b>4000</b> has been used for a predetermined number of times after entering the resolved state.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0429" num="0448">After the program runs through steps <b>7022</b>, <b>7024</b> and <b>7026</b>, a determination may again be made in Step <b>7010</b> to determine of the patient is experiencing any new/further issues with the patient interface (step <b>7020</b>). After adjusting the positioning of the patient interface, steps <b>7022</b>, <b>7024</b> and <b>7026</b>, may be repeated until the user is satisfied with the comfort and effectiveness of the patient interface <b>3000</b>.</p><p id="p-0430" num="0449">As discussed above, in some examples of the present technology, the determination of whether the patient is having issues with the patient interface may be made automatically based on data received from one or more sensors (e.g., a transducer). The data from the sensors may also be used to perform the analysis (step <b>7024</b>) and/or make recommendations to the patient at step <b>7026</b>). The sensors may be disposed in the RPT device <b>4000</b> and/or air circuit <b>4170</b> indicating whether there are any leaks in the patient interface <b>3000</b> and/or incorrect positioning of the patient interface <b>3000</b>. Determining issues (steps <b>7020</b> and/or <b>7024</b>) with the use of the patient interface <b>300</b> and/or displaying results (step <b>7026</b>) of the analysis based on the sensor data may be performed together with the analysis of the images or as an alternative to the analysis made based on the images.</p><p id="p-0431" num="0450">The output from the one or more sensors may be used as input data for determining issues with the mask and providing recommendations for correcting the issues. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, a sensor <b>4270</b> (e.g., a transducer) may be disposed on a surface of or inside a mask (e.g., a mouth cushion and/or a nasal cushion of the mask) and/or the stabilising structure <b>3300</b> (e.g., one or more of the straps <b>3330</b> and/or <b>3340</b> and/or tubes <b>3310</b> and <b>3320</b>). The sensor <b>4270</b> may include one or more of a flow rate sensor, a pressure sensor, a temperature sensor, a piezo electric sensor, a motion sensor, a position sensor, and/or a strain gauge. In some examples, the sensor <b>4270</b> may detect a proper connection between different components of the patient interface. In one example, the strain gauge may be provided on a surface of or within the headgear and/or the cushion of the patient interface <b>3000</b> and be configured to sense tension in portions of the headgear and/or the cushion. The sensor <b>4270</b> may provide data to a processor wirelessly and/or over a wired connection.</p><p id="p-0432" num="0451">The output from the sensors may be used to detect changes in positioning and/or characteristics of the mask and/or headgear placement in real-time while the patient adjusts the setup in accordance with instructions (e.g., display screens <b>206</b> and <b>208</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>). The data from the sensors may be compared to pre-set values, stored in memory, which are determined by the manufacturer or clinician for example, or received from the sensors when the patient establishes a baseline with a mask/headgear providing a proper fit (e.g., step <b>7018</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref>). During execution of steps <b>7020</b>-<b>7026</b>, the sensor data may be received and compared to the pre-set values. The results of the analysis (step <b>7026</b>) may be displayed based on the results of the comparison and updated in real-time as the patient adjusts the patient interface.</p><p id="p-0433" num="0452">In some examples, the sensor data may be received periodically to determine if there are any issues detected with the use of the patient interface. For example, the sensor data may be received when the patient connects the patient interface to the RPT device <b>4000</b> and/or after a predetermined amount of time after start of a treatment cycle.</p><p id="p-0434" num="0453">In some examples, one or more operations (e.g., operations in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref>) may be performed continuously over a predetermined period of time. For example, operations <b>7016</b> and <b>7018</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref> may be performed continuously in real time over a predetermined period of time to aid the patient with fitting the patient interface. In this example, the application may capture a plurality of images, which may be captured in the form of a video, determine a proper fit (e.g., needed setting) of the selected patient interface for the patient based on the facial structure of the patient, and guide the patient in providing the proper fit until the patient interface is properly placed on the patient.</p><p id="p-0435" num="0454">In the example for providing setting for headgear strap length, the patient's facial structure may be cross referenced with predetermined headgear strap lengths to calculate the length and tightening of the headgear for the patient. The data for this determination may be stored in the application or in a remote location. In some example, patient demographic information, images and/or information about the patient's facial profile may be transmitted to a remote processing system (e.g., the remote external device <b>4286</b>) to perform the analysis and the application may receive the analysis results from the remote processing system.</p><p id="p-0436" num="0455">The image of the patient, captured in operation <b>7018</b>, may be analysed to determine if the current settings of the patient interface correspond to the determined length and tightening of the headgear for the patient. In operation <b>7016</b>, instructions are displayed to instruct the patient in making the adjustments needed to achieve the determined length and tightening of the headgear for the patient. The instructions may include overlay of estimated tightening onto the patient's facial structure and provide visual and audible cues for when the patient has reached the estimated amount of headgear adjustment. The instructions may include a visual and/or audible indicator when the estimated amount of headgear adjustment is achieved.</p><heading id="h-0110" level="1">5.7.4 Patient Interface with Indicators and Reference Points</heading><p id="p-0437" num="0456"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> shows a patient interface <b>3000</b> including a plurality of measurable indicators <b>3350</b> and reference points according to one form of the present technology.

For example if distance D<b>1</b> between two reference points increases from the distance in the baseline, a determination may be made that a proper connection between the oro-nasal mask and tube <b>3320</b> connecting to the oro-nasal mask is not present. As another example, if distance D<b>2</b> between two reference points increases from the distance in the baseline, a determination may be made that the length of tube <b>3320</b> is too long and needs to be reduced. If distance D<b>3</b> between two reference points is different from the corresponding distance in the baseline, a determination may be made that the length of tube <b>3320</b> needs to be adjusted by extending or contracting an expandable portion <b>3302</b> of the tube <b>3320</b>.</p><p id="p-0444" num="0463">According to one form of the present technology, the extracted reference points <b>3360</b> may be used to build a three-dimensional profile of the patient interface (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>) and measurements may be compared to a three-dimensional profile of the patient interface provided in the baseline. In this example, angles between lines connecting the reference points, distances of lines connecting the reference points, presence of parallel lines, and/or presence of perpendicular lines may be compared to the baseline to determine changes in the positioning and configuration of the patient interface <b>3000</b>.</p><p id="p-0445" num="0464">While not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, patient features (e.g., one or more features shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B-<b>2</b>F</figref>) may also be extracted and used as part of the analysis to determine changes in positioning of the patient interface <b>3000</b>.

In CPAP therapy with EPR, either or both of the IPAP and the EPAP may be constant values that are hard-coded or manually entered to the RPT device <b>4000</b>. Alternatively, the therapy parameter determination algorithm <b>4329</b> may repeatedly compute the IPAP and/or the EPAP during CPAP with EPR.

In a form of servo-ventilation known as adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV), which has been used to treat CSR, the respiratory parameter is ventilation, and the target ventilation value Vtgt is computed by the target ventilation determination algorithm <b>4328</b> from the typical recent ventilation Vtyp, as described above.</p><p id="p-0501" num="0520">In some forms of servo-ventilation, the therapy parameter determination algorithm <b>4329</b> applies a control methodology to repeatedly compute the pressure support A so as to bring the current measure of the respiratory parameter towards the target value. One such control methodology is Proportional-Integral (PI) control. In one implementation of PI control, suitable for ASV modes in which a target ventilation Vtgt is set to slightly less than the typical recent ventilation Vtyp, the pressure support A is repeatedly computed as:</p><p id="p-0502" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>A=G</i>&#x222b;(<i>Vent&#x2212;Vtgt</i>)<i>dt</i>&#x2003;&#x2003;(2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0503" num="0521">where G is the gain of the PI control.

Conventional means for retrospectively analysing the parameters of a therapy session to assess the severity of CSR during the therapy session may be employed in such implementations In yet other implementations, the gain G may vary depending on the difference between the current measure Vent of ventilation and the target ventilation Vtgt.</p><p id="p-0504" num="0522">Other servo-ventilation control methodologies that may be applied by the therapy parameter determination algorithm <b>4329</b> include proportional (P), proportional-differential (PD), and proportional-integral-differential (PID).</p><p id="p-0505" num="0523">The value of the pressure support A computed via equation (Error!

The multiple cross-sections may cut the surface in a plane that includes the outward normal (a &#x201c;normal plane&#x201d;), and each cross-section may be taken in a different direction. Each cross-section results in a plane curve with a corresponding curvature. The different curvatures at that point may have the same sign, or a different sign. Each of the curvatures at that point has a magnitude, e.g. relatively small.

A space curve may be closed, that is, having no endpoints. A space curve may be considered to be a one-dimensional piece of three-dimensional space. An imaginary person walking on a strand of the DNA helix walks along a space curve. A typical human left ear comprises a helix, which is a left-hand helix, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>Q</figref>. A typical human right ear comprises a helix, which is a right-hand helix, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>R</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>S</figref> shows a right-hand helix. The edge of a structure, e.g. the edge of a membrane or impeller, may follow a space curve. In general, a space curve may be described by a curvature and a torsion at each point on the space curve. Torsion is a measure of how the curve turns out of a plane. Torsion has a sign and a magnitude. The torsion at a point on a space curve may be characterised with reference to the tangent, normal and binormal vectors at that point.</p><p id="p-0653" num="0673">Tangent unit vector (or unit tangent vector): For each point on a curve, a vector at the point specifies a direction from that point, as well as a magnitude. A tangent unit vector is a unit vector pointing in the same direction as the curve at that point. If an imaginary person were flying along the curve and fell off her vehicle at a particular point, the direction of the tangent vector is the direction she would be travelling.</p><p id="p-0654" num="0674">Unit normal vector: As the imaginary person moves along the curve, this tangent vector itself changes. The unit vector pointing in the same direction that the tangent vector is changing is called the unit principal normal vector. It is perpendicular to the tangent vector.</p><p id="p-0655" num="0675">Binormal unit vector: The binormal unit vector is perpendicular to both the tangent vector and the principal normal vector. Its direction may be determined by a right-hand rule (see e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>P</figref>), or alternatively by a left-hand rule (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>O</figref>).</p><p id="p-0656" num="0676">Osculating plane: The plane containing the unit tangent vector and the unit principal normal vector. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>O and <b>3</b>P</figref>.</p><p id="p-0657" num="0677">Torsion of a space curve: The torsion at a point of a space curve is the magnitude of the rate of change of the binormal unit vector at that point. It measures how much the curve deviates from the osculating plane. A space curve which lies in a plane has zero torsion. A space curve which deviates a relatively small amount from the osculating plane will have a relatively small magnitude of torsion (e.g. a gently sloping helical path). A space curve which deviates a relatively large amount from the osculating plane will have a relatively large magnitude of torsion (e.g. a steeply sloping helical path). With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>S</figref>, since T2&#x3e;T1, the magnitude of the torsion near the top coils of the helix of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>S</figref> is greater than the magnitude of the torsion of the bottom coils of the helix of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>S</figref></p><p id="p-0658" num="0678">With reference to the right-hand rule of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>P</figref>, a space curve turning towards the direction of the right-hand binormal may be considered as having a right-hand positive torsion (e.g. a right-hand helix as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>S</figref>). A space curve turning away from the direction of the right-hand binormal may be considered as having a right-hand negative torsion (e.g. a left-hand helix).</p><p id="p-0659" num="0679">Equivalently, and with reference to a left-hand rule (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>O</figref>), a space curve turning towards the direction of the left-hand binormal may be considered as having a left-hand positive torsion (e.g. a left-hand helix).
