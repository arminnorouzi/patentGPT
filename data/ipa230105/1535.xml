When these wafers are cut along the planned dividing lines, individual device chips are formed. Among the wafers are wafer for semiconductor devices formed of silicon, gallium arsenide, or the like, wafer for optical devices formed of SiC (silicon carbide) or the like, package substrate including resin and metal, ceramic substrate, glass substrate, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The cutting is carried out by a cutting apparatus having a cutting unit including a cutting blade having a circular ring shape for example. The cutting unit has a spindle that serves as the axis of rotation and has a circular column shape and the cutting blade is mounted to the tip of the spindle. As the cutting blade, a proper cutting blade is selected depending on the type of workpiece and the contents of processing. The cutting blade is rotated by rotating the spindle, and a workpiece is cut when the rotating cutting blade is brought into contact with the workpiece. The cutting blade has a cutting abrasive containing abrasive grains and a bond material that holds the abrasive grains. In the state in which the abrasive grains are moderately exposed from the bond material, the abrasive grains get contact with a workpiece and thus the workpiece can be properly cut. However, in the case of an unused cutting blade or a cutting blade that has been worn and be lowered in the cutting capability, the abrasive grains are buried in the bond material or dropping-off of the abrasive grains from the bond material, or the like, has occurred, and the cutting blade is not in the state in which proper cutting can be carried out in many cases. Thus, the cutting blade is adjusted by processing called dressing. The dressing is carried out by causing a cutting blade to cut a dressing board. When cutting the dressing board, the cutting blade is properly worn and the abrasive grains are moderately exposed from the bond material.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Furthermore, when an unused cutting blade is mounted to the cutting unit, the distance from the rotation axis to the outer circumference of the cutting blade is not uniform in the whole circumference in some cases. When such a cutting blade is subjected to dressing, the part at which the distance from the rotation axis is longer is worn intensely compared with the part at which the distance from the rotation axis is shorter and the distance from the rotation axis to the outer circumference becomes uniform in the whole circumference, so that the cutting blade becomes the state in which proper cutting can be carried out. As above, the dressing of the cutting blade is carried out for the purposes of moderately exposing the abrasive grains from the bond material (referred to also as blade sharpening) and making the distance from the rotation axis to the outer circumference uniform (referred to also as roundness generation). Various kinds of dressing boards exist and the proper kind of dressing board is used according to the kind of cutting blade and the purpose of dressing. In order to carry out dressing properly and efficiently, a wide variety of dressing boards and cutting apparatuses have been developed (refer to Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 2006-218571, 2011-11280, and 2011-16175).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">If an improper kind of dressing board is accidentally used when dressing of a cutting blade is carried out, breaking occurs in the cutting blade or the state of blade sharpening deteriorates in some cases. Thus, in order to prevent erroneous use of the dressing board, a technique in which a barcode (one-dimensional code) in which information relating to a dressing board is stored is printed on a surface of the dressing board has been proposed (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2012-66328). When the dressing board is used, the barcode is read and the information is checked by a cutting apparatus.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, the amount of information that can be stored in the barcode is small and the information that can be stored in the barcode and relates to the dressing board is limited. Thus, it is conceivable that a two-dimensional code, with which the amount of information that can be stored is comparatively large, is disposed on the dressing board instead of the barcode. When the whole surface of the dressing board is employed as the region that can be cut for dressing thoroughly, the dressing board can be efficiently used. However, when the region in which the two-dimensional code is disposed is cut by a cutting blade even partly, the two-dimensional code becomes unreadable. For this reason, when use of the dressing board is suspended once and the dressing board is removed from a cutting apparatus and thereafter using the dressing board again is attempted, it is impossible to check the information relating to the dressing board from the two-dimensional code in some cases.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is made in view of these problems and an object thereof is to provide a dressing board that allows acquisition of information relating to the dressing board even when being cut by a cutting blade, a use method of the dressing board, and a cutting apparatus.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a dressing board used when dressing of a cutting blade is carried out. The dressing board includes a two-dimensional code that is disposed on a surface of the dressing board and includes information relating to properties of the dressing board and a barcode that is disposed on the surface of the dressing board and includes identification information associated with the information relating to the properties.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably, the information relating to the properties includes information relating to abrasive grains of the dressing board, a bond material of the dressing board, the size of the dressing board, or a product type of the cutting blade that corresponds.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Furthermore, in accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a use method of a dressing board having, on a surface, a two-dimensional code including information relating to properties of the dressing board and a barcode including identification information associated with the information relating to the properties. A cutting apparatus is used in the use method. The cutting apparatus includes a chuck table that holds a workpiece, a cutting unit that cuts the workpiece held by the chuck table by a cutting blade, a control unit that includes an information registration part and controls each constituent element, and an imaging unit connected to the control unit. The use method includes a dressing board disposing step of disposing the dressing board in the cutting apparatus, an identification information reading step of imaging the barcode of the dressing board disposed in the disposing step by the imaging unit and reading the identification information from the barcode, and an information registration step of determining whether or not the identification information has been already registered in the information registration part and, if the identification information has not been registered in the information registration part, reading the information relating to the properties from the two-dimensional code to register the information relating to the properties in the information registration part in association with the identification information.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition, in accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a use method of a dressing board having, on a surface, a two-dimensional code including information relating to properties of the dressing board and a barcode including identification information associated with the information relating to the properties. A cutting apparatus is used in the use method. The cutting apparatus includes a chuck table that holds a workpiece, a cutting unit that cuts the workpiece held by the chuck table by a cutting blade, a control unit that controls each constituent element, and an imaging unit connected to the control unit. The control unit includes an information registration part in which the identification information included in the barcode possessed by the dressing board and the information relating to the properties, included in the two-dimensional code, are registered in association with each other in advance and a specifying part in which a kind of dressing board suitable for dressing of the cutting blade is registered. The use method includes a dressing board disposing step of disposing the dressing board in the cutting apparatus, an identification information reading step of imaging the barcode of the dressing board disposed in the disposing step by the imaging unit and reading the identification information from the barcode, a determination step of reading out, from the information registration part, the information relating to the properties associated with the identification information read in the identification information reading step and determining whether or not the properties of the dressing board included in the information relating to the properties match the kind of dressing board suitable for dressing of the cutting blade, registered in the specifying part, and an informing step of informing that the dressing board is improper if the properties of the dressing board do not match the kind of dressing board suitable for dressing of the cutting blade.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Moreover, in accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a cutting apparatus including a chuck table that holds a workpiece, a first cutting unit that cuts the workpiece held by the chuck table by a first cutting blade, a control unit that controls each constituent element, and an imaging unit connected to the control unit. The control unit includes a reading part that is connected to the imaging unit and reads a barcode and a two-dimensional code that are possessed by a dressing board disposed in the cutting apparatus, an information registration part in which identification information read from the barcode by the reading part and information relating to properties of the dressing board, read from the two-dimensional code, are registered in association with each other, a specifying part in which a kind of dressing board suitable for dressing of the first cutting blade is registered, and a determining part that determines whether or not the properties of the dressing board included in the information relating to the properties read out from the information registration part based on the identification information read by the reading part match the kind of dressing board suitable for dressing of the first cutting blade, registered in the specifying part.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, the cutting apparatus includes a first dress table that holds the dressing board. Furthermore, the cutting apparatus further includes a second cutting unit that cuts the workpiece held by the chuck table by a second cutting blade and a second dress table that holds a second dressing board used when dressing of the second cutting blade is carried out.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">For the dressing board according to one aspect of the present invention, the two-dimensional code including the information relating to the properties of the dressing board and the barcode including the identification information associated with the information relating to the properties are disposed on the surface. Thus, by imaging the dressing board by the imaging unit or the like, the identification information can be acquired from the barcode and the information relating to the properties can be acquired from the two-dimensional code. In the control unit of the cutting apparatus according to one aspect of the present invention, the information relating to the properties can be registered in association with the identification information.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">When dressing by use of the dressing board is carried out and the two-dimensional code printed on the dressing board is cut even partly, it becomes impossible to read the information relating to the properties from the two-dimensional code. Thus, the two-dimensional code cannot be read in some cases although reading the two-dimensional code is attempted when the dressing board is used again after being removed from the cutting apparatus once. However, the identification information can be read from the barcode left on the surface between two adjacent cut grooves among cut grooves formed due to the cutting. For this reason, if the information relating to the properties stored in the two-dimensional code is registered in the cutting apparatus in association with the identification information in advance, the information relating to the properties can be extracted from the identification information.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As above, a dressing board that allows acquisition of information relating to the dressing board even when being cut by a cutting blade, a use method of the dressing board, and a cutting apparatus are provided by the present invention.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention and the manner of realizing them will become more apparent, and the invention itself will best be understood from a study of the following description and appended claims with reference to the attached drawings showing a preferred embodiment of the invention.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view schematically depicting a dressing board;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view schematically depicting a cutting apparatus;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a side view for explaining the positional relationship among a cutting unit, a chuck table, a dress table, and an imaging camera of the cutting apparatus;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is a flowchart for explaining a method in which identification information of the dressing board and information relating to properties are registered in an information registration part in association with each other;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is a flowchart for explaining a method in which it is determined whether or not the properties of the dressing board are suitable for dressing of a cutting blade;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> is a top view schematically depicting dressing of the cutting blade by use of the dressing board;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> is a top view schematically depicting the dressing board used for the dressing; and</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a block diagram for schematically explaining the configuration of a control unit and various kinds of information.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">An embodiment relating to one aspect of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. The embodiment of the present invention is a dressing board, a use method of a dressing board, and a cutting apparatus.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view schematically depicting the dressing board according to the present embodiment. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a barcode <b>3</b> and a two-dimensional code <b>5</b> are disposed on a surface of a dressing board <b>1</b>. The dressing board <b>1</b> is used for dressing of a cutting blade mounted to a cutting apparatus. The cutting blade has a cutting abrasive containing abrasive grains and a bond material (binging material) that holds the abrasive grains. In the state in which the abrasive grains are moderately exposed from the bond material, the abrasive grains can get contact with a workpiece and thus the workpiece can be properly cut. However, in the case of an unused cutting blade or a cutting blade that has been worn and be lowered in the cutting capability, the abrasive grains are buried in the bond material or dropping-off of the abrasive grains from the bond material, or the like, has occurred, and the cutting blade is not in the state in which proper cutting can be carried out in many cases. Thus, the cutting blade is adjusted by processing called dressing in which the cutting blade is caused to cut the dressing board. When cutting the dressing board, the cutting blade is properly worn and the abrasive grains are moderately exposed from the bond material, which provides the state in which proper cutting can be carried out.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Furthermore, when an unused cutting blade is mounted to a cutting unit, the distance from the rotation axis to the outer circumference of the cutting blade is not uniform in the whole circumference in some cases. When such a cutting blade is subjected to dressing, the part at which the distance from the rotation axis is comparatively longer is worn more intensely relative to the part at which the distance from the rotation axis is comparatively shorter and the distance from the rotation axis to the outer circumference becomes uniform in the whole circumference, so that the cutting blade becomes the state in which proper cutting can be carried out.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As above, the dressing of the cutting blade is carried out for the purposes of moderately exposing the abrasive grains from the bond material (referred to also as blade sharpening) and making the distance from the rotation axis to the outer circumference uniform (referred to also as roundness generation). The dressing board also contains a bond material and abrasive grains. Various kinds of dressing boards exist and the proper kind of dressing board is used according to the kind of cutting blade as the target of dressing and the purpose of dressing.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">For example, the bond material is resin, ceramics, or the like and the abrasive grains are green carborundum, white alundum, or the like. The size of the abrasive grains is typically #200 to #2000. For a cutting blade in which the bond material is hard or a cutting blade in which the abrasive grains are large, a dressing board in which the bond material is hard or a dressing board in which the abrasive grains are large is used. Furthermore, for a cutting blade in which the bond material is soft or a cutting blade in which the abrasive grains are small, a dressing board in which the bond material is soft or a dressing board in which the abrasive grains are small is used.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">On the dressing board <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment, the barcode <b>3</b> and the two-dimensional code <b>5</b> are disposed. Identification information of the dressing board <b>1</b> is stored in the barcode <b>3</b>. The identification information is a unique number such as a manufacturing number of the dressing board <b>1</b> for example. Generally the amount of information that can be stored in the barcode is comparatively small and it is impossible to store all of information relating to properties of the dressing board. Thus, on the dressing board <b>1</b>, the two-dimensional code <b>5</b> in which information relating to properties of the dressing board <b>1</b> is stored is disposed. The information stored in the two-dimensional code <b>5</b> is product number, manufacturing number, manufacturing date, expiration date, size (vertical and horizontal lengths, thickness) of the dressing board <b>1</b>, the kinds of bond (binding material) and abrasive grains contained in the dressing board <b>1</b>, and so forth (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). Furthermore, information relating to the kind of cutting blade suitable for dressing with the dressing board <b>1</b> may be stored.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Next, the cutting apparatus according to the present embodiment in which the dressing board <b>1</b> is used will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view schematically depicting the cutting apparatus <b>2</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the cutting apparatus <b>2</b> includes a base <b>4</b> that supports the respective structures. A rectangular opening <b>4</b><i>a </i>is formed at a corner part on the front side of the base <b>4</b> and a cassette support base <b>6</b> that ascends and descends is provided in the opening <b>4</b><i>a. </i>A cassette <b>8</b> that houses plural workpieces <b>11</b> is placed on the upper surface of the cassette support base <b>6</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, only the contour of the cassette <b>8</b> is depicted for convenience of explanation.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The workpiece <b>11</b> is a circular wafer composed of a semiconductor material such as silicon for example and the front surface side thereof is divided into a device region at the center and a peripheral surplus region surrounding the device region. The device region <b>15</b> is further segmented into plural regions by planned dividing lines (streets) arranged in a lattice manner and a device such as integrated circuit (IC) or large scale integration (LSI) is formed in each region. A dicing tape <b>17</b> with a diameter larger than the workpiece <b>11</b> is stuck to the back surface side of the workpiece <b>11</b>. The peripheral part of the dicing tape <b>17</b> is fixed to a ring-shaped frame <b>19</b>.
