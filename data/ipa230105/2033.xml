The electric aircraft may include an electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. As used herein, a vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft is one that can hover, take off, and land vertically.

Fixed-wing flight, as described herein, is where the aircraft is capable of flight using wings and/or foils that generate life caused by the aircraft's forward airspeed and the shape of the wings and/or foils, such as airplane-style flight.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a number of aerodynamic forces may act upon eVTOL aircraft <b>100</b> during flight. Forces acting on eVTOL aircraft <b>100</b> during flight may include, without limitation, thrust, defined as a forward force produced by a propulsor of the eVTOL aircraft <b>100</b> that acts parallel to a longitudinal axis of the eVTOL aircraft.

Lift generated by an airfoil may depend on speed of airflow, density of air, total area of an airfoil and/or segment thereof, and/or an angle of attack between air and the airfoil. For example, and without limitation, eVTOL aircraft <b>100</b> may be designed to be as lightweight as possible. Reducing weight of an aircraft and designing to reduce the number of components is essential to optimize the weight.
