These systems are, however, constrained by the infrastructure required for their deployment. The infrastructure typically includes a specialized building which houses bulky, heavy steel tanks for storing high-pressure hydrogen gas or helium gas.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Furthermore, specialized high-pressure gas plumbing may be needed to reduce safety risk associated with transport and handling of the high-pressurized gas. In situations where hydrogen gas is used, the infrastructure often require additional construction to eliminate spark hazards. The transport of steel storage tanks for hydrogen or helium may also be logistically burdensome.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In addition to the above, ground based inflation and launch of balloon systems may have various challenges. For example, to deploy balloons under high wind conditions from the ground, specialized launch bags may be required to restrain the balloon to the ground to prevent the balloon from contacting sharp objects that can result in puncturing and damage to the balloon. Furthermore, to avoid excess heating caused by the depressurizing gas, inflation of small and medium-sized balloons from steel tanks may take a relatively long period of time. Similarly, shipboard applications, for which the communication capabilities of high-altitude balloons are particularly useful, may also pose challenges. For example, the storage, production, and/or handling of high-pressure gas (e.g., hydrogen gas) aboard vessels may pose potential safety concerns.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In view of the above, the Inventors have appreciated that the need for a system for producing hydrogen gas that does not require specialized infrastructure, and is easy and safe to transport and handle. In particular, the Inventors have recognized the need for a system that may be capable of producing hydrogen gas when the system is at least partially immersed in a body of water. In instances in which the system is used to provide hydrogen gas for inflating a balloon, this may permit the balloon to be inflated and launched directly from a body of water (e.g., sea, ocean, river, lake, etc.). Such a system may advantageously remove the need for specialized infrastructure, bulky hydrogen gas storage tanks, and at the same time, bypasses the difficulties associated with ground based inflation and launch of typical balloon systems, e.g., such as the potential for puncturing of balloons during high wind conditions. However, other applications of the disclosed systems for producing hydrogen are also contemplated.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">While various embodiments herein are related to systems (e.g., balloon systems) and methods directed to applications in a body of water, it should be understood that the disclosure is not limited, and in certain cases, the system may also be employed in ground based applications. Compared to conventional systems, the systems described herein may also exhibit certain advantages for ground base applications, e.g., such as the ability to produce hydrogen gas, a lack of need for cumbersome infrastructure, as well as automated hydrogen generation processes in addition to other potential benefits.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Certain aspects of the present disclosure are directed to a system for producing hydrogen gas. In some embodiments, the system comprises a reaction chamber configured to contain a reactant that is capable of reacting with water to generate a gas, e.g., such as hydrogen gas. In some embodiments, the reactant comprises one or more of a metal and/or alloy thereof. Non-limiting examples of the reactant are described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, the reaction chamber is at least partially immersed in an exterior environment. In some cases, the exterior environment may contain a liquid comprising water. For example, the exterior environment may be a body of water, such as an ocean, a lake, a river, a pond, and/or any other body of water. Non-limiting examples of a liquid comprising water may include freshwater, brackish water, seawater, contaminated water, salt water, water comprising one or more solutes, etc.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, a substantial portion (e.g., at least 50 vol %, 60 vol %, 70 vol %, 80 vol %, 90 vol %, 95 vol %, 99 vol %, or all) of the reaction chamber may be immersed in an exterior environment. In some embodiments, the reaction chamber comprises an inlet, and the reaction chamber may be immersed in the exterior environment to an extent such that the inlet of the reaction chamber is in fluidic communication (e.g., direct fluidic communication) with the exterior environment. For example, in some instances, when the inlet of the reaction chamber may be in fluidic communication with the exterior environment, the inlet may permit a liquid from the exterior environment to flow into the reaction chamber via the inlet.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, the system further comprises a one way valve disposed along a flow path extending between the inlet and an interior of the reaction chamber. That is, the one way valve may be positioned in any appropriate location along a path which a liquid entering into the inlet of the reaction chamber travels to reach the inside of the reaction chamber. In some cases, the one way valve may be configured to permit unidirectional flow of a liquid from an exterior environment into the interior of the reaction chamber and to prevent backflow of the liquid from reaction chamber. As described in more detail below, the one way valve, by permitting a liquid to flow from the exterior environment into the reaction chamber, may in turn allow the reactant contained with the reaction chamber and the influent liquid (e.g., water) to combine and react to form hydrogen gas.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As described in more detail below, the system may further include additional components, e.g., such a balloon, a ballast, one or more controllers, one or more sensors, one or more valves or vents, various types of payloads, etc., that impart the system with various enhanced capabilities. For example, the various components described herein may allow for automated inflation and launch of the balloon system in a body of water, as well as automated buoyancy and/or altitude controls prior to the launch and/or while in flight.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Certain aspects of the present disclosure are also directed to a method for filling and/or using the hydrogen generating systems described herein. In some embodiments, the method first comprises immersing, at least partially, a reaction chamber containing one or more reactants in an exterior environment containing a liquid that comprises water. The exterior environment and liquid may be any of a variety of environment and liquid described elsewhere herein. In one set of embodiments, a substantial portion (e.g., at least 50 vol %, at least 60 vol %, at least 70 vol %, at least 80 vol %, at least 90 vol %, at least 95%, or all) of the reaction chamber is immersed in the exterior environment. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the reaction chamber may be immersed in the exterior environment to an extent such that an inlet of the reaction chamber is in fluid communication with the exterior environment. As such, the liquid may flow from the exterior environment into the reaction chamber via the inlet of the reaction chamber. As the liquid flows in the reaction chamber, the water from the liquid may combine with the reactant contained within the reaction chamber to undergo one or more chemical reactions to produce hydrogen gas. In some cases, other gases, e.g., such as steam, may also be produced from the reaction. The one or more gases may in turn flow through an outlet from the of the reaction chamber. For example, in some embodiments, the provided gas may flow from the outlet into a balloon fluidically connected to the reaction chamber to increase a buoyancy of the balloon though other applications may also be used. As described in more detail below, the buoyancy of the system may be controlled via one or more automated buoyancy and/or altitude controls.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, a reaction chamber comprises an inlet configured to receive an inlet flow of liquid from an exterior environment. The reaction chamber may further comprise an outlet configured to flow a gas produced (e.g., hydrogen gas, etc.) in the reaction chamber into an inlet of an attached balloon. In some embodiments, the inlet of the reaction chamber may comprise an inlet flow control. The inlet flow control may be a gate valve, a ball valve, a butterfly valve, or any other suitable valve that can control the flow of a liquid from the exterior environment into the inlet of the reaction chamber. In some embodiments, the inlet flow control may be in the form of a one way valve configured to allow a liquid to flow into the inlet, while preventing the liquid from flowing out of the inlet into the exterior environment. As described in more detail below, the inlet flow control may be optionally controlled by a controller. As such, the inlet flow control may be operated such that the inlet and/or associated valve is configured to open when the reaction is immersed in the exterior environment. The inlet, when in an open state or otherwise operated to permit flow of a liquid, may be in fluid communication with an exterior environment such that a liquid from the exterior environment is permitted to travel through the inlet into the reaction chamber.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one set of embodiments, the reaction chamber may comprise a controller configured to open the inlet based at least in part on an initiation signal. For example, the controller, upon receiving the initiation signal, may be configured to actuate the inlet and associated valve to open and permit flow of a liquid from an exterior environment into the reaction chamber. In some cases, the initiation signal may be generated by a sensor positioned on an exterior of the reaction chamber. The sensor may, in some cases, be configured to sense a parameter associated the exterior environment. For example, upon sensing a parameter associated with the exterior environment, the sensor may generate an initiation signal that is in turn delivered to the controller. The controller, upon receive the initiation signal, may be configured to actuate the inlet to transition to an open state, thereby permitting flow of a liquid from the exterior environment into the reaction chamber. Any of a variety of a suitable sensors may be employed, including but not limiting to, a liquid level sensor, a pressure sensor, an oxygen sensor, a temperature sensor, a flow sensor, etc. Non-limiting examples of a parameter that may be sensed include H<sub>2</sub>O, liquid level, oxygen level, pressure, temperature, flow, etc.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, the reaction chamber may comprise vessel walls comprising a non-porous material. The non-porous material may be watertight and/or gas tight, e.g., such that a liquid from an exterior environment and/or the generated gaseous products (e.g., hydrogen and/or oxygen) is incapable of diffusing or transferring across the vessel walls.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, the systems disclosed herein may include a balloon in fluid communication with the reaction chamber. The inlet of the balloon may be connected to an outlet of the reaction chamber. As noted above, via the outlet of the reaction chamber, the balloon may be configured to receive a gaseous product (e.g., a hydrogen gas, steam) produced from the reaction chamber. In some embodiments, the one way valve coupled to the inlet of the reaction chamber, by preventing counterflow of liquid from the reaction chamber into the exterior chamber, may force the gaseous product to flow into the outlet of the reaction chamber and into the inlet of the balloon.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, the system comprises a mechanism configured to detach the balloon from the reaction chamber. In one set of embodiments, upon inflation and prior to lift off, the balloon may be configured to detach from the reaction chamber. For example, in some cases, the balloon may be configured to detach from the reaction chamber based on an elapsed reaction time associated with the reaction occurring within the reaction chamber. Alternatively or additionally, the balloon may be configured to detach from the reaction chamber based on a particular lift force resulting from the gaseous products (e.g., hydrogen gas) formed in the reaction. When the elapsed reaction time and/or lift force exceed a threshold value, the balloon may be filled with an amount of gas (e.g., hydrogen and steam) sufficient for the balloon to lift off and increase in altitude. It should also be noted that the present disclosure is not so limited, and that in other embodiments, the balloon may stay attached to the reaction chamber (and associated components) as an integrated system at all times (e.g., take off, in flight).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, the balloon may be made from any suitable material. For instance, the material may be capable of withstanding a temperature and/or pressure associated with the steam and hydrogen gas in the balloon. For instance, the material may be any suitable polymers or elastic polymers. In some instances, the polymer may be hydrophobic polymers. Non-limiting examples of the material include uncured latex, polyamide, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), etc. In some instance, a material that is capable of continual operation at temperatures of up to about 100&#xb0; C. may be chosen.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, the system further comprises an altitude controller configured to control buoyancy of the system (e.g., balloon system). For example, upon receiving commands from the altitude controller, the system may be configured to increase or decrease the buoyancy of the system during the course of the flight. The altitude controller may comprise a processor operatively coupled to one or more sensors and other components of the system for detecting an altitude of the system. For example, using information from the sensors, the processor may control the buoyancy of the system based on input from the one or more sensors for sensing the altitude of the balloon. The altitude controller may communicate with the system wirelessly or via a wired connection. In some embodiments, the system may additionally include a memory associated with the processor. The memory may include instructions that when executed by the processor perform the methods described herein. Of course, it should be understood that while embodiments related to the use of sensors have been described, embodiments in which sensors are not used are also contemplated.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, the reaction chamber may further comprise a ballast dispensing assembly for storing and dispensing ballasts. For example, in some embodiments, waste products formed in the reaction chamber may be stored for use as ballast in the ballast dispensing assembly. The ballast dispensing assembly, in some cases, may be configured to dispense waste product to increase an buoyancy of the system either prior to the lift off, during the lift off, and/or during the course of flight. As described in more detail below, the waste products stored in the ballast dispensing assembly may be configured to open or close during the course of the flight to release the waste products as ballast based on commands received from an altitude controller. In some cases, storing the waste products as ballast may advantageously eliminate the need for external ballasts and reduces the overall weight of the balloon system.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, a payload may be attached to the system described herein. Any of a variety of desired payload may be attached to the system, depending on the desired application. The payload may serve various purposes, including, but not limited to, serving as a buoyancy control for the system and/or comprising an article capable of performing a desired function. For example, the payload may be employed in to control the buoyancy of the system in an exterior environment (e.g., a body of water) in which the reaction chamber is at least partially immersed in. In some embodiments, the payload may have a neutral buoyancy, a negative buoyancy, or a positive buoyancy relative to the liquid in the exterior environment. In some embodiments, a positively buoyant payload may make it possible for the system to stay at least partially afloat on a surface and/or sub-surface of the exterior environment. Conversely, a negatively buoyant payload may make it possible for a part of the system to sink to the bottom of the exterior environment. In some instances, the buoyancy of the payload may be varied accordingly to allow for inflation and/or launch of the system from a body of water, e.g., such as shore-based and/or sea-based inflation and launch of the system, and/or a variety of application in the body of water, e.g., such as undersea applications including undersea salvage and undersea logistics stores.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As noted above, the reaction chamber comprises a reactant capable of reacting with water to form hydrogen gas. The reactant may be disposed in any appropriate locations within the reaction chamber. The presence of such a reactant in the system may advantageously allow for in situ generation of hydrogen gas when the system is at least partially immersed in an exterior environment (e.g., a body of water), and thereby removing the need for any additional infrastructure (e.g., tanks for carrying hydrogen gas and/or water).

Additionally, in some embodiments, steam may be generated from the resultant heat of reaction. In some cases, the hydrogen gas and steam (if formed) may be used to increase the buoyant force acting on a balloon. Reactions 1 and 2 above are both exothermic, meaning they release heat. In addition to the generation of heat, the reactions produce hydrogen gas (the desired product) and hydroxides of aluminum (a byproduct). e.g., specifically aluminum oxide hydroxide (AlO(OH)) and aluminum trihydroxide (Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>). In some embodiments, a waste product (e.g., aluminum hydroxide) associated with the aforementioned reactions may be used as a ballast for altitude control of a balloon. For example, the waste product may be dropped to decrease the weight of the balloon system. As such, a system that employs this chemical reaction and/or another similar chemical reaction may allow for increased system lift. Additionally, in some embodiments, the steam, after condensing, may be used as a ballast for additional altitude control of a balloon. For instance, via a combination of conductive and/or convective heat transfer through the balloon itself and/or another appropriate heat transfer structure, at least a portion of the steam inside a balloon may condense into water condensate. The water condensate may be used as a ballast and dropped to decrease the weight of the balloon system.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0038">In some embodiments, the reactant comprises an activated metal capable of reacting with water to produce hydrogen gas.

Of course, a combination of pellets and powder may also be used and/or different forms of a solid reactant may be used, as the disclosure is not limited in this regard. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the size of the individual elements may influence the operation of the system.

In some embodiments, the system described herein may be stored in a compact state prior to being deployed or used. When the system <b>100</b> is in a compact state, the <b>112</b> balloon has not been inflated and may be in a folded state. The balloon system, when in a compact state (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref>), may have relatively small dimensions. For example, the balloon system in a compact state may individually have a width W, a length L. and height H in one or more of the ranges describe elsewhere herein, e.g., such as between 6 and 12 inches, between 12 inches and 18 inches, and between 12 inches and 18 inches, respectively. Though other dimensions may also be used.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0051">The balloon system <b>100</b> may contain a variety of components described elsewhere herein. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref>, the balloon system <b>110</b> may include a reaction chamber <b>116</b> configured to contain a reactant <b>126</b> (e.g., activated aluminum) capable of reacting with water to generate hydrogen, steam (optionally), and waste products (e.g., as illustrated by Eqs. (1)-(2)). The reactant <b>126</b> may be in any appropriate shape and form as described elsewhere herein, e.g., such as in the form of solid particles. In some instances, the solid reactant particles may be arranged in an ordered fashion to maximum utilization of space within the reaction vessel, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The reaction chamber <b>166</b> may optionally contain one or more additives capable of sequestering and/or removing one or more solutes or ions in order to prevent the solute and ions from binding to the reactant, as described elsewhere herein. According to some embodiments, the vessel walls of the reaction chamber <b>116</b> may be formed via a non-porous and/or waterproof material, e.g., such that liquid from an exterior environment does diffuse into the reaction chamber <b>116</b> through the vessel walls and that the generated hydrogen gas does not diffuse out of the reaction chamber <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0052">The reaction chamber <b>116</b> may further comprise a manifold <b>117</b> fluidically connected to the interior of the reaction chamber. A portion of the manifold may form an inlet <b>114</b> of the reaction chamber <b>116</b>. The inlet <b>114</b> may be configured to permit a flow of liquid from an exterior environment (e.g., a body of water) into the reaction chamber <b>116</b>. In some cases, the inlet <b>114</b> may comprise one or more valves <b>115</b> and/or on/off switch configured to open and close the inlet based at least in part on instructions received from a controller (<b>102</b>) and/or one or more sensors (<b>103</b>). For example, one or more processors which may be included in the controller may be operatively coupled to the one or more sensors and other components of the system for controlling the inlet <b>114</b> or an associated valve <b>115</b> of the reactor chamber <b>116</b>. For example, using information from the sensors, the processor may actuate the inlet <b>114</b> to open or close. In one such embodiment, the one or more sensors may sense a parameter (e.g., liquid level, H<sub>2</sub>O, etc.) of the exterior environment. If the sensors sense that the reactor chamber <b>116</b> is immersed in an exterior environment containing a liquid comprising water, the processor may generate commands to open the inlet. e.g., such that the inlet is in fluid communication with an exterior environment that the reaction chamber is at least partially immersed in. As such, the inlet may be configured to allow flow of the liquid from the exterior environment into the reaction chamber. In some instances, when the sensors detect that the amount of liquid entering into the reaction chamber has reached a threshold amount and/or that the reaction chamber has been sufficiently filled up, the sensor communicates with the processor which then directs the system to close the inlet. Such feedback control may allow the system <b>100</b> to operate stably. Of course, feedback may be performed on parameters different than liquid level or H<sub>2</sub>O detection. The one or more sensors may include temperature sensors, pressure sensors, chemical sensors, light sensors, acoustic sensors, force sensors, strain sensors, accelerometers, gyroscopes, or any other suitable sensors. In some embodiments, the system may additionally include a memory associated with the processor. The memory may include instructions that when executed by the processor perform the methods described herein.

The depicted system may allow for launch of high-altitude balloons without the need for any infrastructure. e.g., such as buildings, electric power, fresh water, high-pressure plumbing, or steel tanks containing hydrogen. Moreover, the system described herein may advantageously eliminate manual handling of the balloon and reduce the need for personnel training. Furthermore, the system described herein is a fully automated system that allows for automated inflation and launch of the balloon.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0065">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, during the inflation process <b>208</b>, part of the system <b>100</b> (e.g., such as the reaction chamber <b>116</b>) may be a at least partially immersed in an exterior environment <b>101</b>, e.g., such as the sea. As such, the inlet <b>114</b> is in fluid communication with the exterior environment <b>101</b> and may permit a liquid <b>132</b> (e.g., seawater) to flow into the reaction chamber <b>116</b> from the exterior environment <b>101</b> via the water inlet <b>114</b>. The one way valve <b>115</b> coupled to the inlet may allow the liquid <b>132</b> (e.g., seawater) to enter the reaction chamber <b>116</b> but prevent the liquid from counterflowing. Once the liquid flows through the valve <b>115</b> and into the reaction chamber <b>116</b>, a reactant <b>126</b> may combine with the liquid and reacts with water from the liquid <b>132</b> to produces hydrogen gas, waste products, and in some instances, steam. For example, in embodiments in which the reactant is aluminum or an alloy of aluminum with an activating composition, hydrogen gas and waste products (e.g, aluminum hydroxides) may be produced according to Eqs. (1) and (2), as described above. In some cases, steam may also be generated from the heat of reaction from the reactions (1) and (2). The generated heat may be sufficiently large relative to the water volume within the reaction chamber that at least a portion of the water is vaporized to form steam.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0066">The hydrogen gas and steam (when formed) may in turn flow along the flow path indicated by arrow <b>130</b> into the balloon <b>112</b> to inflate it. Since the walls of the reaction chamber <b>116</b> are non-porous (e.g., watertight, gas tight) and the valve <b>115</b> prevents counterflow of liquid into the exterior environment <b>101</b>, the generated hydrogen (and steam) may be forced to flow through the outlet <b>119</b> of the reaction chamber <b>116</b> and into the balloon <b>112</b>, thereby causing the balloon <b>112</b> to inflate. Since the reactant <b>126</b> (e.g., activated aluminum), waste products (e.g., aluminum hydroxide byproducts), and reactor are heavier than the balloon <b>112</b>, they would tend to sink lower than the lighter-than-air balloon <b>112</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. In cases where any liquid <b>132</b> accidentally enters into the balloon <b>112</b>, the valve <b>118</b> (e.g., a float valve) may cause it to drain back into the reaction chamber <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0067">In some instances, the waste products (not shown) from the reaction may be stored as ballasts within the ballast dispensing assembly <b>128</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, once the reaction within the reaction chamber is complete, the balloon <b>112</b> has enough lift to raise the entire system, e.g., including the reaction chamber <b>116</b>, the retained reaction byproduct (used subsequently as ballast), the altitude control system <b>120</b>, and the payload <b>124</b>, into the air.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0068">Alternatively, upon reaching a certain elapsed reaction time and/or a lift force, the balloon <b>112</b> may detached from the reaction chamber and lift off. Specific modes of altitude control during the course of flight are described in more detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flow diagram of one embodiment of a method <b>300</b> for filling a balloon system and controlling an altitude of the balloon system (e.g., balloon system <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). At <b>302</b>, a desired payload may be attached to a part of the balloon system, e.g., such as the reaction chamber. As noted elsewhere herein and with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the type of payload may vary depending on the type of application and may be optionally employed, in some cases, as a way to control the buoyancy of the system in the exterior environment. At <b>304</b>, the reaction chamber may be at least partially immersed in an exterior environment and/or a liquid comprising water. In some instances, an inlet associated with the reaction chamber is at least partially immersed in the exterior environment. In some instances, upon immersing the reaction chamber in the exterior environment, a controller or sensor associated with the system may issue an initiation signal to the system directing the inlet and/or an associated valve to open, such that the inlet is in fluidic communication with the exterior environment. In some instances, the system may optionally comprise a sensor capable of sensing a parameter (e.g., water level, etc.) associated with the exterior environment, such that the sensor may communicate with the controller to open the inlet upon sensing the parameter. At <b>306</b>, the liquid comprising water may flow in from the exterior environment into the reaction chamber via the inlet. In some cases, water may be directed into the inlet of the reaction chamber via a one way valve. The one way valve may prevent backflow of loss water from the reaction chamber into the exterior environment once the water enters into the reaction chamber. At <b>308</b>, a reactant and water may be combined to produce waste products, hydrogen gas, and optionally steam, as described above in Eq. (1) and Eq. (2). The waste products may be stored in the reaction chamber (e.g., a ballast dispensing assembly) for future use as ballasts for buoyancy control during launch of the system and/or during the course of flight.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0070">At <b>312</b>, the produced hydrogen gas and steam (when formed) may be flowed into the balloon from the reactor chamber to increase a buoyancy of the balloon. For example, as shown described previously with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, to prevent the liquid (e.g., water) in the reaction chamber from entering and/or accumulating inside the balloon, one or more vents (e.g., a float valve) may be employed to drain any liquid that has entered into the balloon back into the reaction chamber. Upon filling the balloon with sufficient hydrogen gas (and steam), at <b>314</b>, the balloon may be ready for takeoff.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0071">In embodiments in which the balloon system is an integrated system, e.g., where the balloon is permanently connected to the reaction chamber, the balloon system may be launched together as a whole (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). Alternatively, in some embodiments, at <b>316</b>, the balloon may detach from the reaction chamber prior to lift off. For example, the balloon may detach from the reaction chamber based at least in part on an elapsed reaction time and/or lift force. When the elapsed reaction time and/or lift force exceed a threshold value, the balloon may be filled with an amount of gas (e.g., hydrogen and steam) sufficient for the balloon to lift off and increase in altitude, as shown in <b>316</b> and <b>320</b>. Optionally, at <b>310</b>, prior to the lift off, the waste product produced from the reaction may be removed from the reaction chamber via a ballast dispenser assembly (e.g., <b>128</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) to increase a buoyancy of the system.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0072">During the course of flight (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>), in order to control the buoyancy of the balloon system, an altitude controller may send command to the system to increase altitude of the system. At <b>320</b>, the altitude control command may be received by a transmitter after being sent by a remote operator, such as an operator on the ground, or the altitude control command may be generated onboard in response to, for example, various sensor readings. Controlling the altitude of the balloon may include decreasing the weight of the balloon system, decreasing a buoyancy of the balloon (i.e. venting), and/or any appropriate combination of the forgoing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> may be employed to illustrate one such embodiment. As shown, to decrease the buoyancy of the balloon <b>112</b>, hydrogen gas (and optionally steam) may be vented from the balloon during the course of flight via a vent <b>136</b>. To increase the buoyancy of the balloon, a portion of the waste products may be removed from an outlet <b>134</b> of the ballast dispenser assembly <b>128</b> located within the reaction chamber <b>116</b>. In some instances, the ballast dispenser assembly <b>128</b> (e.g., rotary dispenser) may be actuated to open and release the waste products from the reaction chamber based on instructions received from the altitude controller <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0073">Additionally or alternatively, in some instances, the waste product may be actively discharged from the reactor chamber <b>116</b> with one or more pumps. The pumps may be controlled by a processor. Additional sensors may sense parameters related to waste removal, such as operation of the pumps and/or the remaining capacity of the ballast dispensing assembly <b>128</b>. In some embodiments, the waste product may be removed through alternative mechanisms. The waste product may be released in a controlled manner through a device such as an auger, a scooper, belt feed, or any other appropriate mechanism. By controlling the amount of waste material released from the balloon system, the amount of weight lost can be controlled, thereby altering the balance of forces on the balloon. If all other forces remain constant, decreasing the weight of the balloon system may cause the balloon system to rise or stop descending. In some embodiments, the waste product may be wet. In such embodiments, it may be desirable to warm the waste product to prevent the waste product from freezing using methods and systems similar to those described above for controlling a temperature of the reactor chamber and overall system.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0074">Alternatively or additionally, in embodiments in which both hydrogen and steam are flowed into the balloon, the steam condensate inside the balloon may be removed as ballast during the course of flight. As described above, as the balloon increases in altitude, water condensate may be formed as a result of the steam cooling down inside the balloon due to conductive/convective heat transfer across the membrane of the balloon. As a portion of the steam condenses into water condensate, the balloon may experience a decrease in altitude. As such, a controller or sensor described herein may be used to issue an altitude control command to increase altitude. To decrease the weight of the balloon, a water condensate condensed from a portion of the steam and/or a waste product may be dropped as ballast. For instance, as disclosed above, a valve (e.g., such as a valve <b>136</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) may be actuated to open and release the water condensate based at least in part on a parameter associated with the condensate (e.g., water level, conductance, etc.). The water condensate inside the balloon may be released via a vent valve at the bottom of the balloon described herein, thus resulting in an increase in altitude.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0075">The above-described embodiments of the technology described herein can be implemented in any of numerous ways.
