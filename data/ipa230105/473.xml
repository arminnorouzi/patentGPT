Pathological specimens used for this diagnosis can be obtained from a tissue biopsy or from a cytology specimen. Both of these types of samples are usually obtained via an endoscopic procedure. Squamous cell carcinoma arises in the setting of a precancerous lesion&#x2014;squamous dysplasia. Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus most commonly occurs in the distal esophagus. It arises from a glandular dysplasia secondary to Barrett's Esophagus. Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease is generally diagnosed via clinical presentation. At times a tissue biopsy is needed to confirm a diagnosis. Pathological examination of the tissue biopsy identifies morphological features that correlate with this disease. This is done via an endoscopic procedure. Herpes Esophagitis is diagnosed by the identification of cells with morphologic features of Herpes Virus (Herpes Inclusions) on a pathological specimen. Herpes Virus infections generally occur in immunocompromised patients. Pathological specimens used for this diagnosis can be obtained from a tissue biopsy; or from a cytology specimen. Both of these types of samples are usually obtained via an endoscopic procedure.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is a need for improvements for collecting biological samples.

the present disclosure relates to device suitable for collecting biological samples for diagnostic purposes. The device can be designed to collect different types and quantities of biological samples using a combination of expandable textured surfaces. In some embodiments, the sampling device can be the device discussed with respect to U.S. application Ser. No. 15/103,638 and U.S. application Ser. Nos. 16/610,115, 63/030,547 all incorporated by reference in their entirety. The device of the present disclosure can also be designed to target specific types of biological samples for particular types of medical conditions and/or subsequent diagnosis. For example, the device can be used to target cell collection for diagnosis of SCC, SD, EAC, GD, BE, GERD, HSV, or other diseases related to cancer or dysplasia.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) and Squamous Dysplasia (SD) can include different types of neoplasia that result from squamous cells. The squamous cells can be found on the surface of the skin and/or on the lining of surfaces within the body such as the lining within the respiratory and digestive tracts or other organs. To diagnose for SCC or SD, a biopsy for histological and immunohistochemical analysis can be used. For example, TP63 staining can be used as an immunohistochemistry marker for SCC and to identify squamous cells SCC and SD samples can also be collected by a sampling device to facilitate this diagnosis whether by cytological/pathological examination (including cell blocks), or for molecular analysis. The device and system of the present disclosure can be used to position a collection surface within a location where squamous cells are frequently found (e.g., within the respiratory and digestive tracts) to be used to safely collect and remove the squamous Cells for diagnostic purposes. To diagnose SCC and SD, the device can be inflated after it has passed the lower esophageal sphincter and remain dilated throughout the course of the esophagus. When present in the proximal esophagus the device can be deflated and removed from the patient.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and Glandular Dysplasia (GD) can include different types of neoplasia that result from glandular cell proliferations, known as Barrett's Esophagus, of the esophagus. Glandular cells can be found in the lining of surfaces within the body such as the lining within the respiratory and digestive tracts or other organs. To diagnose for EAC or GD, a biopsy for histological and immunohistochemical analysis can be used. For example, CDX-2 staining can be used as a histological marker for EAC and to identify glandular cells. EAC and GD samples can also be collected by the device to facilitate this diagnosis whether by cytological examination, including cell blocks, or for molecular analysis.

The collection device <b>10</b> can include a generally hollow longitudinally extending collection portion <b>12</b>. The collection portion <b>12</b> can have a first or proximal axial end portion <b>14</b> connected to a second or distal axial end portion <b>16</b>. The distal end portion <b>16</b> can have a first axial end portion <b>22</b> connected to the proximal axial end portion <b>14</b>. The first end portion <b>22</b> may be connected to the proximal end portion <b>14</b> in any desired manner, such as by using an adhesive, welding, mechanical connection, bonding, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the first axial end portion <b>22</b> can engage a shoulder <b>24</b> on the proximal axial end portion <b>14</b>. Therefore, the collection portion <b>12</b> can have a smooth outer surface. The distal axial end portion <b>16</b> may be connected to the proximal end portion <b>14</b> in any desired manner. The proximal axial end portion <b>14</b> and the distal axial end portion <b>16</b> may be made of a flexible polymer, such as silicone or polyurethane. In some embodiments, the distal axial end portion <b>16</b> can have a lower durometer than the proximal axial end portion <b>14</b>. The distal axial end portion <b>16</b> may have a durometer between 5-90 Shore A. The durometer of the distal axial end portion <b>16</b> is preferably between 20-70 Shore A, and more specifically, approximately 30 Shore A.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some embodiments, the distal axial end portion <b>16</b> may expand and contract. In some embodiments, the first or proximal axial end portion <b>14</b> is relatively rigid. Therefore, the proximal end portion <b>14</b> can have a fixed radial extent. The first axial end portion <b>14</b> and the second axial end portion <b>16</b> may be formed as separate pieces that are connected together in any desired manner or may be integrally formed as one-piece. Although the proximal end portion <b>14</b> is illustrated as having a cylindrical shape, the proximal end portion may have any desired shape.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some embodiments, the proximal axial end portion <b>14</b> can be connected to a support member <b>20</b>, such as a tubular member or catheter, as discussed in greater detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The support member <b>20</b> may be a tubular member in fluid communication with the interior of the collection portion <b>12</b>. The proximal axial end portion <b>14</b> can conduct fluid, such as air, from the support member <b>20</b> to the distal axial end portion <b>16</b>. In some embodiments, the support <b>20</b> can resist collapsing when a vacuum can be applied to the support member and resists stretching during withdrawal of the collection device <b>10</b> from the collection site.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, the second or distal end portion <b>16</b> of the collection portion <b>12</b> can have an expanded or inflated position (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) and a collapsed or deflated position (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>3</b></figref>). The expanded position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may be one of many expanded positions for the distal end portion <b>16</b>. It is contemplated that the distal end portion <b>16</b> may expand more than shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> so that the distal end portion obtains a more spherical shape and looks similar to a hot air balloon. In some embodiments, the distal end portion <b>16</b> can have a convex shape, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, when in the expanded or inflated position. The distal end portion <b>16</b> may extend radially outward a greater distance than the proximal end portion <b>14</b> when in the expanded position.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, the distal axial end portion <b>16</b> can be modified for a particular biological sample collection and/or collection at a particular location. For example, the distal axial end portion <b>16</b> can be specifically designed to capture the cells and/or substances needed to diagnose any of the SCC, SD, EAC, GD, BE, GERD, HSV, or other diseases related to cancer or dysplasia. In some embodiments, the distal axial end portion <b>16</b> can be designed to expand more in a longitudinal direction for contacting sidewalls for collecting samples including white eosinophil blood cells at the esophagus, stomach, and the small intestine. For example, the distal axial end portion <b>16</b> can expand in in a longitudinal direction that is greater in length than the proximal end portion <b>14</b>. The greater length of the distal axial end portion <b>16</b> can be preferred for contacting surfaces for capturing an adequate amount of sample that is sufficient to accurately count target cells within a sample for diagnosing different diseases.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some embodiments, the distal axial end portion <b>16</b> can be sized and dimensioned for collecting a sample at a particular target location and/or subject. For example, the distal axial end portion <b>16</b> can be designed to expand to a larger diameter for an adult and a small diameter for a pediatric or adolescent. Similarly, different diameter sizes for the distal axial end portion <b>16</b> can be used for collecting samples at different locations, for example, collecting samples within the stomach may use a different diameter distal axial end portion <b>16</b> than when collecting samples within the esophagus. In another example, the distal axial end portion <b>16</b> can have a particular length dimension and shape for patients of different ages, weight, height, etc. Additionally, the distal axial end portion <b>16</b> can be expanded to different levels of pressure/stiffness to target particular samples to be collected.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In some embodiments, the distal end portion <b>16</b> can extend into the first or proximal axial end portion <b>14</b> and can have a concave shape, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, when in the collapsed or deflated position. The distal end portion <b>16</b> may be inverted when in the collapsed position. The distal end portion <b>16</b> can extend axially into the interior of the proximal end portion <b>14</b> when in the collapsed or deflated position. Therefore, the distal end portion <b>16</b> can move axially or longitudinally relative to the proximal end portion <b>14</b> when moving between the deflated and inflated positions. In some embodiments, a relatively lower durometer of the distal end portion <b>16</b> allows the distal end portion to extend axially into the interior of the proximal end portion <b>14</b> and have a concave shape when in the collapsed position. The distal end portion <b>16</b> may be biased into the collapsed or deflated position in any desired manner.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some embodiments, the proximal end portion <b>14</b> can have a relatively high durometer so that the proximal end portion does not collapse when a vacuum is applied to the proximal end portion through the support <b>20</b>. The shape of the proximal end portion <b>14</b> does not change when the distal end portion <b>16</b> moves between the deflated and inflated positions. The proximal end portion <b>14</b> does not move radially when the distal end portion <b>16</b> moves between the deflated and inflated positions.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments, the durometer or the proximal end portion <b>14</b> and the distal end portion <b>16</b> can be modified for collection of a particular biological sample type and/or collection at a particular location. For example, the proximal end portion <b>14</b> and the distal end portion <b>16</b> can be modified to traverse and/or operate differently when sampling in the esophagus compare to the GI tract. In some embodiments, the durometer and/or the proximal end portion <b>14</b> and the distal end portion <b>16</b> can be specifically selected for collecting samples located at different locations, such as for example the esophagus, stomach, and the small intestine. For example, the distal end portion <b>16</b> can have a sufficient durometer level to allow the distal end portion <b>16</b> to sufficiently maintain its expanded shape during sampling. In other words, the durometer of the distal end portion <b>16</b> can have a sufficiently high durometer to prevent the distal end portion <b>16</b> from collapsing when interacting with a tissue wall of the patient such that projections or bristles <b>40</b> thereon can collect an adequate level of sample material to test for any of SCC, SD, EAC, GD, BE, GERD, HSV, or other diseases related to cancer or dysplasia. Although the example discusses the use of a high level of durometer, depending on the shape of the distal end portion <b>16</b>, the projections or bristles <b>40</b> thereon, and the sampling location the durometer level can be higher or lower to most efficiently collect an adequate level of sample material having the target material.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, in some embodiments, the distal end portion <b>16</b> can have an outer surface <b>32</b> for collecting tissue when the distal portion is in the expanded position.

For example, the projections or bristles <b>40</b> can be designed for the collection of esophageal and/or stomach cells from the location within the esophagus and/or stomach.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In some embodiments, the device <b>10</b> can be used to gather biological samples related to Barrett's Esophagus (BE), Glandular Dysplasia (GD), and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma (EAC). For collecting biological samples for BE, GD, and EAC, the collection portion <b>12</b> can be advanced to a desired location within the esophagus and/or stomach using the support member <b>20</b>. For example, BE, GD, and Adenocarcinoma screening, diagnostics, testing, etc. can be performed by examining cells derived from sampling the distal region of the esophagus, for example, by deflating the distal end portion <b>16</b> after 5 cm of sampling. Once at a sampling location within the esophagus and/or stomach, the distal end portion <b>16</b> can be expanded out from within the proximal axial end portion <b>14</b> and further expanded to contact a sidewall of the esophagus and/or stomach for sample collection. In some embodiments, the distal end portion <b>16</b> can include projections or bristles <b>40</b> specifically designed for collecting biological cells needed to diagnose for Barrett's Esophagus, Glandular Dysplasia and Adenocarcinoma. For example, the projections or bristles <b>40</b> can be designed for the collection of esophageal and/or stomach cells from the location within the esophagus and/or stomach.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In some embodiments, the device <b>10</b> can be used to gather biological samples related to Herpes Esophagitis (HSV). For collecting biological samples for HSV, the collection portion <b>12</b> can be advanced to a desired location within the esophagus using the support member <b>20</b>. For example, HSV screening, diagnostics, testing, etc. can be performed by examining cells derived from sampling of the entire esophagus or the device <b>10</b> or can be used to sample from the proximal two-thirds of the esophagus. Once at a sampling location within the esophagus, the distal end portion <b>16</b> can be expanded out from within the proximal axial end portion <b>14</b> and further expanded to contact a sidewall of the esophagus for sample collection. In some embodiments, the distal end portion <b>16</b> can include projections or bristles <b>40</b> specifically designed for collecting biological cells needed to diagnose for HSV. For example, the projections or bristles <b>40</b> can be designed for the collection of esophageal cells from the location within the body.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">After the biological sample is collected, the distal end portion <b>16</b> can be moved from the expanded position to the collapsed or inverted position. For example, the distal end portion <b>16</b> may be moved from the expanded position to the collapsed position by applying a vacuum to the collection portion <b>12</b> with the syringe connected to the Y-fitting <b>102</b>. As the collection portion <b>12</b> moves out of the body lumen, the distal end portion <b>16</b> does not engage the body lumen and prevents the collected biological samples from being contaminated by tissue from areas along the body lumen different from the collection site. Once the collection device <b>10</b> is removed from the patient, the biological samples can be collected from the surface of the distal end portion <b>16</b>. For example, the biological samples can be collected via a wash and/or the collection portion <b>12</b> or the distal end portion <b>16</b> may be cut from the support member <b>20</b> and deposited in a biological sample vial.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Once the distal end portion <b>16</b> has been removed from the support member <b>20</b>, the sample can be sent for further analysis. In some embodiments, a collected sample can be preserved for transportation and/or storage of the sample at an analysis location. The sample can be preserved using any combination of methods. For example, the sample can be preserved by storage within a container (e.g., vial) in a preservative fluid (e.g., methanol, water, etc.), it can be cooled or frozen, placed within a slide/mounted, or a combination thereof. Once preserved, the samples can be sent to the analysis location.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The analysis on collected samples can include any combination of analysis. For example, the analysis can include any combination of pathological analysis, steward pathology, diagnostic assay, cell analysis, biometric assay, etc. The sample can be obtained for a specific type of diagnostic. For example, a pathologist can visually inspect the biological samples and count the number of target cells to determine if any of the SCC, SD, EAC, GD, BE, GERD, HSV, or other diseases related to cancer or dysplasia is likely. Other testing can be performed for the specific conditions. For SCC, SD, and HSV, once collected, the cells may be examined by cytology assessments, including use of cell blocks, by immunohistochemistry or by molecular testing. For EAC, GD, BE, and GERD, once collected, the cells may be examined by cytology assessments, including use of cell blocks, by immunohistochemistry or by molecular testing.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In some embodiments, the analysis can be performed using a combination of users and computer analysis. For example, a user can use specialized software or artificial intelligence systems to perform black box diagnostics, visual inspection, point of care diagnostics, or other analyses. For example, a computer implemented system can be used to visually inspect the biological samples to determine if they fall within a threshold indicative of any of SCC, SD, EAC, GD, BE, GERD, HSV, or other diseases related to cancer or dysplasia.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">For each of the diseases listed above, after collection and transport to a diagnostic laboratory, the sample will be processed in generally similar manners. If a cytological assessment is to be made, the specimen will be concentrated to allow for a cytological slide to be made. This can be done through direct smears of the cytological material, or first via concentration with centrifugation or via an automated process with a filtration step and deposition of the cells on a monolayer. A cell block can also be made of the specimen after concentration of the specimen. Routine diagnostic stains&#x2014;such as the Papanicolaou stain and the hematoxylin and eosin stain, or immunohistochemistry stains, can be used to facilitate diagnoses. DNA, RNA or proteins can be extracted from the collected body fluids to aid in molecular diagnoses. Any other combination of diagnostics can be performed to identify any combination of SCC, SD, EAC, GD, BE, GERD, HSV, or other diseases related to cancer or dysplasia.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The distinguishing features, characterization, and/or diagnosis of a particular disease or disorder provided herein can be determined by the skilled practitioner following the collection of a sample by the methods and device provided herein.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Thus, in one aspect, provided herein is a method of collecting a sample from a subject that is at risk of having or a subject that is suspected of having a disease provided herein (e.g., SCC, SD, EAC, GD, BE, GERD, HSV).

The diagnostic markers of keratinizing SCC generally include marked variation in cellular size and variation in cellular shape, including oval, spindle, and irregular cells as compared with a healthy control sample. Nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma have increased nuclear cytoplasmic (NC) ratio and enlarged nuclei with dense hyperchromatic and coarse chromatin with irregular nuclear membranes. Hyperchromasia and pyknosis may obscure nuclear details such as chromatin and nucleoli. Immunohistochemistry for squamous markers can also be performed for markers such as p63 to help differentiate neoplasm from adenocarcinoma. Biomarkers that can be used to identify SCC include but are not limited to: (i) genes involved in cell cycle regulation (e.g., TP53, CDKN2A, RB1, CREBBP); (ii) genes involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (e.g., PIK3CA, PTEN); (iii) genes involved in the NOTCH signaling pathway (e.g., NOTCH1, NOTCH3, FBXW7); (iv) genes involved in cell adhesion (e.g., AJUBA, FAT1); (v) genes involved in chromatin remodeling (e.g., MLL2, KDM6A, EP300, BAP1); (vi) genes involved in the NRF2 pathway (e.g., NFE2L2, CUL3); and (vii) genes involved in epidermal differentiation (e.g., ZNF750). These biomarkers can be assessed following the collection of cells by the methods and device provided herein.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Low-grade squamous dysplasia (SD) is characterized by enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei and superficial or intermediate type cells. The nuclear cytoplasmic ratio is mildly elevated as compared to normal mature squamous epithelium. High-grade SD and carcinoma in situ are also characterized by enlarged hyperchromatic abnormal nuclei. These changes are more advanced than low-grade dysplasia with more hyperchromasia, coarser chromatin features, more irregular nuclear membranes, and higher NC ratios. Basal/parabasal size cells with abnormal nuclei and high NC ratios may also be observed.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Esophageal Adenocarcinoma (EAC) can be identified by histology and microscopy as 3-dimensional groups as well as single cells. Generally, the groups are disorderly with loss of polarity and loosely cohesive with irregular outlines. The cells are columnar with full orientation of the nucleus and cytoplasm with high nuclear cytoplasmic ratios. Nuclear atypia varies from central thickening and irregularity of the nuclear membrane with fine chromatin to large irregular nuclei with hyperchromatic coarse features irregular chromatin and prominent nucleoli. Malignant nuclei are usually about 2-3 times normal size overlapped and crowded with loss of polarity. The cytoplasm of cells associated with EAC are granular and mucin content is decreased. Unique features of certain cancer subtypes such as signet ring type or adenosquamous carcinoma can also be identified by one skilled in the art. Immunohistochemistry can also identify EAC by glandular markers such as mucin and CDX2, that differentiate EAC from SCC. Finally, TP53 inactivation has been demonstrated in EAC biological samples by immunohistochemistry and/or genetic sequencing methods as compared with healthy control samples.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In glandular dysplasia (GD), dysplastic cells, depending on grade may have appearances along the spectrum from size and shape similar to normal cells to that of adenocarcinoma. The most common pattern of dysplasia is characterized by crowded, enlarged, elongated, hyperchromatic nuclei with increased nuclear side-impact ratios and loss of nuclear polarity rest. The nuclei appearance is less crowded than other types of dysplasia but more pleomorphic enlarged nuclei appear to be malignant with malignant chromatin features and prominent nucleoli. GD cells also exhibit increased nuclear cytoplasmic ratio. Compared to Barrett's esophagus, the GD dysplastic cells are exfoliated and the smaller isotropically arranged 3-dimensional groups of cells exhibit mild pleomorphism. In contrast to invasive carcinoma, diffuse single cells are generally present in GD. Biomarkers of GD include TP53 inactivation as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and/or genetic sequencing methods.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Barrett's esophagus cells are generally exfoliated and appear in large, flat, cohesive sheets. The sheets are distinctly outlined with sharply defined smooth edges. Single cells are rare in histological sections for Barrett's esophagus samples. Cells are uniformly distributed without loss of polarity. The nuclei are round to oval and uniform with smooth nuclear membranes fine even chromatin and single nucleoli. Goblet cells generally have a single large clear cytoplasmic vacuoles that compressed the nucleus. Alcian blue/periodic acid Schiff stains can differentiate Barrett's esophagus from gastric surface epithelial cells. In contrast to the other diseases provided herein Barrett's esophagus does not exhibit inactivation of TP53.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">GERDs is generally characterized by portions of normal/reactive squamous epithelium with basal cell proliferation, and increased intramucosal inflammatory cells, e.g., neutrophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes. Intracellular edema&#x2014;spongiosis is also present. Reactive features include a slight increase in nuclear size with prominent nucleoli with generally smooth nuclear envelope and small prominent pattern. Features of ulceration may be present. GERD-related ulceration can be characterized by fragments of fibropurulent exudate and reactive fibroblasts.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Herpes infection (HSV) can be characterized by epithelial cells containing ground glass chromatin, multi nucleation with nuclear enlargement, and nuclear molding with accentuation of chromatin on the periphery of the nucleus. Cowdry type A bodies are sometimes observed. Immunohistochemistry and/or polymerase chain reaction for detecting herpes virus can facilitate diagnosis of the disease.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">The diseases provided herein can be identified by the exemplary morphological, histological, and/or biological disease markers provided in Table 1 below.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="301pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Exemplary Disease Markers</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="105pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="77pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Histological</entry><entry>Biological Markers</entry></row><row><entry>Disease</entry><entry>Morphological Markers</entry><entry>Markers</entry><entry>(Biomarkers)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Squamous</entry><entry>Irregular cell size and shape</entry><entry>p63 differentiate</entry><entry>Cell cycle regulation</entry></row><row><entry>Cell</entry><entry>Pleomorphic and</entry><entry>neoplasm from</entry><entry>markers:</entry></row><row><entry>Carcinoma</entry><entry>hyperchromatic nuclei.</entry><entry>adenocarcinoma.</entry><entry>TP53, CDKN2A, RB1,</entry></row><row><entry>(SCC)</entry><entry>A characteristic angular,</entry><entry/><entry>CREBBP</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>irregular outline may be seen</entry><entry/><entry>PI3K/AKT/mTOR</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>in many nuclei.</entry><entry/><entry>pathway markers:</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>The malignant cells show</entry><entry/><entry>PIK3CA, PTEN</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>evidence of squamous</entry><entry/><entry>NOTCH signaling</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>differentiation for example</entry><entry/><entry>pathway markers:</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>cytoplasmic keratinization, and</entry><entry/><entry>NOTCH1, NOTCH3,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>refractile ringing around the</entry><entry/><entry>FBXW7</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>nucleus; keratin pearls varying</entry><entry/><entry>Cell adhesion:</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>spatial architectural patterns</entry><entry/><entry>AJUBA, FAT1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>and intercellular bridges.</entry><entry/><entry>Chromatin remodeling:</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Multiple large prominent</entry><entry/><entry>MLL2, KDM6A, EP300,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>nucleoli are commonly seen.</entry><entry/><entry>BAP1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>NRF2 pathway</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>NFE2L2, CUL3</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Epidermal</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>differentiation ZNF750</entry></row><row><entry>Squamous</entry><entry>Enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei</entry></row><row><entry>Dysplasia</entry><entry>and superficial or intermediate</entry></row><row><entry>(SD)</entry><entry>type cells.</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Mildly-High NC ratios</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>compared to normal mature</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>squamous epithelium.</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Enlarged hyperchromatic</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>abnormal nuclei.</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Coarse chromatin</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Irregular nuclear membranes</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Basal/parabasal size cells with</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>abnormal nuclei and high NC</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>ratios</entry></row><row><entry>Esophageal</entry><entry>Disorderly with loss of polarity</entry><entry>Glandular markers</entry><entry>TP53 inactivation</entry></row><row><entry>Adenocarcinoma</entry><entry>and loosely cohesive with</entry><entry>such as mucin and</entry></row><row><entry>(EAC)</entry><entry>irregular outlines.</entry><entry>CDX2 differentiate</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Columnar cells with full</entry><entry>this carcinoma</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>orientation of the nucleus and</entry><entry>from squamous</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>cytoplasm with high nuclear</entry><entry>cell carcinoma.</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>cytoplasmic ratios.
