Some people find it particularly difficult to maintain an exercise regimen that involves continuously repetitive motions, such as running, walking and bicycling.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Additionally, individuals may view exercise as work or a chore and thus, separate it from enjoyable aspects of their daily lives. Often, this clear separation between athletic activity and other activities reduces the amount of motivation that an individual might have toward exercising. Further, athletic activity services and systems directed toward encouraging individuals to engage in athletic activities might also be too focused on one or more particular activities while an individual's interests are ignored. This may further decrease a user's interest in participating in athletic activities or using the athletic activity services and systems.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some systems present audio and/or visual information to users or measure and track performance to encourage individuals to participate in athletic activities. Such systems may use algorithms to track performance data such as speed, acceleration, distance, steps taken, etc. While a lot of research has been performed to develop various algorithms for determining performance data, it can be difficult to select the appropriate algorithm. Some electronic systems are designed to work with a wide range of individuals and utilize generic algorithms that are not as accurate as other algorithms that may be available for specific individuals or specific configurations of systems.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, improved systems and methods to address these and other shortcomings in the art are desired.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the disclosure.

When pressure is applied to the force-sensitive material <b>222</b>, the resistivity and/or conductivity of the force-sensitive material <b>222</b> changes, which changes the electrical potential between the electrodes <b>218</b>, <b>220</b>. The change in resistance can be detected by the sensor system <b>202</b> to detect the force applied on the sensor <b>216</b>. The force-sensitive resistive material <b>222</b> may change its resistance under pressure in a variety of ways. For example, the force-sensitive material <b>222</b> may have an internal resistance that decreases when the material is compressed, similar to the quantum tunneling composites described in greater detail below. Further compression of this material may further decrease the resistance, allowing quantitative measurements, as well as binary (on/off) measurements. In some circumstances, this type of force-sensitive resistive behavior may be described as &#x201c;volume-based resistance,&#x201d; and materials exhibiting this behavior may be referred to as &#x201c;smart materials.&#x201d; As another example, the material <b>222</b> may change the resistance by changing the degree of surface-to-surface contact. This can be achieved in several ways, such as by using microprojections on the surface that raise the surface resistance in an uncompressed condition, where the surface resistance decreases when the microprojections are compressed, or by using a flexible electrode that can be deformed to create increased surface-to-surface contact with another electrode. This surface resistance may be the resistance between the material <b>222</b> and the electrode <b>218</b>, <b>220</b> <b>222</b> and/or the surface resistance between a conducting layer (e.g., carbon/graphite) and a force-sensitive layer (e.g., a semiconductor) of a multi-layer material <b>222</b>. The greater the compression, the greater the surface-to-surface contact, resulting in lower resistance and enabling quantitative measurement. In some circumstances, this type of force-sensitive resistive behavior may be described as &#x201c;contact-based resistance.&#x201d; It is understood that the force-sensitive resistive material <b>222</b>, as defined herein, may be or include a doped or non-doped semiconducting material.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The electrodes <b>218</b>, <b>220</b> of the FSR sensor <b>216</b> can be formed of any conductive material, including metals, carbon/graphite fibers or composites, other conductive composites, conductive polymers or polymers containing a conductive material, conductive ceramics, doped semiconductors, or any other conductive material.

Certain embodiments may classify physical motions of a user. For example, at illustrative step <b>302</b>, one or more activities may be classified. System <b>100</b> may process data received from one or more of the sensors described above to attempt to classify a user's activity. For example, system <b>100</b> may compare a sensor signal to one or more signal or activity &#x201c;templates&#x201d; or &#x201c;signatures&#x201d; corresponding to selected activities. In certain embodiments, templates may be created by attaching sensors to a user and monitoring signals generated when the user performs various activities. In accordance with certain embodiments, an activity may be associated with an activity template specific to user <b>124</b>. In one such embodiment, user <b>124</b> may be assigned a default template for a specific activity unless a specific template has been assigned to that activity. Thus, user <b>124</b> may create or receive (but is not required to create or receive) an activity template that may be more accurate than a default template because the template is more specific to the user and/or the activity. User <b>124</b> may have the option to create templates for one or more predefined or undefined activities. A specific or otherwise new template might be shared among the community of users. Shared templates may be based on a variety of different sensors. In some embodiments templates may be refined or adjusted for use with different sensors. For example, a template that was created for use with a shoe based sensor may be refined for use with a wrist worn sensor.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">An activity template may be created from data obtained from one or more of a plurality of different sensors. For example, a first group of sensors (e.g. sensors <b>126</b> and <b>138</b>) may be utilized in the formation or refinement of a first activity template; however, a second group of sensors (e.g., sensors <b>128</b> and <b>140</b>) may be utilized in the formation or refinement of a second activity template. In yet further embodiments, a third group of sensors, such as sensors <b>128</b> and <b>140</b> (and/or other sensors), may be utilized in the creation of the first activity template for a second user (e.g., not user <b>124</b>) than utilized for the formation of the same activity template as user <b>124</b>. Thus, in accordance with certain embodiments, there is no requirement that data from a specific sensor be received for either: 1) the same activity template for different users; and/or 2) different activity templates for the same user.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one embodiment, a wrist mounted accelerometer, which may be a multi-axis accelerometer, may be attached to a user and signal templates based on the accelerometer output when the user runs, walks, etc. may be created. The templates may be functions of the sensor(s) used and/or the locations of the sensor(s). In some embodiments, a single signal (or value) is created by combining multiple signals (or values). For example, three outputs of a three axis accelerometer may be summed or otherwise combined to create one or more signals. Example step <b>302</b> may include comparing a signal, multiple signals or a combination of signals to one or more templates. In some embodiments, a best match approach may be implemented in which every activity is attempted to be classified. In other embodiments, if a signal, multiple signals or combination of signals does not sufficiently match a template, the activity may remain unclassified. Some embodiments may utilize only templates for running and walking and a best first approach is used to determine whether the user is running or walking.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">After at least one of user's <b>124</b> activity is classified, step <b>304</b> may be implemented to determine a corresponding activity factor. An activity factor may correspond to brisk running, running at a moderate pace, walking slowly or any other activity. An activity factor for an activity may be related to calories or energy generally required to perform the activity. If an activity was not classified in step <b>302</b>, a default activity factor may be selected or derived. In some embodiments multiple default activity factors may be utilized. An activity's intensity, duration or other characteristic(s) may be assessed, from which one or more default activity factors may be applied. The plural activity factors may be set via medians/averages, ranges, or other statistical approaches.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Energy expenditure point calculations me be used in connection with games and competitions. Some games and competitions may limit awarding energy expenditure points for activities that have relatively low activity factors. In some embodiments, awarding energy expenditure points for activities that have relatively low activity factors may also be limited all of the time or in other situations. In step <b>306</b> it may be determined whether the activity factor exceeds a threshold value. For example, an exemplary threshold value may be 1.0, 2.0 or 3.0. In another embodiment, the threshold value may equal 2.8. Different games and competitions may use other threshold values. When the activity factor does not exceed the threshold, step <b>308</b> may be implemented to disregard the corresponding activity and not use the activity when calculating energy expenditure points.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Another embodiment could have the threshold generally applied, but not when games or competitions are underway, or at least certain games or competitions. The games or competitions may be based on all points. In another embodiment, a threshold may always apply even to games and competitions. In another embodiment, different thresholds may apply by activity, game and/or competition, e.g., one for running briskly, one for running, one for walking, and a default.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In various embodiments of the invention, activity factors are used to calculate energy expenditure points. After at least one of user's <b>124</b> activity is classified, in step <b>310</b> energy expenditure points may be calculated. The use of energy expenditure points allows for comparison of activity levels and may promote collaboration among users, normalize for competition among users of different capabilities, and otherwise encourage activity. In one embodiment, energy expenditure points are calculated as follows:</p><p id="p-0058" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>EEPs=AF*duration &#x2003;&#x2003;(equation 1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0057">Wherein:</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0058">EEPs=energy expenditure points</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0059">AF=activity factor determined in step <b>304</b></li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0060">duration=duration of the activity classified in step <b>302</b></li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0059" num="0061">Step <b>310</b> may be performed at a device that includes sensors that monitor activity and/or at another device that includes a processor, such as a mobile phone (see, e.g., <b>138</b>) or server (see, e.g., <b>134</b>). In alternative embodiments equation 1 may be modified to include other factors, a scalar and/or a different combination of terms.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0062">In some embodiments equation 1 may be modified to include a scalar that is multiplied by the activity factor and duration. The scalar may be selected so that typical energy expenditure points fall within a desired range. The range of points may be desired for various games or competitions. The scalar may also represent an intensity of the activity. For example, a first scalar may be correspond to brisk running and a second scalar may correspond to running at a moderate pace. In alternative embodiments additional activity templates and activity factors may be used and may correspond to the various intensities of running or walking.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0063">Variations of equation 1 may be used in other embodiments of the invention. In some embodiments, users may select an equation and/or one or more variables, such as for example, a scalar. Equations may be selected for different games and competitions. In one example a group may set handicaps among the players based on fitness, so that the most fit generate EEPs only if they do a common activity or set of activities for longer period(s) of time. A group of users participating in an energy expenditure point competition may agree on a particular equation or method before beginning the competition. In some embodiments of the invention, a user may participate in multiple competitions and earn different points for the same activity because of different calculation methods. For example, a user may be participating in two competitions that have unique calculation methods. The user may earn two different point totals for the two different games and a third point total for their overall energy expenditure. Some point totals may be maintained separate from an overall point total.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0064">Alternative embodiments of the invention may use alternative or additional equations for calculating point values and/or other quantities. The equations may include derivations of measured and/or calculated values. Derivations that include time periods may be used to show rates and rates of change. For example, one equation may be used to determine a rate of accumulating activity points or energy expenditure points. Another equation may be used to determine a quantity of activity points or energy expenditure points accumulated over a predetermined time period.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0065">Some equations may use variables other than time. For example, some equations may be used to calculate a value as a function of activity points or energy expenditure points and steps. Calculating values that are functions of activity points or energy expenditure points and other variables may be used to compare the efficiencies of various activities. For example, an equation may be used to determine that taking steps at a faster pace may result in activity points or energy expenditure points accumulating at a faster per step pace. Another exemplary equation may determine activity points or energy expenditure points per a predetermined distance or a unit of distance.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0066">Some equations may be used to calculate first and/or second derivatives of measured or calculated values to show rates and rates of change. For example, an equation may be used to calculate or estimate a rate of accumulation of activity points or energy expenditure points at a given time. In some embodiments an instantaneous rate of accumulation of activity points or energy expenditure points is displayed to a user via display <b>235</b> or a display that is part of a mobile device.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0067">After the energy expenditure points are calculated, the calculated points may be combined, such as being added, to a total in step <b>312</b>. The total may allow user <b>124</b> (and/or selected individuals or groups approved by user <b>124</b>) to see how many points are earned over various periods of time, such as days, weeks and months. Totals may also be calculated for multiple time periods. For example, a user may receive totals for periods that include 24 hours, one week, one month and one year. In some embodiments users may select other time periods or deselect time periods. A user may track multiple time periods concurrently and track points award since the beginning of use of a device or start of a program. The total for any giving time period may represent points earned for several activities. For example, in a day a user may receive points for walking, jogging and sprinting during different time periods. As mentioned above, the points earned for each activity may be a function of a corresponding activity factor.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0068">Energy expenditure points may be deducted when user <b>124</b> has been inactive for a predetermined period of time or enhanced when certain criteria are met. This feature may be included with all calculations or may be used in various games and competitions. For example, in step <b>314</b> it may be determined whether an adjustment criteria has been met. The adjustment criteria may include inactivity for a predetermined time period. In some embodiments inactivity is not determined by merely determining that an amount of time has passed since the user was active. Rest, recovery and sleep periods may also be considered. An assessment may require attention not only to inactivity for a predetermined period of time, but also (i) accumulated inactivity over a period of time (particularly in light of the accumulated activity over that time), and/or (ii) the interpositionings of activities and inactivities, e.g. over some previous amount of time before the inactivity period being considered.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0069">In certain embodiments, the quantity may vary for different periods of time. For example, the predetermined quantity of inactivity may be a first value during a period of time in the morning and a second value during a second period of time, such as at night. User <b>124</b> may be determined to have been inactive when there is an absence of an activity having a corresponding activity factor that exceeds a threshold. When an adjustment criteria has been met, the total of energy expenditure points may be adjusted in step <b>316</b>. The adjustment may be a function of duration of inactivity. In some embodiments, a device may warn user <b>124</b> (or authorized groups/individuals) that they are close to receiving a reduction in energy expenditure points to encourage activity. It yet other embodiments, an alarm may notify user <b>124</b> (and/or other authorized individuals and/or groups) that they have received a reduction of energy expenditure points. In certain embodiments, team-mates and/or competing users may be notified of a reduction (or potential for reduction). In further embodiments, teachers, trainers, and/or parents may more readily monitor the physical activity of others. When a user has not been inactive, the process may end in step <b>318</b>. Of course, the method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> may be repeated at various intervals and allow for tracking points concurrently for different time periods, such as days, weeks and years.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0070">In another aspect, a device, such as device <b>226</b>, may provide a message based on inactivity or non-active periods. If the device <b>10</b> senses that the user has been in a non-active (e.g., low activity) state for a predetermined amount of time, an alert message may be delivered to the indicator system or display to remind the user to become more active. The alert message can be delivered in any of the manners described herein. The threshold levels of a low activity state and amount of inactive time could also vary and be individually set by the user.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0071">In some arrangements, user non-activity or inactivity may also be detected and affect the user's progress toward completion of an activity goal. For example, inactivity may be detected when a user does not exhibit movement of a particular level or a type of movement for a specified amount of time, does not exhibit a heart rate of at least a threshold level, does not move a sufficient amount of distance over an amount of time and the like and/or combinations thereof. For arrangements in which a user accumulates activity points to reach an activity point goal, points or a value may be deducted from the user's activity point or other activity metric total when an amount of non-activity (e.g., inactivity or sedentary state) is detected. Various conversion rates for converting inactivity to activity point deductions may be used. In a particular example, 10 minutes of inactivity may correspond to a 5 point deduction. In another example, 30 minutes of inactivity may correspond to a 100 point deduction. Loss or deduction of activity points may be linear or may be non-linear, for example, exponential, parabolic and the like.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0072">A user's non-active time may include inactive time and sedentary time. Inactivity and sedentary time may be defined by different movement, heart-rate, step or other thresholds or may be defined using the same thresholds. In one example, sedentary time may have a higher threshold (e.g., requiring a higher level of activity) than an inactivity threshold. That is, an individual may be considered sedentary but not inactive. The non-active threshold may correspond to the sedentary threshold or a higher threshold, if desired. Alternatively, an inactivity threshold may be greater than a sedentary threshold. There may also be multiple sedentary thresholds, inactivity thresholds and/or non-active thresholds (e.g., each of the sedentary and inactivity thresholds may be a non-active threshold). Different point deductions or rates of point deductions may also be defined between the multiple thresholds and levels of little to no activity (e.g., non-activity). For example, a user may lose 50 points per hour for inactivity and 30 points per hour for sedentary activity or vice versa. Further, activity point deduction may be triggered at different times depending on if the user is inactive or sedentary. For instance, a user may begin losing activity points after 30 minutes of inactivity or 45 minutes of being sedentary. Additional thresholds (e.g., more than two thresholds) and corresponding rates of activity point loss may also be defined.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0073">In some arrangements, various sensors may be used to detect non-active periods of time. As discussed, non-activity time periods may be defined based on heart-rate, amplitude of a movement signal, step rate (e.g., &#x3c;10 steps per minute), or the like. Alternatively or additionally, inactivity and sedentary time periods may be measured based on a physical position, body position, body orientation, body posture of or type of activity being performed by the individual. The detrimental effects of various physical inactivity or sedentary body positions or orientations may also differ. Accordingly, 30 minutes of reclining may introduce the same health risks as 45 minutes of sitting. The potential for health risks may also be time-dependent. Accordingly, non-activity (e.g., sleeping) for a specified range of durations and during a specified range of time might not introduce health risks. In one example, sleeping for 7-9 hours between 9 PM and 9 AM might not introduce detrimental health risks and thus, might not contribute to activity point or other activity metric value deduction. Indeed, in some example, a lack of inactivity (such as sleep) for a specified range of durations and/or during a specified range of time may be considered detrimental to a user's health. Thus, activity points may be deducted or activity points may be accumulated at a slower rate during these times.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0074">Alternatively or additionally, the amount by which a value of the activity metric (e.g., an activity points) is decreased may be determined based on time of day, location of the user, physical position of the user, level of inactivity and the like. For example, a user may lose greater value in an activity metric and/or at a faster rate during the afternoon than during the evenings. In another example, if a user is at a gym, the user may lose fewer activity points or other activity metric or lose value in the metric at a slower rate than if the user was located at home.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0075">To account for the variances in types of non-active activity (e.g., below a requisite level of movement to be considered activity), a system may distinguish between physical body positions or orientations including, for example, sleeping, reclining, sitting and standing. Distinguishing between different physical body positions and orientations may include placing sensors at different locations of the user's body to detect the individual positions of each body part. The physical body position of the user may then be determined based on the relative positions of the body parts to one another. For example, when a knee location sensor is within a first threshold distance of a waist or chest sensor, the system may determine that the user is sitting. If the knee location sensor is outside of the first threshold distance, the system may determine that the user is standing. In the above example, the system may use a portion of the distance such as the vertical distance. By using vertical distance alone or in combination with an absolute distance (e.g., straight line distance between the two sensors), the system may further distinguish between when a user is lying down and standing up. For example, a lying down position may correspond to a very low vertical distance between the knee sensor and chest or waist sensor even though the absolute distance may be larger. A standing position may correspond to a larger vertical distance between the knee sensor and the waist or chest sensor but exhibit a similar absolute distance. In other examples, an angle formed by the various sensors may be used to determine an individual's position. Additionally or alternatively, the location of the user's various body parts may be evaluated in conjunction with accelerometer or movement data to determine if the user is exhibiting movement or (e.g., at, above or below) a specified level of movement.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0076">In addition to deductions in activity points, the system may alert a user to inactivity to encourage active lifestyles. In one example, the system may alert the user by displaying a message or indicator on a device such as the wearable device assembly described herein after a specified amount of inactivity such as 2 minutes, 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour and the like. The amount of inactivity time may be additive over non-consecutive time periods. An amount of consecutive inactivity time may alternatively or additionally be tracked. For example, if the user is inactive between 10:15 and 11:00 AM and then again between 2:00 and 2:30 PM, the total amount of non-active time may be 1 hour and 15 minutes. The message or indicator of inactivity may be provided as a warning prior to deducting activity points. For example, the message may indicate that X amount of activity points will be deducted if the user does not exhibit a sufficient level of activity within a specified amount of time (e.g., 30 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 hour, 2 hours, etc.). Accordingly, the device may include an non-active timer to determine the amount of user non-activity. Additionally, the message may provide a suggestion as to a type of activity the user should perform to counter any risks introduced by the inactivity. For example, the system may suggest that the user walk 1 hour at a 10 minute mile pace. The device or system may use the user's profile, or data from various communities, including the data of their friends, in order to suggest activities. The data used to suggest activities may include athletic data and/or non-athletic data. The device or system may also suggest rest or recovery periods, e.g., based upon the user's activity or activities over time or any particular time. When the user has counteracted or accounted for the risks or negative effects of the detected amount of inactivity time, a celebratory message or other indication may be provided.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0077">Warnings, point deductions and/or other notifications may be provided if a user returns to a sedentary or a non-active mode within a specified amount of time of exiting sedentary or a non-active mode. For example, the user may exercise or exhibit a sufficient level of activity to exit the sedentary or a non-active mode for a period of 10 minutes. However, the system or device may require at least 30 minutes of activity to avoid additional warnings for a period of time such as 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, etc. For example, the warnings may indicate that the user did not exhibit activity for a sufficient amount of time or a sufficient level of activity or a combination thereof. Additionally, multiple sedentary periods within short amounts of time (e.g., a threshold amount of time) may require higher or additional levels of activity to counteract potential sedentary effects including health risks and the like. In a particular example, the user may be required to perform a higher level of activity to halt point deduction.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0078">A device, such as device <b>226</b>, or other system may further advise a user as to an amount of non-active time allowed before negative health effects may occur. In one example, the device or system may include a countdown indicating a remaining amount of allowable non-active time before potential health risks may begin taking effect. An amount of permissible non-active time may be earned or accumulated based on an amount of activity performed. Accordingly, the device may also provide suggestions or recommendations as to a type and/or duration of activity that may be performed to earn a specified amount of non-active time (e.g., 1 hour of TV watching). Different types of non-active or sedentary activities may require different types or amounts of activity. For example, 1 hour of reclining may require more strenuous or longer exercise than 1 hour of sitting. In another example, 1 hour of sitting while knitting may require less strenuous or a lower amount of exercise or activity than 1 hour of sitting while watching television. According to one or more arrangements, recommendations may be generated based on empirical data and/or predefined programming and data tables specifying a type and/or duration of activity and a corresponding amount of permissible non-activity.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0079">A device, such as device <b>226</b>, or other activity tracking system may further recommend activities based on historical records. For instance, the device or tracking system may determine activity performed by the user in the past and generate recommendations based on those types of activities. Additionally or alternatively, the device or tracking system may generate recommendations for specific workouts performed by the user in the past. For example, a user may need to perform 500 calories worth of activity to counteract 2 hours of TV watching. In such a case, the system may recommend a particular workout performed by the user in the past in which the user burned <b>500</b> calories. Combinations of historical activity types and specific historical workouts may be used to generate recommendations. In one example, the system may recommend one of two workouts that the user has performed in the past based on a type of workout that the user appears to prefer. The preference may be determined based on a number of times the user has performed each type of workout. A workout or activity type may also be recommended based on location and time. For example, if a user previously performs a particular type of activity or a particular workout routine at the same location and/or at the same time, the system may recommend that type of activity or workout routine. Other recommendations algorithms and factors may be used.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0080">Activity and inactivity may be tracked across multiple devices, such as the devices shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and described above. The devices may include computers, mobile phones, music players, game consoles, set-top boxes, etc. A system that calculates energy expenditure points may link activity and inactivity tracking across multiple devices so that the same activity or inactivity is not counted multiple times. Attaching time stamps to data may facilitate tracking activity and inactivity across multiple devices. In some embodiments, data received from multiple devices is analyzed together to increase the accuracy energy expenditure points.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0081">System <b>100</b> may be configured to transmit energy expenditure points to a social networking website. The users may be ranked based on their total number of points for a desired time interval (e.g., rank by day, week, month, year, etc.).</p><p id="p-0080" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a schematic diagram of an example electronic module <b>402</b> that may be used to sense and transmit data in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Electronic module <b>402</b> is configured to be removably engaged with a housing <b>404</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an example configuration in which electronic module <b>402</b> is configured to be removably engaged with housing <b>404</b>.

Electronic module <b>402</b> and housing <b>404</b> may each include one or more electrical contacts, such as contacts <b>408</b> and <b>410</b>. An identification memory <b>412</b> may be attached to an electrical contact of housing <b>404</b> to provide information to electronic module <b>402</b> when electronic module <b>402</b> is engaged with housing <b>404</b>. Identification memory <b>412</b> may be implemented with a memory that includes a single contact serial interface, such as a 1-Wire&#xae; memory, an RFID tag or any other device that stores identifying information. Memory devices that include a single contact serial interface allow for retrieving the contents of the memory with a single contact point. Various embodiments of the invention may utilize active or passive identification memories. Alternative identification memories may use RFID or Near-Field Communication (NFC) components and technologies. Some identification memories may include and/or be connected to one or more associated sensors. Associated sensors may include power sources or receive power from an identification memory. In some embodiments sensors remain in a power off state until receiving a signal from an identification memory or other component.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0084">Identification memory <b>412</b> may store information about clothing, location, users, equipment and other types of information used to evaluate athletic activity. Other types of information may include manufacturing data, such as the identification of a manufacturer, manufacturing date, manufacturing time and manufacturing location. Product use information may also be stored in an identification memory.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0085">In one particular embodiment identification memory <b>412</b> stores bits of data that identifies a brand and an intended use category. The intended use category may correspond to a sport such as basketball or running. Gender information and information that further identifies apparel, such as a left or right shoe designation and/or a serial number may also be included. Identification memories may be embedded in or associated with apparel during manufacturing. In some embodiments identification memories are activated and/or configured, either at first sale, first use or at some other time after the manufacturing process. Activation and/or configuration may enable operation by providing a connection to a battery or changing a state of an identification memory. Activation and/or configuration information may be provided to a computer device, such as computer device <b>430</b> and/or server <b>446</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an example of where housing <b>404</b> may be attached to or embedded within clothing of a user. The housing may be placed in shirts, shorts, jackets, footwear, wrist worn devices, heart rate monitor straps, and other locations that allow electronic module <b>402</b> to determine information, such as activity points. Alternative embodiments of the invention include identification memories embedded in apparel without association with housings. In such embodiments, identification memories may be connected to one or more sensors, actuators, switches, display elements or other electronic component. For example, a shirt sleeve may include an embedded identification memory that stores information relating to the type of shirt and a location of the identification memory. The stored information may be used when selecting or modifying an algorithm. In addition to selecting or modifying an algorithm, an electronic module, such as electronic module <b>402</b>, may read information from an identification memory and use this information to activate or turn on associated sensors. For example, electronic module <b>402</b> may know that a particular identification memory is associated with three sensors and data from one of the sensors will be used by the selected algorithm. In such a case, electronic module <b>402</b> may cause the identification memory to activate or turn on the indicated sensor.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0087">Electronic module <b>402</b> may include one or more sensors, such as accelerometer <b>414</b>, and a processing system <b>416</b> (e.g., one or more microprocessors) and a memory <b>418</b>. Memory <b>418</b> may store a plurality of algorithms that are used to determine information such as athletic performance parameters and activity points. Algorithms may be optimized to generate results based on the location of electronic module <b>402</b>. For example, memory <b>418</b> may include a plurality of algorithms for determining activity points. In operation, processing system <b>416</b> may retrieve information from identification memory <b>412</b> that identifies a current location of electronic module <b>402</b>. The location information may identify apparel such as shirts, pants, shorts, footwear, hats, accessories, etc. Location information may also identify equipment, such as balls, mitts, treadmills, exercise bikes, and other equipment that a user may operate. Location information may further identify a location on apparel, such as in footwear, on a shirt sleeve, etc. With this location information, processing system <b>416</b> may retrieve an algorithm that is optimized for determining activity points with accelerometer data when accelerometer <b>414</b> is at the indicated location.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0088">Location information may be associated with other information, such as an expected range of motion of apparel. Some apparel is intended to have a loose fit, such as a basketball jersey, while other apparel is intended to have a snug fit, such as an American football jersey. An identification memory may store location and expected range of motion information. Alternatively, an identification memory may store location information and attributes of the apparel and electronic module <b>402</b> or some other device may determine an expected range of motion. The resulting information may be used when selecting or modifying an algorithm. Moreover, such information may be used to validate data received from sensors. For example, an identification memory may store information indicating that the location is on a sleeve of a jersey that is intended to be worn snuggly. An accelerometer signal value may be discarded because it exceeds an expected value, while the same value may be valid when it is received from an accelerometer attached to a loose fitting jersey.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0089">Electronic module <b>402</b>, or some other device may also modify or update one or more algorithms based on information received from one or more identification memories. Modifications may include adding or removing steps, variables, scalars, boundary conditions, parameters, terms and other elements that may be used by algorithms. Modifications may also include setting values for scalars, boundary conditions etc. For example, an identification memory may identify a size of a shoe and the shoe size information may be used to set a value of a scalar in an algorithm. The presence of information stored within an identification memory may also be used to eliminate algorithms from the selection process. For example, information identifying a particular type of footwear may be used to eliminate one or more algorithms.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0090">In addition to modifying one or more algorithms, information received from an identification memory also be used to modify processes implemented with software, firmware, etc. over time. For example, electronic module <b>402</b> may use information obtained from an identification memory to both modify an algorithm and alter software that controls the operation of transmission/reception system (TX-RX) <b>428</b> to change a frequency of data transmissions. Some information may be used to change a scope of a user's profile data that may be stored in electronic module <b>402</b>, computer device <b>430</b> and/or server <b>446</b>. In some embodiments identification memories include indicators such as electrochromic displays. A display state may be set as a function of whether the memory has been turned on and/or is providing data that was used to select or modify an algorithm that is currently being used.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0091">In addition to including one or more sensors, electronic module <b>402</b> may be connected to one or more external sensors, such as sensors <b>420</b>, <b>422</b> and <b>424</b>. Sensors <b>420</b>, <b>422</b> and <b>424</b> may be accelerometers, pressure sensors, altimeters, gyroscopes or any of the other types of sensors described above. External sensors may include memories that store location information. In some embodiments, the algorithm selected from memory <b>418</b> may also be a function of sensor data available, value of the sensor data and external data, such as weather data. For example, sensor <b>420</b> may be an accelerometer and processing system <b>416</b> select an algorithm from memory <b>418</b> that is optimized to be used with data from an external accelerometer and internal accelerometer <b>414</b> that is determined to be located within footwear by information stored in identification memory <b>412</b>. Data from sensor <b>420</b> may also be initially analyzed to determine if the user is running or walking and this information may also be used when selecting an algorithm. Some algorithms may not use data from all of the available sensors. Computer device <b>430</b> or some other device may be used to inform a user of which sensors are currently being used. In some embodiments, computer device <b>430</b>, electronic module <b>402</b> or some other device may identify available sensors and locations and recommend modifying a location of electronic module <b>402</b>. For example, electronic module <b>402</b> may determine that a user is running, electronic module <b>402</b> is attached to a sleeve and based upon the activity and other sensor data available, repositioning electronic module <b>402</b> to footwear would produce more accurate results. The repositioning of electronic module <b>402</b> may also result in selection of a different algorithm or modification of an algorithm.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0092">Identification memories embedded in apparel may also be used to help identify activities with varying levels of confidence. For example, an identification memory embedded in footwear may include category information that identifies the footwear as intended for use when playing basketball. When this information is received at a mobile phone or other device, the device can assume at a first confidence level that the user is playing basketball. An identification memory embedded in shorts worn by the user may identify the shorts as basketball shorts. When footwear and shorts data is combined with sensor data, the mobile phone or other device may assume at a second confidence level, higher than the first confidence level, that the user is playing basketball. Identification memories may similarly be embedded or attached to equipment to provide similar information. For example, an identification memory may be embedded in a basketball and the information identifying the basketball may be used to identify the activity as basketball at an even higher confidence level. The identification of activities may be used to select and modify algorithms. In some embodiments more general algorithms are selected when activities are identified with relatively lower confidence levels and more accurate algorithms are selected when activities are identified with relatively higher confidence levels. The identification of activities with various confidence levels may also be used to adjust displays and other software, such as the software that controls the operation of transmission/reception system (TX-RX) <b>428</b> to change a frequency of data transmissions.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0093">In some embodiments of the invention algorithms may be selected or modified dynamically.
