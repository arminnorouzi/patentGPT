(CME), provides a contract market where financial products/instruments, for example futures and options on futures, are traded. Futures is a term used to designate all contracts for the purchase or sale of financial instruments or physical commodities for future delivery or cash settlement on a commodity futures exchange. A futures contract is a legally binding agreement to buy or sell a commodity at a specified price at a predetermined future time, referred to as the expiration date or expiration month.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Cash Settlement is a method of settling a futures contract whereby the party's effect final settlement when the contract expires by paying/receiving the loss/gain related to the contract in cash, rather than by effecting physical sale and purchase of the underlying reference commodity at a price determined by the futures contract price.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typically, the exchange provides for a centralized &#x201c;clearing house&#x201d; through which all trades made must be confirmed, matched, and settled each day until offset or delivered. The clearing house is an adjunct to the exchange, and may be an operating division thereof, which is responsible for settling trading accounts, clearing trades, collecting and maintaining performance bond funds, regulating delivery, and reporting trading data. The essential role of the clearing house is to mitigate credit risk. Clearing is the procedure through which the Clearing House becomes buyer to each seller of a futures contract, and seller to each buyer, also referred to as a novation, and assumes responsibility for protecting buyers and sellers from financial loss due to breach of contract, by assuring performance on each contract. A clearing member is a firm qualified to clear trades through the Clearing House.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Current financial instrument trading systems allow customers to submit orders and receive confirmations, market data, and other information electronically via a network. These &#x201c;electronic&#x201d; marketplaces have largely supplanted the pit based trading systems whereby the traders, or their representatives, all physically stand in a designated location, i.e. a trading pit, and trade with each other via oral and hand based communication. In contrast to the pit based trading system where like-minded buyers and sellers can readily find each other to trade, electronic marketplaces must electronically &#x201c;match&#x201d; the orders placed by buyers and sellers on behalf thereof. Electronic trading systems may offer a more efficient and transparent system of trading. Electronic trading systems may achieve more fair and equitable matching among traders as well as identify more opportunities to trade, thereby improving market liquidity.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the technological field of computer science, systems are designed to provide efficient and quick calculations of market conditions. One example market condition is volatility. Volatility measures the changes of a value over time. For example, the volatility of a financial instrument over time may be used to analyze the performance of the financial instruments as well as correlation for margin requirements.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an illustrative computer network system that may be used to implement aspects of the disclosed embodiments.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts an illustrative embodiment of a general computer system for use with the disclosed embodiments.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts a flow chart showing exemplary operation of the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts an example graphical user interface (GUI) for dual volatility calculations of one or more financial instruments according to an anchor.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts another example GUI for dual volatility calculations including forward volatility.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts another example GUI for dual volatility calculations including a dynamic matrix.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> depicts another example GUI for dual volatility calculations including multiple anchors.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts another example GUI for dual volatility calculations including a frequency selector.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Volatility is a calculation of the variation of a quantity over time. For financial instruments, the quantity may be price. Various formulae or techniques are possible for the calculation of volatility. One example is the standard deviation of the logarithmic change of the quantity. The logarithm change of the quantity may be the natural log of the ratio of the final value to the initial value. Equation 1 summaries these calculations for a single interval using a final price P<sub>f </sub>and a price P<sub>i</sub>:</p><p id="p-0017" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mi>Volatility</mi>     <mo>=</mo>     <msqrt>      <mrow>       <mi>ln</mi>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mfrac>        <msub>         <mi>P</mi>         <mi>f</mi>        </msub>        <msub>         <mi>P</mi>         <mi>i</mi>        </msub>       </mfrac>      </mrow>     </msqrt>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mi>Eq</mi>     <mo>.</mo>     <mtext>   </mtext>     <mn>1</mn>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0018" num="0016">Realized, or Historical Volatility may be calculated numerically based on the standard deviation of the square root of the variance in price. Equation 2 provides a root-mean-squared form for historical or realized volatility according to the ratio of a current price to a previous price. For multiple quantities over time (e.g., 252 trading days per year), volatility is calculated according to Equation 2 as the summation of the individual interval changes in the quantities according to a first price P<sub>t </sub>and a second or previous price P<sub>t-1</sub>:</p><p id="p-0019" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00002" num="00002"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mi>Volatility</mi>     <mo>=</mo>     <mrow>      <mn>100</mn>      <mo>&#xd7;</mo>      <msqrt>       <mfrac>        <mrow>         <mrow>          <mn>252</mn>          <mo>&#xd7;</mo>          <mrow>           <msubsup>            <mo>&#x2211;</mo>            <mrow>             <mi>t</mi>             <mo>=</mo>             <mn>1</mn>            </mrow>            <mi>n</mi>           </msubsup>           <msup>            <mrow>             <mo>(</mo>             <mrow>              <mi>ln</mi>              <mo>&#x2061;</mo>              <mo>(</mo>              <mfrac>               <msub>                <mi>P</mi>                <mi>t</mi>               </msub>               <msub>                <mi>P</mi>                <mrow>                 <mi>t</mi>                 <mo>-</mo>                 <mn>1</mn>                </mrow>               </msub>              </mfrac>              <mo>)</mo>             </mrow>             <mo>)</mo>            </mrow>            <mn>2</mn>           </msup>          </mrow>         </mrow>         <mo>)</mo>        </mrow>        <mi>n</mi>       </mfrac>      </msqrt>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mi>Eq</mi>     <mo>.</mo>     <mtext>   </mtext>     <mn>2</mn>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0020" num="0017">Historical volatility (realized volatility) may be calculated according to any of these techniques.

Implied volatilities for non-observable strike prices or expirations, or forward dates, can then be implied or predicted based on the implied volatilities of options already calculated. Especially in options markets, analysis focuses on volatility and the distribution of prices, rather than the direction or trend of increasing or decreasing prices. Using Equation 3, the &#x3c3;<sup>2 </sup>term may be algorithmically swapped with the option price. The option price being the known quantity and the &#x3c3;<sup>2 </sup>value being the unknown quantity, which is then solved for.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0020">Different options contracts for the same underlying asset may have different expiration dates. The prices of these options for the various expiration dates describe the markets perception for the future volatility of the underlying for the options. Thus, options can provide an estimate of where prices are predicted to go in the future. More information is provided by the shape of the volatility term structure. Even more information is provided by the forward implied volatility that govern market implication of specified periods of time. One example calculation for implied volatility is described by the Black-Scholes model.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0021">An analogy is that the past (realized or historical volatility) is like looking in the rear-view mirror, while the implied volatility term structure presents the market's estimates of future volatility, which is like driving looking straight ahead through the windshield. The following embodiments solve technical challenges faced in the display and coordination of historical volatility and implied volatility. These challenges are rooted in the differences in calculation techniques for historical volatility and implied volatility. The following embodiments provide more information/data on a single view and unique control structures to control the time display. The historical volatility and implied volatility are coordinated to provide a seamless view of both past and future volatility. The combination of historical and implied volatility offers a significantly improved view of the options marketplace (past plus future expected) volatility dynamics. Further, the baseline implementation allows additional user selections to pivot the combined view according to an anchor date, which dynamically adjusts the calculations of volatility in real time under the control of the user.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="2">Exchange Computing System</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0022">The disclosed embodiments may be implemented in a data transaction processing system that processes data items or objects.

The electronic data transaction request messages may include, for example, transaction matching parameters, such as instructions and/or values, for processing the data transaction request messages within the data transaction processing system. The instructions may be to perform transactions, e.g., buy or sell a quantity of a product at a range of values defined equations. Products, e.g., financial instruments, or order books representing the state of an electronic marketplace for a product, may be represented as data objects within the exchange computing system. The instructions may also be conditional, e.g., buy or sell a quantity of a product at a given value if a trade for the product is executed at some other reference value. The data transaction processing system may include various specifically configured matching processors that match, e.g., automatically, electronic data transaction request messages for the same one of the data items or objects. The specifically configured matching processors may match, or attempt to match, electronic data transaction request messages based on multiple transaction matching parameters from the different client computers. The specifically configured matching processors may additionally generate information indicative of a state of an environment (e.g., the state of the order book) based on the processing, and report this information to data recipient computing systems via outbound messages published via one or more data feeds.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0023">For example, one exemplary environment where the disclosed embodiments may be desirable is in financial markets, and in particular, electronic financial exchanges, such as a futures exchange, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0024">A financial instrument trading system, such as a futures exchange, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME), provides a contract market where financial instruments, e.g., futures and options on futures, are traded using electronic systems. &#x201c;Futures&#x201d; is a term used to designate all contracts for the purchase or sale of financial instruments or physical commodities for future delivery or cash settlement on a commodity futures exchange. A futures contract is a legally binding agreement to buy or sell a commodity at a specified price at a predetermined future time. An option contract is the right, but not the obligation, to sell or buy the underlying instrument (in this case, a futures contract) at a specified price on or before a certain expiration date. An option contract offers an opportunity to take advantage of futures price moves without actually having a futures position. The commodity to be delivered in fulfillment of the contract, or alternatively the commodity for which the cash market price shall determine the final settlement price of the futures contract, is known as the contract's underlying reference or &#x201c;underlier.&#x201d; The underlying or underlier for an options contract is the corresponding futures contract that is purchased or sold upon the exercise of the option.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0025">The terms and conditions of each futures contract are standardized as to the specification of the contract's underlying reference commodity, the quality of such commodity, quantity, delivery date, and means of contract settlement. Cash settlement is a method of settling a futures contract whereby the parties effect final settlement when the contract expires by paying/receiving the loss/gain related to the contract in cash, rather than by effecting physical sale and purchase of the underlying reference commodity at a price determined by the futures contract price. Options and futures may be based on more generalized market indicators, such as stock indices, interest rates, futures contracts and other derivatives.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0026">An exchange may provide for a centralized &#x201c;clearing house&#x201d; through which trades made must be confirmed, matched, and settled each day until offset or delivered. The clearing house may be an adjunct to an exchange, and may be an operating division of an exchange, which is responsible for settling trading accounts, clearing trades, collecting and maintaining performance bond funds, regulating delivery, and reporting trading data. One of the roles of the clearing house is to mitigate credit risk. Clearing is the procedure through which the clearing house becomes buyer to each seller of a futures contract, and seller to each buyer, also referred to as a novation, and assumes responsibility for protecting buyers and sellers from financial loss due to breach of contract, by assuring performance on each contract. A clearing member is a firm qualified to clear trades through the clearing house.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0027">An exchange computing system may operate under a central counterparty model, where the exchange acts as an intermediary between market participants for the transaction of financial instruments. In particular, the exchange computing system novates itself into the transactions between the market participants, i.e., splits a given transaction between the parties into two separate transactions where the exchange computing system substitutes itself as the counterparty to each of the parties for that part of the transaction, sometimes referred to as a novation. In this way, the exchange computing system acts as a guarantor and central counterparty and there is no need for the market participants to disclose their identities to each other, or subject themselves to credit or other investigations by a potential counterparty. For example, the exchange computing system insulates one market participant from the default by another market participant. Market participants need only meet the requirements of the exchange computing system. Anonymity among the market participants encourages a more liquid market environment as there are lower barriers to participation. The exchange computing system can accordingly offer benefits such as centralized and anonymous matching and clearing.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Electronic Data Transaction Request Messages</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0028">As used herein, a financial message, or an electronic message, refers both to messages communicated by market participants to an electronic trading or market system and vice versa. The messages may be communicated using packeting or other techniques operable to communicate information between systems and system components. Some messages may be associated with actions to be taken in the electronic trading or market system. In particular, in one embodiment, upon receipt of a request, a token is allocated and included in a TCP shallow acknowledgment transmission sent back to the participant acknowledging receipt of the request. It should be appreciated that while this shallow acknowledgment is, in some sense, a response to the request, it does not confirm the processing of an order included in the request. The participant, i.e., their device, then sends back a TCP acknowledgment which acknowledges receipt of the shallow acknowledgment and token.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0029">Financial messages communicated to the electronic trading system, also referred to as &#x201c;inbound&#x201d; messages, may include associated actions that characterize the messages, such as trader orders, order modifications, order cancellations and the like, as well as other message types. Inbound messages may be sent from client devices associated with market participants, or their representatives, e.g., trade order messages, etc., to an electronic trading or market system. For example, a market participant may submit an electronic message to the electronic trading system that includes an associated specific action to be undertaken by the electronic trading system, such as entering a new trade order into the market or modifying an existing order in the market. In one embodiment, if a participant wishes to modify a previously sent request, e.g., a prior order which has not yet been processed or traded, they may send a request message comprising a request to modify the prior request. In one exemplary embodiment, the incoming request itself, e.g., the inbound order entry, may be referred to as an iLink message. iLink is a bidirectional communications/message protocol/message format implemented by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0030">Financial messages communicated from the electronic trading system, referred to as &#x201c;outbound&#x201d; messages, may include messages responsive to inbound messages, such as confirmation messages, or other messages such as market update messages, quote messages, and the like. Outbound messages may be disseminated via data feeds.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0031">Financial messages may further be categorized as having or reflecting an impact on a market or electronic marketplace, also referred to as an &#x201c;order book&#x201d; or &#x201c;book,&#x201d; for a traded product, such as a prevailing price therefore, number of resting orders at various price levels and quantities thereof, etc., or not having or reflecting an impact on a market or a subset or portion thereof. In one embodiment, an electronic order book may be understood to be an electronic collection of the outstanding or resting orders for a financial instrument.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0032">For example, a request to place a trade may result in a response indicative of the trade either being matched with, or being rested on an order book to await, a suitable counter-order. This response may include a message directed solely to the trader who submitted the order to acknowledge receipt of the order and report whether it was matched, and the extent thereto, or rested. The response may further include a message to all market participants reporting a change in the order book due to the order. This response may take the form of a report of the specific change to the order book, e.g., an order for quantity X at price Y was added to the book (referred to, in one embodiment, as a Market By Order message), or may simply report the result, e.g., price level Y now has orders for a total quantity of Z (where Z is the sum of the previous resting quantity plus quantity X of the new order). In some cases, requests may elicit a non-impacting response, such as temporally proximate to the receipt of the request, and then cause a separate market-impact reflecting response at a later time. For example, a stop order, fill or kill order (FOK), also known as an immediate or cancel order, or other conditional request may not have an immediate market impacting effect, if at all, until the requisite conditions are met.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0033">An acknowledgement or confirmation of receipt, e.g., a non-market impacting communication, may be sent to the trader simply confirming that the order was received. Upon the conditions being met and a market impacting result thereof occurring, a market-impacting message may be transmitted as described herein both directly back to the submitting market participant and to all market participants (in a Market By Price &#x201c;MBP&#x201d; e.g., Aggregated By Value (&#x201c;ABV&#x201d;) book, or Market By Order &#x201c;MBO&#x201d;, e.g., Per Order (&#x201c;PO&#x201d;) book format). It should be appreciated that additional conditions may be specified, such as a time or price limit, which may cause the order to be dropped or otherwise canceled and that such an event may result in another non-market-impacting communication instead. In some implementations, market impacting communications may be communicated separately from non-market impacting communications, such as via a separate communications channel or feed.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0034">It should be further appreciated that various types of market data feeds may be provided which reflect different markets or aspects thereof. Market participants may then, for example, subscribe to receive those feeds of interest to them. For example, data recipient computing systems may choose to receive one or more different feeds. As market impacting communications usually tend to be more important to market participants than non-impacting communications, this separation may reduce congestion and/or noise among those communications having or reflecting an impact on a market or portion thereof. Furthermore, a particular market data feed may only communicate information related to the top buy/sell prices for a particular product, referred to as &#x201c;top of book&#x201d; feed, e.g., only changes to the top 10 price levels are communicated. Such limitations may be implemented to reduce consumption of bandwidth and message generation resources. In this case, while a request message may be considered market-impacting if it affects a price level other than the top buy/sell prices, it will not result in a message being sent to the market participants.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0035">Examples of the various types of market data feeds which may be provided by electronic trading systems, such as the CME, in order to provide different types or subsets of market information or to provide such information in different formats include Market By Order or Per Order, Market Depth (also known as Market by Price or Aggregated By Value to a designated depth of the book), e.g., CME offers a 10-deep market by price feed, Top of Book (a single depth Market by Price feed), and combinations thereof. There may also be all manner of specialized feeds in terms of the content, i.e., providing, for example, derived data, such as a calculated index.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0036">Market data feeds may be characterized as providing a &#x201c;view&#x201d; or &#x201c;overview&#x201d; of a given market, an aggregation or a portion thereof or changes thereto. For example, a market data feed, such as a Market By Price (&#x201c;MBP&#x201d;) feed, also known as an Aggregated By Value (&#x201c;ABV&#x201d;) feed, may convey, with each message, the entire/current state of a market, or portion thereof, for a particular product as a result of one or more market impacting events. For example, an MBP message may convey a total quantity of resting buy/sell orders at a particular price level in response to a new order being placed at that price. An MBP message may convey a quantity of an instrument which was traded in response to an incoming order being matched with one or more resting orders. MBP messages may only be generated for events affecting a portion of a market, e.g., only the top 10 resting buy/sell orders and, thereby, only provide a view of that portion. As used herein, a market impacting request may be said to impact the &#x201c;view&#x201d; of the market as presented via the market data feed.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0037">An MBP feed may utilize different message formats for conveying different types of market impacting events. For example, when a new order is rested on the order book, an MBP message may reflect the current state of the price level to which the order was added, e.g., the new aggregate quantity and the new aggregate number of resting orders. As can be seen, such a message conveys no information about the individual resting orders, including the newly rested order, themselves to the market participants. Only the submitting market participant, who receives a separate private message acknowledging the event, knows that it was their order that was added to the book. Similarly, when a trade occurs, an MBP message may be sent which conveys the price at which the instrument was traded, the quantity traded and the number of participating orders, but may convey no information as to whose particular orders contributed to the trade. MBP feeds may further batch reporting of multiple events, i.e., report the result of multiple market impacting events in a single message.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0038">Alternatively, a market data feed, referred to as a Market By Order (&#x201c;MBO&#x201d;) feed also known as a Per Order (&#x201c;PO&#x201d;) feed, may convey data reflecting a change that occurred to the order book rather than the result of that change, e.g., that order ABC for quantity X was added to price level Y or that order ABC and order XYZ traded a quantity X at a price Y. In this case, the MBO message identifies only the change that occurred so a market participant wishing to know the current state of the order book must maintain their own copy and apply the change reflected in the message to know the current state. As can be seen, MBO/PO messages may carry much more data than MBP/ABV messages because MBO/PO messages reflect information about each order, whereas MBP/ABV messages contain information about orders affecting some predetermined value levels. Furthermore, because specific orders, but not the submitting traders thereof, are identified, other market participants may be able to follow that order as it progresses through the market, e.g., as it is modified, canceled, traded, etc.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0039">An ABV book data object may include information about multiple values. The ABV book data object may be arranged and structured so that information about each value is aggregated together. Thus, for a given value V, the ABV book data object may aggregate all the information by value, such as for example, the number of orders having a certain position at value V, the quantity of total orders resting at value V, etc. Thus, the value field may be the key, or may be a unique field, within an ABV book data object. In one embodiment, the value for each entry within the ABV book data object is different. In one embodiment, information in an ABV book data object is presented in a manner such that the value field is the most granular field of information.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0040">A PO book data object may include information about multiple orders. The PO book data object may be arranged and structured so that information about each order is represented. Thus, for a given order O, the PO book data object may provide all of the information for order O. Thus, the order field may be the key, or may be a unique field, within a PO book data object. In one embodiment, the order ID for each entry within the PO book data object is different. In one embodiment, information in a PO book data object is presented in a manner such that the order field is the most granular field of information.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0041">Thus, the PO book data object may include data about unique orders, e.g., all unique resting orders for a product, and the ABV book data object may include data about unique values, e.g., up to a predetermined level, e.g., top ten price or value levels, for a product.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0042">A market data feed may also provide information about volatility. The market data feed may include data supporting a single volatility index for combining dual volatility calculations for both historical volatility and implied volatility.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0043">It should be appreciated that the number, type and manner of market data feeds provided by an electronic trading system are implementation dependent and may vary depending upon the types of products traded by the electronic trading system, customer/trader preferences, bandwidth and data processing limitations, etc. and that all such feeds, now available or later developed, are contemplated herein. MBP/ABV and MBO/PO feeds may refer to categories/variations of market data feeds, distinguished by whether they provide an indication of the current state of a market resulting from a market impacting event (MBP) or an indication of the change in the current state of a market due to a market impacting event (MBO).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0044">Messages, whether MBO or MBP, generated responsive to market impacting events which are caused by a single order, such as a new order, an order cancellation, an order modification, etc., are fairly simple and compact and easily created and transmitted. However, messages, whether MBO or MBP, generated responsive to market impacting events which are caused by more than one order, such as a trade, may require the transmission of a significant amount of data to convey the requisite information to the market participants. For trades involving a large number of orders, e.g., a buy order for a quantity of 5000 which matches 5000 sell orders each for a quantity of 1, a significant amount of information may need to be sent, e.g., data indicative of each of the 5000 trades that have participated in the market impacting event.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0045">In one embodiment, an exchange computing system may generate multiple order book objects, one for each type of view that is published or provided. For example, the system may generate a PO book object and an ABV book object. It should be appreciated that each book object, or view for a product or market, may be derived from the Per Order book object, which includes all the orders for a given financial product or market.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0046">An inbound message may include an order that affects the PO book object, the ABV book object, or both. An outbound message may include data from one or more of the structures within the exchange computing system, e.g., the PO book object queues or the ABV book object queues.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0047">Furthermore, each participating trader needs to receive a notification that their particular order has traded. Continuing with the example, this may require sending 5001 individual trade notification messages, or even 10,000+ messages where each contributing side (buy vs. sell) is separately reported, in addition to the notification sent to all of the market participants.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0048">As detailed in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2015/0161727, the entirety of which is incorporated by reference herein and relied upon, it may be recognized that trade notifications sent to all market participants may include redundant information repeated for each participating trade and a structure of an MBP trade notification message may be provided which results in a more efficient communication of the occurrence of a trade. The message structure may include a header portion which indicates the type of transaction which occurred, i.e., a trade, as well as other general information about the event, an instrument portion which comprises data about each instrument which was traded as part of the transaction, and an order portion which comprises data about each participating order. In one embodiment, the header portion may include a message type, Transaction Time, Match Event Indicator, and Number of Market Data Entries (&#x201c;No. MD Entries&#x201d;) fields. The instrument portion may include a market data update action indicator (&#x201c;MD Update Action&#x201d;), an indication of the Market Data Entry Type (&#x201c;MD Entry Type&#x201d;), an identifier of the instrument/security involved in the transaction (&#x201c;Security ID&#x201d;), a report sequence indicator (&#x201c;Rpt Seq&#x201d;), the price at which the instrument was traded (&#x201c;MD Entry PX&#x201d;), the aggregate quantity traded at the indicated price (&#x201c;ConsTradeQty&#x201d;), the number of participating orders (&#x201c;NumberOfOrders&#x201d;), and an identifier of the aggressor side (&#x201c;Aggressor Side&#x201d;) fields. The order portion may further include an identifier of the participating order (&#x201c;Order ID&#x201d;), described in more detail below, and the quantity of the order traded (&#x201c;MD Entry Size&#x201d;) fields. It should be appreciated that the particular fields included in each portion are implementation dependent and that different fields in addition to, or in lieu of, those listed may be included depending upon the implementation. It should be appreciated that the exemplary fields can be compliant with the FIX binary and/or FIX/FAST protocol for the communication of the financial information.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0049">The instrument portion contains a set of fields, e.g., seven fields accounting for 23 bytes, which are repeated for each participating instrument. In complex trades, such as trades involving combination orders or strategies, e.g., spreads, or implied trades, there may be multiple instruments being exchanged among the parties. In one embodiment, the order portion includes only one field, accounting for 4 bytes, for each participating order which indicates the quantity of that order which was traded. As will be discussed below, the order portion may further include an identifier of each order, accounting for an additional 8 bytes, in addition to the quantity thereof traded. As should be appreciated, data which would have been repeated for each participating order, is consolidated or otherwise summarized in the header and instrument portions of the message thereby eliminating redundant information and, overall, significantly reducing the size of the message.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0050">While the disclosed embodiments may be discussed with respect to an MBP market data feed, it should be appreciated that the disclosed embodiments may also be applicable to an MBO market data feed.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Market Segment Gateway</heading><p id="p-0055" num="0051">In one embodiment, the disclosed system may include a Market Segment Gateway (&#x201c;MSG&#x201d;) that is the point of ingress/entry and/or egress/departure for all transactions, i.e., the network traffic/packets containing the data therefore, specific to a single market at which the order of receipt of those transactions may be ascribed. An MSG or Market Segment Gateway may be utilized for the purpose of deterministic operation of the market. The electronic trading system may include multiple markets, and because the electronic trading system includes one MSG for each market/product implemented thereby, the electronic trading system may include multiple MSGs. For more detail on deterministic operation in a trading system, see U.S. Patent Publication No. 2015/0127513 entitled &#x201c;Transactionally Deterministic High Speed Financial Exchange Having Improved, Efficiency, Communication, Customization, Performance, Access, Trading Opportunities, Credit Controls, And Fault Tolerance&#x201d; and filed on Nov. 7, 2013 (&#x201c;the '513 Publication&#x201d;), the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein and relied upon.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0052">For example, a participant may send a request for a new transaction, e.g., a request for a new order, to the MSG. The MSG extracts or decodes the request message and determines the characteristics of the request message.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0053">The MSG may include, or otherwise be coupled with, a buffer, cache, memory, database, content addressable memory, data store or other data storage mechanism, or combinations thereof, which stores data indicative of the characteristics of the request message. The request is passed to the transaction processing system, e.g., the match engine.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0054">An MSG or Market Segment Gateway may be utilized for the purpose of deterministic operation of the market. Transactions for a particular market may be ultimately received at the electronic trading system via one or more points of entry, e.g., one or more communications interfaces, at which the disclosed embodiments apply determinism, which as described may be at the point where matching occurs, e.g., at each match engine (where there may be multiple match engines, each for a given product/market, or moved away from the point where matching occurs and closer to the point where the electronic trading system first becomes &#x201c;aware&#x201d; of the incoming transaction, such as the point where transaction messages, e.g., orders, ingress the electronic trading system. Generally, the terms &#x201c;determinism&#x201d; or &#x201c;transactional determinism&#x201d; may refer to the processing, or the appearance thereof, of orders in accordance with defined business rules. Accordingly, as used herein, the point of determinism may be the point at which the electronic trading system ascribes an ordering to incoming transactions/orders relative to other incoming transactions/orders such that the ordering may be factored into the subsequent processing, e.g., matching, of those transactions/orders as will be described. For more detail on deterministic operation in a trading system, see the '513 Publication.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Electronic Trading</heading><p id="p-0059" num="0055">Electronic trading of financial instruments, such as futures contracts, is conducted by market participants sending orders, such as to buy or sell one or more futures contracts, in electronic form to the exchange. These electronically submitted orders to buy and sell are then matched, if possible, by the exchange, i.e., by the exchange's matching engine, to execute a trade. Outstanding (unmatched, wholly unsatisfied/unfilled or partially satisfied/filled) orders are maintained in one or more data structures or databases referred to as &#x201c;order books,&#x201d; such orders being referred to as &#x201c;resting,&#x201d; and made visible, i.e., their availability for trading is advertised, to the market participants through electronic notifications/broadcasts, referred to as market data feeds. An order book is typically maintained for each product, e.g., instrument, traded on the electronic trading system and generally defines or otherwise represents the state of the market for that product, i.e., the current prices at which the market participants are willing to buy or sell that product. As such, as used herein, an order book for a product may also be referred to as a market for that product.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0056">Upon receipt of an incoming order to trade in a particular financial instrument, whether for a single-component financial instrument, e.g., a single futures contract, or for a multiple-component financial instrument, e.g., a combination contract such as a spread contract, a match engine, as described herein, will attempt to identify a previously received but unsatisfied order counter thereto, i.e., for the opposite transaction (buy or sell) in the same financial instrument at the same or better price (but not necessarily for the same quantity unless, for example, either order specifies a condition that it must be entirely filled or not at all).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0057">Previously received but unsatisfied orders, i.e., orders which either did not match with a counter order when they were received or their quantity was only partially satisfied, referred to as a partial fill, are maintained by the electronic trading system in an order book database/data structure to await the subsequent arrival of matching orders or the occurrence of other conditions which may cause the order to be modified or otherwise removed from the order book.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0058">If the match engine identifies one or more suitable previously received but unsatisfied counter orders, they, and the incoming order, are matched to execute a trade there between to at least partially satisfy the quantities of one or both the incoming order or the identified orders. If there remains any residual unsatisfied quantity of the identified one or more orders, those orders are left on the order book with their remaining quantity to await a subsequent suitable counter order, i.e., to rest. If the match engine does not identify a suitable previously received but unsatisfied counter order, or the one or more identified suitable previously received but unsatisfied counter orders are for a lesser quantity than the incoming order, the incoming order is placed on the order book, referred to as &#x201c;resting&#x201d;, with original or remaining unsatisfied quantity, to await a subsequently received suitable order counter thereto. The match engine then generates match event data reflecting the result of this matching process. Other components of the electronic trading system, as will be described, then generate the respective order acknowledgment and market data messages and transmit those messages to the market participants.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0059">Matching, which is a function typically performed by the exchange, is a process, for a given order which specifies a desire to buy or sell a quantity of a particular instrument at a particular price, of seeking/identifying one or more wholly or partially, with respect to quantity, satisfying counter orders thereto, e.g., a sell counter to an order to buy, or vice versa, for the same instrument at the same, or sometimes better, price (but not necessarily the same quantity), which are then paired for execution to complete a trade between the respective market participants (via the exchange) and at least partially satisfy the desired quantity of one or both of the order and/or the counter order, with any residual unsatisfied quantity left to await another suitable counter order, referred to as &#x201c;resting.&#x201d; A match event may occur, for example, when an aggressing order matches with a resting order. In one embodiment, two orders match because one order includes instructions for or specifies buying a quantity of a particular instrument at a particular price, and the other order includes instructions for or specifies selling a (different or same) quantity of the instrument at a same or better price. It should be appreciated that performing an instruction associated with a message may include attempting to perform the instruction. Whether or not an exchange computing system is able to successfully perform an instruction may depend on the state of the electronic marketplace.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0060">While the disclosed embodiments will be described with respect to a product by product or market by market implementation, e.g. implemented for each market/order book, it will be appreciated that the disclosed embodiments may be implemented so as to apply across markets for multiple products traded on one or more electronic trading systems, such as by monitoring an aggregate, correlated or other derivation of the relevant indicative parameters as described herein.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0061">While the disclosed embodiments may be discussed in relation to futures and/or options on futures trading, it should be appreciated that the disclosed embodiments may be applicable to any equity, fixed income security, currency, commodity, options or futures trading system or market now available or later developed. It may be appreciated that a trading environment, such as a futures exchange as described herein, implements one or more economic markets where rights and obligations may be traded. As such, a trading environment may be characterized by a need to maintain market integrity, transparency, predictability, fair/equitable access and participant expectations with respect thereto. In addition, it may be appreciated that electronic trading systems further impose additional expectations and demands by market participants as to transaction processing speed, latency, capacity and response time, while creating additional complexities relating thereto. Accordingly, as will be described, the disclosed embodiments may further include functionality to ensure that the expectations of market participants are met, e.g., that transactional integrity and predictable system responses are maintained.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0062">Financial instrument trading systems allow traders to submit orders and receive confirmations, market data, and other information electronically via electronic messages exchanged using a network. Electronic trading systems ideally attempt to offer a more efficient, fair and balanced market where market prices reflect a true consensus of the value of traded products among the market participants, where the intentional or unintentional influence of any one market participant is minimized if not eliminated, and where unfair or inequitable advantages with respect to information access are minimized if not eliminated.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0063">Electronic marketplaces attempt to achieve these goals by using electronic messages to communicate actions and related data of the electronic marketplace between market participants, clearing firms, clearing houses, and other parties. The messages can be received using an electronic trading system, wherein an action or transaction associated with the messages may be executed. For example, the message may contain information relating to an order to buy or sell a product in a particular electronic marketplace, and the action associated with the message may indicate that the order is to be placed in the electronic marketplace such that other orders which were previously placed may potentially be matched to the order of the received message. Thus, the electronic marketplace may conduct market activities through electronic systems.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Clearing House</heading><p id="p-0068" num="0064">The clearing house of an exchange clears, settles and guarantees matched transactions in contracts occurring through the facilities of the exchange. In addition, the clearing house establishes and monitors financial requirements for clearing members and conveys certain clearing privileges in conjunction with the relevant exchange markets.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0065">The clearing house establishes clearing level performance bonds (margins) for all products of the exchange and establishes minimum performance bond requirements for customers of such products. A performance bond, also referred to as a margin requirement, corresponds with the funds that must be deposited by a customer with his or her broker, by a broker with a clearing member or by a clearing member with the clearing house, for the purpose of insuring the broker or clearing house against loss on open futures or options contracts. This is not a part payment on a purchase. The performance bond helps to ensure the financial integrity of brokers, clearing members and the exchange as a whole. The performance bond refers to the minimum dollar deposit required by the clearing house from clearing members in accordance with their positions. Maintenance, or maintenance margin, refers to a sum, usually smaller than the initial performance bond, which must remain on deposit in the customer's account for any position at all times. The initial margin is the total amount of margin per contract required by the broker when a futures position is opened. A drop in funds below this level requires a deposit back to the initial margin levels, i.e., a performance bond call. If a customer's equity in any futures position drops to or under the maintenance level because of adverse price action, the broker must issue a performance bond/margin call to restore the customer's equity. A performance bond call, also referred to as a margin call, is a demand for additional funds to bring the customer's account back up to the initial performance bond level whenever adverse price movements cause the account to go below the maintenance.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0066">The exchange derives its financial stability in large part by removing debt obligations among market participants as they occur. This is accomplished by determining a settlement price at the close of the market each day for each contract and marking all open positions to that price, referred to as &#x201c;mark to market.&#x201d; Every contract is debited or credited based on that trading session's gains or losses. As prices move for or against a position, funds flow into and out of the trading account. In the case of the CME, each business day by 6:40 a.m. Chicago time, based on the mark-to-the-market of all open positions to the previous trading day's settlement price, the clearing house pays to or collects cash from each clearing member. This cash flow, known as settlement variation, is performed by CME's settlement banks based on instructions issued by the clearing house. All payments to and collections from clearing members are made in &#x201c;same-day&#x201d; funds. In addition to the 6:40 a.m. settlement, a daily intra-day mark-to-the market of all open positions, including trades executed during the overnight GLOBEX&#xae;, the CME's electronic trading systems, trading session and the current day's trades matched before 11:15 a.m., is performed using current prices. The resulting cash payments are made intra-day for same day value. In times of extreme price volatility, the clearing house has the authority to perform additional intra-day mark-to-the-market calculations on open positions and to call for immediate payment of settlement variation. CME's mark-to-the-market settlement system differs from the settlement systems implemented by many other financial markets, including the interbank, Treasury securities, over-the-counter foreign exchange and debt, options, and equities markets, where participants regularly assume credit exposure to each other. In those markets, the failure of one participant can have a ripple effect on the solvency of the other participants. Conversely, CME's mark-to-the-market system does not allow losses to accumulate over time or allow a market participant the opportunity to defer losses associated with market positions.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0067">While the disclosed embodiments may be described in reference to the CME, it should be appreciated that these embodiments are applicable to any exchange. Such other exchanges may include a clearing house that, like the CME clearing house, clears, settles and guarantees all matched transactions in contracts of the exchange occurring through its facilities. In addition, such clearing houses establish and monitor financial requirements for clearing members and convey certain clearing privileges in conjunction with the relevant exchange markets.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0068">The disclosed embodiments are also not limited to uses by a clearing house or exchange for purposes of enforcing a performance bond or margin requirement. For example, a market participant may use the disclosed embodiments in a simulation or other analysis of a portfolio. In such cases, the settlement price may be useful as an indication of a value at risk and/or cash flow obligation rather than a performance bond. The disclosed embodiments may also be used by market participants or other entities to forecast or predict the effects of a prospective position on the margin requirement of the market participant.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Trading Environment</heading><p id="p-0073" num="0069">The embodiments may be described in terms of a distributed computing system.

Such administration, management or maintenance may include managing a number of database records reflective of margin accounts of the market participants. In some embodiments, the risk management module <b>114</b> implements one or more aspects of the disclosed embodiments, including, for instance, principal component analysis (PCA) based margining, in connection with interest rate swap (IRS) portfolios, as described herein.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0076">A message management module <b>116</b> may be included to, among other things, receive, and extract orders from, electronic data transaction request messages. The message management module <b>116</b> may define a point of ingress into the Exchange Computer System <b>100</b> where messages are ordered and considered to be received by the system. This may be considered a point of determinism in the Exchange Computer System <b>100</b> that defines the earliest point where the system can ascribe an order of receipt to arriving messages. The point of determinism may or may not be at or near the demarcation point between the Exchange Computer System <b>100</b> and a public/internet network infrastructure. The message management module <b>116</b> processes messages by interpreting the contents of a message based on the message transmit protocol, such as the transmission control protocol (&#x201c;TCP&#x201d;), to provide the content of the message for further processing by the Exchange Computer System.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0077">The message management module <b>116</b> may also be configured to detect characteristics of an order for a transaction to be undertaken in an electronic marketplace. For example, the message management module <b>116</b> may identify and extract order content such as a price, product, volume, and associated market participant for an order. The message management module <b>116</b> may also identify and extract data indicating an action to be executed by the Exchange Computer System <b>100</b> with respect to the extracted order. For example, the message management module <b>116</b> may determine the transaction type of the transaction requested in a given message. A message may include an instruction to perform a type of transaction. The transaction type may be, in one embodiment, a request/offer/order to either buy or sell a specified quantity or units of a financial instrument at a specified price or value. The message management module <b>116</b> may also identify and extract other order information and other actions associated with the extracted order. All extracted order characteristics, other information, and associated actions extracted from a message for an order may be collectively considered an order as described and referenced herein.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0078">Order or message characteristics may include, for example, the state of the system after a message is received, arrival time (e.g., the time a message arrives at the MSG or Market Segment Gateway), message type (e.g., new, modify, cancel), and the number of matches generated by a message. Order or message characteristics may also include market participant side (e.g., buyer or seller) or time in force (e.g., a good until end of day order that is good for the full trading day, a good until canceled order that rests on the order book until matched, or a fill or kill order that is canceled if not filled immediately, or a fill and kill order (FOK) that is filled to the maximum amount possible, and any remaining or unfilled/unsatisfied quantity is not stored on the books or allowed to rest).</p><p id="p-0083" num="0079">An order processing module <b>118</b> may be included to decompose delta-based, spread instrument, bulk and other types of composite orders for processing by the order book module <b>110</b> and/or the match engine module <b>106</b>. The order processing module <b>118</b> may also be used to implement one or more procedures related to clearing an order. The order may be communicated from the message management module <b>118</b> to the order processing module <b>118</b>. The order processing module <b>118</b> may be configured to interpret the communicated order, and manage the order characteristics, other information, and associated actions as they are processed through an order book module <b>110</b> and eventually transacted on an electronic market. For example, the order processing module <b>118</b> may store the order characteristics and other content and execute the associated actions. In an embodiment, the order processing module may execute an associated action of placing the order into an order book for an electronic trading system managed by the order book module <b>110</b>. In an embodiment, placing an order into an order book and/or into an electronic trading system may be considered a primary action for an order. The order processing module <b>118</b> may be configured in various arrangements, and may be configured as part of the order book module <b>110</b>, part of the message management module <b>118</b>, or as an independent functioning module.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0080">As an intermediary to electronic trading transactions, the exchange bears a certain amount of risk in each transaction that takes place. To that end, the clearing house implements risk management mechanisms to protect the exchange. One or more of the modules of the Exchange Computer System <b>100</b> may be configured to determine settlement prices for constituent contracts, such as deferred month contracts, of spread instruments, such as for example, settlement module. A settlement module (or settlement processor or other payment processor) may be included to provide one or more functions related to settling or otherwise administering transactions cleared by the exchange. Settlement module of the Exchange Computer System <b>100</b> may implement one or more settlement price determination techniques. Settlement-related functions need not be limited to actions or events occurring at the end of a contract term. For instance, in some embodiments, settlement-related functions may include or involve daily or other mark to market settlements for margining purposes. In some cases, the settlement module may be configured to communicate with the trade database <b>108</b> (or the memory(ies) on which the trade database <b>108</b> is stored) and/or to determine a payment amount based on a spot price, the price of the futures contract or other financial instrument, or other price data, at various times. The determination may be made at one or more points in time during the term of the financial instrument in connection with a margining mechanism. For example, the settlement module may be used to determine a mark to market amount on a daily basis during the term of the financial instrument. Such determinations may also be made on a settlement date for the financial instrument for the purposes of final settlement.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0081">In some embodiments, the settlement module may be integrated to any desired extent with one or more of the other modules or processors of the Exchange Computer System <b>100</b>. For example, the settlement module and the risk management module <b>114</b> may be integrated to any desired extent. In some cases, one or more margining procedures or other aspects of the margining mechanism(s) may be implemented by the settlement module.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0082">One or more of the above-described modules of the Exchange Computer System <b>100</b> may be used to gather or obtain data to support the settlement price determination, as well as a subsequent margin requirement determination. For example, the order book module <b>110</b> and/or the market data module <b>112</b> may be used to receive, access, or otherwise obtain market data, such as bid-offer values of orders currently on the order books. The trade database <b>108</b> may be used to receive, access, or otherwise obtain trade data indicative of the prices and volumes of trades that were recently executed in a number of markets. In some cases, transaction data (and/or bid/ask data) may be gathered or obtained from open outcry pits and/or other sources and incorporated into the trade and market data from the electronic trading system(s).</p><p id="p-0087" num="0083">The historical volatility module <b>142</b> is configured to calculate historic volatility values based on prices, for example, prices previously determined by the settlement module or prices stored in the order book module <b>110</b> or distributed by the market data module <b>112</b>.

A computer program does not necessarily correspond to a file in a file system. A program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub programs, or portions of code).

Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a read only memory or a random-access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for performing instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally, a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto optical disks, or optical disks. However, a computer need not have such devices. Moreover, a computer can be embedded in another device, e.g., a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile audio player, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, to name just a few. Computer-readable media suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of non-volatile memory, media and memory devices, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto optical discs; and CD ROM and DVD-ROM discs. The processor and the memory can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, special purpose logic circuitry.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0113">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;microprocessor&#x201d; or &#x201c;general-purpose processor&#x201d; (&#x201c;GPP&#x201d;) may refer to a hardware device that fetches instructions and data from a memory or storage device and executes those instructions (for example, an Intel Xeon processor or an AMD Opteron processor) to then, for example, process the data in accordance therewith. The term &#x201c;reconfigurable logic&#x201d; may refer to any logic technology whose form and function can be significantly altered (i.e., reconfigured) in the field post-manufacture as opposed to a microprocessor, whose function can change post-manufacture, e.g. via computer executable software code, but whose form, e.g. the arrangement/layout and interconnection of logical structures, is fixed at manufacture. The term &#x201c;software&#x201d; may refer to data processing functionality that is deployed on a GPP. The term &#x201c;firmware&#x201d; may refer to data processing functionality that is deployed on reconfigurable logic. One example of a reconfigurable logic is a field programmable gate array (&#x201c;FPGA&#x201d;) which is a reconfigurable integrated circuit. An FPGA may contain programmable logic components called &#x201c;logic blocks&#x201d;, and a hierarchy of reconfigurable interconnects that allow the blocks to be &#x201c;wired together&#x201d;, somewhat like many (changeable) logic gates that can be inter-wired in (many) different configurations. Logic blocks may be configured to perform complex combinatorial functions, or merely simple logic gates like AND, OR, NOT and XOR. An FPGA may further include memory elements, which may be simple flip-flops or more complete blocks of memory.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0114">To provide for interaction with a user, embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented on a device having a display, e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor, for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device, e.g., a mouse or a trackball, by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well. Feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback.

The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network (&#x201c;LAN&#x201d;) and a wide area network (&#x201c;WAN&#x201d;), e.g., the Internet.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0116">The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network.

Further, the messages may comprise one or more data packets, datagrams or other collection of data formatted, arranged configured and/or packaged in a particular one or more protocols, e.g., the FIX protocol, TCP/IP, Ethernet, etc., suitable for transmission via a network as was described, such as the message format and/or protocols described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,831,491 and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005/0096999 A1, both of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties and relied upon. Further, the disclosed message management system may be implemented using an open message standard implementation, such as FIX, FIX Binary, FIX/FAST, or by an exchange-provided API.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0118">The embodiments described herein utilize trade related electronic messages such as mass quote messages, individual order messages, modification messages, cancellation messages, etc., so as to enact trading activity in an electronic market. The trading entity and/or market participant may have one or multiple trading terminals associated with the session. Furthermore, the financial instruments may be financial derivative products. Derivative products may include futures contracts, options on futures contracts, futures contracts that are functions of or related to other futures contracts, swaps, swaptions, or other financial instruments that have their price related to or derived from an underlying product, security, commodity, equity, index, or interest rate product. In one embodiment, the orders are for options contracts that belong to a common option class. Orders may also be for baskets, quadrants, other combinations of financial instruments, etc. The option contracts may have a plurality of strike prices and/or comprise put and call contracts. A mass quote message may be received at an exchange. As used herein, an Exchange Computing System <b>100</b> includes a place or system that receives and/or executes orders.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0119">In an embodiment, a plurality of electronic messages is received from the network. The plurality of electronic messages may be received at a network interface for the electronic trading system. The plurality of electronic messages may be sent from market participants. The plurality of messages may include order characteristics and be associated with actions to be executed with respect to an order that may be extracted from the order characteristics. The action may involve any action as associated with transacting the order in an electronic trading system. The actions may involve placing the orders within a particular market and/or order book of a market in the electronic trading system.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0120">In an embodiment, an incoming transaction may be received. The incoming transaction may be from, and therefore associated with, a market participant of an electronic market managed by an electronic trading system. The transaction may involve an order as extracted from a received message, and may have an associated action. The actions may involve placing an order to buy or sell a financial product in the electronic market, or modifying or deleting such an order. In an embodiment, the financial product may be based on an associated financial instrument which the electronic market is established to trade.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0121">In an embodiment, the action associated with the transaction is determined. For example, it may be determined whether the incoming transaction comprises an order to buy or sell a quantity of the associated financial instrument or an order to modify or cancel an existing order in the electronic market. Orders to buy or sell and orders to modify or cancel may be acted upon differently by the electronic market. For example, data indicative of different characteristics of the types of orders may be stored.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0122">In an embodiment, data relating to the received transaction is stored. The data may be stored in any device, or using any technique, operable to store and provide recovery of data. For example, a memory <b>204</b> or computer-readable medium <b>210</b>, may be used to store data, as is described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> in further detail herein. Data may be stored relating received transactions for a period of time, indefinitely, or for a rolling most recent time period such that the stored data is indicative of the market participant's recent activity in the electronic market.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0123">If and/or when a transaction is determined to be an order to modify or cancel a previously placed, or existing, order, data indicative of these actions may be stored. For example, data indicative of a running count of a number or frequency of the receipt of modify or cancel orders from the market participant may be stored. A number may be a total number of modify or cancel orders received from the market participant, or a number of modify or cancel orders received from the market participant over a specified time. A frequency may be a time-based frequency, as in a number of cancel or modify orders per unit of time, or a number of cancel or modify orders received from the market participant as a percentage of total transactions received from the participant, which may or may not be limited by a specified length of time.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0124">If and/or when a transaction is determined to be an order to buy or sell a financial product, or financial instrument, other indicative data may be stored. For example, data indicative of quantity and associated price of the order to buy or sell may be stored.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0125">Data indicative of attempts to match incoming orders may also be stored. The data may be stored in any device, or using any technique, operable to store and provide recovery of data. For example, a memory <b>204</b> or computer-readable medium <b>210</b>, may be used to store data, as is described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The acts of the process as described herein may also be repeated. As such, data for multiple received transactions for multiple market participants may be stored and used as describe herein.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0126">The order processing module <b>118</b> may also store data indicative of characteristics of the extracted orders. For example, the order processing module may store data indicative of orders having an associated modify or cancel action, such as by recording a count of the number of such orders associated with particular market participants. The order processing module may also store data indicative of quantities and associated prices of orders to buy or sell a product placed in the market order book <b>110</b>, as associated with particular market participants.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0127">Also, the order processing module <b>118</b> may be configured to calculate and associate with particular orders a value indicative of an associated market participant's market activity quality, which is a value indicative of whether the market participant's market activity increases or tends to increase liquidity of a market. This value may be determined based on the price of the particular order, previously stored quantities of orders from the associated market participant, the previously stored data indicative of previously received orders to modify or cancel as associated with the market participant, and previously stored data indicative of a result of the attempt to match previously received orders stored in association with the market participant. The order processing module <b>118</b> may determine or otherwise calculate scores indicative of the quality value based on these stored extracted order characteristics, such as an MQI as described herein.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0128">Further, electronic trading systems may perform actions on orders placed from received messages based on various characteristics of the messages and/or market participants associated with the messages. These actions may include matching the orders either during a continuous auction process, or at the conclusion of a collection period during a batch auction process. The matching of orders may be by any technique.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0129">The matching of orders may occur based on a priority indicated by the characteristics of orders and market participants associated with the orders. Orders having a higher priority may be matched before orders of a lower priority. Such priority may be determined using various techniques. For example, orders that were indicated by messages received earlier may receive a higher priority to match than orders that were indicated by messages received later. Also, scoring or grading of the characteristics may provide for priority determination. Data indicative of order matches may be stored by a match engine and/or an order processing module <b>118</b>, and used for determining MQI scores of market participants.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Example Users</heading><p id="p-0134" num="0130">Generally, a market may involve market makers, such as market participants who consistently provide bids and/or offers at specific prices in a manner typically conducive to balancing risk, and market takers who may be willing to execute transactions at prevailing bids or offers may be characterized by more aggressive actions so as to maintain risk and/or exposure as a speculative investment strategy. From an alternate perspective, a market maker may be considered a market participant who places an order to sell at a price at which there is not a previously or concurrently provided counter order. Similarly, a market taker may be considered a market participant who places an order to buy at a price at which there is a previously or concurrently provided counter order. A balanced and efficient market may involve both market makers and market takers, coexisting in a mutually beneficial basis. The mutual existence, when functioning properly, may facilitate liquidity in the market such that a market may exist with &#x201c;tight&#x201d; bid-ask spreads (e.g., small difference between bid and ask prices) and a &#x201c;deep&#x201d; volume from many currently provided orders such that large quantity orders may be executed without driving prices significantly higher or lower.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0131">As such, both market participant types are useful in generating liquidity in a market, but specific characteristics of market activity taken by market participants may provide an indication of a particular market participant's effect on market liquidity. For example, a Market Quality Index (&#x201c;MQI&#x201d;) of an order may be determined using the characteristics. An MQI may be considered a value indicating a likelihood that a particular order will improve or facilitate liquidity in a market. That is, the value may indicate a likelihood that the order will increase a probability that subsequent requests and transaction from other market participants will be satisfied. As such, an MQI may be determined based on a proximity of the entered price of an order to a midpoint of a current bid-ask price spread, a size of the entered order, a volume or quantity of previously filled orders of the market participant associated with the order, and/or a frequency of modifications to previous orders of the market participant associated with the order. In this way, an electronic trading system may function to assess and/or assign an MQI to received electronic messages to establish messages that have a higher value to the system, and thus the system may use computing resources more efficiently by expending resources to match orders of the higher value messages prior to expending resources of lower value messages.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0132">While an MQI may be applied to any or all market participants, such an index may also be applied only to a subset thereof, such as large market participants, or market participants whose market activity as measured in terms of average daily message traffic over a limited historical time period exceeds a specified number. For example, a market participant generating more than 500, 1,000, or even 10,000 market messages per day may be considered a large market participant.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0133">An exchange provides one or more markets for the purchase and sale of various types of products including financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, futures contracts, options, currency, cash, and other similar instruments. Agricultural products and commodities are also examples of products traded on such exchanges. A futures contract is a product that is a contract for the future delivery of another financial instrument such as a quantity of grains, metals, oils, bonds, currency, or cash. Generally, each exchange establishes a specification for each market provided thereby that defines at least the product traded in the market, minimum quantities that must be traded, and minimum changes in price (e.g., tick size). For some types of products (e.g., futures or options), the specification further defines a quantity of the underlying product represented by one unit (or lot) of the product, and delivery and expiration dates. As will be described, the exchange may further define the matching algorithm, or rules, by which incoming orders will be matched/allocated to resting orders.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">Matching and Transaction Processing</heading><p id="p-0138" num="0134">Market participants, e.g., traders, use software to send orders or messages to the trading platform. The order identifies the product, the quantity of the product the trader wishes to trade, a price at which the trader wishes to trade the product, and a direction of the order (i.e., whether the order is a bid, i.e., an offer to buy, or an ask, i.e., an offer to sell). It will be appreciated that there may be other order types or messages that traders can send including requests to modify or cancel a previously submitted order.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0135">The Exchange Computer System monitors incoming orders received thereby and attempts to identify, i.e., match or allocate, as described herein, one or more previously received, but not yet matched, orders, i.e., limit orders to buy or sell a given quantity at a given price, referred to as &#x201c;resting&#x201d; orders, stored in an order book database, wherein each identified order is contra to the incoming order and has a favorable price relative to the incoming order. An incoming order may be an &#x201c;aggressor&#x201d; order, i.e., a market order to sell a given quantity at whatever may be the current resting bid order price(s) or a market order to buy a given quantity at whatever may be the current resting ask order price(s). An incoming order may be a &#x201c;market making&#x201d; order, i.e., a market order to buy or sell at a price for which there are currently no resting orders. In particular, if the incoming order is a bid, i.e., an offer to buy, then the identified order(s) will be an ask, i.e., an offer to sell, at a price that is identical to or higher than the bid price. Similarly, if the incoming order is an ask, i.e., an offer to sell, the identified order(s) will be a bid, i.e., an offer to buy, at a price that is identical to or lower than the offer price.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0136">An exchange computing system may receive conditional orders or messages for a data object, where the order may include two prices or values: a reference value and a stop value. A conditional order may be configured so that when a product represented by the data object trades at the reference price, the stop order is activated at the stop value. For example, if the exchange computing system's order management module includes a stop order with a stop price of 5 and a limit price of 1 for a product, and a trade at 5 (i.e., the stop price of the stop order) occurs, then the exchange computing system attempts to trade at 1 (i.e., the limit price of the stop order). In other words, a stop order is a conditional order to trade (or execute) at the limit price that is triggered (or elected) when a trade at the stop price occurs.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0137">Stop orders also rest on, or are maintained in, an order book to monitor for a trade at the stop price, which triggers an attempted trade at the limit price. In some embodiments, a triggered limit price for a stop order may be treated as an incoming order.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0138">Upon identification (matching) of a contra order(s), a minimum of the quantities associated with the identified order and the incoming order is matched and that quantity of each of the identified and incoming orders become two halves of a matched trade that is sent to a clearing house. The Exchange Computer System considers each identified order in this manner until either all of the identified orders have been considered or all of the quantity associated with the incoming order has been matched, i.e., the order has been filled. If any quantity of the incoming order remains, an entry may be created in the order book database and information regarding the incoming order is recorded therein, i.e., a resting order is placed on the order book for the remaining quantity to await a subsequent incoming order counter thereto.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0139">It should be appreciated that in electronic trading systems implemented via an exchange computing system, a trade price (or match value) may differ from (i.e., be better for the submitter, e.g., lower than a submitted buy price or higher than a submitted sell price) the limit price that is submitted, e.g., a price included in an incoming message, or a triggered limit price from a stop order.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0140">As used herein, &#x201c;better&#x201d; than a reference value means lower than the reference value if the transaction is a purchase (or acquire) transaction, and higher than the reference value if the transaction is a sell transaction. Said another way, for purchase (or acquire) transactions, lower values are better, and for relinquish or sell transactions, higher values are better.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0141">Traders access the markets on a trading platform using trading software that receives and displays at least a portion of the order book for a market, i.e., at least a portion of the currently resting orders, enables a trader to provide parameters for an order for the product traded in the market, and transmits the order to the Exchange Computer System. The trading software typically includes a graphical user interface to display at least a price and quantity of some of the entries in the order book associated with the market. The number of entries of the order book displayed is generally preconfigured by the trading software, limited by the Exchange Computer System, or customized by the user. Some graphical user interfaces display order books of multiple markets of one or more trading platforms. The trader may be an individual who trades on his/her behalf, a broker trading on behalf of another person or entity, a group, or an entity. Furthermore, the trader may be a system that automatically generates and submits orders.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0142">If the Exchange Computer System identifies that an incoming market order may be filled by a combination of multiple resting orders, e.g., the resting order at the best price only partially fills the incoming order, the Exchange Computer System may allocate the remaining quantity of the incoming order, i.e., that which was not filled by the resting order at the best price, among such identified orders in accordance with prioritization and allocation rules/algorithms, referred to as &#x201c;allocation algorithms&#x201d; or &#x201c;matching algorithms,&#x201d; as, for example, may be defined in the specification of the particular financial product or defined by the exchange for multiple financial products. Similarly, if the Exchange Computer System identifies multiple orders contra to the incoming limit order and that have an identical price which is favorable to the price of the incoming order, i.e., the price is equal to or better, e.g., lower if the incoming order is a buy (or instruction to purchase, or instruction to acquire) or higher if the incoming order is a sell (or instruction to relinquish), than the price of the incoming order, the Exchange Computer System may allocate the quantity of the incoming order among such identified orders in accordance with the matching algorithms as, for example, may be defined in the specification of the particular financial product or defined by the exchange for multiple financial products.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0143">An exchange responds to inputs, such as trader orders, cancellation, etc., in a manner as expected by the market participants, such as based on market data, e.g., prices, available counter-orders, etc., to provide an expected level of certainty that transactions will occur in a consistent and predictable manner and without unknown or unascertainable risks. Accordingly, the method by which incoming orders are matched with resting orders must be defined so that market participants have an expectation of what the result will be when they place an order or have resting orders and an incoming order is received, even if the expected result is, in fact, at least partially unpredictable due to some component of the process being random or arbitrary or due to market participants having imperfect or less than all information, e.g., unknown position of an order in an order book. Typically, the exchange defines the matching/allocation algorithm that will be used for a particular financial product, with or without input from the market participants. Once defined for a particular product, the matching/allocation algorithm is typically not altered, except in limited circumstance, such as to correct errors or improve operation, so as not to disrupt trader expectations. It will be appreciated that different products offered by a particular exchange may use different matching algorithms.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0144">For example, a first-in/first-out (FIFO) matching algorithm, also referred to as a &#x201c;Price Time&#x201d; algorithm, considers each identified order sequentially in accordance with when the identified order was received. The quantity of the incoming order is matched to the quantity of the identified order at the best price received earliest, then quantities of the next earliest best price orders, and so on until the quantity of the incoming order is exhausted. Some product specifications define the use of a pro-rata matching algorithm, wherein a quantity of an incoming order is allocated to each of plurality of identified orders proportionally. Some Exchange Computer Systems provide a priority to certain standing orders in particular markets. An example of such an order is the first order that improves a price (i.e., improves the market) for the product during a trading session. To be given priority, the trading platform may require that the quantity associated with the order is at least a minimum quantity. Further, some Exchange Computer Systems cap the quantity of an incoming order that is allocated to a standing order on the basis of a priority for certain markets. In addition, some Exchange Computer Systems may give a preference to orders submitted by a trader who is designated as a market maker for the product. Other Exchange Computer Systems may use other criteria to determine whether orders submitted by a particular trader are given a preference. Typically, when the Exchange Computer System allocates a quantity of an incoming order to a plurality of identified orders at the same price, the trading host allocates a quantity of the incoming order to any orders that have been given priority. The Exchange Computer System thereafter allocates any remaining quantity of the incoming order to orders submitted by traders designated to have a preference, and then allocates any still remaining quantity of the incoming order using the FIFO or pro-rata algorithms. Pro-rata algorithms used in some markets may require that an allocation provided to a particular order in accordance with the pro-rata algorithm must meet at least a minimum allocation quantity. Any orders that do not meet or exceed the minimum allocation quantity are allocated to on a FIFO basis after the pro-rata allocation (if any quantity of the incoming order remains). More information regarding order allocation may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 7,853,499, the entirety of which is incorporated by reference herein and relied upon. Other examples of matching algorithms which may be defined for allocation of orders of a particular financial product include: Price Explicit Time; Order Level Pro Rata; Order Level Priority Pro Rata; Preference Price Explicit Time; Preference Order Level Pro Rata; Preference Order Level Priority Pro Rata; Threshold Pro-Rata; Priority Threshold Pro-Rata; Preference Threshold Pro-Rata; Priority Preference Threshold Pro-Rata; and Split Price-Time Pro-Rata, which are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/534,499, filed on Jun. 27, 2012, entitled &#x201c;Multiple Trade Matching Algorithms,&#x201d; published as U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2014/0006243 A1, the entirety of which is incorporated by reference herein and relied upon.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0145">With respect to incoming orders, some traders, such as automated and/or algorithmic traders, attempt to respond to market events, such as to capitalize upon a mispriced resting order or other market inefficiency, as quickly as possible. This may result in penalizing the trader who makes an errant trade, or whose underlying trading motivations have changed, and who cannot otherwise modify or cancel their order faster than other traders can submit trades there against. It may be considered that an electronic trading system that rewards the trader who submits their order first creates an incentive to either invest substantial capital in faster trading systems, participate in the market substantially to capitalize on opportunities (aggressor side/lower risk trading) as opposed to creating new opportunities (market making/higher risk trading), modify existing systems to streamline business logic at the cost of trade quality, or reduce one's activities and exposure in the market. The result may be a lesser quality market and/or reduced transaction volume, and corresponding thereto, reduced fees to the exchange.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0146">With respect to resting orders, allocation/matching suitable resting orders to match against an incoming order can be performed, as described herein, in many different ways. Generally, it will be appreciated that allocation/matching algorithms are only needed when the incoming order quantity is less than the total quantity of the suitable resting orders as, only in this situation, is it necessary to decide which resting order(s) will not be fully satisfied, which trader(s) will not get their orders filled. It can be seen from the above descriptions of the matching/allocation algorithms, that they fall generally into three categories: time priority/first-in-first-out (&#x201c;FIFO&#x201d;), pro rata, or a hybrid of FIFO and pro rata.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0147">FIFO generally rewards the first trader to place an order at a particular price and maintains this reward indefinitely. So, if a trader is the first to place an order at price X, no matter how long that order rests and no matter how many orders may follow at the same price, as soon as a suitable incoming order is received, that first trader will be matched first. This &#x201c;first mover&#x201d; system may commit other traders to positions in the queue after the first move traders. Furthermore, while it may be beneficial to give priority to a trader who is first to place an order at a given price because that trader is, in effect, taking a risk, the longer that the trader's order rests, the less beneficial it may be. For instance, it could deter other traders from adding liquidity to the marketplace at that price because they know the first mover (and potentially others) already occupies the front of the queue.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0148">With a pro rata allocation, incoming orders are effectively split among suitable resting orders. This provides a sense of fairness in that everyone may get some of their order filled. However, a trader who took a risk by being first to place an order (a &#x201c;market turning&#x201d; order) at a price may end up having to share an incoming order with a much later submitted order. Furthermore, as a pro rata allocation distributes the incoming order according to a proportion based on the resting order quantities, traders may place orders for large quantities, which they are willing to trade but may not necessarily want to trade, in order to increase the proportion of an incoming order that they will receive. This results in an escalation of quantities on the order book and exposes a trader to a risk that someone may trade against one of these orders and subject the trader to a larger trade than they intended. In the typical case, once an incoming order is allocated against these large resting orders, the traders subsequently cancel the remaining resting quantity which may frustrate other traders. Accordingly, as FIFO and pro rata both have benefits and problems, exchanges may try to use hybrid allocation/matching algorithms which attempt to balance these benefits and problems by combining FIFO and pro rata in some manner. However, hybrid systems define conditions or fixed rules to determine when FIFO should be used and when pro rata should be used. For example, a fixed percentage of an incoming order may be allocated using a FIFO mechanism with the remainder being allocated pro rata.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">Spread Instruments</heading><p id="p-0153" num="0149">Traders trading on an exchange including, for example, Exchange Computer System <b>100</b>, often desire to trade multiple financial instruments in combination. Each component of the combination may be called a leg. Traders can submit orders for individual legs or in some cases can submit a single order for multiple financial instruments in an exchange-defined combination. Such orders may be called a strategy order, a spread order, or a variety of other names.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0150">A spread instrument may involve the simultaneous purchase of one security and sale of a related security, called legs, as a unit. The legs of a spread instrument may be options or futures contracts, or combinations of the two. Trades in spread instruments are executed to yield an overall net position whose value, called the spread, depends on the difference between the prices of the legs. Spread instruments may be traded in an attempt to profit from the widening or narrowing of the spread, rather than from movement in the prices of the legs directly. Spread instruments are either &#x201c;bought&#x201d; or &#x201c;sold&#x201d; depending on whether the trade will profit from the widening or narrowing of the spread, respectively. An exchange often supports trading of common spreads as a unit rather than as individual legs, thus ensuring simultaneous execution of the two legs, eliminating the execution risk of one leg executing but the other failing.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0151">One example of a spread instrument is a calendar spread instrument. The legs of a calendar spread instrument differ in delivery date of the underlier. The leg with the earlier occurring delivery date is often referred to as the lead month contract. A leg with a later occurring delivery date is often referred to as a deferred month contract. Another example of a spread instrument is a butterfly spread instrument, which includes three legs having different delivery dates. The delivery dates of the legs may be equidistant to each other. The counterparty orders that are matched against such a combination order may be individual, &#x201c;outright&#x201d; orders or may be part of other combination orders.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0152">In other words, an exchange may receive, and hold or let rest on the books, outright orders for individual contracts as well as outright orders for spreads associated with the individual contracts. An outright order (for either a contract or for a spread) may include an outright bid or an outright offer, although some outright orders may bundle many bids or offers into one message (often called a mass quote).</p><p id="p-0157" num="0153">A spread is an order for the price difference between two contracts. This results in the trader holding a long and a short position in two or more related futures or options on futures contracts, with the objective of profiting from a change in the price relationship. A typical spread product includes multiple legs, each of which may include one or more underlying financial instruments. A butterfly spread product, for example, may include three legs. The first leg may consist of buying a first contract. The second leg may consist of selling two of a second contract. The third leg may consist of buying a third contract. The price of a butterfly spread product may be calculated as:</p><p id="p-0158" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Butterfly=Leg1&#x2212;2&#xd7;Leg2+Leg3.<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0159" num="0154">In the above equation, Leg1 equals the price of the first contract, Leg2 equals the price of the second contract and Leg3 equals the price of the third contract. Thus, a butterfly spread could be assembled from two inter-delivery spreads in opposite directions with the center delivery month common to both spreads.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0155">A calendar spread, also called an intra-commodity spread, for futures is an order for the simultaneous purchase and sale of the same futures contract in different contract months (i.e., buying a September CME S&#x26;P 500&#xae; futures contract and selling a December CME S&#x26;P 500 futures contract).</p><p id="p-0161" num="0156">A crush spread is an order, usually in the soybean futures market, for the simultaneous purchase of soybean futures and the sale of soybean meal and soybean oil futures to establish a processing margin. A crack spread is an order for a specific spread trade involving simultaneously buying and selling contracts in crude oil and one or more derivative products, typically gasoline and heating oil. Oil refineries may trade a crack spread to hedge the price risk of their operations, while speculators attempt to profit from a change in the oil/gasoline price differential.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0157">A straddle is an order for the purchase or sale of an equal number of puts and calls, with the same strike price and expiration dates. A long straddle is a straddle in which a long position is taken in both a put and a call option. A short straddle is a straddle in which a short position is taken in both a put and a call option. A strangle is an order for the purchase of a put and a call, in which the options have the same expiration and the put strike is lower than the call strike, called a long strangle. A strangle may also be the sale of a put and a call, in which the options have the same expiration and the put strike is lower than the call strike, called a short strangle. A pack is an order for the simultaneous purchase or sale of an equally weighted, consecutive series of four futures contracts, quoted on an average net change basis from the previous day's settlement price. Packs provide a readily available, widely accepted method for executing multiple futures contracts with a single transaction. A bundle is an order for the simultaneous sale or purchase of one each of a series of consecutive futures contracts. Bundles provide a readily available, widely accepted method for executing multiple futures contracts with a single transaction.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">Implication</heading><p id="p-0163" num="0158">Thus, an exchange may match outright orders, such as individual contracts or spread orders (which as discussed herein could include multiple individual contracts). The exchange may also imply orders from outright orders. For example, Exchange Computer System <b>100</b> may derive, identify and/or advertise, publish, display or otherwise make available for trading orders based on outright orders.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0159">As was described above, the financial instruments which are the subject of the orders to trade, may include one or more component financial instruments. While each financial instrument may have its own order book, i.e. market, in which it may be traded, in the case of a financial instrument having more than one component financial instrument, those component financial instruments may further have their own order books in which they may be traded. Accordingly, when an order for a financial instrument is received, it may be matched against a suitable counter order in its own order book or, possibly, against a combination of suitable counter orders in the order books the component financial instruments thereof, or which share a common component financial instrument. For example, an order for a spread contract comprising component financial instruments A and B may be matched against another suitable order for that spread contract. However, it may also be matched against suitable separate counter orders for the A and for the B component financial instruments found in the order books therefore. Similarly, if an order for the A contract is received and suitable match cannot be found in the A order book, it may be possible to match order for A against a combination of a suitable counter order for a spread contract comprising the A and B component financial instruments and a suitable counter order for the B component financial instrument. This is referred to as &#x201c;implication&#x201d; where a given order for a financial instrument may be matched via a combination of suitable counter orders for financial instruments which share common, or otherwise interdependent, component financial instruments. Implication increases the liquidity of the market by providing additional opportunities for orders to be traded. Increasing the number of transactions may further increase the number of transaction fees collected by the electronic trading system.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0160">The order for a particular financial instrument actually received from a market participant, whether it comprises one or more component financial instruments, is referred to as a &#x201c;real&#x201d; or &#x201c;outright&#x201d; order, or simply as an outright. The one or more orders which must be synthesized and submitted into order books other than the order book for the outright order in order to create matches therein, are referred to as &#x201c;implied&#x201d; orders. Upon receipt of an incoming order, the identification or derivation of suitable implied orders which would allow at least a partial trade of the incoming outright order to be executed is referred to as &#x201c;implication&#x201d; or &#x201c;implied matching&#x201d;, the identified orders being referred to as an &#x201c;implied match.&#x201d; Depending on the number of component financial instruments involved, and whether those component financial instruments further comprise component financial instruments of their own, there may be numerous different implied matches identified which would allow the incoming order to be at least partially matched and mechanisms may be provided to arbitrate, e.g., automatically, among them, such as by picking the implied match comprising the least number of component financial instruments or the least number of synthesized orders.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0161">Upon receipt of an incoming order, or thereafter, a combination of one or more suitable/hypothetical counter orders which have not actually been received but if they were received, would allow at least a partial trade of the incoming order to be executed, may be, e.g., automatically, identified or derived and referred to as an &#x201c;implied opportunity.&#x201d; As with implied matches, there may be numerous implied opportunities identified for a given incoming order. Implied opportunities are advertised to the market participants, such as via suitable synthetic orders, e.g. counter to the desired order, being placed on the respective order books to rest (or give the appearance that there is an order resting) and presented via the market data feed, electronically communicated to the market participants, to appear available to trade in order to solicit the desired orders from the market participants. Depending on the number of component financial instruments involved, and whether those component financial instruments further comprise component financial instruments of their own, there may be numerous implied opportunities, the submission of a counter order in response thereto, would allow the incoming order to be at least partially matched.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0162">Implied opportunities, e.g. the advertised synthetic orders, may frequently have better prices than the corresponding real orders in the same contract. This can occur when two or more traders incrementally improve their order prices in the hope of attracting a trade, since combining the small improvements from two or more real orders can result in a big improvement in their combination. In general, advertising implied opportunities at better prices will encourage traders to enter the opposing orders to trade with them. The more implied opportunities that the match engine of an electronic trading system can calculate/derive, the greater this encouragement will be and the more the exchange will benefit from increased transaction volume. However, identifying implied opportunities may be computationally intensive. In a high-performance trading system where low transaction latency is important, it may be important to identify and advertise implied opportunities quickly so as to improve or maintain market participant interest and/or market liquidity.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0163">For example, two different outright orders may be resting on the books or be available to trade or match. The orders may be resting because there are no outright orders that match the resting orders. Thus, each of the orders may wait or rest on the books until an appropriate outright counteroffer comes into the exchange or is placed by a user of the exchange. The orders may be for two different contracts that only differ in delivery dates. It should be appreciated that such orders could be represented as a calendar spread order. Instead of waiting for two appropriate outright orders to be placed that would match the two existing or resting orders, the Exchange Computer System may identify a hypothetical spread order that, if entered into the system as a tradable spread order, would allow the Exchange Computer System to match the two outright orders. The exchange may thus advertise or make available a spread order to users of the exchange system that, if matched with a tradable spread order, would allow the exchange to also match the two resting orders. Thus, the match engine is configured to detect that the two resting orders may be combined into an order in the spread instrument and accordingly creates an implied order.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0164">In other words, the exchange's matching system may imply the counteroffer order by using multiple orders to create the counteroffer order. Examples of spreads include implied IN, implied OUT, 2nd- or multiple-generation, crack spreads, straddle, strangle, butterfly, and pack spreads. Implied IN spread orders are derived from existing outright orders in individual legs. Implied OUT outright orders are derived from a combination of an existing spread order and an existing outright order in one of the individual underlying legs. Implied orders can fill in gaps in the market and allow spreads and outright futures traders to trade in a product where there would otherwise have been little or no available bids and asks.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0165">For example, implied IN spreads may be created from existing outright orders in individual contracts where an outright order in a spread can be matched with other outright orders in the spread or with a combination of orders in the legs of the spread. An implied OUT spread may be created from the combination of an existing outright order in a spread and an existing outright order in one of the individual underlying leg. An implied IN or implied OUT spread may be created when an electronic match system simultaneously works synthetic spread orders in spread markets and synthetic orders in the individual leg markets without the risk to the trader/broker of being double filled or filled on one leg and not on the other leg.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0166">By linking the spread and outright markets, implied spread trading increases market liquidity. For example, a buy in one contract month and an offer in another contract month in the same futures contract can create an implied market in the corresponding calendar spread. An exchange may match an order for a spread product with another order for the spread product. Some existing exchanges attempt to match orders for spread products with multiple orders for legs of the spread products. With such systems, every spread product contract is broken down into a collection of legs and an attempt is made to match orders for the legs.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0167">Implied orders, unlike real orders, are generated by electronic trading systems. In other words, implied orders are computer generated orders derived from real orders. The system creates the &#x201c;derived&#x201d; or &#x201c;implied&#x201d; order and provides the implied order as a market that may be traded against. If a trader trades against this implied order, then the real orders that combined to create the implied order and the resulting market are executed as matched trades. Implied orders generally increase overall market liquidity. The creation of implied orders increases the number of tradable items, which has the potential of attracting additional traders. Exchanges benefit from increased transaction volume. Transaction volume may also increase as the number of matched trade items increases.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0168">Examples of implied spread trading include those disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005/0203826, entitled &#x201c;Implied Spread Trading System,&#x201d; the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein and relied upon.

The settlement price may be determined, for example, through a boundary constraint-based technique based on the market data (e.g., bid-offer data) for the spread instrument, as described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2015/0073962 entitled &#x201c;Boundary Constraint-Based Settlement in Spread Markets&#x201d; (&#x201c;the '962 Publication&#x201d;), the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein and relied upon.
