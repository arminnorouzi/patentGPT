The basic building block of a WLAN conforming to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 family of standards is a Basic Service Set (BSS), which is managed by an AP. Each BSS is identified by a Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID) that is advertised by the AP. An AP periodically broadcasts beacon frames to enable any STAs within wireless range of the AP to establish or maintain a communication link with the WLAN.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To improve data throughput, the AP may communicate with one or more STAs over multiple concurrent communication links. Each of the communication links may be of various bandwidths, for example, by bonding a number of 20 MHz-wide channels together to form 40 MHz-wide channels, 80 MHz-wide channels, or 160 MHz-wide channels. The AP may establish BSSs on any of the different communication links, and therefore it is desirable to improve communication between the AP and the one or more STAs over each of the communication links.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The systems, methods and devices of this disclosure each have several innovative aspects, no single one of which is solely responsible for the desirable attributes disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure can be implemented as a method for wireless communication.

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The following description is directed to certain implementations for the purposes of describing innovative aspects of this disclosure. However, a person having ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that the teachings herein can be applied in a multitude of different ways. The described implementations can be implemented in any device, system, or network that is capable of transmitting and receiving radio frequency (RF) signals according to one or more of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 standards, the IEEE 802.15 standards, the Bluetooth&#xae; standards as defined by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), or the Long Term Evolution (LTE), 3G, 4G or 5G (New Radio (NR)) standards promulgated by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), among others. The described implementations can be implemented in any device, system or network that is capable of transmitting and receiving RF signals according to one or more of the following technologies or techniques: code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), orthogonal FDMA (OFDMA), single-carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA), single-user (SU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), and multi-user (MU) MIMO. The described implementations also can be implemented using other wireless communication protocols or RF signals suitable for use in one or more of a wireless personal area network (WPAN), a wireless local area network (WLAN), a wireless wide area network (WWAN), or an internet of things (IOT) network.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Various implementations relate generally to multi-link (ML) communications, and specifically to establishing an ML communication session between wireless communication devices. Aspects of the present disclosure provide a single ML association context for a plurality of communication links shared between multiple devices that form a multi-link device (MLD). Each MLD may have a unique medium access control (MAC) address, which is also referred to as a MAC service access point (MAC-SAP) endpoint. One example of an MLD device is an AP MLD, which includes multiple APs each capable of communicating on multiple communication links and establishing a BSS on the multiple communication links. Another example of an MLD device is a STA MLD device, which includes multiple STAs capable of communicating with other devices (such as an AP MLD device) on multiple communication links. The STA MLD device may have one medium access control physical layer (MAC-PHY) instance for each of the multiple communication links, and the MAC address of each MAC-PHY instance may be the same or different. Under certain conditions, such as if congestion on a first communication link is above a certain level, the MLD devices may switch from communicating on the first communication link to communicating on a second communication link. By providing a single ML association context that can be shared between the MAC-SAP endpoints of the MLD devices, aspects of the present disclosure allow the MLD devices to dynamically switch their communications between different communication links or groups of communication links without disassociating or re-associating with one another. In some implementations, associating with one another on one communication link allows the MLD devices to use the same association configuration, encryption keys, and other ML communication parameters when communicating on one or more of the other communication links associated with the MLDs.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Some implementations more specifically relate to a first wireless communication device (for example, an AP MLD device) transmitting a first packet on a first communication link (also referred to as a &#x201c;first communication link&#x201d;). The first packet includes discovery information for at least the first communication link and a second communication link (also referred to as a &#x201c;secondary communication link&#x201d;). A second wireless communication device (for example, a STA MLD device) transmits an MLA request to the AP MLD device on the first communication link based at least in part on the discovery information. In some implementations, the AP MLD then transmits a second packet on the first communication link. The second packet includes association information for at least the first communication link and the second communication link. In some implementations, the AP MLD associates with the STA MLD based at least in part on the association information. In some implementations, the associating includes establishing at least one ML communication parameter for communicating with the STA MLD on the first and the second communication links. The at least one ML communication parameter may be the same for each of the first and the second communication links.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some other implementations, the associating includes establishing a common security context between a first MAC-SAP endpoint of the STA MLD and a second MAC-SAP endpoint of the AP MLD. Each of the first and second MAC-SAP endpoints may be used to communicate over both the first and second communication links. The STA MLD and the AP MLD may communicate on the second communication link based on the association on the first communication link without disassociating or re-associating. Some other implementations relate to the AP MLD establishing a common block acknowledgement (BA) session with the STA MLD for at least one traffic identifier (TID).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Particular implementations of the subject matter described in this disclosure can be implemented to realize one or more of the following potential advantages. By using a first communication link to exchange discovery information and one or more of capability information or operating parameter information for other communication links, wireless communication devices that implement various aspects of the present disclosure may allow the wireless communication devices to associate with one another by exchanging communications on a single communication link. The exchanged ML information may also allow the wireless communication devices to quickly switch communications between different communication links, and to dynamically change mappings between TID values and a plurality of communication links. Specifically, a STA MLD may receive, from an AP MLD, a single packet including ML information for all of the links that the MLDs are operating on. Thus, aspects of the present disclosure enable the STA MLD to discover the AP MLD on any link that the AP MLD device has setup a BSS. Additionally, aspects of the present disclosure may allow an AP MLD device and a STA MLD to establish a common BA session with one another for MAC service data units (MSDUs) corresponding to one or more TIDs, and to affiliate (or &#x201c;map&#x201d;) each of the one or more TIDs with a corresponding group of communication links. The common BA session established between the AP MLD and the STA MLD, in conjunction with mappings between each TID and a corresponding group of communication links, may allow the AP MLD and the STA MLD MLDs to remap each TID of the one or more TIDs to another group of communication links without tearing-down the common BA session or establishing a new BA session.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a block diagram of an example wireless communication network <b>100</b>. According to some aspects, the wireless communication network <b>100</b> can be an example of a wireless local area network (WLAN) such as a Wi-Fi network (and will hereinafter be referred to as WLAN <b>100</b>). For example, the WLAN <b>100</b> can be a network implementing at least one of the IEEE 802.11 family of standards (such as that defined by the IEEE 802.11-2016 specification or amendments thereof including, but not limited to, 802.11ah, 802.11ad, 802.11ay, 802.11ax, 802.11az, 802.11ba, and 802.11be). The WLAN <b>100</b> may include numerous wireless communication devices such as an access point (AP) <b>102</b> and multiple stations (STAs) <b>104</b>. While only one AP <b>102</b> is shown, the WLAN network <b>100</b> also can include multiple APs <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Each of the STAs <b>104</b> also may be referred to as a mobile station (MS), a mobile device, a mobile handset, a wireless handset, an access terminal (AT), a user equipment (UE), a subscriber station (SS), or a subscriber unit, among other possibilities. The STAs <b>104</b> may represent various devices such as mobile phones, personal digital assistant (PDAs), other handheld devices, netbooks, notebook computers, tablet computers, laptops, display devices (for example, TVs, computer monitors, navigation systems, among others), music or other audio or stereo devices, remote control devices (&#x201c;remotes&#x201d;), printers, kitchen or other household appliances, key fobs (for example, for passive keyless entry and start (PKES) systems), among other possibilities.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">A single AP <b>102</b> and an associated set of STAs <b>104</b> may be referred to as a basic service set (BSS), which is managed by the respective AP <b>102</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> additionally shows an example coverage area <b>106</b> of the AP <b>102</b>, which may represent a basic service area (BSA) of the WLAN <b>100</b>. The BSS may be identified to users by a service set identifier (SSID), as well as to other devices by a basic service set identifier (BSSID), which may be a medium access control (MAC) address of the AP <b>102</b>. The AP <b>102</b> periodically broadcasts beacon frames (&#x201c;beacons&#x201d;) including the BSSID to enable any STAs <b>104</b> within wireless range of the AP <b>102</b> to &#x201c;associate&#x201d; or re-associate with the AP <b>102</b> to establish a respective communication link <b>108</b> (hereinafter also referred to as a &#x201c;Wi-Fi link&#x201d;), or to maintain a communication link <b>108</b>, with the AP <b>102</b>. For example, the beacons can include an identification of a primary channel used by the respective AP <b>102</b> as well as a timing synchronization function for establishing or maintaining timing synchronization with the AP <b>102</b>. The AP <b>102</b> may provide access to external networks to various STAs <b>104</b> in the WLAN via respective communication links <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">To establish a communication link <b>108</b> with an AP <b>102</b>, each of the STAs <b>104</b> is configured to perform passive or active scanning operations (&#x201c;scans&#x201d;) on frequency channels in one or more frequency bands (for example, the 2.4 GHz, 5.0 GHz, 6.0 GHz, or 60 GHz bands). To perform passive scanning, a STA <b>104</b> listens for beacons, which are transmitted by respective APs <b>102</b> at a periodic time interval referred to as the target beacon transmission time (TBTT) (measured in time units (TUs) where one TU may be equal to 1024 microseconds (&#x3bc;s)). To perform active scanning, a STA <b>104</b> generates and sequentially transmits probe requests on each channel to be scanned and listens for probe responses from APs <b>102</b>. Each STA <b>104</b> may be configured to identify or select an AP <b>102</b> with which to associate based on discovery information obtained through the passive or active scans, and to perform authentication and association operations to establish a communication link <b>108</b> with the selected AP <b>102</b>. After authentication, the AP <b>102</b> may assign an association identifier (AID) to each associated STA <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">As a result of the increasing ubiquity of wireless networks, a STA <b>104</b> may have the opportunity to select one of many BSSs within range of the STA or to select among multiple APs <b>102</b> that together form an extended service set (ESS) including multiple connected BSSs. An extended network station associated with the WLAN <b>100</b> may be connected to a wired or wireless distribution system that may allow multiple APs <b>102</b> to be connected in such an ESS. As such, a STA <b>104</b> can be covered by more than one AP <b>102</b> and can associate with different APs <b>102</b> at different times for different transmissions. Additionally, after association with an AP <b>102</b>, a STA <b>104</b> also may be configured to periodically scan its surroundings to find a more suitable AP <b>102</b> with which to associate. For example, a STA <b>104</b> that is moving relative to its associated AP <b>102</b> may perform a &#x201c;roaming&#x201d; scan to find another AP <b>102</b> having more desirable network characteristics such as a greater received signal strength indicator (RSSI) or a reduced traffic load.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some cases, STAs <b>104</b> may form networks without APs <b>102</b> or other equipment other than the STAs <b>104</b> themselves. One example of such a network is an ad hoc network (or wireless ad hoc network). Ad hoc networks may alternatively be referred to as mesh networks or peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. In some cases, ad hoc networks may be implemented within a larger wireless network such as the WLAN <b>100</b>. In such implementations, while the STAs <b>104</b> may be capable of communicating with each other through the AP <b>102</b> using communication links <b>108</b>, STAs <b>104</b> also can communicate directly with each other via direct wireless links <b>110</b>. Additionally, two STAs <b>104</b> may communicate via a direct communication link <b>110</b> regardless of whether both STAs <b>104</b> are associated with and served by the same AP <b>102</b>. In such an ad hoc system, one or more of the STAs <b>104</b> may assume the role filled by the AP <b>102</b> in a BSS. Such a STA <b>104</b> may be referred to as a group owner (GO) and may coordinate transmissions within the ad hoc network. Examples of direct wireless links <b>110</b> include Wi-Fi Direct connections, connections established by using a Wi-Fi Tunneled Direct Link Setup (TDLS) link, and other P2P group connections.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The APs <b>102</b> and STAs <b>104</b> may function and communicate (via the respective communication links <b>108</b>) according to the IEEE 802.11 family of standards (such as that defined by the IEEE 802.11-2016 specification or amendments thereof including, but not limited to, 802.11ah, 802.11ad, 802.11ay, 802.11ax, 802.11az, 802.11ba, and 802.11be). These standards define the WLAN radio and baseband protocols for the PHY and medium access control (MAC) layers. The APs <b>102</b> and STAs <b>104</b> transmit and receive wireless communications (hereinafter also referred to as &#x201c;Wi-Fi communications&#x201d;) to and from one another in the form of physical layer convergence protocol (PLCP) protocol data units (PPDUs). The APs <b>102</b> and STAs <b>104</b> in the WLAN <b>100</b> may transmit PPDUs over an unlicensed spectrum, which may be a portion of spectrum that includes frequency bands traditionally used by Wi-Fi technology, such as the 2.4 GHz band, the 5.0 GHz band, the 60 GHz band, the 3.6 GHz band, and the 900 MHz band. Some implementations of the APs <b>102</b> and STAs <b>104</b> described herein also may communicate in other frequency bands, such as the 6.0 GHz band, which may support both licensed and unlicensed communications. The APs <b>102</b> and STAs <b>104</b> also can be configured to communicate over other frequency bands such as shared licensed frequency bands, where multiple operators may have a license to operate in the same or overlapping frequency band or bands.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Each of the frequency bands may include multiple sub-bands or frequency channels. For example, PPDUs conforming to the IEEE 802.11n, 802.11ac, and 802.11ax standard amendments may be transmitted over the 2.4 and 5.0 GHz bands, each of which is divided into multiple 20 MHz channels. As such, these PPDUs are transmitted over a physical channel having a minimum bandwidth of 20 MHz, but larger channels can be formed through channel bonding. For example, PPDUs may be transmitted over physical channels having bandwidths of 40 MHz, 80 MHz, 160, or 320 MHz by bonding together multiple 20 MHz channels.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Each PPDU is a composite structure that includes a PHY preamble and a payload in the form of a PLCP service data unit (PSDU). The information provided in the preamble may be used by a receiving device to decode the subsequent data in the PSDU. In instances in which PPDUs are transmitted over a bonded channel, the preamble fields may be duplicated and transmitted in each of the multiple component channels. The PHY preamble may include both a legacy portion (or &#x201c;legacy preamble&#x201d;) and a non-legacy portion (or &#x201c;non-legacy preamble&#x201d;). The legacy preamble may be used for packet detection, automatic gain control and channel estimation, among other uses. The legacy preamble also may generally be used to maintain compatibility with legacy devices. The format of, coding of, and information provided in the non-legacy portion of the preamble is based on the particular IEEE 802.11 protocol to be used to transmit the payload.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows an example protocol data unit (PDU) <b>200</b> usable for communications between an AP and a number of STAs. For example, the PDU <b>200</b> can be configured as a PPDU. As shown, the PDU <b>200</b> includes a PHY preamble <b>202</b> and a PHY payload <b>204</b>. For example, the PHY preamble <b>202</b> may include a legacy portion that itself includes a legacy short training field (L-STF) <b>206</b>, a legacy long training field (L-LTF) <b>208</b>, and a legacy signaling field (L-SIG) <b>210</b>. The PHY preamble <b>202</b> may also include a non-legacy portion (not shown). The L-STF <b>206</b> generally enables a receiving device to perform automatic gain control (AGC) and coarse timing and frequency estimation. The L-LTF <b>208</b> generally enables a receiving device to perform fine timing and frequency estimation and also to estimate the wireless channel. The L-SIG <b>210</b> generally enables a receiving device to determine a duration of the PDU and use the determined duration to avoid transmitting on top of the PDU. For example, the L-STF <b>206</b>, the L-LTF <b>208</b>, and the L-SIG <b>210</b> may be modulated according to a binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation scheme. The payload <b>204</b> may be modulated according to a BPSK modulation scheme, a quadrature BPSK (Q-BPSK) modulation scheme, a quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) modulation scheme, or another appropriate modulation scheme. The payload <b>204</b> may generally carry higher layer data, for example, in the form of medium access control (MAC) protocol data units (MPDUs) or aggregated MPDUs (A-MPDUs).</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> shows an example L-SIG field <b>210</b> in the PDU of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. The L-SIG <b>210</b> includes a data rate field <b>212</b>, a reserved bit <b>214</b>, a length field <b>216</b>, a parity bit <b>218</b>, and a tail field <b>220</b>. The data rate field <b>212</b> indicates a data rate (note that the data rate indicated in the data rate field <b>212</b> may not be the actual data rate of the data carried in the payload <b>204</b>). The length field <b>216</b> indicates a length of the packet in units of, for example, bytes. The parity bit <b>218</b> is used to detect bit errors. The tail field <b>220</b> includes tail bits that are used by the receiving device to terminate operation of a decoder (for example, a Viterbi decoder). The receiving device utilizes the data rate and the length indicated in the data rate field <b>212</b> and the length field <b>216</b> to determine a duration of the packet in units of, for example, microseconds (&#x3bc;s). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> shows another example PDU <b>300</b> usable for wireless communication between an AP and one or more STAs. The PDU <b>300</b> may be used for SU, OFDMA or MU-MIMO transmissions. The PDU <b>300</b> may be formatted as a High Efficiency (HE) WLAN PPDU in accordance with the IEEE 802.11ax amendment to the IEEE 802.11 wireless communication protocol standard. The PDU <b>300</b> includes a PHY preamble including a legacy portion <b>302</b> and a non-legacy portion <b>304</b>. The PDU <b>300</b> may further include a PHY payload <b>306</b> after the preamble, for example, in the form of a PSDU including a data field <b>324</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The legacy portion <b>302</b> of the preamble includes an L-STF <b>308</b>, an L-LTF <b>310</b>, and an L-SIG <b>312</b>. The non-legacy portion <b>304</b> includes a repetition of L-SIG (RL-SIG) <b>314</b>, a first HE signal field (HE-SIG-A) <b>316</b>, an HE short training field (HE-STF) <b>320</b>, and one or more HE long training fields (or symbols) (HE-LTFs) <b>322</b>. For OFDMA or MU-MIMO communications, the second portion <b>304</b> further includes a second HE signal field (HE-SIG-B) <b>318</b> encoded separately from HE-SIG-A <b>316</b>. Like the L-STF <b>308</b>, L-LTF <b>310</b>, and L-SIG <b>312</b>, the information in RL-SIG <b>314</b> and HE-SIG-A <b>316</b> may be duplicated and transmitted in each of the component 20 MHz channels in instances involving the use of a bonded channel. In contrast, the content in HE-SIG-B <b>318</b> may be unique to each 20 MHz channel and target specific STAs <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">RL-SIG <b>314</b> may indicate to HE-compatible STAs <b>104</b> that the PDU <b>300</b> is an HE PPDU. An AP <b>102</b> may use HE-SIG-A <b>316</b> to identify and inform multiple STAs <b>104</b> that the AP has scheduled UL or DL resources for them. For example, HE-SIG-A <b>316</b> may include a resource allocation subfield that indicates resource allocations for the identified STAs <b>104</b>. HE-SIG-A <b>316</b> may be decoded by each HE-compatible STA <b>104</b> served by the AP <b>102</b>.

Thus, the common BA session may map TID=4 to the first communication link and the second communication link and not the third communication link.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">In some instances, conditions for one or more of the communication links may change. For example, interference on the second communication link may increase, and interference on the third communication link may decrease such that the third communication link offers higher throughput or lower latencies than the second communication link. Thus, in this example, the first device D<b>1</b> may transmit a single signal (such as the third packet <b>923</b>) to dynamically remap TID=4 to the first communication link and the third communication link. For example, the third packet <b>923</b> may change the anchor bit for the second communication link from logic high to logic low, and may change the anchor bit for the third communication link from logic low to logic high. Since the second device D<b>2</b> has already received information about each of the communication links and setup the common BA session with the first device D<b>1</b>, the second device D<b>2</b> may dynamically switch from communicating over the first and the second communication links for TID=4 to communicating over the first and the third communication links for TID=4 without disassociating from the first device D<b>1</b>, re-associating with the first device D<b>1</b>, or exchanging additional information with the first device D<b>1</b>, thereby saving time, conserving device resources, and reducing overhead on the communication links (such as compared with conventional mechanisms for which wireless communication devices disassociate and/or re-associate with one another when changing mappings between the TIDs and the communication links).</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">In addition, or in the alternative, the first device D<b>1</b> may dynamically map one or more other TIDs to any subset of the communication links using the third packet <b>923</b>. As a non-limiting example, the third packet <b>923</b> may dynamically map TID=2 to the third communication link, TID=5 to the first communication link and the second communication link, TID=3 to a fourth communication link, and TID=6 to all of the first, the second, the third, and the fourth communication links. In addition, or in the alternative, a wireless communication device may indicate to the first device D<b>1</b> that the wireless communication device is capable of operating on a single link, even though multiple link are active and available. For example, the second device D<b>2</b> may have one antenna and thus be capable of operating on a single link. In this example, the first device D<b>1</b> may dynamically map TIDs to a single communication link for communications with the second device D<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows an example frame <b>1000</b> including a Link Attribute Element <b>1010</b> and a Multiple Link Attribute Element <b>1020</b> usable for communications between wireless communication devices.

In some aspects, a particular TID (such as for voice) may be indicated as always mapped to a particular link. In some other aspects, a particular communication type (such as HT) of TID may be mapped to a particular link, such that only the particular link may be used for the particular communication type of TID. In another example, a particular TID (such as low-latency voice) may be mapped to all links, such that the corresponding packets for the particular TID may be transmitted on any available link.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">In some implementations, in a packet-level aggregation MLO system, a first MAC-SAP endpoint and a second MAC-SAP endpoint may each be capable of supporting multiple links, and MLDs may aggregate data over the pair of MAC-SAP endpoints.
