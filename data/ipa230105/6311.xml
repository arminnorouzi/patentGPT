In recent years, as a large-size and high-capacity power supply for vehicles, a lithium-ion secondary battery high in energy density has been developed for adoption. In development of a lithium-ion secondary battery for vehicles, achievement of a large-size and high-capacity battery is required in addition to achievement of a long-life battery and achievement of an improvement in safety.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There is a battery, such as a lithium-ion secondary battery, in which an electrode group including a positive electrode and a negative electrode is housed in the inner cavity of a container.

Then, a lid member is attached to the surrounding wall of the container, so that the opening of the inner cavity is covered with the lid member. In the battery, an electrode terminal is attached to the outer surface of the lid member, and a current collecting tab protrudes outward from the electrode group in the inner cavity. Then, the current collecting tab is electrically connected to the electrode terminal through a connecting lead (lead).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Regarding such a battery as described above, for example, in response to vibration of machinery equipped with the battery, the connecting lead receives, for example, an impact from outside. Thus, the connecting lead is required to have a high impact resistance against an impact or the like. The connecting lead forms a current path between the electrode group and the electrode terminal. Thus, the connecting lead is required to have a low electric resistance.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic perspective view of a battery according to a first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic exploded perspective view of the battery according to the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of the configuration of a connecting lead according to the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic sectional view of the joint portion of the connecting lead according to the first embodiment to a current collecting tab and the vicinity thereof.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an explanatory schematic view of an exemplary method of manufacturing the connecting lead according to the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a perspective view of the configuration of a connecting lead according to a modification.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to one embodiment, a connecting lead establishing a connection between a current collecting tab of an electrode group and an electrode terminal in a battery is provided.

Then, the connecting leads <b>20</b> each have the corresponding one of the electrode terminals <b>16</b>, connected thereto, for example, by swaging fixation at the through hole <b>33</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the inner cavity <b>8</b> of the battery <b>1</b>, the leg portion <b>32</b> of each of the connecting leads <b>20</b> in pairs is disposed between the corresponding one of the side walls <b>11</b> and the electrode group <b>2</b> in the lateral direction of the battery <b>1</b>. In each of the connecting leads <b>20</b>, the width direction of the leg portion <b>32</b> is identical to or substantially identical to the depth direction of the battery <b>1</b>, and the thickness direction of the leg portion <b>32</b> (cross direction of the connecting lead <b>20</b>) is identical to or substantially identical to the lateral direction of the battery <b>1</b>. In each of the connecting leads <b>20</b>, the leg portion <b>32</b> is disposed outside the through hole <b>33</b>, namely, outside the connecting position with the corresponding one of the electrode terminals <b>16</b>, in the lateral direction of the battery <b>1</b>. Therefore, the top plate portion <b>31</b> of each of the connecting leads <b>20</b> extends outward in the lateral direction of the battery <b>1</b> from the corresponding one of the electrode terminals <b>16</b> to the connecting position (extension end E<b>2</b>) with the leg portion <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In each of the connecting leads <b>20</b>, the leg portion <b>32</b> is bent with respect to the top plate portion <b>31</b> toward the side on which the bottom wall <b>6</b> is located in the height direction of the battery <b>1</b>. The bend line of the leg portion <b>32</b> to the top plate portion <b>31</b> is along the depth direction of the battery <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In each of the connecting leads <b>20</b>, the extension portion <b>36</b> of the leg portion <b>32</b> has the corresponding one of the current collecting tabs <b>13</b>B and <b>14</b>B, connected thereto. That is, in each of the connecting leads <b>20</b>, the extension portion <b>36</b> has a junction <b>50</b> with the corresponding one of the current collecting tabs <b>13</b>B and <b>14</b>B. In the present embodiment, the extension portion <b>36</b> of each of the connecting leads <b>20</b> has the junction <b>50</b> on the side face <b>43</b>. In each of the connecting leads <b>20</b>, the side face <b>43</b> of the extension portion <b>36</b> is opposed to the corresponding one of the current collecting tabs <b>13</b>B and <b>14</b>B, from one side in the depth direction of the battery <b>1</b>. In the present embodiment, the current collecting tabs <b>13</b>B and <b>14</b>B are each connected to the side face <b>43</b> through the backup lead <b>22</b>. That is, the current collecting tabs <b>13</b>B and <b>14</b>B are each joined to the side face <b>43</b> with the sheaf portion <b>15</b> pinched by the backup lead <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In each of the connecting leads <b>20</b> according to the present embodiment, the leg portion <b>32</b> is bent with respect to the top plate portion <b>31</b>, with the bend line at the bend position to the top plate portion <b>31</b> along the width direction of the top plate portion <b>31</b>. Then, the width direction of the leg portion <b>32</b> is identical to or substantially identical to the width direction of the top plate portion <b>31</b>. Thus, for example, unlike a structure in which the leg portion is bent with respect to the top plate portion <b>31</b> with its bend line along the extending direction (longitudinal direction) of the top plate portion <b>31</b>, the top plate portion <b>31</b> requires no cutout at the connecting position with the leg portion <b>32</b> and in the vicinity thereof. Thus, the top plate portion <b>31</b> has a large cross-sectional area at the portion to which the leg portion <b>32</b> is connected and in the vicinity thereof, namely, at the extension end E<b>2</b> and in the vicinity thereof. Since the top plate portion <b>31</b> has such a large cross-sectional area as described above, the connecting lead <b>20</b> has a low electric resistance. Thus, the current path between each of the current collecting tabs <b>13</b>B and <b>14</b>B and the corresponding one of the electrode terminals <b>16</b> has a low electric resistance.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In each of the connecting leads <b>20</b> according to the present embodiment, as described above, the bend line of the leg portion <b>32</b> to the top plate portion <b>31</b> is along the width direction of the top plate portion <b>31</b>. Then, in each of the connecting leads <b>20</b> disposed in the inner cavity <b>8</b>, the bend line of the leg portion <b>32</b> to the top plate portion <b>31</b> is along the depth direction of the battery <b>1</b>. Thus, even when the electrode group <b>2</b> vibrates in the depth direction of the battery <b>1</b> (thickness direction of the electrode group <b>2</b>), for example, due to vibration of machinery equipped with the battery, such as a vehicle, the bend line of the leg portion <b>32</b> to the top plate portion <b>31</b> is parallel to or substantially parallel to the vibration direction of the electrode group <b>2</b>. Thus, even when the electrode group <b>2</b> vibrates, the connecting leads <b>20</b> are each unlikely to be damaged. Therefore, the connecting leads <b>20</b> each have a high impact resistance against an impact or the like.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the present embodiment, the leg portion <b>32</b> includes the extension portion <b>36</b> provided apart from the bend position to the top plate portion <b>31</b>. Then, in each of the connecting leads <b>20</b>, the side face <b>43</b>, which faces one side in the width direction of the top plate portion <b>31</b> on the outer surface of the extension portion <b>36</b>, has the corresponding one of the current collecting tabs <b>13</b>B and <b>14</b>B connected thereto. Thus, even with the leg portion <b>32</b> bent with respect to the top plate portion <b>31</b> as described above, the workability of joining, to the leg portion <b>32</b> of each of the connecting leads <b>20</b>, the corresponding one of the current collecting tabs <b>13</b>B and <b>14</b>B is secured.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In each of the connecting leads <b>20</b>, the side face <b>43</b> is joined to the corresponding one of the current collecting tabs <b>13</b>B and <b>14</b>B. Thus, for example, in a case where the electrode group <b>2</b> vibrates in the depth direction of the battery <b>1</b> (thickness direction of the electrode group <b>2</b>), the direction of force acting from the electrode group <b>2</b> to the connecting leads <b>20</b> is identical to or substantially identical to the depth direction of the battery <b>1</b>. Thus, the force from the electrode group <b>2</b> to each of the connecting leads <b>20</b> acts in the direction along the bend line of the leg portion <b>32</b> to the top plate portion <b>31</b>. Thus, a further improvement is made in the impact resistance of each of the connecting leads <b>20</b> against acting force from the electrode group <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the present embodiment, the dimension W<b>2</b> of the leg portion <b>32</b> in the width direction in the extension portion <b>36</b> is smaller than the dimension W<b>1</b> of the leg portion <b>32</b> in the width direction at the connecting position with the top plate portion <b>31</b>. Due to the smaller dimension W<b>2</b> of the leg portion <b>32</b> in the width direction in the extension portion <b>36</b>, to the leg portion <b>32</b> of each of the connecting leads <b>20</b>, the corresponding one of the current collecting tabs <b>13</b>B and <b>14</b>B is joined more easily.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the present embodiment, the dimension T<b>2</b> of the leg portion <b>32</b> in the thickness direction in the extension portion <b>36</b> is larger than the dimension T<b>1</b> of the leg portion <b>32</b> in the thickness direction at the connecting position with the top plate portion <b>31</b>. Due to the larger dimension T<b>2</b> of the leg portion <b>32</b> in the thickness direction in the extension portion <b>36</b>, the side face <b>43</b>, which is joined to the corresponding one of the current collecting tabs <b>13</b>B and <b>14</b>B in each of the connecting leads <b>20</b>, has a large surface area. Thus, the junction <b>50</b> between each of the connecting leads <b>20</b> and the corresponding one of the current collecting tabs <b>13</b>B and <b>14</b>B has a large contact area. Therefore, the current path between each of the current collecting tabs <b>13</b>B and <b>14</b>B and the corresponding one of the electrode terminals <b>16</b> has a lower electric resistance, appropriately.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the present embodiment, in the profile varying portion <b>37</b>, along with approach to the extension portion <b>36</b>, the dimension of the leg portion <b>32</b> in the width direction reduces gradually. Therefore, the dimension of the leg portion <b>32</b> in the width direction does not reduces suddenly from the dimension W<b>1</b> to the dimension W<b>2</b>. Thus, the current path between each of the current collecting tabs <b>13</b>B and <b>14</b>B and the corresponding one of the electrode terminals <b>16</b> has a lower electric resistance, appropriately.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Modifications</heading><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Note that, in a modification illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, throughout a connecting lead <b>20</b>, the dimension (thickness) in the thickness direction is a dimension T<b>1</b> and uniform or substantially uniform.

The relay side face (first relay side face) <b>53</b> faces the side that a side face <b>43</b> faces in the width direction of the leg portion <b>32</b>. The relay side face (second relay side face) <b>54</b> is adjacent to a side face <b>44</b>, on the side on which the top plate portion <b>31</b> is located. The relay side face <b>54</b> faces the side opposite to the side that the relay side face <b>53</b> faces in the width direction of the leg portion <b>32</b>.

Due to the step face <b>51</b>, a step is formed between the relay side face <b>53</b> and the side face <b>43</b>. Due to the step based on the step face <b>51</b>, the side face <b>43</b> is disposed closer to the side on which the relay side face <b>54</b> and the side face <b>44</b> are located than the relay side face <b>53</b> is, in the width direction of the leg portion <b>32</b>.
