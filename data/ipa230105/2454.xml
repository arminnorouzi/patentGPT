To this end the invention focuses on facilitating or increasing the production and/or accumulation of a Myb41-type transcription factor (Myb41), fragment or homolog thereof in a plant, plant part and/or plant cell compared to corresponding wild type plants, wild type plant parts and/or wild type plant cells. The invention also relates to plants, plant parts, and/or plant cells having an increased resistance against fungal pathogens and to material and methods to create or use such plants plant parts or to produce products therefrom.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The cultivation of agricultural crop plants serves mainly for the production of foodstuffs for humans and animals. Monocultures in particular, which are routine nowadays, are highly susceptible to an epidemic-like spread of diseases. The result is markedly reduced yields. To date, the pathogenic organisms have been controlled mainly by using pesticides. Nowadays, the possibility of directly modifying the genetic disposition of a plant or pathogen is also open to man. Alternatively, natural occurring fungicides produced by the plants after fungal infection can be synthesized and applied to the plants. Resistance generally describes the ability of a plant to prevent, or at least curtail the infestation and colonization by a harmful pathogen. Different mechanisms can be discerned in the naturally occurring resistance, with which the plants fend off colonization by phytopathogenic organisms (Schopfer and Brennicke (1999) Pflanzenphysiologie, Springer Verlag, Berlin-Heidelberg, Germany).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">With regard to the race specific resistance, also called host resistance, a differentiation is made between compatible and incompatible interactions. In the compatible interaction, an interaction occurs between a virulent pathogen and a susceptible plant. The pathogen survives, and may build up reproduction structures, while the host is seriously hampered in development or dies off. An incompatible interaction occurs on the other hand when the pathogen infects the plant but is inhibited in its growth before or after weak development of symptoms (mostly by the presence of R genes of the NBS-LRR family, see below). In the latter case, the plant is resistant to the respective pathogen (Schopfer and Brennicke, vide supra). However, this type of resistance is mostly specific for a certain strain or pathogen.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In both compatible and incompatible interactions a defensive and specific reaction of the host to the pathogen occurs. In nature, however, this resistance is often overcome because of the rapid evolutionary development of new virulent races of the pathogens (Neu et al. (2003) American Cytopathol. Society, MPMI 16 No. 7: 626-633).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Most pathogens are plant-species specific. This means that a pathogen can induce a disease in a certain plant species, but not in other plant species (Heath (2002) Can. J. Plant Pathol. 24: 259-264). The resistance against a pathogen in certain plant species is called non-host resistance. The non-host resistance offers strong, broad, and permanent protection from phytopathogens. Genes providing non-host resistance provide the opportunity of a strong, broad and permanent protection against certain diseases in non-host plants. In particular, such a resistance works for different strains of the pathogen.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Fungi are distributed worldwide. Approximately 100 000 different fungal species are known to date. Thereof rusts are of great importance. They can have a complicated development cycle with up to five different spore stages (spermatium, aecidiospore, uredospore, teleutospore and basidiospore).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">During the infection of plants by pathogenic fungi, different phases are usually observed. The first phases of the interaction between phytopathogenic fungi and their potential host plants are decisive for the colonization of the plant by the fungus. During the first stage of the infection, the spores become attached to the surface of the plants, germinate, and the fungus penetrates the plant. Fungi may penetrate the plant via existing ports such as stomata, lenticels, hydatodes and wounds, or else they penetrate the plant epidermis directly as the result of the mechanical force and with the aid of cell-wall-digesting enzymes. Specific infection structures are developed for penetration of the plant. To counteract plants have developed physical barriers, such as wax layers, and chemical compounds having antifungal effects to inhibit spore germination, hyphal growth or penetration.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The soybean rust fungus <i>Phakopsora pachyrhizi </i>directly penetrates through the cuticule and the plant epidermis. After crossing the epidermal cell, the fungus reaches the intercellular space of the mesophyll, where the fungus starts to spread through the leaves. To acquire nutrients the fungus penetrates mesophyll cells and develops haustoria inside the mesophyll cell. During the penetration process the plasma membrane of the penetrated mesophyll cell stays intact.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The initial step of pathogenesis of Asian soybean rust disease is the initial penetration of the fungus through the plant cuticule into the epidermal cell. The plant cuticle is an extracellular hydrophobic layer that covers the aerial epidermis and that consists of two major components, the polymer cutin and cuticular waxes (for review about plant cuticle see Yeats T H, Rose J K. The formation and function of plant cuticles. Plant Physiol. 2013; 163(1):5-20). The cuticle provides protection against desiccation, external environmental stresses and pathogens. For example it has been shown that lower cutin amounts in tomato &#x201c;cd&#x201d; mutants are associated with increased susceptibility to <i>Botrytis cinerea </i>(Isaacson et al., 2009). To facilitate penetration through the cuticle many fungal pathogens secrete enzymes to degrade or weaken the cuticle, such as e.g. cutinases, a class of small, nonspecific esterases that hydrolyze the cutin polymer.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition to cutin also the epicuticular waxes play an important role in pathogen development and defense. For example it has been shown that the &#x201c;inhibitor of rust tube germination1&#x201d; (irg1) mutant of <i>M. truncatula </i>showed less epicuticular wax crystals on the abaxial leaf surface and a strong decrease in wax primary alcohol groups. This surface alteration led to an increased resistance against the fungal pathogens <i>Phakopsora pachyrhizi, Puccinia emaculata </i>and the anthracnose fungus <i>C. trifolii </i>(Uppalapati et al., 2012). The authors found that IRG1 codes for a Cys(2)His(2) zinc finger transcription factor also called PALM1.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Biotrophic phytopathogenic fungi depend for their nutrition on the metabolism of living cells of the plants. This type of fungi belong to the group of biotrophic fungi, like many rust fungi, powdery mildew fungi or oomycete pathogens like the genus <i>Phytophthora </i>or <i>Peronospora. Necrotrophic phytopathogenic fungi depend for their nutrition on dead cells of the plants, e.g. species from the genus Fusarium, Rhizoctonia </i>or <i>Mycospaerella</i>. Soybean rust has occupied an intermediate position, since it penetrates the epidermis directly, whereupon the penetrated cell becomes necrotic. After the penetration, the fungus switches to an obligatory biotrophic lifestyle. The subgroup of the biotrophic fungal pathogens which follows essentially such an infection strategy are heminecrotrohic.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Soybean rust has become increasingly important in recent times. The disease is caused by the biotrophic rusts <i>Phakopsora pachyrhizi </i>(Sydow) and <i>Phakopsora meibomiae </i>(Arthur). They both belong to the class Basidiomycota, order Uredinales, family Phakopsoraceae. Both rusts infect a wide spectrum of leguminosic host plants.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><i>P. pachyrhizi </i>is the more aggressive pathogen on soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>), and is therefore, at least currently, of great importance for agriculture. <i>P. pachyrhizi </i>can be found in nearly all tropical and subtropical soybean growing regions of the world. <i>P. pachyrhizi </i>is capable of infecting 31 species from 17 families of the Leguminosae in nature and is capable of growing on further 60 species in controlled conditions (Sinclair et al. (eds.), Proceedings of the rust workshop (1995), National Soybeana Research Laboratory, Publication No. 1 (1996); Rytter J. L. et al., Plant Dis. 87, 818 (1984)). <i>P. meibomiae </i>has been found in the Caribbean Basin and in Puerto Rico, and has not caused substantial damage as yet.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><i>P. pachyrhizi </i>can currently be controlled in the field only by means of fungicides. Soybean plants with resistance to the entire spectrum of the isolates are not available. When searching for resistant soybean accessions, six dominant R genes of the NBS-LRR family, which mediate resistance of soybean to <i>P. pachyrhizi</i>, were discovered. The resistance they conferred was lost rapidly, as <i>P. pachyrhizi </i>develops new virulent races.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In recent years, fungal diseases, e.g. soybean rust, became more important in agricultural production. There was, therefore, a demand in the prior art for developing methods to control fungi and to provide plants that resist fungal diseases.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A lot of research has been performed on powdery and downy mildew infecting the epidermal layer of plants. However, the problem to cope with soybean rust, which infects the mesophyll or with <i>Fusarium </i>fungi that infect inaccessible inner tissues remains unsolved.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The object of the present invention is inter alia to provide a method of increasing resistance against fungal pathogens, preferably against fungal pathogens of the family Phakopsoraceae, more preferably against fungal pathogens of the genus <i>Phakopsora</i>, most preferably against <i>Phakopsora pachyrhizi </i>(Sydow) and/or <i>Phakopsora meibomiae </i>(Arthur), also known as soybean rust.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Surprisingly, we found that fungal pathogens, in particular of the family Phakopsoraceae, for example soybean rust, can be controlled by expression of the Myb41 protein, which initially has been identified as a repressor of cutin biosynthesis (Cominelli et al. (2008) Over-expression of the <i>Arabidopsis </i>AtMYB41 gene alters cell expansion and leaf surface permeability. Plant J. 53(1):53-64). Cominelli et al. had found that overexpression of AtMYB41 resulted in a dwarf phenotype similar to that exhibited by some mutants that affect cuticle biosynthesis.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The MYB superfamily of transcription factors is a large and functionally diverse protein family that can be found in all eukaryotes. In plants, the MYB family has selectively expanded. For example in <i>Arabidopsis </i>there 196 Myb transcription factor homologs can be found, which belong to 4 different families (for a comprehensive review about Myb transcription factors in <i>Arabidopsis </i>see Dubos et al. (2010), Trends in Plant Science, Vol. 15, No. 10; 573-581).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The Myb41 protein described in this invention belongs to the R2R3-MYB family, which consist of 126 members in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. R2R3-MYB genes are reported to be involved in many divergent regulatory networks controlling development, metabolism and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In <i>Arabidopsis </i>AtMYB41 is expressed at high levels in response to drought, ABA and salt treatments, suggesting a possible role in stress responses. Transgenic lines over-expressing this transcription factor in <i>Arabidopsis </i>showed a pleiotropic phenotype (dwarf appearance) similar to that exhibited by some mutants that affect cuticle biosynthesis (Cominelli et al. (2008) Over-expression of the <i>Arabidopsis </i>AtMYB41 gene alters cell expansion and leaf surface permeability. Plant J. 53(1):53-64). Nevertheless, the real cause of the phenotypes was not analyzed in this publication. Further characterization of AtMyb41-overexpressing lines by transcriptome and metabolome analysis showed that AtMyb41 is involved in several cellular processes, including control of primary metabolism and negative regulation of short-term transcriptional responses to osmotic stress (Lippold et al. AtMyb41 regulates transcriptional and metabolic responses to osmotic stress in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Plant Physiol. 149:1761-1772(2009)). By further evaluating the role of Myb41 in tolerance to salt and desiccation it turned out that is regulated by phosphorylation of Ser251 by the mitogen-activated protein kinase MPK6; the phosphorylation of MYB41 by MPK6 is required for the biological function of MYB41 in salt tolerance (Hoang et al., Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2012 May; 422(1) 181-186).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Recently the molecular mechanism of the overexpression of AtMyb41 gene has been linked to the synthesis of Suberin in leaves. (Kosma et al. AtMYB41 activates ectopic suberin synthesis and assembly in multiple plant species and cell types. Plant J. 80:216-229(2014) Suberin is a lipid and phenolic cell wall heteropolymer found in the roots and vascular tissues of all plants. Suberin plays a critical role in plant water relations and in protecting plants from biotic and abiotic stresses. Kosma at al. showed that the expression of AtMYB41 can activate all the steps necessary for suberin synthesis and deposition of cell wall-associated suberin-like lamellae. Therefore overexpression of AtMYB41 will increase suberin, lignin and phenylpropanoid biosynthetic gene transcripts and will elevate amounts of monolignols in leaves resulting in the formation of suberin-like lamellae in both epidermal and mesophyll cells of leaves.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The formation of suberin-lamellae in leaves has never been linked to increased resistance to fungal pathogens. Therefore it was surprising to find an increased resistance to <i>Phakopsora pachyrhizi </i>after overexpression of AtMyb41 in soybean. Also, there appear to be distinct responses to stressors for different species as described by Le Gall et al. (Cell Wall Metabolism in Response to Abiotic Stress. Plants 2015, 112-166) for the difference in salt response in rosids and <i>Arabidopsis</i>. It is thus not possible to extrapolate stress responses found for example in <i>Arabidopsis </i>to other plant species.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present invention accordingly provides a method for conferring or increasing fungal resistance in a plant, a plant part, or a plant cell wherein the method comprises the step of increasing the production and/or accumulation of Myb41 in the plant, plant part, or plant cell in comparison to a respective wild type plant, wild type plant part, or wild type plant cell.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Further provided is a method of conferring or increasing fungal resistance in a plant, a plant part, or a plant cell, wherein the method comprises increasing the expression and/or biological activity of a Myb41 protein in the plant, plant part, or plant cell in comparison to a respective wild type plant, wild type plant part, or wild type plant cell, wherein said Myb41 protein is encoded by</p><p id="p-0027" num="0000">(i) an exogenous nucleic acid having at least 70% identity, at least 80% identity, at least 90% identity, at least 95% identity with SEQ ID NO. 1, or a functional fragment thereof or a splice variant thereof;<br/>(ii) an exogenous nucleic acid encoding a protein having at least 70% identity, at least 80% identity, at least 90% identity, at least 95% identity with SEQ ID NO. 2 or 5, or a functional fragment thereof;<br/>(iii) an exogenous nucleic acid capable of hybridizing under stringent conditions with a complementary sequence of any of the nucleic acids according to (i) or (ii); or<br/>(iv) an exogenous nucleic acid encoding the same Myb41 protein as the nucleic acids of (i) to (iii) above, but differing from the nucleic acids of (i) to (iii) above due to the degeneracy of the genetic code.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0026">The invention also provides a recombinant vector construct comprising a nucleic acid encoding a Myb41 protein of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0027">Further provided is a genetically modified plant, genetically modified plant part, or genetically modified plant cell transformed with one or more recombinant vector construct(s) of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0028">The invention also provides a crop plant, crop plant part or crop plant cell overexpressing a Myb41 protein of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0029">Also, the invention provides a method for the production of a genetically modified crop plant, genetically modified crop plant part, or genetically modified crop plant cell having increased fungal resistance compared to a respective wild type plant, plant part or plant cell, comprising</p><p id="p-0032" num="0000">(a) introducing an exogenous nucleic acid encoding a Myb41 protein into a plant, a plant part, or a plant cell,<br/>(b) generating a genetically modified plant, genetically modified plant part, or genetically modified plant cell from the plant, plant part or plant cell; and<br/>(c) expressing the Myb41 protein in the genetically modified plant, genetically modified plant part, or genetically modified plant cell from the plant.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0030">According to an aspect of the invention a Myb41 protein or of a nucleic acid encoding a Myb41 protein is used to increase fungal resistance in a plant.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0031">The invention also provides method of controlling a fungus in a field, preferably by reducing or delaying infection of plants in a field and/or reducing or delaying emission of fungal spores from the field, comprising the step of (a) planting seed from any plant of the present invention and/or (b) increasing suberin-lamellae formation in the plants.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0032">And the invention provides a harvestable part of a plant of the present invention, wherein the harvestable part of the plant comprises an exogenous nucleic acid encoding a Myb41 protein of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0033">The invention also provides a product derived from a plant of the present invention, from a plant producible by the method of the present invention or from the harvestable part of the plant of the present invention, wherein the product comprises an exogenous nucleic acid encoding the Myb41 protein and/or the Myb41 protein of the present invention.

In particular, the skilled person will understand that the signification of individual technical concepts is done herein as an abbreviation of spelling out each possible combination of concepts as far as technically sensible, such that for example the disclosure of three concepts or embodiments A, B and C are a shorthand notation of the concepts A+B, A+C, B+C, A+B+C.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0047">As used herein, terms in the singular and the singular forms like &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise.

For example, the substitution of histidine at position 120 with alanine is designated as &#x201c;His120Ala&#x201d; or &#x201c;H120A&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0053">&#x201c;Deletions&#x201d; are described by providing the original amino acid followed by the number of the position within the amino acid sequence, followed by &#x201c;*&#x201d; or &#x201c;-&#x201d;. Accordingly, the deletion of glycine at position 150 is designated as &#x201c;Gly150*&#x201d;, &#x201c;G150*&#x201d;, &#x201c;Gly150-&#x201d; or &#x201c;G150-&#x201d;. Alternatively, deletions are indicated by e.g. &#x201c;deletion of D183 and G184&#x201d;. &#x201c;Insertions&#x201d; are described by providing the original amino acid followed by the number of the position within the amino acid sequence, followed by the original amino acid and the additional amino acid. For example, an insertion at position 180 of lysine next to glycine would be designated as &#x201c;Gly180GlyLys&#x201d; or &#x201c;G180GK&#x201d;. When more than one amino acid residue is inserted, such as e.g. a Lys and Ala after Gly180 this may be indicated as: Gly180GlyLysAla or G180GKA. In cases where a substitution and an insertion occur at the same position, this may be indicated as S99SD+S99A or in short S99AD. In cases where an amino acid residue identical to the existing amino acid residue is inserted, it is clear that degeneracy in the nomenclature arises. If for example a glycine is inserted after the glycine in the above example this would be indicated by G180GG.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0054">Variants comprising multiple alterations are separated by &#x201c;+&#x201d;, e.g. &#x201c;Arg170Tyr+Gly195Glu&#x201d; or &#x201c;R170Y+G195E&#x201d; representing a substitution of arginine and glycine at positions 170 and 195 with tyrosine and glutamic acid, respectively. Alternatively, multiple alterations may be separated by space or a comma e.g. R170Y G195E or R170Y, G195E respectively.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0055">Where different alterations can be introduced at a position, the different alterations are separated by a comma, e.g. &#x201c;Arg170Tyr, Glu&#x201d; represents a substitution of arginine at position 170 with tyrosine or glutamic acid. Alternatively, different alterations or optional substitutions may be indicated in brackets e.g. Arg170[Tyr, Gly] or Arg170{Tyr, Gly} or in short R170[Y,G] or R170{Y, G}.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0056">A special aspect concerning amino acid substitutions are conservative mutations which often appear to have a minimal effect on protein folding resulting in substantially maintained peptide or polypeptide properties of the respective peptide or polypeptide variant compared to the peptide or polypeptide properties of the parent peptide or polypeptide. Conservative mutations are those where one amino acid is exchanged with a similar amino acid.

The hybridisation process can occur entirely in solution, i.e. both complementary nucleic acids are in solution. The hybridisation process can also occur with one of the complementary nucleic acids immobilised to a matrix such as magnetic beads, Sepharose beads or any other resin. The hybridisation process can furthermore occur with one of the complementary nucleic acids immobilised to a solid support such as a nitro-cellulose or nylon membrane or immobilised by e.g. photolithography to, for example, a siliceous glass support (the latter known as nucleic acid arrays or microarrays or as nucleic acid chips). In order to allow hybridisation to occur, the nucleic acid molecules are generally thermally or chemically denatured to melt a double strand into two single strands and/or to remove hairpins or other secondary structures from single stranded nucleic acids.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0083">The term &#x201c;stringency&#x201d; refers to the conditions under which a hybridisation takes place. The stringency of hybridisation is influenced by conditions such as temperature, salt concentration, ionic strength and hybridisation buffer composition. Generally, low stringency conditions are selected to be about 30&#xb0; C. lower than the thermal melting point (Tm) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH. Medium stringency conditions are when the temperature is 20&#xb0; C. below Tm, and high stringency conditions are when the temperature is 10&#xb0; C. below Tm. High stringency hybridisation conditions are typically used for isolating hybridising sequences that have high sequence similarity to the target nucleic acid sequence. However, nucleic acids may deviate in sequence and still encode a substantially identical polypeptide, due to the degeneracy of the genetic code. Therefore, medium stringency hybridisation conditions may sometimes be needed to identify such nucleic acid molecules.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0084">The &#x201c;Tm&#x201d; is the temperature under defined ionic strength and pH, at which 50% of the target sequence hybridises to a perfectly matched probe. The Tm is dependent upon the solution conditions and the base composition and length of the probe. For example, longer sequences hybridise specifically at higher temperatures. The maximum rate of hybridisation is obtained from about 16&#xb0; C. up to 32&#xb0; C. below Tm. The presence of monovalent cations in the hybridisation solution reduce the electrostatic repulsion between the two nucleic acid strands thereby promoting hybrid formation; this effect is visible for sodium concentrations of up to 0.4M (for higher concentrations, this effect may be ignored). Formamide reduces the melting temperature of DNA-DNA and DNA-RNA duplexes with 0.6 to 0.7&#xb0; C. for each percent formamide, and addition of 50% formamide allows hybridisation to be performed at 30 to 45&#xb0; C., though the rate of hybridisation will be lowered. Base pair mismatches reduce the hybridisation rate and the thermal stability of the duplexes. On average and for large probes, the Tm decreases about 1&#xb0; C. per % base mismatch. The Tm may be calculated using the following equations, depending on the types of hybrids:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0085">DNA-DNA hybrids (Meinkoth and Wahl, Anal.

For non-related probes, a series of hybridizations may be performed by varying one of (i) progressively lowering the annealing temperature (for example from 68&#xb0; C. to 42&#xb0; C.) or (ii) progressively lowering the formamide concentration (for example from 50% to 0%). The skilled artisan is aware of various parameters which may be altered during hybridisation and which will either maintain or change the stringency conditions.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0089">Besides the hybridisation conditions, specificity of hybridisation typically also depends on the function of post-hybridisation washes. To remove background resulting from non-specific hybridisation, samples are washed with dilute salt solutions. Critical factors of such washes include the ionic strength and temperature of the final wash solution: the lower the salt concentration and the higher the wash temperature, the higher the stringency of the wash. Wash conditions are typically performed at or below hybridisation stringency. A positive hybridisation gives a signal that is at least twice of that of the background. Generally, suitable stringent conditions for nucleic acid hybridisation assays or gene amplification detection procedures are as set forth above. More or less stringent conditions may also be selected. The skilled artisan is aware of various parameters which may be altered during washing and which will either maintain or change the stringency conditions.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0090">For example, typical high stringency hybridisation conditions for DNA hybrids longer than 50 nucleotides encompass hybridisation at 65&#xb0; C. in 1&#xd7;SSC or at 42&#xb0; C. in 1&#xd7;SSC and 50% formamide, followed by washing at 65&#xb0; C. in 0.3&#xd7;SSC.

The length of the hybrid is the anticipated length for the hybridising nucleic acid. When nucleic acids of known sequence are hybridised, the hybrid length may be determined by aligning the sequences and identifying the conserved regions described herein. 1&#xd7;SSC is 0.15M NaCl and 15 mM sodium citrate; the hybridisation solution and wash solutions may additionally include 5&#xd7;Denhardt's reagent, 0.5-1.0% SDS, 100 &#x3bc;g/ml denatured, fragmented salmon sperm DNA, 0.5% sodium pyrophosphate. Another example of high stringency conditions is hybridisation at 65&#xb0; C. in 0.1&#xd7;SSC comprising 0.1 SDS and optionally 5&#xd7;Denhardt's reagent, 100 &#x3bc;g/ml denatured, fragmented salmon sperm DNA, 0.5% sodium pyrophosphate, followed by the washing at 65&#xb0; C. in 0.3&#xd7;SSC.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0091">For the purposes of defining the level of stringency, reference can be made to Sambrook et al.

Polynucleotide molecules, or fragment thereof, can also be obtained by other techniques, such as by directly synthesizing the fragment by chemical means, as is commonly practiced by using an automated oligonucleotide synthesizer. A polynucleotide can be single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds). &#x201c;Double-stranded&#x201d; refers to the base-pairing that occurs between sufficiently complementary, anti-parallel nucleic acid strands to form a double-stranded nucleic acid structure, generally under physiologically relevant conditions.

This allows for unprecedented precision of genome manipulation.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0136">The CRISPR system was initially identified as an adaptive defense mechanisms of bacteria belonging to the genus of <i>Streptococcus </i>(WO2007/025097). Those bacterial CRISPR systems rely on guide RNA (gRNA) in complex with cleaving proteins to direct degradation of complementary sequences present within invading viral DNA. The application of CRISPR systems for genetic manipulation in various eukaryotic organisms have been shown (WO20131141680; WO2013/176772; WO2014/093595). Cas9, the first identified protein of the CRISPR/Cas system, is a large monomeric DNA nuclease guided to a DNA target sequence adjacent to the PAM (protospacer adjacent motif) sequence motif by a complex of two noncoding RNAs: CRSIPR RNA (crRNA) and trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA). Also a synthetic RNA chimera (single guide RNA or sgRNA) created by fusing crRNA with tracrRNA was shown to be equally functional (WO2013/176772). CRISPR systems from other sources comprising DNA nucleases distinct from Cas9 such as Cpf1, C2c1p or C2c3p have been described having the same functionality (WO2016/0205711, WO2016/205749). Other authors describe systems in which the nuclease is guided by a DNA molecule instead of an RNA molecule. Such system is for example the AGO system as disclosed in US2016/0046963.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0137">Several research groups have found that the CRISPR cutting properties could be used to disrupt target regions in almost any organism's genome with unprecedented ease. Recently it became clear that providing a template for repair allows for editing the genome with nearly any desired sequence at nearly any site, transforming CRISPR into a powerful gene editing tool (WO2014/150624, WO2014/204728). The template for repair is addressed as donor nucleic acid comprising at the 3&#x2032; and 5&#x2032; end sequences complementary to the target region allowing for homologous recombination in the respective template after introduction of doublestrand breaks in the target nucleic acid by the respective nuclease.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0138">The main limitation in choosing the target region in a given genome is the necessity of the presence of a PAM sequence motif close to the region where the CRISPR related nuclease introduces doublestrand breaks. However, various CRISPR systems recognize different PAM sequence motifs. This allows choosing the most suitable CRISPR system for a respective target region. Moreover, the AGO system does not require a PAM sequence motif at all.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0139">The technology may for example be applied for alteration of gene expression in any organism, for example by exchanging the promoter upstream of a target gene with a promoter of different strength or specificity. Other methods disclosed in the prior art describe the fusion of activating or repressing transcription factors to a nuclease minus CRISPR nuclease protein. Such fusion proteins may be expressed in a target organism together with one or more guide nucleic acids guiding the transcription factor moiety of the fusion protein to any desired promoter in the target organism (WO2014/099744; WO2014/099750). Knockouts of genes may easily be achieved by introducing point mutations or deletions into the respective target gene, for example by inducing non-homologous-end-joining (NHEJ) which usually leads to gene disruption (WO2013/176772).</p><p id="p-0128" num="0140">Thus, the invention also provides an ensemble of at least 50 crop plants according to the present invention, more preferably at least 100 plants, even more preferably at least 1000 plants, even more preferably at least 100000 plants.

Preferably, explants were transferred onto SIM without selection for one week.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0176">For leaf explants (Method B), the explant should be placed into the medium such that it is perpendicular to the surface of the medium with the petiole imbedded into the medium and the lamina out of the medium.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0177">For propagated axillary meristem (Method C), the explant was placed into the medium such that it was parallel to the surface of the medium (basipetal) with the explant partially embedded into the medium.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0178">Wrap plates with Scotch 394 venting tape (3M, St. Paul, Minn., USA) were placed in a growth chamber for two weeks with a temperature averaging 25&#xb0; C. under 18 h light/6 h dark cycle at 70-100 &#x3bc;E/m<sup>2</sup>s. The explants remained on the SIM medium with or without selection until de novo shoot growth occurred at the target area (e.g., axillary meristems at the first node above the epicotyl). Transfers to fresh medium can occur during this time. Explants were transferred from the SIM with or without selection to SIM with selection after about one week. At this time there was considerable de novo shoot development at the base of the petiole of the leaf explants in a variety of SIM (Method B), at the primary node for seedling explants (Method A), and at the axillary nodes of propagated explants (Method C).</p><p id="p-0161" num="0179">Preferably, all shoots formed before transformation were removed up to 2 weeks after co-cultivation to stimulate new growth from the meristems. This helped to reduce chimerism in the primary transformant and increase amplification of transgenic meristematic cells. During this time the explant may or may not be cut into smaller pieces (i.e. detaching the node from the explant by cutting the epicotyl).</p><heading id="h-0019" level="2">3.5&#x2014;Shoot Elongation</heading><p id="p-0162" num="0180">After 2 to 4 weeks (or until a mass of shoots was formed) on SIM medium (preferably with selection), the explants were transferred to SEM medium (shoot elongation medium, see Olhoft et al., a novel <i>Agrobacterium rhizogenes</i>-mediated transformation method of soy using primary-node explants from seedlings. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol.-Plant (2007) 43:536-549) that stimulates shoot elongation of the shoot primordia. This medium may or may not contain a selection compound.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0181">After every 2 to 3 weeks, the explants were transfer to fresh SEM medium (preferably containing selection) after carefully removing dead tissue. The explants should hold together and not fragment into pieces and retain somewhat healthy. The explants were continued to be transferred until the explant dies or shoots elongate. Elongated shoots &#x3e;3 cm were removed and placed into RM medium for about 1 week (Method A and B), or about 2 to 4 weeks depending on the cultivar (Method C) at which time roots began to form. In the case of explants with roots, they were transferred directly into soil. Rooted shoots were transferred to soil and hardened in a growth chamber for 2 to 3 weeks before transferring to the greenhouse. Regenerated plants obtained using this method were fertile and produced on average 500 seeds per plant.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0182">After 5 days of co-cultivation with <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens </i>transient expression of the gene of interest (GOI) was widespread on the seedling axillary meristem explants especially in the regions wounding during explant preparation (Method A). Explants were placed into shoot induction medium without selection to see how the primary-node responds to shoot induction and regeneration. Thus far, greater than 70% of the explants were formed new shoots at this region. Expression of the GOI was stable after 14 days on SIM, implying integration of the T-DNA into the soybean genome. In addition, preliminary experiments resulted in the formation of cDNA expressing shoots forming after 3 weeks on SIM.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0183">For Method C, the average regeneration time of a soybean plantlet using the propagated axillary meristem protocol was 14 weeks from explant inoculation. Therefore, this method has a quick regeneration time that leads to fertile, healthy soybean plants.</p><heading id="h-0020" level="1">Example 4: Pathogen Assay</heading><heading id="h-0021" level="2">4.1. Growth of Plants</heading><p id="p-0166" num="0184">10 T1 plants per event were potted and gown for 3-4 weeks in the phytochamber (16 h-day-und 8 h-night-Rhythm at a temperature of 16&#xb0; and 22&#xb0; C. und a humidity of 75%) till the first 2 trifoliate leaves were fully expanded.</p><heading id="h-0022" level="2">4.2 Inoculation</heading><p id="p-0167" num="0185">The plants were inoculated with spores of <i>P. pachyrhizi</i>. In order to obtain appropriate spore material for the inoculation, soybean leaves which had been infected with rust 15-20 days ago, were taken 2-3 days before the inoculation and transferred to agar plates (1% agar in H2O). The leaves were placed with their upper side onto the agar, which allowed the fungus to grow through the tissue and to produce very young spores. For the inoculation solution, the spores were knocked off the leaves and were added to a Tween-H2O solution. The counting of spores was performed under a light microscope by means of a Thoma counting chamber. For the inoculation of the plants, the spore suspension was added into a compressed-air operated spray flask and applied uniformly onto the plants or the leaves until the leaf surface is well moisturized. For macroscopic assays we used a spore density of 1-5&#xd7;105 spores/ml. For the microscopy, a density of &#x3e;5&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>spores/ml is used. The inoculated plants were placed for 24 hours in a greenhouse chamber with an average of 22&#xb0; C. and &#x3e;90% of air humidity. The following cultivation was performed in a chamber with an average of 25&#xb0; C. and 70% of air humidity.</p><heading id="h-0023" level="1">Example 5: Microscopical Screening</heading><p id="p-0168" num="0186">For the evaluation of the pathogen development, the inoculated leaves of plants were stained with aniline blue 48 hours after infection.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0187">The aniline blue staining serves for the detection of fluorescent substances. During the defense reactions in host interactions and non-host interactions, substances such as phenols, callose or lignin accumulated or were produced and were incorporated at the cell wall either locally in papillae or in the whole cell (hypersensitive reaction, HR). Complexes were formed in association with aniline blue, which lead e.g. in the case of callose to yellow fluorescence. The leaf material was transferred to falcon tubes or dishes containing destaining solution II (ethanol/acetic acid 6/1) and was incubated in a water bath at 90&#xb0; C. for 10-15 minutes. The destaining solution II was removed immediately thereafter, and the leaves were washed 2&#xd7; with water. For the staining, the leaves were incubated for 1.5-2 hours in staining solution II (0.05% aniline blue=methyl blue, 0.067 M di-potassium hydrogen phosphate) and analyzed by microscopy immediately thereafter.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0188">The different interaction types were evaluated (counted) by microscopy. An Olympus UV microscope BX61 (incident light) and a UV Longpath filter (excitation: 375/15, Beam splitter 405 LP) are used. After aniline blue staining, the spores appeared blue under UV light. The papillae could be recognized beneath the fungal appressorium by a green/yellow staining. The hypersensitive reaction (HR) was characterized by a whole cell fluorescence.</p><heading id="h-0024" level="1">Example 6: Evaluating the Susceptibility to Soybean Rust</heading><p id="p-0171" num="0189">The progression of the soybean rust disease was scored 14 days after inoculation (see example 4) by the estimation of the diseased area (area which was covered by sporulating uredinia) on the adaxial leaf side. Additionally, the yellowing of the leaf was taken into account. (for scheme see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0172" num="0190">At all 107 T1 soybean plants, representing 9 independent transformation events (11-12 plants per event) and expressing Myb41 protein were inoculated with spores of <i>Phakopsora pachyrhizi </i>(see example 4). The macroscopic disease symptoms of soybean after infection with <i>P. pachyrhizi </i>were scored 14 days after inoculation. Plants were grown and kept under the conditions described in example 4.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0191">The average of the percentage of the leaf area showing fungal colonies or strong yellowing/browning was considered as diseased leaf area. All 107 transgenic T1 soybean plants expressing Myb41 (expression checked by RT-PCR) were grown and evaluated in parallel to non-transgenic control plants with the same genetic background as used for the transformation (see example 3).</p><p id="p-0174" num="0192">The average of the diseased leaf area for plants expressing recombinant Myb41 protein and respective wildtype control plants is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Both, transgenic T1 soybean plants expressing Myb41 and non-transgenic wild type control plants are based on the same genetic background.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0193">Overexpression of the Myb41 protein reduces the diseased leaf area in comparison to non-transgenic control plants by 33.5% in average over all events and plants generated. This difference is statistically significant on a p&#x3c;0.001 level (two-sided student's t-test). The data clearly shows that the in-planta expression of the Myb41 expression vector construct (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) leads to a lower disease in transgenic plants compared to wild type controls. So, the expression of Myb41 protein (as shown in SEQ ID NO. 2) in soybean increases the resistance of soy against soybean rust.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-sequence-list-doc id="SEQLST-1"><sequence-list file="US20230002455A1-20230105-S00001.XML" carriers="internal-electronic" seq-file-type="ST.25"/></us-sequence-list-doc><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
