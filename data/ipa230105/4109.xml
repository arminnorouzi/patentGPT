The horizontal axis represents the position in the arrangement direction, and the vertical axis represents the outer diameter of the pressure roller <b>21</b>. A line D<b>1</b> illustrated on the lower part of the graph is an outer diameter profile of the pressure roller <b>21</b> in the arrangement direction before the thermal expansion of the pressure roller <b>21</b> (that is, in a cold state), in other words, a line formed by continuously plotting the outer diameters in the arrangement direction. A curve D<b>2</b> illustrated on the upper part of the graph indicates the outer diameter profile of the pressure roller <b>21</b> after the thermal expansion of the pressure roller <b>21</b>, and an alternate long and short dash line D<b>3</b> indicates the outer diameter profile of the pressure roller <b>21</b> that thermally expands by an equal amount at each position in the arrangement direction. FIG. is a graph illustrating an outer diameter profile of the pressure roller <b>21</b> according to a first embodiment, which is described below. The above-described definitions are also applied to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> to <b>17</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b> to <b>17</b></figref>, the amount of increase in the outer diameter of the pressure roller <b>21</b> is exaggerated for the sake of convenience.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The amount of increase in the outer diameter of the pressure roller <b>21</b> is an amount by which the outer diameter of the pressure roller <b>21</b> increases from the position of the pressure roller <b>21</b> corresponding to the center position C<b>0</b> of the heat generation area C (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) toward the outer end of the pressure roller <b>21</b> corresponding to one of the ends of the heat generation area C. The amount of increase in the outer diameter can be obtained as a difference in the outer diameters in a certain section on the pressure roller <b>21</b> in the arrangement direction. Alternatively, the amount of increase in the outer diameter may be evaluated by the inclination at each position on each of the lines D<b>1</b> to D<b>3</b> in the arrangement direction as the absolute value of the outer diameter increase amount at the position. Hereinafter, the thermal expansion at the outer diameter of the pressure roller is evaluated by an increasing rate of the outer diameter. The increasing rate of the outer diameter is an increase amount of the outer diameter of the pressure roller per unit length in a direction from the center toward the end of the pressure roller. The increasing rate of the outer diameter means the inclination at each of positions of lines and curves in the graphs of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>, <b>16</b></figref>, and <b>17</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, temperature of the pressure roller <b>21</b> is low at a position facing the center position B<b>0</b> of the separation area B and in the vicinity of the position in the arrangement direction. Therefore, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the low temperature reduces the amount of thermal expansion of the pressure roller <b>21</b> and the increasing rate of the outer diameter at each position of the position facing the center position B<b>0</b> and in the vicinity of the position. In other words, the low temperature increases the difference between the value of the solid line D<b>2</b> and the value of the alternate long and short dash line D<b>3</b> at the position in the above-described range in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. As a result, the pressure roller <b>21</b> has concave portions facing the center positions B<b>0</b> of the separation areas as indicated by the solid line D<b>2</b> and does not have a shape in which the outer diameter of the pressure roller <b>21</b> gradually increases toward the outside.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The above-described difference in the thermal expansion amounts of the pressure roller <b>21</b> generates a difference in the forces applied to the sheet P by the pressure roller <b>21</b> at positions in the arrangement direction. The difference in the forces causes wrinkles in the sheet P conveyed through the fixing nip N. In particular, the difference in the forces applied to the sheet P is large at the local maximum point E illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, which causes the wrinkles in the sheet P.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the local maximum point E is a point at which the inclination of the solid line D<b>2</b> is inverted (that is, the point at which the inclination of the solid line D<b>2</b> changes from an inclination in which the outer diameter increases toward the outside to an inclination in which the outer diameter decreases toward the outside). In the pressure roller <b>21</b> having the outer diameter profile as illustrated by the solid line D<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the force applied to the sheet P increases toward the outside, and the force is uniformly applied to the sheet in a direction in which the force stretches the sheet P, that is, the direction toward the outside in the arrangement direction. In contrast, the pressure roller <b>21</b> having the outer diameter profile as illustrated by the solid line D<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> has a range in which the outer diameter decreases toward the outside, that is, the range from the position of the pressure roller <b>21</b> facing the center position B<b>0</b> of the separation area toward the center of the pressure roller <b>21</b>. In the other range, the outer diameter increases toward the outside. In the above-described range contrary to the other range, the force applied to the sheet P decreases toward the outside. As a result, in the other range of the pressure roller <b>21</b> from the local maximum point E to the center of the pressure roller, the force toward the outside is applied to the sheet P and stretches the sheet P. In the range of the pressure roller <b>21</b> from the local maximum point E to the outside, the force toward the inside is applied to the sheet P and contracts the sheet P. In other words, the sheet P receives the forces in two opposite directions (the stretching direction and the contracting direction) at the local maximum point E, and wrinkles occur in the sheet P.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Next, a description is given of the pressure roller <b>21</b> of a first embodiment. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the pressure roller <b>21</b> of the first embodiment has a first region J<b>1</b> and second regions J<b>2</b> arranged in the arrangement direction. The first region J<b>1</b> is the inside of the pressure roller <b>21</b> in the arrangement direction, and each of the second regions J<b>2</b> is the outside of the pressure roller <b>21</b> in the arrangement direction. That is, the first region J<b>1</b> of the pressure roller <b>21</b> is nearer to a position on the pressure roller <b>21</b> facing the center position C<b>0</b> of the heat generation area C of the heater <b>22</b> than the second region J<b>2</b> of the pressure roller <b>21</b>. The increasing rate of the outer diameter in the first region J<b>1</b> is relatively smaller than the increasing rate of the outer diameter in the second region J<b>2</b>. The increasing rate of the outer diameter in the arrangement direction is constant in each of the first region J<b>1</b> and the second region J<b>2</b>. In other words, the pressure roller <b>21</b> has an inflection point <b>21</b><i>d </i>on the surface of the pressure roller <b>21</b>. The inflection point <b>21</b><i>d </i>is at a position in the arrangement direction and serves as a boundary. The increasing rate of the outer diameter in a region from the inflection point <b>21</b><i>d </i>toward the outside is larger than the increasing rate of the outer diameter in a region from the inflection point <b>21</b><i>d </i>toward the inside.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The pressure roller <b>21</b> according to the first embodiment has the inflection point <b>21</b><i>d </i>at the position in a range from the local maximum point E toward the inside. In other words, the inflection point <b>21</b><i>d </i>is located at the position in the range from the position at which the increasing rate of the outer diameter is inverted toward the inside. The position occurs after the pressure roller <b>21</b> that has a constant increasing rate of the outer diameter under the room temperature as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> thermally expands.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">As described above, the thermal expansion changes the increasing rate of the outer diameter of the pressure roller <b>21</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> to be negative in a region from the position facing the center position B<b>0</b> of the separation area toward the inside. In contrast, the pressure roller <b>21</b> in the first embodiment is designed so that the increasing rate of the outer diameter in the region from the position facing the center position B<b>0</b> of the separation area toward the inside (specifically, the region from the position facing the center position B<b>0</b> of the separation area toward the inside and the region outside the region J<b>1</b>) is relatively larger than the increasing rate of the outer diameter in the region J<b>1</b>. Designing the pressure roller <b>21</b> so that the increasing rate of the outer diameter in the region from the position facing the center position B<b>0</b> of the separation area toward the inside to be larger than the increasing rate of the outer diameter in the region J<b>1</b> considering a difference between thermal expansions in the above-described regions in advance prevents the increasing rate of the outer diameter in the region from the position facing the center position B<b>0</b> of the separation area toward the inside from being smaller than the increasing rate of the outer diameter in the region J<b>1</b>. As a result, the occurrence of the wrinkles in the sheet is prevented. Specifically, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, the above-described configuration prevents the occurrence of the local maximum point E in the range of the pressure roller <b>21</b> from the inflection point <b>21</b><i>d </i>to the position facing the center position B<b>0</b> of the separation area. As a result, the above-described configuration reduces the inward force acting on the sheet P and prevents the occurrence of wrinkles in the sheet P.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The occurrence of wrinkles in the sheet P is prevented by setting the increasing rate of the outer diameter of the pressure roller <b>21</b> in the region facing a part of the separation area and the region from the position facing the center position B<b>0</b> of the separation area defined by neighboring resistive heat generators toward the inside, to be relatively larger than the increasing rate of the outer diameter in the region from the above-described region toward the inside. The above-described center position B<b>0</b> of the separation area defined by neighboring resistive heat generators is not the center position C<b>0</b> of the heat generation area. The center position B<b>0</b> is outside the center position C<b>0</b>. The heater <b>22</b> in the present embodiment has two center positions B<b>0</b> of the separation areas.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The occurrence of wrinkles in the sheet P is prevented by setting the increasing rate of the outer diameter of the pressure roller <b>21</b> in at least a part of the region of 30 mm from the position facing the center position B<b>0</b> of the separation area defined by neighboring resistive heat generators toward a position facing the center position C<b>0</b> of the heat generation area to be relatively larger than the increasing rate of the outer diameter of the pressure roller <b>21</b> in the region of 20 mm from the position facing the center position C<b>0</b> of the heat generation area toward the outside.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Preferably, the occurrence of wrinkles in the sheet P is prevented by setting the increasing rate of the outer diameter of the pressure roller <b>21</b> in at least a part of the range of 10 mm from the position facing the center position B<b>0</b> of the separation area defined by neighboring resistive heat generators toward the position facing the center position C<b>0</b> of the heat generation area to be relatively larger than the increasing rate of the outer diameter of the pressure roller <b>21</b> in the range of 20 mm from the position facing the center position C<b>0</b> of the heat generation area toward the outside.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Preferably, the pressure roller <b>21</b> is designed to have the inflection point <b>21</b><i>d </i>in a range of 30 mm from the position facing the center position B<b>0</b> of the separation area defined by neighboring resistive heat generators toward the outside. Setting the inflection point <b>21</b><i>d </i>too close to the center of pressure roller <b>21</b> increases the second region J<b>2</b>, and the crown amount L becomes too large. As a result, the force applied to the sheet P becomes excessive, which causes unstable behavior of the sheet P passing through the fixing nip N. This causes the toner image on the surface of the sheet P to come into contact with other members, which results in the occurrence of abnormal image. Setting the inflection point <b>21</b><i>d </i>as described above can reduce the force applied to the sheet P.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The position of the inflection point <b>21</b><i>d </i>is not limited to the arrangement illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>. However, it is preferable that the inflection point <b>21</b><i>d </i>is designed to be at a position inside a position at which the local maximum point E may occur. For example, in a second embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, the inflection point <b>21</b><i>d </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is outside the inflection point in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> and disposed at a position corresponding to the local maximum point E illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. The above-described configuration according to the second embodiment can obtain the effect of preventing the occurrence of wrinkles in the sheet as described above and reduce the second region to reduce the crown amount.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In a third embodiment, the pressure roller <b>21</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> has second first regions J<b>3</b> outside the second regions J<b>2</b>.

The pressure roller <b>21</b> has the second first regions J<b>3</b> outside the other inflection points <b>21</b><i>d</i><b>2</b>. In the pressure roller <b>21</b> of the third embodiment, the increasing rate of the outer diameter increases in the second regions J<b>2</b> outside the first region J<b>1</b> and decrease in the second first regions J<b>3</b> outside the second regions J<b>2</b> like the first region J<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The second region J<b>2</b> that is an entire region outside the inflection point <b>21</b><i>d </i>as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> and <b>16</b></figref> can prevent the occurrence of wrinkles in the sheet but increases the crown amount L. To reduce the crown amount, the second region J<b>2</b> in the third embodiment is set to be a region of the pressure roller from the position facing the center position B<b>0</b> of the separation area toward the center of the pressure roller and the region at which the above-described local maximum point E may occur. The first regions J<b>3</b> are set outside the second regions J<b>2</b>. The second region J<b>2</b> in the third embodiment is narrower than the second region J<b>2</b> in the first and second embodiments described above. The above-described configuration can prevent the occurrence of wrinkles in the sheet and reduce the crown amount L to be as small as possible. Note that setting the first region J<b>3</b> to be at least a part of the region outside the position facing the center position B<b>0</b> of the separation area can reduce the crown amount L.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The above-described configurations of the pressure roller <b>21</b> are preferably applied to the fixing device having a configuration in which the base of the fixing belt <b>20</b> is made of resin such as polyimide as in the present embodiments.
