The device further relates to a method for protecting against repercussions of a distance-active protection system on a military vehicle with a protection device. A defense system with a distance-active protection system and a military vehicle with such a defense system form further objects of the device.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Distance-active protection systems, such as those described in Published European Patent Application No. EP 0 687 885 A1 or U.S. Pat. No. 7,202,809 B1, are used in military vehicles to defend against approaching threats.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Possible threats can be in particular approaching missiles or projectiles, which approach the military vehicle and destroy or at least damage it. Military vehicles are both land vehicles, such as tanks or off-road vehicles, as well as watercraft or aircraft, such as ships or helicopters.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">If such a military vehicle has a distance-active protection system, then as with the invention, an approaching threat can also be detected and a corresponding countermeasure initiated. To defend against the threat, it can be shot at in particular by the distance-active protection system, for example by projectile-forming charges or hollow body projectiles, so that the threat is already destroyed in the air at a distance from the vehicle and damage to the vehicle is avoided.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, although the use of a distance-active protection system reduces the effects of an approaching threat on a military vehicle, the use of the protection system itself causes repercussions on the vehicle to be protected, so that in particular turret superstructures, such as in particular optics, crew members and/or other less armored elements can be damaged by the repercussions. The repercussions of the distance-active protection system, for example blasts or projectile residues, result from the bombardment of the approaching threat, since when a projectile is fired as a countermeasure, repercussions occur simultaneously, in particular against the direction of fire, which can then act on the military vehicle.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the prior art, distance-active protection systems are therefore arranged in such a way that their repercussions cannot have an effect on the military vehicle, but &#x201c;bypass&#x201d; the vehicle. European Published Patent Application No. EP 0 687 885 A1, for example, arranges the distance-active protection system on an obliquely positioned, oblong mounting arm on the vehicle, so that there is a clear distance between the vehicle and the protection system. In U.S. Pat. No. 7,202,809 B1, on the other hand, the distance-active protection system is arranged directly on the highest point of the military vehicle, so that the repercussions of the distance-active protection system also bypass the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Even though the military vehicle can thus be protected from repercussions of the distance-active protection system, in an unfavorable way in the solutions of the prior art an excessive increase in the vehicle contour of the military vehicle results from the arrangement of the distance-active protection system on a mounting arm or at the highest point of the vehicle. However, such an increase in the contour of the vehicle can prove to be disadvantageous and limit the possible applications of the military vehicle.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, military vehicles often have to be loaded and transported, wherein an increase in the vehicle structure requires additional transport volume. Furthermore, when driving the military vehicle, an enlarged vehicle contour may be disadvantageous, for example, when crossing terrain or in underpasses.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The disclosed distance active protection system is therefore based on the object of creating a protection device which reduces an enlargement of the vehicle contour of a military vehicle due to a defense system.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">This object is achieved with a protection device of the type mentioned at the beginning in that a protective shield can be movably, in particular pivotally, attached to the vehicle by means of a fastening device.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The protection device may serve to protect the military vehicle with the distance-active protection system against its repercussions, in particular against blasts and/or projectile residues. It can be arranged directly on the vehicle. Due to the design according to the invention and the associated protective effect, the distance-active protection system can also be arranged directly on the vehicle compared to the known solutions from the prior art, wherein a distance from this, in particular on its highest point or by means of a mounting arm, is no longer absolutely necessary. Due to the direct arrangement of the protection device and the associated possibility of the direct arrangement of the distance-active protection system on the vehicle, this results in a reduced vehicle contour.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The protection device may have a protective shield, which can be movably attached to the vehicle by means of a fastening device. The protective shield can absorb and/or redirect the repercussions of the distance-active protection system so that they do not act directly on the vehicle. The fastening device can be used for the attachment and movability of the protective shield, wherein it can be designed as a kind of interface between the vehicle and the protective shield. Due to the movability of the protective shield, the vehicle contour, especially outside of operations, can be additionally reduced, so that the possible applications are not limited here due to the protection device.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">An advantageous design provides that the protective shield can be moved from a parking position to an operating position. While in the parking position the vehicle contour can be reduced, especially compact, whereas in the operating position the protective shield can protect against repercussions of the distance-active protection system on the vehicle. The dismantling of the protection device, in particular the protective shield, outside of operations and the subsequent assembly thereof can thus be avoided due to the movability. In addition to the parking position and the operating position, however, other positions of the protective shield may also be provided, such as an intermediate position, which can be located in particular between the parking position and the operating position. In this context, it is also possible that when the protective shield is being transferred from the operating position to the parking position, the protective shield can be moved out of a field of view, in particular a field of view of optics and/or a crew member. As a result, the field of view can be increased accordingly.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In this context, it may also be provided that the movement of the protective shield from the parking position to an operating position is done manually, for example by a crew member, by hydraulics and/or by a drive, for example by a motor. Conversely, the protective shield can also be moved from the operating position to the parking position. In order to maintain the position of the protective shield after moving to the desired position, it can be suitably locked.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A further advantageous design provides for at least one locking element for locking the protective shield in different positions of the protective shield. Such a locking element can be designed as a captive plug-in bolt or a captive screw bolt and can lock the protective shield in the various positions, in particular in the parking position and the operating position, so that the protective shield is held in the desired position. In the design and arrangement of the locking element, it is possible that the same locking element can lock the protective shield in all its positions, for example by moving this locking element with the protective shield. Alternatively, however, it is also possible that multiple locking elements may be provided, each of which locks the protective shield in a different position, so that, for example, a first locking element locks the protective shield in the parking position and a second locking element locks the protective shield in the operating position.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Since the protective shield can restrict the view of crew members and/or optics due to the arrangement on the vehicle, in particular in the operating position, the protective shield advantageously has at least one viewing window for looking through the protective shield. Especially in the operating position, the protective shield can reduce the field of view of crew members and/or optics, so that the viewing window allows a view through the protective shield, even if it were in the field of view. In this context, it is possible that the viewing window is made of bulletproof glass, so that protection against repercussions can also be provided in the area of the viewing window. When designing the viewing window, it is also possible to design the viewing window as a viewing block. Furthermore, it is also conceivable to adapt the viewing window to the design of the protective shield, in particular any angular designs, for example by designing the viewing window at an angle.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">An advantageous design in this context provides that the viewing window is arranged replaceably in the protective shield. This means that the viewing window can be replaced if necessary, for example if the transparency is reduced due to dirt or damage to the viewing window. This can occur especially because the repercussions of the distance-active protection system can, among other things, act on the viewing window and can foul and/or damage it accordingly. Due to the replaceability of the viewing window, however, the protective shield can be retained and just the viewing window can be replaced if necessary. It is also possible due to the rapid replaceability to adapt the viewing window depending on the purpose.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">With reference to the viewing window, it is further proposed as an advantageous development that the protection device has vibration protection to protect the viewing window against vibrations. This vibration protection can be designed as a damper and/or as a support. Regardless of the position of the protective shield, vibrations can act on the protective shield and thus in particular on the viewing window when the military vehicle is used, for example when driving or in battle. Due to these vibrations, the transparency through the viewing window can be impaired, especially worsened. Furthermore, these vibrations may damage the viewing window. In order to counteract impaired transparency and/or damage to the viewing window, vibration protection can protect the viewing window from vibrations, in particular by dampening them.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">With regard to the protective properties of the protection device, a further particularly advantageous design of the invention provides that the protective shield is designed at an angle to deflect the repercussions of the distance-active protection system. Here, the angular design of the protective shield can not only enable the protection of the military vehicle from the repercussions of the distance-active protection system, but also that repercussions can be diverted away from the military vehicle, so that they no longer act primarily towards the vehicle and thus the protective effect can be increased. In connection with the geometry of the protective shield, it is also possible to design the protective shield so that its geometry can be expanded. Thus, it would be particularly advantageous to adapt the geometry of the protective shield to the respective purpose, for example by adjusting the size and/or the shape and/or the angular design, in particular the angular position, of the protective shield.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In order to attach the protective shield movably by means of the fastening device, a particularly advantageous design provides that the fastening device has at least one hinge for the movement of the protective shield. The hinge may be formed as a pivot hinge for pivoting, for example a hinge joint or a ball joint, and/or as a sliding hinge for moving the protective shield. The at least one hinge can allow the movement of the protective shield in its different positions by connecting the protective shield to the military vehicle by means of the hinge. Due to the at least one hinge, it is possible that the protective shield is independently movable relative to the distance-active protection system. For example, it is possible that the protective shield is moved to an operating position and remains fixed therein, while the distance-active protection system orients itself accordingly and bombards threats approaching the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an advantageous manner, it is further provided with regard to the fastening device that the fastening device has a carrier device for carrying the protective shield. The carrier device can carry the protective shield and can accordingly absorb its load. It is possible that the carrier device can be moved with it when the protective shield moves, so that the relative position between the carrier device and the protective shield remains the same. However, it is also possible that the carrier device cannot be moved and thus the relative position between the carrier device and the protective shield changes accordingly during its movement.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Furthermore, an advantageous design of the protection device provides at least one support for supporting the protective shield. This support can support the protective shield as soon as repercussions of the distance-active protection system act thereon, so that it withstands the repercussions. It is advantageous in this context if the support itself is formed as part of the fastening device, in particular as part of the carrier device. Furthermore, a plurality of supports may also be provided for a greater supporting effect, wherein it would be possible to connect these to each other by means of at least one support arranged transversely thereto, so that the supporting effect is additionally increased.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In order for the protective shield to be supported by the fastening device, a further advantageous design provides that at least one stop is designed in such a way that in the event of repercussions of the distance-active protective system, at least a part of the repercussions acting on the protective shield is absorbed by the fastening device by means of the at least one stop. The stop may be designed as part of the fastening device, in particular as part of the carrier device or the support. In order to absorb at least some of the repercussions acting on the protective shield, the stop may be in contact with the protective shield. The contact can exist either at any time in the form of a fixed connection, in particular a welded joint, or only in the event of repercussions, in particular if the protective shield merely rests on the stop.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As a further advantageous design, at least one sensor is provided for detecting at least one position of the protective shield, in particular the parking position and/or the operating position. The sensor can be used to detect the position of the protective shield, as it can take different positions due to its movability, wherein the respective position generally depends on the intended use. The sensor may be designed as an active or passive sensor, in particular as a proximity sensor or position sensor or as a switch, in particular as a limit switch.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A further advantageous design in this context provides for a control unit for processing the sensor data. The detected sensor data can be processed by the control unit and then reused. Thus, it is possible to display the processed sensor data to the crew via an interface by means of the control unit and/or to transmit the processed sensor data to other systems of the military vehicle. The tasks of the other systems can then be carried out taking into account the sensor data. It is also possible in this context that the control unit can be coupled to a drive and/or to hydraulics for the movement of the protective shield, so that this control unit can control the movement accordingly. Here it would be possible to make the control unit operable by a crew member.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In addition to the protection device according to the invention, it is also proposed in a defense system with a distance-active protection system for the protection of a military vehicle for the achievement of the aforementioned object that this has a protection device having one or more of the aforementioned features. This results in the advantages explained in connection with the protection device.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">An advantageous design of the defense system provides that the protective shield in the parking position serves as a cover for the distance-active protection system. In this context, it is possible that the protective shield in the parking position can cover the distance-active protection system and thus protect it from external influences. Especially in transport situations, for example when loading the military vehicle, possible damage to the protection system can be counteracted. It is also possible that the protective shield cannot cover the entire distance-active protection system, but that the cover can only extend to a part of it, in particular to a part of the protective system remaining on the vehicle when the countermeasure is dismounted. Furthermore, it is also possible that the protective shield in the parking position cannot cover any part of the distance-active protection system, in particular if this is moved away from the distance-active protection system when moving from the operating position to the parking position.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A further advantageous design provides that the distance-active protection system is coupled to the protection device in such a way that the distance-active protection system can only be used in one of several possible positions of the protective shield, in particular the operating position. The coupling of the protective system to the protection device can then ensure that the protective system can only be used if the protective shield is in a certain position, in particular the operating position. In particular, since the protection against the repercussions of the distance-active protection system can only be fully guaranteed by the protection device if the protective shield is in the operating position, this coupling can increase the operating safety of the protection device. In this context, it would be possible for such a coupling to be controlled by a control unit. It is possible that the protective shield remains in one position, in particular the operating position, while the distance-active protective system moves relative to the protective shield. For example, the protective shield can be pivoted into a position and locked in it, especially in the operating position. The distance-active protection system can then aim at and shoot at an approaching threat by orientation, e.g. by a rotational movement.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Advantageously, the protective shield is movable, in particular pivotable, independently of the distance-active protection system. It is possible that the distance-active protection system is movable, in particular rotatable, independently of the protective shield.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In addition, in the case of a military vehicle of the type mentioned above, for the achievement of the aforementioned object it is further proposed that it has a defense system with one or more of the aforementioned characteristics. This results in the advantages explained in connection with the defense system or with the protection system.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">An advantageous design of the military vehicle provides that the protection device can be arranged on a line between the distance-active protection system and an object to be protected of the military vehicle. This arrangement can ensure that in the event of repercussions of the distance-active protection system towards the object to be protected, the protection device can absorb and/or redirect these repercussions, so that the repercussions are kept away from the object, and accordingly this is protected. It is possible that the distance-active protection system is rotationally movable for bombarding an approaching threat, while the shield can be fixedly locked in the operating position. Even with a moving distance-active protection system, this makes it possible for the protective shield to be arranged in the operating position on a line between the distance-active protection system and the object to be protected. The protective shield may be fixed in the operating position relative to the vehicle, while the distance-active protective system moves relative to the protective shield.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a method for protecting against repercussions of a distance-active protection system on a military vehicle with a protection device, it is proposed that a protective shield is moved, in particular pivoted, to achieve the aforementioned object.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The advantages explained in connection with the protection device result here. The features described in connection with the protection device may also occur individually or in combination with the method. The described advantages result.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">With regard to the method, it has proven to be advantageous that the protective shield is moved to an operating position to enable shooting by the distance-active protection system. In the operating position of the protective shield, the protection device protects the vehicle from repercussions of the distance-active protection system. Since in the parking position of the protective shield the protective effect against repercussions may be correspondingly reduced, coupling of the distance-active protection system and the protection device, in particular the protective shield, may be advantageous. Here it is possible to carry out the coupling in such a way that the protection system can only be enabled and accordingly activated when the protective shield is in the operating position.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In an advantageous manner, it may also be provided in connection with the method that the protective shield is moved to a parking position to block shooting of the distance-active protection system. Since the protective effect of the protection device may be reduced in the parking position, coupling of the distance-active protection system and the protection device may be advantageous. The coupling may provide that the distance-active protection system is deactivated when the protective shield is transferred to the parking position and the shooting function is blocked accordingly.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">With regard to the method, it has also proven to be advantageous if, before the use of the distance-active protection system, a protective shield is moved, in particular pivoted, from a parking position to an operating position to protect against repercussions of the distance-active protection system on the vehicle. Outside of operations, the protective shield can be moved to the parking position, since outside of operations the use of the distance-active protection system is generally not provided. In the parking position, the protective shield can reduce the contour of the vehicle, so that the aforementioned advantages occur. If, on the other hand, the military vehicle is in use, wherein the use of the distance-active protection system may be provided, the protective shield may be moved from the parking position to the operating position in order to protect the vehicle from repercussions of the distance-active protection system.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Further details and advantages of protection devices according to the invention, defense systems equipped with such protection devices, military vehicles equipped with such defense systems and methods according to the invention are explained below by way of example on the basis of the figures.

The defense system <b>500</b> serves, among other things, on the one hand to protect the vehicle <b>100</b> from possible approaching threats <b>400</b>, in that the distance-active protection system <b>200</b> can shoot at and destroy them accordingly, and on the other hand to protect the vehicle <b>100</b> from repercussions R of the distance-active protection system <b>200</b> occurring as a result of the bombardment B of the threats <b>400</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The distance-active protection system <b>200</b> has a countermeasure <b>201</b>, which is loaded by means of a loading device <b>202</b> of the protection system <b>200</b>. The charges, in particular projectiles, projectile-forming charges or hollow body projectiles, of the countermeasure <b>201</b> are used to bombard B approaching threats <b>400</b>, as shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the protection device <b>1</b> has a protective shield <b>2</b> and a fastening device <b>3</b>, which movably attaches the protective shield <b>2</b> to the vehicle <b>100</b>. The fastening device <b>3</b> has a carrier device <b>7</b> for carrying the protective shield <b>2</b> and a hinge <b>8</b> for the movement of the protective shield <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The protective shield <b>2</b> is in an operating position according to the representation, so that it can protect the military vehicle <b>100</b> from possible repercussions R of the distance-active protection system <b>200</b>. The protective shield <b>2</b> is set up in such a way that the area of the vehicle <b>100</b> is covered by the protective shield <b>2</b> starting from the countermeasure <b>201</b> to the middle of the vehicle <b>100</b>, so that this area is protected accordingly against repercussions R of the distance-active protection system <b>200</b>. While the protective shield <b>2</b> is arranged vertically in the operating position in this implementation, other orientations of the protective shield <b>2</b> in the operating position are also possible.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">If, as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically depicts, a threat <b>400</b>, for example in the form of a steerable missile or a projectile, approaches the vehicle <b>100</b> in order to destroy or damage it, the threat <b>400</b> is detected by the distance-active protection system <b>200</b> and shot at by its countermeasure <b>201</b>. By means of the bombardment B, the threat <b>400</b> is destroyed at a distance from the vehicle <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">During the bombardment B by the countermeasure <b>201</b>, however, repercussions R occur at the same time, such as in particular blasts or projectile residues, which act opposite to the direction of shelling and thus towards the vehicle <b>100</b>. In order to protect the military vehicle <b>100</b> against these repercussions R, these are suitably absorbed by means of the protection device <b>1</b> and in particular its protective shield <b>2</b> and at least partially deflected, so that the vehicle <b>100</b> is correspondingly protected.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Outside of operations, the protective shield <b>2</b> may be in a parking position, as shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In the parking position, the protective shield <b>2</b> is accordingly folded down to the side of the vehicle, wherein folding inwards is also possible as an alternative. In the implementation, the protective shield <b>2</b> is oriented horizontally in the parking position, wherein alternatively other orientations of the protective shield <b>2</b> are quite possible in the parking position.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In order to transfer the protective shield <b>2</b> from the operating position according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to the parking position according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the countermeasure <b>201</b> is dismounted accordingly so that the protective shield <b>2</b> can be pivoted. However, it would also be conceivable here that the countermeasure <b>201</b> remains mounted on the vehicle <b>100</b> and the protective shield <b>2</b> in the parking position covers at least part of the distance-active protection system <b>200</b> and thus acts as a kind of cover or lid. It is also possible to arrange the protection device <b>1</b> on the vehicle <b>100</b> in such a way that the countermeasure <b>201</b> is not covered in the parking position of the protective shield <b>2</b>, for example when the protective shield <b>2</b> is pivoted inwards.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">When looking at the different positions of the protective shield <b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, it becomes apparent that the contour of the vehicle <b>100</b> can be reduced in the parking position of the protective shield <b>2</b> compared to the contour of the vehicle <b>100</b> with the protective shield <b>2</b> in the operating position.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Various embodiments of the protection device <b>1</b> will be explained below in more detail on the basis of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> to <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i></figref>show a first exemplary embodiment of the protection device <b>1</b> in two different perspectives. The protection device <b>1</b> has a protective shield <b>2</b> and a fastening device <b>3</b>, wherein the fastening device <b>3</b> is used for the movable attachment of the protective shield <b>2</b> to a military vehicle <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The protective shield <b>2</b> is designed at an angle in both a horizontal plane H and a vertical plane V. The angular design can advantageously cause repercussions R of a distance-active protection system <b>200</b> to be correspondingly deflected by the protective shield <b>2</b> and thus that the vehicle <b>100</b> can be protected, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. However, taking into account the intended use or the available installation space on the vehicle <b>100</b>, it is also possible to design the configuration of the protective shield <b>2</b> differently. For example, the protective shield <b>2</b> can also be designed completely flat and without angular areas or with a different number of angular areas in a horizontal plane H and/or a vertical plane V. However, the possible angles here are not limited to the horizontal plane H and/or the vertical plane V but can also be oriented differently.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The protective shield <b>2</b> has a viewing window <b>4</b> for looking through it. The viewing window <b>4</b> may be particularly advantageous if the protective shield <b>2</b>, for example, reduces the field of view of an optical arrangement and/or a crew member of the military vehicle <b>100</b>. According to the embodiment the viewing window <b>4</b> is manufactured of bulletproof glass, so that in addition the area behind the viewing window <b>4</b> is also correspondingly protected against the repercussions of the distance-active protection system <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The viewing window <b>4</b> is arranged in front of a shield recess <b>2</b>.<b>1</b> of the protective shield <b>2</b> by means of a frame <b>5</b>. For the arrangement, the viewing window <b>4</b> is positioned between the frame <b>5</b> and the protective shield <b>2</b> and in front of the shield recess <b>2</b>.<b>1</b> and is fixed by screwing the frame <b>5</b> to the protective shield <b>2</b> by means of multiple screws <b>6</b>. Due to this arrangement, the viewing window <b>4</b> is replaceable and accordingly can be replaced if necessary, for example if it is damaged or the view is impeded.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In order to ensure the view through the viewing window <b>4</b> even in the event of vibrations occurring, which may occur in particular while driving the vehicle <b>100</b> or during use of the distance-active protection system <b>200</b>, vibration protection which is not shown is provided in the frame <b>5</b>. Especially if the viewing window <b>4</b> is made of bulletproof glass, vibrations can lead to reduced transparency if the viewing window <b>4</b> were also to vibrate. Furthermore, the vibration protection can prevent damage to the viewing window <b>4</b> due to occurring vibrations, which can occur, for example, when driving the military vehicle <b>100</b> or due to the distance-active protection system <b>200</b>. In order to avoid the transmission of vibrations to the viewing window <b>4</b>, the vibration protection can be designed as a damper.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">For the movable attachment of the protective shield <b>2</b> to the military vehicle <b>100</b>, the protection device <b>1</b> has the fastening device <b>3</b>. The fastening device <b>3</b> allows the movement of the protective shield <b>2</b> between different positions, such as in particular between a parking position and an operating position.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The fastening device <b>3</b> has a carrier device <b>7</b>, which carries the protective shield <b>2</b>. The carrier device <b>7</b> is composed of four supports <b>7</b>.<b>1</b> which are vertical in the illustrations and two supports <b>7</b>.<b>2</b> which are horizontal in the illustrations, wherein the horizontal supports <b>7</b>.<b>2</b> are not formed contiguously, but are divided into multiple subsections. The supports <b>7</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>7</b>.<b>2</b> are arranged in a lattice structure, running transversely. The supports <b>7</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>7</b>.<b>2</b> are used to support the protective shield <b>2</b>, in particular once repercussions R of the distance-active protection system <b>200</b> occur, wherein the lattice structure can cause an advantageous force application and force distribution in the supports <b>7</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>7</b>.<b>2</b> or in the fastening device <b>3</b>. However, different embodiments, in particular taking into account the intended use of the protection device <b>1</b>, are also possible here. For example, the number of supports <b>7</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>7</b>.<b>2</b> and/or the angles between the junctions of supports <b>7</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>7</b>.<b>2</b> and/or the design of supports <b>7</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>7</b>.<b>2</b> could be varied. Furthermore, it is also possible to design the supports <b>7</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>7</b>.<b>2</b> not as part of the carrier device <b>7</b>, but as separate components of the protection device <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The carrier device <b>7</b> also has a total of four stops <b>7</b>.<b>3</b>, wherein a different number is also possible, which are designed as part of the vertical supports <b>7</b>.<b>1</b>. By means of the stops <b>7</b>.<b>3</b>, the carrier device <b>7</b> is connected to the protective shield <b>2</b>. The connection is designed to be inseparable, for example by welding, but can alternatively be designed to be detachable, for example by screwing. The connection between the protective shield <b>2</b> and the carrier device <b>7</b> allows the at least partial introduction of the repercussions R from the protective shield <b>2</b> into the carrier device <b>7</b>, in particular into the vertical supports <b>7</b>.<b>1</b>, via the stops <b>7</b>.<b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">For the movement of the protective shield <b>2</b>, the fastening device <b>3</b> has three hinges <b>8</b>. The hinges <b>8</b> are attached to a first side of the protective shield <b>2</b> and can be attached on the opposite side to the military vehicle <b>100</b>, so that the protective shield <b>2</b> can be moved, here pivoted, by means of the hinges <b>8</b>. The movement of the hinges <b>8</b> takes place around an axis A, wherein the protective shield <b>2</b> is accordingly moved around this axis A. Since the axis A results from the arrangement of the hinges <b>8</b>, a different arrangement of the hinges <b>8</b> from the exemplary embodiment, for example on the carrier device <b>7</b>, is also possible. In particular, against the background of the available installation space for the protection device <b>1</b> on the vehicle <b>100</b>, a differently oriented axis A may well be advantageous, for example if the protection device <b>1</b> and in particular its protective shield <b>2</b> must be pivoted past a body of the vehicle <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The protective shield <b>2</b> can be movably attached to the vehicle <b>100</b> by means of the fastening device <b>3</b> in that the carrier device <b>7</b> and the connected protective shield <b>2</b> are also moved when the hinges <b>8</b> move. For the implementation according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i></figref>, the carrier device <b>7</b> is moved with the protective shield <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">As an alternative, it is also possible to arrange the hinges <b>8</b> not on the protective shield <b>2</b>, but on the carrier device <b>7</b>. In this case, when the carrier device <b>7</b> moves, the protective shield <b>2</b> would be moved if there is a fixed connection between the protective shield <b>2</b> and the carrier device <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The fastening device <b>3</b> also has two locking elements <b>9</b> for locking the protective shield <b>2</b> in different positions. According to the implementation, the locking elements <b>9</b> may be formed as captive screw bolts <b>9</b>.<b>1</b> or captive plug bolts <b>9</b>.<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The locking elements <b>9</b> allow the protective shield <b>2</b> to be immovably lockable in different positions relative to the vehicle <b>100</b>. The distance-active protection system <b>200</b>, in particular the countermeasure <b>201</b>, can aim at an approaching threat <b>400</b>, for example by a rotational movement, while the protective shield <b>2</b> remains unmoved in the respective position.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">As a counterpart to the locking elements <b>9</b>, the fastening device <b>3</b> has two locking holders <b>10</b>. The locking holders <b>10</b> are essentially fork-shaped, wherein the first locking holder <b>10</b>.<b>1</b> has only one fork arm and the second locking holder <b>10</b>.<b>2</b> has two opposite fork arms. The fork arm of the first locking holder <b>10</b>.<b>1</b> has a threaded bore to accommodate the screw bolt <b>9</b>.<b>1</b>, the fork arms of the second locking holder <b>10</b>.<b>2</b> each have a bore. To lock the protective shield <b>2</b> in one position, the locking elements <b>9</b> are inserted, in particular plugged or screwed, into the locking holders <b>10</b> according to the illustrations in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i></figref>. The locking holders <b>10</b> are designed as part of the carrier device <b>7</b>, here in particular as part of the vertical supports <b>7</b>.<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i></figref>a further exemplary embodiment of the protection device <b>1</b> is illustrated. The protection device <b>1</b> has the essential features of the first implementation according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i></figref>, so that the differences between the two implementations are addressed in particular. However, the advantages of the first implementation mentioned above also apply to this second implementation and are by no means excluded by the subsequent discussion of the differences.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The protection device <b>1</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i></figref>has a protective shield <b>2</b> which is movable by means of a fastening device <b>3</b>, which, however, is designed with different dimensions compared to the previously described implementation. The dimensioning of the protective shield <b>2</b> may be adapted as required in the design, in particular taking into account the installation space for the protection device <b>1</b> on a military vehicle <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The protective shield <b>2</b> is also of an angular design in this implementation and has an angular viewing window <b>4</b> adapted to the protective shield <b>2</b>. The surface of the viewing window <b>4</b> ends on one side at the surface of the protective shield <b>2</b>. The angular design of the viewing window <b>4</b> may be particularly advantageous if a large area of the protective shield <b>2</b> is to be transparent, because, for example, the protective shield covers a large viewing area of an optical arrangement and/or of a crew member. Alternatively, however, it is also possible to design the viewing window <b>4</b> to be flat.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The protection device <b>1</b> also has a frame <b>5</b>, which is arranged on the protective shield <b>2</b>. The frame <b>5</b> is irreversibly connected to the protective shield <b>2</b>, for example by welding, wherein it would also be conceivable here to alternatively provide a detachable connection, for example by screws. Frame <b>5</b> surrounds a shield recess <b>2</b>.<b>1</b>, in which the viewing window <b>4</b> is fitted. In addition, it is possible that the viewing window <b>4</b> is clamped and/or glued into the shield recess <b>2</b>.<b>1</b>. To simplify the installation of the viewing window <b>4</b> in the shield recess <b>2</b>.<b>1</b>, the corners of the viewing window <b>4</b> can be beveled, for example, to allow a rear grip by a fitter during assembly.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The fastening device <b>3</b> has a carrier device <b>7</b>, which has two vertical supports <b>7</b>.<b>1</b> and a horizontal support <b>7</b>.<b>2</b> in the illustration. The protective shield <b>2</b> is arranged on the carrier device <b>7</b> by means of stops <b>7</b>.<b>3</b>, which are formed as part of the vertical supports <b>7</b>.<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The fastening device <b>3</b> also has two hinges <b>8</b>, which are arranged on the protective shield <b>2</b>. Alternatively, however, it would also be possible to arrange the hinges <b>8</b> on the carrier device <b>7</b>. In this design according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i></figref>, the distanced arrangement of the hinges <b>8</b> also results in an axis A, which is the pivot axis of the hinges <b>8</b> and at the same time the pivot axis of the protective shield <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">A difference of the protection device <b>1</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i></figref>compared to the previous described design according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b </i></figref>results from the consideration of the locking elements <b>9</b> and the locking holders <b>10</b>. The two locking holders <b>10</b> are fork-like, each with a fork arm, each of which has a bore, for example a threaded bore. By means of the locking holders <b>10</b>, the protective shield <b>2</b> can be attached to the vehicle <b>100</b>, for example, by making a screw connection between the locking holders <b>10</b> and the vehicle <b>100</b>. The locking holders <b>10</b> are connected by a bridge <b>10</b>.<b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The locking elements <b>9</b> are used to lock the protective shield <b>2</b> and are designed as screw bolts <b>9</b>.<b>1</b>. The screw bolts <b>9</b>.<b>1</b> connect the carrier device <b>7</b> to the locking holders <b>10</b>. When moving the protective shield <b>2</b> from a first position, for example the operating position, to a second position, for example the parking position, the locking of the locking elements <b>9</b> is released, so that the locking holders <b>10</b> including the bridge <b>10</b>.<b>4</b> remain unmoved and fixed on the vehicle <b>100</b> and the carrier device <b>7</b> is moved with the hinges <b>8</b> and the protective shield <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a</i></figref>, the protective shield <b>2</b> is located in the parking position.

Also according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b</i></figref>, in which the protective shield <b>2</b> is located in the operating position, it can be seen that the protective shield <b>2</b> is attached to the vehicle <b>100</b> by means of the fastening device <b>3</b>, namely by means of the hinges <b>8</b> and the carrier device <b>7</b>. For the attachment of the protective shield <b>2</b> to the vehicle <b>100</b>, however, other designs are also conceivable, for example an arrangement in which the protective shield <b>2</b> without the carrier device is attached directly to the vehicle <b>100</b> by means of a hinge or in which the carrier device comprises the hinge.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i></figref>show a protection device <b>1</b> according to the invention with a protective shield <b>2</b>, which is movably attached by means of a fastening device <b>3</b> to a military vehicle <b>100</b>. The protection device <b>1</b> represents a third exemplary embodiment, wherein the design is essentially similar to the first two embodiments according to the preceding illustrations according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>. The advantages of the first two embodiments mentioned above therefore also apply to this embodiment and the following discussion will focus in particular on further features and aspects of the protection device <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>a </i></figref>shows the protective shield <b>2</b> in a parking position. In the parking position, the contour of the vehicle <b>100</b> is reduced compared to an operating position as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>b </i></figref>shows. In the parking position the protective shield <b>2</b> is positioned flat to the roof of the vehicle <b>100</b>, wherein different positions are also possible as a parking position.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The protective shield <b>2</b> is held in the parking position by the fastening device <b>3</b>, in particular by the carrier device <b>7</b>, and is locked in this position by means of the locking elements <b>9</b>.
