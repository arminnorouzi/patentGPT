Specifically, it relates to surfactant concentrates used to treat and modify the rock wettability of hydrocarbon-containing formations for improved oil and gas recovery.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Without limiting the scope of the disclosure, this background information is provided herein. Hydrocarbon production from unconventional shale reservoirs has grown immensely in the last decade with the advent of modern hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling technologies. Hydraulic fracturing is a stimulation technique that relies on the injection of fracturing fluids along with solid proppants which can create long, deep propped, primary fractures and/or induce natural microfractures which can increase the conductivity of the formation. However, overall recovery from these reservoirs remains very low and only about 5-10% OOIP (&#x201c;original oil in place&#x201d;) is recovered. This can be attributed to the ultra-low permeability of the shale matrix, oil-wet or neutral-wet rock wettability, channeling, and reservoir heterogeneity. With surging global energy demand and consumption globally, it becomes vital to develop solutions to increase hydrocarbon recovery and exploit such complex reservoirs more efficiently.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The wettability of the rock is the tendency of one fluid to preferentially spread over the rock surface in the presence of another fluid. It is a critical petrophysical property that governs the multiphase flow in the pores of a rock and the fluid distribution. Wettability is a function of rock mineralogy, oil composition, water salinity, types of ions, saturation history, and reservoir temperature. There are several methods to characterize the wettability of a porous media including Amott wettability measurements, the U.S. Bureau of Mines (&#x201c;USBM&#x201d;) method, and the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (&#x201c;NMR&#x201d;) Longitudinal Relaxation method. However, the most common method is the contact angle (&#x3b8;) measurement. Depending on the magnitude of the &#x3b8;, the wettability state of the rock can be classified as either water-wet, neutral-wet, or oil-wet. In porous media, the wetting phase occupies the smaller pores, and the non-wetting phase occupies the larger pores whereas the wetting phase exists as a continuous phase with the thin film adhering to the rock surface. Therefore, in an oil-wet rock, oil recovery is typically poor as the injection fluid has to overcome the negative capillary pressure barrier to invade the rock-matrix and displace oil. In such cases, altering the rock wettability from oil-wet to water-wet is desirable and can increase the oil recovery significantly. The wettability of the rock can be altered using different techniques such as surfactant injection, thermal treatments, injection of low salinity brine or modified brine, and/or alkaline flooding. In the present disclosure, novel surfactant concentrates are disclosed which utilizes the synergy between surfactants and cosurfactants to form a stable, robust, formulation which can alter the wettability of rock surfaces, including shale surfaces, to increase oil recovery significantly.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure relates to surfactant concentrates and methods used to increase hydrocarbon recovery from subterranean formations.

These interfaces could be between gas/oil, oil/water, or gas/water. The IFT can be measured using different analytical techniques and instruments such as pendant-drop analysis, Du No&#xfc;y ring, Wilhelmy plate, and spinning drop tensiometer.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0024">As used herein, the term &#x201c;surfactant&#x201d; or &#x201c;surface-active agents&#x201d; refers to chemical species that comprise of the hydrophobic tail and hydrophilic head which have the affinity to go at the fluid-fluid interface to lower the interfacial tension. The term &#x201c;ionic surfactants&#x201d; refers to the class of surfactants that carries a net charge on the head. These include anionic, cationic and zwitterionic/amphoteric surfactants. Similarly, the term &#x201c;non-ionic surfactants&#x201d; refers to the class of surfactants that has no charged groups in its head.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0025">As used herein, the term &#x201c;subterranean formation&#x201d; or &#x201c;subsurface formation&#x201d; means a hydrocarbon-containing reservoir that is present below the ground which has porosity and permeability to store and flow the hydrocarbon fluids. The lithology of the reservoir could comprise of sedimentary rocks, carbonates such as limestones and dolomites, sandstones, shales, coals, evaporites, igneous, and metamorphic rocks, and combinations thereof. These reservoirs can be fully or partially consolidated or unconsolidated in nature. These formations can be an offshore or onshore reservoir.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0026">As used herein, the term &#x201c;shale&#x201d; refers to fine-grained sedimentary rocks which are predominantly comprised of consolidated clay-sized particles. The fine sheet-like clay minerals and the laminated nature of the sediments result in ultra-low permeability which significantly slows down the flow of hydrocarbon within the rock matrix.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0027">As used herein, the term &#x201c;hydraulic fracturing&#x201d; refers to the subsurface reservoir stimulation technique which is adopted to increase the conductivity of the low permeability formations such as shale reservoirs or tight sandstone or carbonate reservoirs. Hydraulic fracturing relies on the injection of fracturing fluids to induce fractures which increase the contacted reservoir surface area and the stimulated reservoir volume. Typical fracturing fluids include a wide range of chemical additives that serve different physical and chemical purposes. Common fluids can include acids, biocides, clay stabilizers, breakers, corrosion inhibitors, crosslinkers, friction reducers, gels, viscosifier, polymers, organic or inorganic salts, oxygen scavengers, pH adjusting agents, scale inhibitors, non-emulsifier, aqueous stability enhancer, wettability-altering agents, IFT modifiers and surfactants. Fracturing fluids are often injected with proppants such as natural sand, glass, resin-coated sand, sintered bauxite, ceramic beads, and fused zirconia, which maintain the fracture conductivity after fracture closure by keeping it propped. These fractures along with induced natural fractures act as conductive pathways for hydrocarbon production.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0028">During hydraulic fracturing process, a significant volume of fracturing fluids is injected in the formation. These fluids are often expensive, and it is desired to recover back the fluids after the fracturing is performed so that they could be reused. Moreover, typically leaving behind the fracturing fluid to imbibe in the formation could actually harm the hydrocarbon production. The damage is worsened with time and depth of the imbibition of the fracturing fluids in the formation. Certain chemical additives such as surfactants or microemulsion are often added to recover or produce back the fracturing fluids to the surface. This process is known as &#x201c;flow back&#x201d; or &#x201c;flow-back process&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0029">As used herein, the term &#x201c;wettability&#x201d; refers to the relative adhesion of two fluids to a solid surface. In the present context, it is the affinity of one fluid to adhere to the interstitial surface of the porous media in the presence of the other fluid. These fluids could be formation brine, injection brine, injected aqueous formulations, hydrocarbon (oil and gas) present in the reservoir.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0030">As used herein, the term &#x201c;contact angle&#x201d; refers to the quantitative measure of the wettability of the solid surface such as the rock samples by a liquid in the presence of the other liquid. It is measured as the angle at the interface where two fluids and solid surface meet.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0031">As used herein, the term &#x201c;water-wet&#x201d; means that in a solid-aqueous-oil system, contact angle as measured from the solid surface through the aqueous phase is less than 75&#xb0;. Similarly, the term &#x201c;neutral-wet&#x201d; refers to contact angle as measured from the solid surface through the aqueous phase is between 750 to 1050 and the term &#x201c;oil-wet&#x201d; refers to contact angle as measured from the solid surface through the aqueous phase greater than 105&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0032">The wettability is a critical parameter that governs the multiphase flow as well as the distribution of fluids through the porous media. As used herein, the term &#x201c;aging&#x201d; refers to treating the rock cores or disks to restore its reservoir wettability. It involves saturating the cores with crude oil or submerging the disks in crude oil and placing them at elevated temperature (&#x3e;80&#xb0; C. or &#x3e;176&#xb0; F.) for a long duration (3 weeks to 1 month).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0033">As used herein, the term &#x201c;salt&#x201d; refers to a chemical compound comprising an ionic assembly of cations and anions. It includes inorganic salts such as potassium chloride, ammonium chloride, sodium chloride, calcium chloride, magnesium chloride and organic salts such as sodium acetate, sodium citrate and combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0034">As used herein, the term &#x201c;brine&#x201d; refers to a mixture of water and soluble salts typically present in the aqueous phase in the hydrocarbon-containing reservoirs. These salts are presents in the form of ions such as but not limited to chloride (Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>), sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>), sulfate (SO4<sup>2&#x2212;</sup>), magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>), calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), potassium (K<sup>+</sup>), bicarbonate (HCO3<sup>&#x2212;</sup>), bromide (Br<sup>&#x2212;</sup>), borate (H2BO3<sup>&#x2212;</sup>), and strontium (Sr<sup>2+</sup>).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0035">As used herein, the term &#x201c;total dissolved solids&#x201d; refers to the total amount of solids dissolved in the water. These solids could comprise water-soluble inorganic materials (minerals, salts, metals, cations, and/or anions) and/or organic materials. It is often reported in parts per million (ppm) or wt %. The typical TDS of seawater is 35,000 ppm or 3.5 wt %.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0036">As used herein, the term &#x201c;salinity&#x201d; refers to the total concentrations of salts in the aqueous solution and is expressed in wt. %</p><p id="p-0035" num="0037">As used herein, the term &#x201c;aqueous stable&#x201d; means the formulation is both thermally stable as well as colloidally stable at the specified temperature. The formulation is free from any coagulation, phase-separation, or precipitation of any component/phase of the mixture.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0038">As used herein, the term &#x201c;spontaneous imbibition&#x201d; or &#x201c;SI&#x201d; refers to the process by which one fluid displaces other fluid from a porous media due to the presence of capillary forces. In an SI process, the wetting phase is drawn in the pores of the rock while the non-wetting phase is displaced via a capillary gradient. Therefore, in a water-wet system, significant oil (non-wetting phase) can be recovered from the rock via spontaneous imbibition of water (wetting phase). In contrast, in an oil-wet system, oil (wetting phase) is trapped in the pores of the rock due to negative capillary pressure and water (non-wetting phase) cannot invade the pores to displace the oil. In such a system, changing the wettability of the rock from oil-wet to water-wet can shift the capillary pressure to positive values and spontaneous imbibition can be achieved which mobilizes the trapped oil and increase the overall recovery.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0039">As used herein, the word &#x201c;Original Oil in Place (&#x201c;OOIP&#x201d;)&#x201d; refers to the estimated total amount of oil present in a given volume of the reservoir. During core saturation or oil displacement experiments, OOIP is typically estimated using the volumetric method or the material balance method as well as the petrophysical data of the cores.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0040">As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;Huff-n-Puff&#x201d; or &#x201c;Huff and Puff&#x201d; refers to the process of recovering oil from a subsurface formation where a fluid is injected in the well and the well production is temporarily stopped to allow the injection fluid to soak into the reservoir, or interact with the reservoir fluids and rock surfaces, and then the production is resumed again. After producing from the well, this cycle is then continued again. The injection fluid can be, but is not limited to, steam, gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, ethane, produced gas, hydrocarbon gases, surfactant formulations, wettability-altering agents, conformance control agents, stimulation chemicals, and combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0041">As used herein, the phrases &#x201c;enhanced oil recovery&#x201d; (&#x201c;EOR&#x201d;) or &#x201c;improved oil recovery&#x201d; (&#x201c;IOR&#x201d;) refers to techniques to increase the hydrocarbon recovery from subsurface formations. Typically, IOR techniques can recover more than 20% original-oil-in-place (&#x201c;OOIP&#x201d;). It includes, but is not limited to, waterflooding, gasflooding (e.g., injection of hydrocarbon gas, nitrogen and/or carbon dioxide), chemical flooding (e.g., using polymers, surfactants and/or alkalis) and thermal techniques (e.g., steam injection, hot water injection, electrical heating and/or combustion), microbial injections, and combination thereof. IOR can also include stimulation techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and shale acidization which aims at increasing the conductivity of the formation to increase the hydrocarbon recovery.

These disks were then washed with formation brine to remove any bulk oil sticking to the surface and were placed in an optical quartz cell filled with injection brine as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>.

The formation of such emulsions is often undesirable owing to the high viscosity of the emulsion which can lead to injectivity issues. The Bulk Emulsion Stability Test quantifies and compares the stability of emulsions. In the Bulk Emulsion Stability Test, crude oil and the surfactant formulations are prepared in a 30:70 ratio, by volume, in glass vials. The mixtures were agitated at high shear using a rotor-stator homogenizer (Scilogex D160) operating at 8,000 rpm for 45 seconds. The stability of the emulsion was quantified in terms of the normalized emulsion height (NEH) as a function of time. Digital images of the vials were taken, and image processing software ImageJ was used to calculate the NEH.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0220">Interfacial Tension (IFT)</p><p id="p-0149" num="0221">The crude oil-aqueous phase interfacial tension (IFT) was measured via a pendant droplet method using the Dataphysics OCA-15EC goniometer. Different surfactant formulations were taken in an optical quartz cell and a droplet of crude oil was suspended for sufficient time to allow it to equilibrate with the aqueous phase using a U-shaped hypodermic needle. The IFT was measured using the in-built software by fitting the drop profile with the Young-Laplace equation.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0222">Core Characterization and Saturation</p><p id="p-0151" num="0223">Tight Carbonate Cores</p><p id="p-0152" num="0224">Tight carbonate cores were prepared to mimic reservoir conditions in order to evaluate the performance of different surfactant formulations for increased oil recovery. Oil-free, cylindrical cores, 1&#x2033; or 1.5&#x2033; in diameter and 1 ft long, were prepared by first drying the cores at 85&#xb0; C. for 48 hours in an oven. The cores were then covered with fluorinated ethylene propylene (&#x201c;FEP&#x201d;) heat-shrink wrap tubing and placed vertically in a Hassler-type core holder under a confining overburden pressure of 1500 psi. The schematic of the high-pressure, high-temperature setup is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0225">Petrophysical properties of the cores such as brine porosity were measured by performing a vacuum saturation of formation brine. The permeability of the cores was then measured by injecting formation brine at different flow rates and measuring the differential pressure drop across the cores. The crude oil was then injected from the top of the core at constant high-pressure of 1000 psi in the brine-saturated core until residual water saturation was achieved. To minimize any capillary end-effects, more than 4 PV of oil was injected. In some cases, a direct vacuum saturation of crude oil was performed to achieve 100% oil saturation. The oil-saturated cores were then taken out of the core holder and were submerged in crude oil bottle and placed in the oven at 85&#xb0; C. for 1 month for &#x201c;aging&#x201d; which renders the cores oil-wet in nature.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0226">Ultra-Tight Shale Cores</p><p id="p-0155" num="0227">Ultra-tight shale cores having ultra-low permeability and porosity could not be prepared with the &#x2018;Tight Carbonate Cores&#x2019; method. To prepare ultra-tight shales cores, Eagle Ford and Wolf Camp cores, having a 1&#x2033; diameter and measuring 6-inches long, were dried at 85&#xb0; C. for 15 days and then the dry weights were measured. The cores were then placed in a high-pressure piston accumulator filled with crude oil. The system was pressurized at 2750 psi by running an ISCO syringe pump at constant pressure. The whole setup was heated at 85&#xb0; C. in an oven and the pressure was maintained for 45 days. The crude oil slowly imbibed into the cores. The amount of oil imbibed was calculated gravimetrically.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0228">Spontaneous Imbibition Test</p><p id="p-0157" num="0229">The Spontaneous Imbibition Test was performed to quantify the efficacy of different surfactant formulations in altering the wettability of the cores, inducing surfactant solution imbibition and improved oil recovery. A custom imbibition glass cell was fabricated by Ace Glass, Inc. (Vineland, N.J.) capable of withstanding high-temperature and high-pressure. The custom imbibition glass cell comprised a cylindrical chamber and a thin graduated tube attached to the top to collect oil. Such a cell is often referred to in the literature as an &#x201c;Amott Cell&#x201d;. The diameter of the graduated tube was designed based on the amount of expected oil recovery to ensure measurement accuracy. Each oil-saturated core was loaded in the cell and it was filled with the surfactant formulations until a fixed liquid level was reached. Both ends of the cell were securely closed using threaded-Teflon screws and O-rings to prevent evaporation and the cell placed in the oven at reservoir temperature. The oil recovered from the core accumulated in the graduated tube and was monitored with time.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Examples</heading><p id="p-0158" num="0230">The following examples are reported to illustrate the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0231">The cores from the Eagle Ford shale formation were cut into small disks (diameter: 1 inch and length: about 1 inch). The disks smoothed using a polishing machine and then were equilibrated with brine (5 wt. % potassium chloride or KCl) for 24 hours. The potassium chloride prevents swelling of clays which can affect the results. The contact angle of the Texas crude oil was measured on one of the disks to quantify the wettability of the rock before any aging process. The unmodified contact angle was found to be 98.3&#xb0;+7.0&#xb0; indicating the neutral-wet nature of the rock. The remaining disks were then submerged in the Texas crude oil at 85&#xb0; C. for one month for aging to mimic the wettability state in the subsurface reservoir. During this aging process, the indigenous or naturally occurring crude oil components such as naphthenic and carboxylic acids tend to adsorb on the surface of the rock to render it oil-wet in nature. This wettability alteration toward oil-wet nature is strongly governed by the oil composition, brine salinity, temperature and duration of aging. To confirm that the oil used in this present disclosure can alter the wettability of the shale disks to oil-wet, contact angle experiments were performed to quantify the wettability state of the disks post-aging.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0232">To measure the contact angle, an aqueous phase comprised of 5 wt. % KCl with no added surfactants was used (Formulation F1). The aged shale disk was submerged in the formulation F1 for 48 hours at 85&#xb0; C. in the oven. The disk was then placed on a Teflon stand in the quartz optical cell submerged in the brine (5 wt. % KCl). When the crude oil droplet was introduced at the bottom of the disk, it resulted in the complete spreading of the oil droplet and a contact angle of 1800 was observed confirming the strong oil-wetness of the shale disks. The wettability state obtained via formulation F1 which contains no surfactants was used as a base case or reference wettability to compare the results with other formulations in Table 1 and Table 2.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0233">To determine the effects of the surfactant formulations described herein, other oil-wet Eagle Ford shale disks were submerged in the various surfactant formulations at a reservoir temperature of 85&#xb0; C. for 48 hours. Such a process mimics the treatment of shale formations in the subsurface environment. After the treatment, the disks were taken out of the formulations and washed gently with brine (5 wt. % KCl) to remove any bulk oil sticking to the surface. These disks were then placed in an optical quartz cell and were submerged in brine (with no surfactants) and the contact angle test was performed.

The final wettability state of the rock samples was determined by the magnitude of the contact angle (&#x3b8;). The final wettability was categorized as either Water Wet (&#x201c;WW&#x201d;) for a &#x3b8;&#x3c;75&#xb0;, Neutral Wet (&#x201c;NW&#x201d;) for 75&#xb0;&#x3c;&#x3b8;&#x3c;105&#xb0;, or Oil Wet &#x201c;OW&#x201d; for a &#x3b8;&#x3e;105&#xb0;. As can be appreciated, different oil recovery processes prefer different wettability states. For improved oil recovery application, a preferential water-wet wettability is preferred. In Tables 1 to 4, surfactant formulations which yields a contact angle, &#x3b8; &#x3c;600 is considered to have pass the contact angle test for IOR application and a contact angle, &#x3b8; &#x3e;60&#xb0; is considered to have failed the test. In contrast, for flow-back applications, the final wettability of rock after surfactant formulation treatment is preferred to be less water-wet. Herein, in Table 1 to 4, the surfactant formulations which yields a contact angle, &#x3b8;&#x3e;750 is considered to have passed the contact angle test while &#x3b8;&#x3c;750 is considered to have failed the test for flow-back applications.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0235">Table 1 summarizes the results of the contact angle test on for the different surfactant formulations (F2 to F14) comprising of single surfactant at a constant salinity (5 wt. % KCl) and the corresponding contact angle of the oil droplet post-treatment with these formulations.

Note that the final wettability state due to primary surfactant alone (F72) was strongly oil-wet (&#x3b8;=160.9&#xb1;2.5), and final wettability state due to the individual cosurfactants alone (F78, F9, and F10) was neutral-wet. However, remarkably, the final wettability state for the formulations with a mixture of surfactants (F716, F17, and F18) was water-wet in nature. These results illustrate the non-obvious result of how the incorporation of suitable primary surfactants with other cosurfactants can result in a synergistic reduction of contact angle towards favorable water-wet conditions.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0240">To further understand the improvement of synergistic surfactant blends in favorably altering the wettability of shale cores, the synergistic formulations were further evaluated with the oil-wet Wolf Camp shale samples. Analogous to cases of Eagle Ford shale samples, a similar protocol was adopted to cut and polish the shale disks and age them with reservoir crude oil. After the aging process, one of the disks was taken out of the crude oil and submerged in the formation brine (5 wt. % KCl) with no surfactant for 48 hours at 85&#xb0; C. The disk was taken out and the contact angle of the crude oil was measured. It was equal to 177.4&#xb0;&#xb1;4.4&#xb0; indicating the aging process was able to make the shale disks strongly oil-wet in nature. In the subsequent runs, surfactant formulations with individual surfactants with a constant salinity of 5 wt. % KCl was used to treat the oil-wet Wolf Camp shale disks. The treatment conditions (time=48 hours and temperature=85&#xb0; C.) were kept constant. Table 3 lists the results of the different surfactant formulations (F24 to F33) comprising of individual surfactants. The total surfactant concentration was kept constant and equal to 0.5 wt. %.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00003" num="00003"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"

The IFT values for the various surfactant formulation varied from 0.1 to 1 mN/m as opposed to ultra-low IFT values (&#x3c;0.001 mN/m) which confirmed the observations from the Bulk Emulsion Stability Test. Ultra-low IFTs, which are typically preferred in chemical EOR in conventional formations, may result in oil redeposition on the surface and water expelling out of matrix due to negligible capillary pressures.

Because shale samples have ultra-low porosity and permeability, the maximum initial oil saturation is relatively low for lab-scale experiments. Accordingly, Indiana limestone core plugs (length: 3 inches, diameter: 1 inch) were used as a proxy to better simulate a tight formation. These cores are also geochemically similar to calcite-rich Eagle Ford and Wolfcamp shales. To evaluate formulations in the Spontaneous Imbibition Test, the cores were placed in a coreholder under confining pressure of 1500 psi. The permeabilities of these cores were around 7.5 mD. These cores were vacuum-saturated with crude oil to obtain 100% initial oil saturation (So<sub>i</sub>) or 0% initial water saturation (Sw<sub>i</sub>). The core plugs were taken out of the coreholder and placed in a glass jar and were submerged in the crude oil. The jar was then placed in an oven at 85&#xb0; C. for 1 month to render the cores oil-wet in nature. The aging process is a strong function of initial water saturation or connate water saturation, oil composition, aging time, and temperature. It is known in the literature that the degree of wettability alteration towards oil-wetness typically increases with a decrease in the initial water saturation (Sw<sub>i</sub>). Since the Sw<sub>i </sub>in the Indiana limestone core plugs is zero, the wettability state of the cores was &#x201c;strongly oil-wet&#x201d; or &#x201c;SOW&#x201d;. Due to the absence of any water film in the cores during aging, and 100% of the pores being filled with crude oil, the wettability-altering components in the crude oil are strongly adsorbed on the surface of the rock pores. For the cases with Sw<sub>i</sub>&#x3e;0, the final wettability state of the cores after aging is mixed-wet.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0257">After the aging process, the saturated oil-wet core plugs were placed in a custom-designed Amott cell and were filled with various surfactant formulations and placed in the oven operating at 85&#xb0; C. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> depicts the initial state of the core submerged in the surfactant formulation in an Amott cell.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0258"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> compares the performance of six surfactant formulations: F16, F17, F18, F16&#x2032;, F17&#x2032;, F18&#x2032;, and brine. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> specifically plots the percentage of original-oil-in-place recovered as a function of time for these formulations.

Formulation F18&#x2032; showed the best performance in improving the oil recovery with 404.5% increment as compared to the base case.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0261">Based on these results, formulations F16&#x2032;, F17&#x2032;, and F18&#x2032; were further evaluated using mixed-wet (&#x201c;MW&#x201d;) Indiana limestone cores. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> depicts a plot showing the percentage of original-oil-in-place (&#x201c;OOIP&#x201d;) recovered during spontaneous imbibition tests using mixed-wet (&#x201c;MW&#x201d;) cores for formulations F16&#x2032;, F17&#x2032;, and F18&#x2032;.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0262">The total oil recovery at the end of 306 hours for F16&#x2032;, F17&#x2032;, and F18&#x2032; was 28.63% OOIP, 24.43% OOIP, and 52.62% OOIP, respectively. As expected, the recoveries in these mixed-wet (MW) cases were higher than previous cases where the wettability was &#x201c;strongly oil-wet&#x201d;. These show the great potential of these synergistic surfactant blends in improving the oil recovering for tight formations in field applications.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0263">Formulation F18&#x2032; was further evaluated using oil-wet shale cores. A similar experimental procedure was adopted as before. Crude oil droplets were observed on the surface of the shale surface in just a few hours once they were placed in the surfactant formulation as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. The total oil recoveries at the end of 7 days are listed in Table 6. This demonstrates that by utilizing the synergy between surfactants, a significant amount of oil can be recovered from ultra-tight shale rocks via the imbibition of surfactant solutions.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00006" num="00006"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" rowsep="1">TABLE 6</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>% OOIP </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Core Type</entry><entry>Diameter</entry><entry>Length</entry><entry>Recovered</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Eagle Ford</entry><entry>1 inch</entry><entry>6 inches</entry><entry>12.96%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Wolf Camp</entry><entry>1 inch</entry><entry>6 inches</entry><entry>22.40%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0198" num="0264">The dimensions and values disclosed herein are not to be understood as being strictly limited to the exact numerical values recited.
