More particularly, the present invention relates to systems, apparatus and methods for treating dysfunctional sacroiliac (SI) joints and structures proximate thereto.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As is well known in the art, the sacroiliac (SI) joint <b>6</b> comprises a diarthrodial synovial joint, which, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, is defined by the interface between the articular surfaces of the sacrum 2 and the ilium <b>4</b>. Thus, the SI joint <b>6</b> is defined by (and, hence, comprises) portions of the sacrum 2 and ilium <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B-<b>1</b>D</figref>, the SI joint <b>6</b> generally comprises the shape of an inverted capital letter &#x201c;L&#x201d; (denoted &#x201c;<b>13</b>&#x201d;) lying on its side (rather than a triangle), where the long arm of the inverted &#x201c;L&#x201d; <b>15</b> (i.e., SI joint <b>6</b>) is oriented along the posterior wall of the pelvis <b>11</b> (denoted &#x201c;<b>25</b>&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) and is also oriented relatively straight through its entire course. The sacral floor (denoted &#x201c;<b>21</b>&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>), which is defined by the region between the anterior sacral promontory <b>19</b><i>a </i>and the apex <b>19</b><i>b </i>of the sacrum 2, generally slopes downward and laterally at an approximately 30% grade relative to the cephalocaudal axis <b>27</b>.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B and <b>1</b>C</figref>, the short arm of the inverted &#x201c;L&#x201d; (denoted &#x201c;<b>17</b>&#x201d;) is generally oriented parallel to the transverse plane of the L5-S1 lumbosacral joint and limited superiorly by the sacral ala (denoted &#x201c;<b>23</b>&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The apex of the inverted &#x201c;L&#x201d; (denoted &#x201c;<b>29</b>&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) is positioned below the S2 segment region of the sacrum 2 (denoted &#x201c;S2&#x201d;) proximate to the S3 segment region of the sacrum 2 (denoted &#x201c;S3&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">As is also well known in the art, the SI joint further comprises a SI joint dorsal recess or gap <b>7</b> that is disposed between the sacrum 2 and ilium <b>4</b> proximate the S2 segment region of the sacrum 2, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As is further well known in the art, the SI joint further comprises articular cartilage, i.e., hyaline and fibrocartilage, and a strong, extensive ligamentous architecture, which stabilizes the SI joint.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Generally, the articular surfaces of the sacrum 2 and the ilium <b>4</b> that define the SI joint <b>6</b> comprise cortical bone <b>8</b>, which is more compact, dense and hard relative to softer trabecular bone <b>10</b>, which, as further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, is disposed in the interior regions of the sacrum and ilium <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The SI Joint is distinguished from other synovial joints by the atypical articulation of the different articular surfaces of the sacrum and ilium; the articular surface of the sacrum comprising hyaline cartilage and the articular surface of the ilium comprising substantially stronger fibrocartilage.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">As is further well known in the art, the primary plane of motion of the SI joint is anterior-posterior along a transverse axis. The terms often employed to describe the relative motion of the sacrum and ilium are nutation, which refers to anterior-inferior movement of the sacrum while the coccyx (denoted &#x201c;<b>3</b>&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) moves posteriorly relative to the ilium, and counternutation, which refers to posterior-superior movement of the sacrum while the coccyx moves anteriorly relative to the ilium.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In most healthy individuals, the SI joint range of motion in flexion-extension is approximately 3&#xb0;, approximately 1.5&#xb0; in axial rotation and approximately 0.8&#xb0; in lateral bending.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As is well established, the SI joint performs several seminal biomechanical functions. The primary functions of the SI joint are to attenuate loads exerted on the upper body and to distribute the loads to the lower extremities. The SI joint also functions as a shock absorber for loads exerted on spine.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">As is also well established, the noted loads and, hence, forces exerted on the SI joint can adversely affect the biomechanical functions of the SI joint, which can, and often will, result in SI joint dysfunction&#x2014;an often-overlooked musculoskeletal pathology associated with lower back pain.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Indeed, SI joint dysfunction is estimated to be the primary cause of lower back pain in 15-30% of subjects afflicted with such pain. However, lower back pain associated with SI joint dysfunction is suspected to be far more common than most healthcare providers realize, since such pain is often associated with other skeletal and musculoskeletal dysfunctions.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">SI joint dysfunction, and pain associated therewith, can be caused by various SI joint abnormalities and/or disorders, including traumatic fracture dislocation of the pelvis, degenerative arthritis, sacroiliitis, i.e., an inflammation or degenerative condition of the sacroiliac joint; osteitis condensans ilii, and other degenerative conditions of the SI joint structures and associated structures.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Various non-surgical methods, such as administration of pharmacological agents, e.g., the corticosteroid prednisone, and surgical methods and devices, i.e., SI joint prostheses, have been developed and employed to treat SI joint dysfunction and the pain associated therewith.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The most common approach employed to treat SI joint dysfunctions (when non-surgical treatments fail to ameliorate pain associated therewith), at present, is SI joint stabilization, i.e., reinforcing or modulating articulation by and between the sacrum and ilium, via surgical intervention.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">SI joint stabilization typically comprises surgical placement of a bone structure prosthesis proximate to or in a dysfunctional SI joint and is generally characterized by the direction of access to the dysfunctional SI joint, i.e., anterior, posterior or lateral.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Although several conventional SI joint stabilization surgical methods and associated bone structure prostheses have effectively ameliorated pain associated with SI joint dysfunction, there remains many disadvantages associated with the conventional surgical methods and associated bone structure prostheses.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">A major disadvantage associated with many conventional SI joint stabilization surgical methods is that the surgeon is required to make a substantial incision in and through the skin and tissues of a subject to access the dysfunctional SI joint. Often referred to as &#x201c;open surgery&#x201d; methods, these surgical methods have the attendant disadvantages of requiring general anesthesia and often involve increased operative time, pain, hospitalization, and recovery time due to the extensive soft tissue damage. There is also an increased probability of post-surgical complication associated with open surgery methods, such as nosocomial infection.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Minimally-invasive systems and methods for SI joint stabilization have thus been developed to address the noted disadvantages associated with open surgery methods. Although conventional minimally-invasive SI joint stabilization systems and methods, such as the systems and methods disclosed in U.S. Pub. No. 2009/0076551 to Petersen, have garnered some success in relieving pain associated with SI joint dysfunction and have effectively addressed many of the disadvantages associated with open surgery systems and methods, there similarly remains many disadvantages associated with conventional minimally-invasive SI joint stabilization systems and methods.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A major disadvantage associated with many conventional minimally-invasive SI joint stabilization methods is that such methods are difficult to perform and the associated surgical systems often require extensive, system-specific surgical training and experience. Indeed, it has been found that, notwithstanding the level of surgical training and experience that a surgeon may possess, when such conventional minimally-invasive SI joint stabilization systems and methods are employed, there is still a substantial incidence of damage to the lumbosacral neurovascular structures proximate to the SI joint.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A further disadvantage associated with many conventional minimally-invasive SI joint stabilization systems and methods is that they comprise anterior or lateral approaches to the dysfunctional SI joint and, hence, muscles, e.g., gluteal aponeurotic fascia and gluteus medius, and ligaments are typically disrupted, and nerves and blood vessels are susceptible to damage during placement of a bone structure prosthesis in a dysfunctional SI joint.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Further, although some conventional minimally-invasive SI joint stabilization systems comprise a bone structure prosthesis that is adapted to deliver osteogenic material and/or compositions to a bone structure when implanted therein, such as the prostheses disclosed in Applicant's Co-pending U.S. application Ser. Nos. 17/469,132, 17/468,811, and 17/463,831, most, if not all, bone structure prostheses have limited functionality, e.g., not adapted to monitor physiological or biomechanical parameters associated with a bone structure.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">It would thus be desirable to provide improved SI joint stabilization systems, apparatus and methods that substantially reduce or eliminate the disadvantages associated with conventional SI joint stabilization systems, apparatus and methods.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">It is therefore an object of the invention to provide improved SI joint stabilization systems, apparatus and methods that substantially reduce or eliminate the disadvantages associated with conventional SI joint stabilization systems, apparatus and methods.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">It is another object of the invention to provide improved minimally-invasive SI joint stabilization systems and apparatus, and methods of using same, that facilitate posterior placement of bone structure prostheses in and, thereby, stabilization of dysfunctional SI joints.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">It is another object of the invention to provide improved minimally-invasive SI joint stabilization systems and apparatus, including improved bone structure prostheses, which, when employed to stabilize dysfunctional SI joints, disrupt less tissue and muscles, and avoid nerves and large blood vessels.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">It is another object of the invention to provide improved minimally-invasive SI joint stabilization systems and apparatus, including improved bone structure prostheses, which can be readily employed to stabilize dysfunctional SI joints.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">It is another object of the invention to provide improved minimally-invasive SI joint stabilization systems and apparatus, which effectively ameliorate pain associated with SI joint dysfunction.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">It is another object of the invention to provide multi-functional bone structure prostheses that can readily be employed in minimally-invasive SI joint stabilization methods.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">It is
