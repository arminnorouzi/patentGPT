Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to the identification of network topologies based not only on discrete channel estimation measurements but also network-level information such as load and inter-channel interference. In certain embodiments, a preferred topology is identified that results in improved network throughput because of a more dynamic analysis of these measurements.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">B. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Home wireless networks are typically made up of a wide mix of devices: routers, access points (APs), consumer communication devices, IoT devices, video distribution boxes, etc. Traditionally, each wireless network contained a single AP, to which all wireless clients (&#x201c;stations&#x201d; or &#x201c;STAs&#x201d;) connected. However, the limited range of a single AP often places undesirable requirements on its placement inside the home. And, even when these requirements are met, some parts of the home are often still left without strong wireless coverage, typically due to other issues like interference from other nearby APs (e.g., neighbors), or even severe attenuation from obstacles inside the house (e.g., rebar in walls).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Existing methods for coordinated management of such multi-hub networks leave much to be desired. They are typically simple extensions of the methods available for single APs, and do not take into account the competitive nature of the objectives of different APs and/or extenders (collectively referred to as &#x201c;hubs&#x201d;). For example, a station typically connects to the hub with the highest RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator). But that hub may already be overloaded with too many other clients, and it may not be able to provide a high throughput or even a stable connection to its new client. A different hub that is located further away but is only lightly loaded with clients may have been a better choice even though it has a lower RSSI, and yet existing systems typically do not even consider this possibility.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">References will be made to embodiments of the disclosure, examples of which may be illustrated in the accompanying figures.

In prior art systems, the deployed star topology is created based on discrete RSSI measurements between the access point <b>102</b> and each of the extenders <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b</i>. This prior art configuration is oftentimes not an optimal deployment because the measurements (e.g., RSSI) fail to take into account the load on each of the extenders as well as how each connection may negatively affect other connections within the topology such as inter-channel interference and/or cross-talk caused by the wireless connections operating within a shared or overlapping frequency band(s).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a daisy-chained network topology once again based on discrete and independent measurements of connectivity between the extenders <b>212</b><i>a</i>, <b>212</b><i>b </i>and the access point <b>202</b>. This particular daisy-chained topology may not be optimized because of the deficiencies within prior art procedures in defining optimal network topologies.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In embodiments, the stations <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b>-<b>114</b><i>a</i>-<b>3</b>, <b>114</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b>-<b>114</b><i>b</i>-<b>2</b>, <b>214</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b>-<b>214</b><i>a</i>-<b>3</b>, <b>214</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b>-<b>214</b><i>b</i>-<b>2</b> may be user devices and include a wide variety of applications, ranging from tasks that require low speed with low latency and very high reliability (e.g., remote lighting solutions) to tasks that demand continuous high-speed connectivity with high reliability, but where low latency (in the millisecond range) is not that important (e.g., constantly-streaming high-definition security cameras). In embodiments, these new applications may communicate the network via the AP and extender(s). For instance, the station <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b> may communicate data to the network <b>101</b> through one extender <b>112</b><i>a </i>and one AP <b>102</b>, i.e., the data flows <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b>&#x2192;<b>112</b><i>a</i>&#x2192;<b>102</b>&#x2192;<b>101</b> or vice versa. In another example, the station <b>214</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b> may communicate data to the network <b>201</b> through the two extenders and one AP: <b>214</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b>&#x2192;<b>212</b><i>b</i>&#x2192;<b>212</b><i>a</i>&#x2192;<b>202</b>&#x2192;<b>201</b> or vice versa. In the system <b>100</b>, each of the extenders <b>112</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>b </i>may be directly coupled to the AP <b>102</b> to form a star topology. In the system <b>200</b>, the extenders <b>212</b><i>a </i>and <b>212</b><i>b </i>may be communicatively coupled to the AP <b>202</b> in a daisy chain topology, i.e., the extender <b>212</b><i>b </i>may communicate data with the AP <b>202</b> via the extender <b>212</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In embodiments, the components in the system <b>100</b> (or <b>200</b>) may communicate with each other through a wireless communication channel. In the system <b>100</b>, each extender (&#x201c;hub&#x201d;) may connect directly to an AP and extend the communication range to problematic areas. For instance, the extender <b>112</b><i>a </i>in the system <b>100</b> may provide wireless communications for the STAs <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b>-<b>114</b><i>a</i>-<b>3</b> that may be located in the area <b>130</b><i>a</i>, where the AP <b>102</b> may not be able to communicate directly with the devices in the area <b>130</b><i>a</i>. Similarly, the extender <b>112</b><i>b </i>may cover the area <b>103</b><i>b</i>, where the AP <b>102</b> is not able to directly communicate data with the devices in the area <b>103</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In embodiments, each of the AP <b>102</b> (<b>202</b>) and/or extenders <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>b </i>(<b>212</b><i>a</i>-<b>212</b><i>b</i>) has its own radio(s), its own connectivity rules, and its own performance objectives. In conventional systems, the connections between the APs and extenders are configured without taking into account these characteristics of the AP and extenders. As such, in conventional systems, different hubs often end up with competing objectives, with unwanted results such as multiple devices vying for the same frequency channels, or a net reduction of usable spectrum available to stations due to the need for hubs to communicate wirelessly with each other.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The following example illustrates methods in which throughput is measured instead of a discrete RSSI measurement in defining a network topology for the one access point and two extenders that share a single band or have overlapping bands.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">EXAMPLE 1</heading><heading id="h-0008" level="1">One AP and Two Extenders that Share One Frequency Band</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In embodiments, a system that includes one AP and two extenders, three possible topologies may be possible:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0031">1.

The first extender, E<b>1</b>, is connected to the AP, and the second extender, E<b>2</b>, is connected to E<b>1</b> (daisy chain), as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0033">3. E<b>2</b> is connected to the AP, and E<b>1</b> is connected to E<b>2</b> (similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, with E<b>1</b> and E<b>2</b> roles reversed).</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0032" num="0034">In embodiments, one of the three topologies that maximizes the minimum of connection received-signal-strength-indicator (RSSI) values in the resulting network may be selected, i.e., the topology that defines the selected cost function of this optimization approach as max{min(RSSI)}. In this method, the solution may be described as follows: If both E<b>1</b> and E<b>2</b> measure a higher RSSI from the AP than from the other extender (E<b>2</b> or E<b>1</b>, respectively), they connect directly to the AP, resulting in the star topology, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. But if at least one of the extenders E<b>1</b> and E<b>2</b> measures a higher RSSI from the other extender compared to the RSSI measured from the AP, then that extender will want to connect to the other extender, which in turn will connect to the AP <b>202</b>. If both extenders want to connect to each other, that would not result in a viable topology, because there would be no connection to the AP <b>202</b>; therefore, the extender with the higher RSSI to the AP <b>202</b> will be forced to connect to the AP <b>202</b>, in order to create a viable topology. In either case, the resulting topology will be a daisy chain, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>: the extender (e.g. <b>212</b><i>a</i>) that measures either (i) a higher RSSI from the AP <b>202</b> than from the other extender <b>212</b><i>b </i>or (ii) the higher RSSI from the AP <b>202</b> among the two extenders, will connect to the AP <b>202</b>, and the other extender <b>212</b><i>b </i>will connect to the extender <b>212</b><i>a </i>that connects to the AP <b>202</b>. In embodiments, instead of RSSI, the direct throughput measurements between the extenders may be used instead of the RSSI to improve this method.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0035">In the method described above, the cost function of maximizing the minimum RSSI value between hubs may be practical and easy to optimize. This method does not consider the fact that, if the path between the AP and one of the extenders (say E<b>2</b>) is a multi-hop (daisy chain topology, i.e., AP&#x2194;E<b>1</b>&#x2194;E<b>2</b>), and if both connections operate in the same frequency band (for example, because of heavy interference in the other bands), the end-to-end throughput between the AP and E<b>2</b> may be T<b>1</b>A*T<b>21</b>/(T<b>1</b>A+T<b>21</b>), where T<b>1</b>A and T<b>21</b> are the throughput values for connections from E<b>1</b> to the AP and from E<b>2</b> to E<b>1</b>, respectively). In this case, it may be better to directly connect E<b>2</b> to AP than to E<b>1</b> (star topology, i.e., E<b>1</b>&#x2194;AP&#x2194;E<b>2</b>), even if E<b>2</b> measures a higher RSSI from E<b>1</b> than from the AP. If the throughput of E<b>2</b> to AP is T<b>2</b>A, and T<b>2</b>A is only a little lower than T<b>1</b>A, then the resulting throughput will be min(T<b>1</b>A,T<b>2</b>A)=T<b>2</b>A, which is higher than T<b>1</b>A*T<b>21</b>/(T<b>1</b>A+T<b>21</b>), even if T<b>2</b>A is lower than T<b>21</b>. For example, if T<b>1</b>A=100, T<b>21</b>=100, and T<b>2</b>A=80, then the daisy-chain topology in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> results in a throughput of 50, while the star topology in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> results in a throughput of 80.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0036">As such, in the case where the connections between AP&#x2194;E<b>1</b> and E<b>1</b>&#x2194;E<b>2</b> use the same frequency band, the direct throughput measurements between the extenders may be used instead of RSSI, to thereby modify the method for selecting a topology. In other words, max{min(Tput)}, where Tput is the throughput from the AP to each extender, is a better cost function than max{min(RSSI)}, because it maximizes the minimum throughput from the AP to the extenders.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts a first daisy-chained topology in which an access point <b>302</b> is coupled to a first extender <b>312</b><i>a</i>, which is coupled to a second extender <b>312</b><i>b</i>. When compared to the method of defining a topology in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> which only use RSSI measurements, the topologies in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>5</b></figref> result from a more dynamic modeling of the network where other factors are also considered, including load and inter-channel interference. The channel responses between the access point <b>302</b> and the extenders <b>312</b> are measured. In addition, measurements taken across the network, such that inter-channel interference and network load, are also included in defining a preferred network configuration. In addition, band allocation may be adjusted across these connections to further increase throughput as a result of further improvements of inter-channel interference.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts a second daisy-chained topology in which an access point <b>402</b> is coupled to a second extender <b>412</b><i>b</i>, which is coupled to the first extender <b>412</b><i>a</i>. As discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, measurements are taken that not only account for discrete channel response measurements but also inter-channel interference and load are measured across the entire network. This resulting topology may also allocate different bands between the extenders and the access point to further increase overall throughput.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts a star topology in which an access point <b>502</b> is coupled directly to a first extender <b>512</b><i>a </i>and second extender <b>512</b><i>b</i>. This topology may be identified as a result of channel measurements, network inter-channel interference and load. The result of this more dynamic modeling of network performance provides a more accurate depiction of the network and identifies a preferred topology that improves overall throughput. Exemplary network scenarios and corresponding channel measurements, inter-channel infringement and load are described later in this application to highlight the improved overall throughput of the network when a more dynamic model is used in deployment of network topologies.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a possible scenario in which load across a first extender <b>612</b><i>a </i>and a second extender <b>612</b><i>b </i>is asymmetric. In this example, the load across the two extenders is highly disproportionate which will result in traffic to/from the first extender being significantly larger than the traffic to/from the second extender. This asymmetric traffic may result in heavy cross-talk between channels if they are shared between components. Additionally, the unequal load may be disproportionately balanced if a selected network topology does not take this into account.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates the effect of asymmetric load and inter-channel interference across channels within a network. As shown, the channel between the first extender <b>712</b><i>a </i>and access point <b>702</b> is significantly more congested than the channel between the second extender <b>712</b><i>b </i>and the access point <b>702</b>. As shown, the traffic stream from the first extender <b>712</b><i>a </i>contains only a single unused window for transmission of traffic while the traffic stream from the second extender <b>712</b><i>b </i>contains many unused windows. This unbalanced traffic load may not only bog down a single node within a network topology but may also result in significant inter-channel interference. Accordingly, various procedures are described below in which this type of information is analyzed to define a particular topology and frequency band allocation to enhance overall network throughput.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">EXAMPLE 2</heading><heading id="h-0010" level="1">One AP and Two Extenders and Two Frequency Bands</heading><p id="p-0040" num="0042">Systems <b>300</b>, <b>400</b>, <b>500</b> may use two frequency bands for communication. For instance, the system may operate under the following conditions:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0043">1.

As such, a topology with higher throughput than the star topology in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> may be selected for communication.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0046">In embodiments, the total load on E<b>1</b> may be also considered to select the topology. If E<b>1</b> has many devices already connected to it, the airtime of E<b>1</b> that is available for E<b>2</b> may be low, let's say 20%. Therefore, the effective throughput from E<b>2</b> to AP in the daisy-chain topology in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> may end up being only 29 (20% of 143), which is again lower than the throughput achieved with the star configuration.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0047">In other words, in embodiments, the cost function may need to be modified to incorporate the load of individual extenders in addition to the nominal throughput in the determination of the optimal topology. In embodiments, such an approach may be achieved by considering the load on each extender in the computation of the corresponding effective throughput. This approach may modify the cost function indirectly, by modifying the throughput function that is used in the cost function.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">EXAMPLE 3</heading><heading id="h-0012" level="1">One AP and Two Frequency Bands</heading><p id="p-0044" num="0048">A communication system may include a single AP and support wireless links to multiple stations, in two frequency bands, such as the 2G and the 5G bands, and use band steering. Band steering is the process by which an AP encourages a station to connect using a particular band (in this case 2G or 5G) in order to improve overall performance.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0049">In embodiments, one method for band steering is to minimize interference, which is defined as the number of timeslots that are already occupied in a particular band. In one example, the AP may see that the interference in the 2G band is at 70% (for instance, because several devices are already connected that are only capable of operating in the 2G band), while in the 5G band the interference is only 30%. In such a case, the AP may instruct a dual-band station (i.e., one capable of operating in both the 2G and 5G bands) that is connected in the 2G band to switch to the 5G band.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0050">However, the station in question may, in fact, be unable to connect to the AP in the 5G band under the particular conditions it is experiencing. For example, the station may be located just outside the range of the 5G band of the AP. Or the station may be experiencing heavy interference in the 5G band from a neighbor's 5G AP, which is located just far enough away to be invisible to the station's own AP (and therefore not be correctly accounted for in the interference calculations). In such a case, if the AP instructs the station to connect in the 5G band, the station may drop its connection, which is a highly undesirable result.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0051">In embodiments, the interference minimization cost function may be modified by adding the constraint that connection drops may be kept below an acceptable threshold. Then, the AP may keep a history of past connection drops for each station and disable band steering for stations that are in danger of dropping their connections to the AP.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">EXAMPLE 4</heading><heading id="h-0014" level="1">One AP and Two Channels</heading><p id="p-0048" num="0052">The communication system may include one AP that communicates with multiple stations through two channels. For the purpose of illustration, it is assumed that the AP is connected to multiple stations in the 5G band, for instance.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0053">Station STA may be located fairly close to the AP and therefore has a high RSSI. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a plot <b>800</b> of throughput as a function of RSSI. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, station STA may be located at a point where it is using channel <b>149</b>. On channel <b>149</b>, the AP transmission power is 23 dBm and the RSSI is &#x2212;54 dBm, but the interference is high (e.g., 60%). The point A <b>810</b> in the plot <b>800</b> represents the (hypothetical) channel condition where the station STA has no interference and uses channel <b>149</b>. But when the interference is taken into account, station STA is actually represented by point <u style="single">A</u> <b>812</b>, so its actual throughput is significantly lower. If the AP decides to reassign station STA to channel <b>36</b>, station STA may move to a point <u style="single">B</u> <b>816</b>, where the interference of the channel is low (e.g., 20%). The transmit power of the AP on channel <b>36</b> is 6 dB lower at 17 dBm, but the RSSI is still very high at &#x2212;60 dBm, and the significantly lower interference means that the throughput of station STA may approximately double by moving from channel <b>149</b> to channel <b>36</b>. In the plot <b>800</b>, the point B <b>814</b> represents the (hypothetical) channel condition where the station STA uses channel <b>36</b> and has no interference.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0054">Station STA may be located further away from the AP. It is assumed that station STA is using channel <b>149</b> and the point C <b>820</b> corresponds to the channel condition of station STA where the interference is still 60%. As depicted, the RSSI is significantly lower at &#x2212;74 dBm, and so is its throughput, compared to the condition at the point A <b>812</b>. In the plot <b>800</b>, the point C <b>818</b> represents the (hypothetical) channel condition where station STA uses channel <b>149</b> and does not have any interference. If the AP re-assigns station STA to channel <b>36</b>, the channel condition moves from the point C <b>820</b> to the point D <b>822</b>. By changing the channel, the interference is reduced to 20%, but the lower AP transmit power (by 6 dB) may push the RSSI of station STA to a low enough level (&#x2212;80 dBm) that station STA may lose connectivity and its throughput may go down to zero.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0055">In embodiments, the cost function of minimizing the interference, i.e., min(interference), may result in an undesirable disconnect event. Therefore, in embodiments of the present invention, the cost function may be augmented by taking into account the uplink RSSI (to determine whether the station is in a high RSSI or low RSSI location) and the AP transmit power (which acts as a proxy for the downlink RSSI).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0056">As illustrated by the examples described above, in embodiments, generalizing existing cost functions that involve metrics, such as RSSI or interference, by adding constraints on additional metrics, such as dropped connections, load, transmit power, and throughput, may result in significant improvements in the performance of wireless networks.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0057">In one or more embodiments, aspects of the present patent document may be directed to, may include, or may be implemented on one or more information handling systems (or computing systems).
