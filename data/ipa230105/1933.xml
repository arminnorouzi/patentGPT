For example, a vehicle velocity may be continuously tracked over time to estimate the relative position of a vehicle as the vehicle maneuvers from one position to another. That is, from a given position, the speed and direction of the vehicle may be continuously updated to track the path or trajectory along which the vehicle is traveling. In some instances, the path or trajectory may be determined relative to a map (e.g., as part of localization) to determine the position (e.g., pose) of the vehicle relative to the map. Accurate localization is important for various operations, such as for determining proper next maneuvers for a vehicle to execute (e.g., to stay on drivable surfaces, to avoid obstacles, to successfully maneuver to a destination, etc.), and as such, accurate velocity determinations are also important. In some instances, velocity may be determined using various approaches, some of which may rely on sensors, such as steering sensors, yaw rate sensors, and the like. However, some sensor data may introduce noise or other inaccuracies into the velocity calculation, which can affect localization and/or other downstream processes that use the velocity determination(s).</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The detailed description is described with reference to the accompanying figures.

This application relates to techniques for using multiple velocities at different points of a vehicle to estimate a velocity of the vehicle at a reference point (e.g., a centralized reference point). The velocities at different points may be determined in various manners, and in some examples, variables associated with vehicle wheels (e.g., linear velocity or speed at a wheel and orientation of the wheel) are used to estimate velocity of a vehicle. In examples of the disclosure, a wheel orientation and a linear speed during a maneuver may be determined for a wheel of the vehicle. Furthermore, a yaw rate (e.g., from an inertial measurement unit, gyroscope, etc.) of the vehicle during the turn maneuver may also be determined. Examples of the present disclosure include, based on the velocities at different points on the vehicle (e.g., based on variables associated with the wheels) and the yaw rate associated with the turn maneuver, estimating a vehicle velocity (e.g., v<sub>x</sub>, v<sub>y</sub>) during the turn maneuver. In at least some examples, the velocity of the vehicle may be used by various downstream components, such as to determine or update a pose of a vehicle as part of a localization operation.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As a vehicle traverses through an environment (e.g., when maneuvering along a roadway, searching for a parking spot, actively parking, etc.), the vehicle often executes a series of maneuvers, and as the maneuvers are executed, it can be useful to track sequential positions of the vehicle. In some instances, tracking and iterating sequential positions may enable a determination of relative positions of the vehicle over time. For example, from a given initial position, sequential positions may be tracked and combined to determine a current position of the vehicle relative to the initial position. In additional examples, such as where a map represents the environment in which the vehicle is maneuvering and a pose (e.g., position and orientation) relative to the map is determined, the sequential positions may be tracked relative to the map in order to monitor the movement of the vehicle through (relative to) the environment.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Positions of a vehicle may be determined using various techniques. In examples of the present disclosure, the vehicle velocity (e.g., speed and direction) may be continuously determined as the vehicle executes driving maneuvers, and a vehicle velocity may be used to iteratively update the position of the vehicle. In this way, the positions may be linked together, one after the next, to track a position of the vehicle. For instance, in at least some examples, a vehicle velocity is determined in association with a turn maneuver, which may be combined with a subsequent vehicle velocity determined in association with a subsequent turn maneuver. According to some techniques describe herein, the vehicle velocity may be estimated based on the yaw rate and variables associated with the wheels, such as the linear speed of the vehicle at the wheels and the estimated wheel angles (or some other velocity associated with the wheel). In other examples, velocities of the vehicle at different points on the vehicle may be based on data received from sensors associated with those different points (e.g., sensors mounted at different points along a bumper or undercarriage frame).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In examples of the present disclosure, a speed of the vehicle at the wheels and during the turn maneuver is determined. The speed of the vehicle at a wheel may be determine using various techniques. For example, the speed at a wheel may be based on sensor data from a wheel encoder or other sensor. In examples of the present disclosure, a speed of the vehicle at multiple wheels may be determined (e.g., at two wheels, three wheels, four wheels, etc.), and as explained below, the speeds may be used (with other variables) to determine a vehicle velocity.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In addition to determining the speed of the vehicle at the wheels, examples of the present disclosure include determining the angle or orientation of the wheels during the turn maneuver. In examples, the speed and the wheel angle may represent a velocity. A wheel angle may be determined using various techniques. For example, in some instances, the wheel angle may be determined based on steering sensor data. In some examples of the present disclosure, the wheel angle may be determined or estimated based on non-steering variables (e.g., variables that are independent of a steering system). As used in this disclosure, the angle of a wheel is an angle between the orientation of the wheel (e.g., a direction in which the wheel is pointed) and the longitudinal orientation or axis of the vehicle. In examples of this disclosure, a yaw rate (e.g., from an inertial measurement unit, gyroscope, etc.), a linear speed at or near a wheel speed (e.g., from an encoder), and vehicle dimensions (e.g., distance between the wheel and a turn-center reference line), can be used to estimate the angle of the wheel. Among other things, angles estimated based on non-steering variables may provide redundancy (e.g., when determined in parallel with steering-based angles) and validation and may be less susceptible to inaccuracies from steering-component slippage and/or loss of tire traction, model inaccuracies, and the like. In addition, estimated wheel angles may be used in various manners, such as for estimating vehicle velocity.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A vehicle may include various steering components used to affect or control an angle of a vehicle wheel. For example, a vehicle may include a steering motor that generates a rotational output, which is transferred to a wheel and/or to linear travel of a steering rack. A steering sensor may measure the rotation of the steering motor, and the rotation may be used to determine (e.g., from a correlation between rotation and linear rack travel) steering rack travel (or other steering data associated with a command angle of the wheel). In other examples, steering rack travel may be directly measured or may be derived from other sensor data associated with the steering system or the suspension assembly. This steering data (e.g., motor rotation data, rack travel distance, etc.) may in turn be used to estimate an angle of a wheel. In some instances, steering components (e.g., belts, racks, pinions, gear teeth, etc.) may experience slippage (e.g., mechanical slip) that can affect the accuracy of the steering-based estimated angle. In other instances, the wheel may lose traction against pavement, which can cause an inconsistency between the angle commanded by the vehicle and the actual angle.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In examples of this disclosure, by using non-steering variables to estimate a wheel angle, the determination may avoid or mitigate inaccuracies that can arise from relying solely on the steering system (e.g., inaccuracies arising from steering-component component slippage or wear, loss of tire traction, model-predication inaccuracies, etc.). For example, determining the estimated wheel angle based on the yaw rate, linear velocity, and vehicle dimensions may, in some instances, provide a more accurate estimate as opposed to relying solely on steering sensor data, which can be noisy or affected by mechanical slippage in the steering components (e.g., belts, links, joints, knuckles, etc.). The estimated angle may be used in various respects to control vehicle operations. For example, as indicated above, the estimated angle may be used to determine vehicle velocity. In addition, the estimated angle may be compared to a commanded wheel angle to determine whether the commanded wheel angle was executed. As used in this disclosure, a &#x201c;commanded wheel angle&#x201d; is a wheel angle generated by one or more vehicle components and selected for executed by the vehicle. For example, a trajectory planner may select a trajectory (e.g., turn maneuver) to be executed by the vehicle, and the trajectory may include a wheel angle (e.g., the commanded wheel angle) at which a wheel should be turned (e.g., by using steering components) in order to execute the trajectory. In other examples, a steering wheel may be rotated to a degree that correlates with a wheel angle (e.g., the commanded wheel angle), which can be attempted using the steering motor, rack, and/or other steering components. Based on these examples, the commanded wheel angle may be generated or provided by the trajectory planner and/or by the steering components. For example, the commanded wheel angle may be an angle that is provided by (or retrieved from) a vehicle-trajectory planner, steering components (e.g., steering sensor, steering motor, and/or steering rack), or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In examples of the disclosure, by comparing the estimated angle to the commanded wheel angle, the reliability of various information and components may be assessed. For example, the reliability of the commanded wheel angle (e.g., for downstream processing when estimating vehicle velocity) may be assessed, as well as the condition of the steering components (e.g., where sufficient differences between the estimated angle and the commanded wheel angle may suggest component wear, slippage, etc.). In further examples, a difference (e.g., variance) between the estimated angle and the commanded angle may be used to detect and/or flag conditions, such as wheel slip. In additional examples, the estimated angle from non-steering variables may be combined with the commanded angle (e.g., averaged) for use by downstream components (e.g., localization). In addition, the estimated angle may be directly used (e.g., independent of commanded angle) by downstream processes to determine vehicle position or other vehicle states (e.g., velocity), which may be used for localization or other map-related operations. In some examples, a difference may be determined between an estimated wheel angle and a commanded angle and operations that use (e.g., rely on or consume) the wheel angle could be augmented (e.g., increased or decreased accordingly) by the difference.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In examples of this disclosure, once variables associated with wheels have been determined, a set of variables (associated with the turn maneuver) may exist for one or more wheels of the vehicle, including the speed at the wheel and the wheel angle. For example, in association with a four wheeled vehicle, a set of variables may include a speed for a first wheel (e.g., Vw<b>1</b>); an angle for the first wheel&#x2014;or another representation thereof such as a sine of the angle&#x2014;(e.g., Sw<b>1</b>); a speed for a second wheel (e.g., Vw<b>2</b>); an angle (or another representation thereof such as a sine of the angle) for the second wheel (e.g., Sw<b>2</b>); a speed for a third wheel (e.g., Vw<b>3</b>); an angle (or another representation thereof such as a sine of the angle) for the third wheel (e.g., Sw<b>3</b>); a speed for a fourth wheel (e.g., Vw<b>4</b>); and an angle (or another representation thereof such as a sine of the angle) for the fourth wheel (e.g., Sw<b>4</b>). Collectively then, the set of variables associated with the vehicle wheels during the turn maneuver may include, in some examples, Vw<b>1</b>, Sw<b>1</b>, Vw<b>2</b>, Sw<b>2</b>, Vw<b>3</b>, Sw<b>3</b>, Vw<b>4</b>, and Sw<b>4</b>. In examples of the present disclosure, these variables are used in combination with the yaw rate to determine a vehicle velocity (e.g., velocity in x or &#x201c;v<sub>x</sub>&#x201d; and velocity in y or &#x201c;v<sub>y</sub>&#x201d;) at a central reference point. For example, a technique in the present disclosure includes applying an optimization, such as a least squares optimization (e.g., Gauss-Newton method), to determine or solve for a vehicle velocity at the central reference point that best matches the set of variables associated with the vehicle wheels. In at least some examples, the optimization is based on the relationship between the velocity of two points fixed on a rigid body (e.g., the velocities at the wheel and the central reference point on the rigid body of the vehicle). That is, a function representing rigid body dynamics may be used to estimate or predict variables associated with the vehicle wheels, and the optimization may minimize the difference between the predicted variables and the measured variables (e.g., Vw<b>1</b>, Sw<b>1</b>, Vw<b>2</b>, Sw<b>2</b>, Vw<b>3</b>, Sw<b>3</b>, Vw<b>4</b>, and Sw<b>4</b>). Among other things, using an optimization may account for measurement noise among the set of variables, as well as outlier variables.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As described above, at least some examples of the present disclosure may determine a velocity at different points on a vehicle (e.g., at wheels of the vehicle) based on a wheel speed and wheel angle. In some examples, the velocity at different points on the vehicle may be determined in other manners, such as based on sensors (e.g., doppler, cameras, etc.) mounted at those different points. As such, where velocities associated with multiple points on the vehicle are used to estimate the velocity at a reference point, a similar optimization may be used to minimize the difference between the velocities associated with those points (e.g., based on sensor data) and the predicted velocities (based on the function). As a non-limiting example, various optical techniques (e.g., bundle adjustment, feature tracking, etc.) may be implemented using camera data from a camera at a point on the vehicle pointed towards the ground to estimate the speed (or velocity) of the vehicle associated with the point where the camera is mounted based on such camera data (images). In such examples, the measured data may be used in the techniques described herein.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The techniques described herein can be implemented in a number of ways to determine vehicle velocity using variables associated with vehicle wheels. In addition, at least some examples include using non-steering variables to estimate wheel angle. Examples are provided below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C and <b>2</b>-<b>5</b></figref>. Examples are discussed in the context of autonomous vehicles; however, the methods, apparatuses, and components described herein can be applied to a variety of components (e.g., a sensor component or a robotic platform), and are not limited to autonomous vehicles. In one example, the techniques described herein may be utilized in driver-controlled vehicles. Furthermore, the techniques described herein can be used with real data (e.g., captured using sensor(s)), simulated data (e.g., generated by a simulator), or any combination of the two.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates a vehicle <b>102</b><i>a/b/c </i>progressing through a series of positions in an environment <b>100</b> as the vehicle traverses along a trajectory <b>14</b>. For illustration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the vehicle is identified by reference numeral <b>102</b><i>a </i>(vehicle <b>102</b><i>a</i>) at time n&#x2212;3 and at a first position along the trajectory <b>14</b>; the vehicle is identified by reference numeral <b>102</b><i>b </i>(vehicle <b>102</b><i>b</i>) at time n and at a second position along the trajectory <b>14</b>; and the vehicle is identified by reference numeral <b>102</b><i>c </i>at time n+3 and at a third position along the trajectory <b>14</b>. In some examples, the operations of the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a/b/c </i>to traverse along the trajectory <b>14</b> may include multiple turn maneuvers. For example, the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a </i>may execute a first turn maneuver, which includes wheels (e.g., front wheels) rotated to one or more first angles or orientations, and the vehicle <b>102</b><i>b </i>may execute a second turn maneuver, which includes the wheels (e.g., front wheels) rotated to one or more second angles or orientations that are different from the first.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The vehicle <b>102</b><i>a/b/c </i>may include various components, and referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B and <b>1</b>C</figref>, additional examples of the vehicle <b>102</b> (representing the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a/b/c</i>) are depicted. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> depicts a perspective view of the vehicle <b>102</b>, which is ghosted in broken lines to help illustrate internally positioned components; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> presents a plan view of the vehicle <b>102</b>, in some examples. Among other things, the vehicle <b>102</b> includes a front end <b>104</b>, a rear end <b>106</b>, a left side <b>108</b>, and a right side <b>110</b>. In addition, for reference in this disclosure, the vehicle <b>102</b> includes a longitudinal axis <b>112</b> extending along a front-to-back orientation (e.g., longitudinal orientation) and a lateral axis <b>114</b> extending along a side-to-side orientation (e.g., lateral orientation) and substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis <b>112</b>. Furthermore, a vertical axis <b>116</b> may extend top-to-bottom and perpendicular to the longitudinal axis <b>112</b> and to the lateral axis <b>114</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> also depicts a yaw action <b>118</b>, which indicates the vehicle <b>102</b> may rotate relative to the vertical axis <b>116</b>, such as when the vehicle <b>102</b> executes a turn. For example, the vehicle <b>102</b> includes four wheels <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<b>120</b><i>d</i>, each oriented in a direction indicated by a respective directional arrow <b>122</b><i>a</i>-<b>122</b><i>d</i>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B and <b>1</b>C</figref>, the front wheels <b>120</b><i>a </i>and <b>120</b><i>b </i>are depicted rotated at a command angle towards the left in a direction indicated by a respective directional arrow <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b</i>. The placement of the yaw action <b>118</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates an example, and the vehicle <b>102</b> a yaw action, yaw event, or yaw rotation may occur at various locations or positions of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one example, the vehicle <b>102</b> is a bidirectional vehicle having a first drive module positioned in the front end <b>104</b> and a second drive module positioned in the rear end <b>106</b>. As used herein, a bidirectional vehicle is one that is configured to switch between traveling in a first direction of the vehicle and a second, opposite, direction of the vehicle. In other words, there is no fixed &#x201c;front&#x201d; or &#x201c;rear&#x201d; of the vehicle <b>102</b>. Rather, whichever longitudinal end of the vehicle <b>102</b> is leading at the time becomes the &#x201c;front&#x201d; and the trailing longitudinal end becomes the &#x201c;rear.&#x201d; In other examples, the techniques described herein may be applied to vehicles other than bidirectional vehicles. Also, whether or not the vehicle is bidirectional, the first drive and second drive modules may be different from one another. For example, one drive module may have a subset of the features of the other drive module. In one such example, the first drive module may include a first, comprehensive set of vehicle systems (e.g., drive motor, battery, steering system, braking system, suspension system, HVAC, sensors, lights, body panels, facia, etc.) while the second drive module includes a limited subset of vehicle systems (e.g., suspension system, braking system, sensors, lights, and facia). In various instances, the wheels positioned in the front end <b>104</b> are steerable, and the wheels positioned in the rear end <b>106</b> are also steerable, such that the vehicle <b>102</b> includes four-wheel steering (e.g., including each set of wheels having the respective steering components). In other examples, the drive modules may have one or more distinct or mutually exclusive vehicle systems (e.g., one drive module has an HVAC system and the other drive module has a drive motor). As another non-limiting example of such, one module may have a first HVAC system while the other drive module has a second HVAC system that is different from the first HVAC system.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In addition, the vehicle <b>102</b> may include various sensors for detecting one or more different conditions. For example, the vehicle <b>102</b> may include sensors <b>124</b><i>a</i>-<b>124</b><i>d</i>, each of which may include a perception sensor for capturing data of an environment around the vehicle <b>102</b> (e.g., lidar, camera, time-of-flight, sonar, radar, etc.). These sensors <b>124</b><i>a</i>-<b>124</b><i>d </i>may be used for various operations, such as object detection, route planning, localization, etc. In at least one example, the vehicle <b>102</b> may also include a yaw rate sensor <b>125</b>, such as an inertial measurement unit (IMU), gyroscope, or other sensor for measuring a yaw rate of the vehicle <b>102</b>. The position of the yaw rate sensor <b>125</b> is an example, and the yaw rate sensor <b>125</b> may include various other positions or locations of the vehicle <b>102</b>. In a further example, the vehicle <b>102</b> may include one or more sensors <b>126</b><i>a</i>-<b>126</b><i>d </i>(e.g., wheel encoders) for measuring a wheel speed of a respective wheel (e.g., determining a linear speed of the vehicle <b>102</b> at a wheel). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the sensors <b>126</b><i>a </i>and <b>126</b><i>c </i>are depicted in broken lines to convey that, in some examples, the sensors <b>126</b><i>a </i>and <b>126</b><i>c </i>may be obscured behind a respective wheel (at least from the perspective provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>). These are just some examples of sensors, and the vehicle may include other sensors, such as those described with respect to the system <b>500</b>. In addition, the placement of the sensors relative to the vehicle <b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is an example, and in other examples, the sensors (e.g., <b>124</b><i>a</i>-<b>124</b><i>d</i>, <b>125</b>, and <b>126</b><i>a</i>-<b>126</b><i>d</i>) may be arranged at other positions on the vehicle <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In additional examples, the vehicle <b>102</b> may include various steering components, such as a steering motor <b>128</b> and a steering rack <b>130</b> that operate to affect a commanded angle of each wheel <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<b>120</b><i>d </i>(e.g., autonomously commanded and/or manually commanded). For example, the steering motor <b>128</b> may generate a rotational output based on steering input (e.g., direction and amount) from a manually operated steering wheel (not shown), from a computing device (e.g., planning <b>536</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), or from a combination thereof. The rotational output may be transferred to the steering rack <b>130</b> to create linear steering rack travel in one direction or another. The steering rack <b>130</b> may interface with each wheel at a knuckle of the suspension assembly or some other coupling that transfers the linear rack travel to the wheel to cause the wheel to pivot or rotate about an axis. In examples, the vehicle <b>102</b> may include one or more steering sensors <b>132</b> for determining steering data associated with the commanded angle of each of the wheels <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<b>120</b><i>d</i>. For example, the steering sensor <b>132</b> may determine an amount of steering-motor rotation, an amount of steering rack travel, or other data, which may be related to the commanded angle of each wheel. That is, in some instances, a commanded angle may be selected for execution, and the commanded angle may correlate with an amount of steering motor rotation and/or rack travel. As such, in some examples, a commanded angle may be determined based on given steering data by referencing the correlation. In other examples, a correlated command angle that is based on the steering data may be compared to a command angle selected by or received from another component (e.g., trajectory planner) to assess consistency. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, a steering assembly is depicted in the front end <b>104</b> and rear end <b>106</b> of the vehicle. In other aspects, only one end of the vehicle may include a steering assembly while the other end is fixed. Alternative aspects of the disclosure may include a different steering arrangement. For example, each suspension assembly may include a respective steering motor that, without a shared or common steering rack, affects the command angle of a wheel (e.g., by rotating about a steering axis). As such, the steering motor rotation may affect the wheel command angle without relying on the shared or common steering rack.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some instances, steering components may be used to impart an angle on one or more wheels of the vehicle <b>102</b>, such as when the vehicle is executing a turn (e.g., one of the turn maneuvers in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> the front wheels <b>120</b><i>a </i>and <b>120</b><i>b </i>are rotated to the left. In addition, the steering components may impart the actual wheel angle based on a commanded wheel angle from another component (e.g., trajectory planner, manual steering wheel, etc.) or the steering sensor data may be used to determine a commanded angle based on a correlation. However, in some instances, such as loss of tire traction, mechanical slip of steering components, component noise or inaccuracies, the commanded angle (e.g., from the other component or based on the steering data correlation) may not accurately reflect the actual angle of each wheel. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, the actual orientations of the front wheels <b>120</b><i>a </i>and <b>120</b><i>b </i>are illustrated with the directional arrows <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b</i>; however, the orientations reflected by the commanded angles <b>132</b><i>a </i>and <b>132</b><i>b </i>(also indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> by &#x398;&#x2033; and &#x398;&#x2033;&#x2032;) are indicated by the broken-line command arrows <b>134</b><i>a </i>and <b>134</b><i>b </i>and are inconsistent with the actual-orientation arrows <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b</i>. As such, some examples of the present disclosure are directed to estimating a wheel angle (e.g., <b>136</b><i>a</i>/&#x398; and <b>136</b><i>b</i>/&#x398;&#x2032;) of a wheel (e.g., <b>120</b><i>a </i>and <b>120</b><i>b</i>) based on non-steering variables, and in some examples, the estimated wheel angle based on non-steering variables may be used to determine the velocity of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, motion of the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a/b/c </i>may be described in various ways. In one example, each turn maneuver may be associated with a respective arc or circular segment. That is, when the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a/b/c </i>is executing a turn maneuver and each wheel is at a respective angle, an assumption may be made that the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a/b/c </i>rotates around a center of a circle (e.g., the turn center) along the arc. Under this assumption, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a </i>rotates along an arc and around a turn center <b>16</b> of a first circle <b>18</b> (e.g., along a segment of the first circle <b>18</b>). In addition, the vehicle <b>102</b><i>b </i>rotates along an arc and around a turn center <b>20</b> of a second circle <b>22</b> (e.g., along a segment of the second circle <b>22</b>). In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the wheels (e.g., front wheels) of the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a </i>may be turned to a lesser degree than the wheels of the vehicle <b>102</b><i>b</i>, as illustrated by the radius <b>24</b> of the first circle <b>18</b> being larger than the radius <b>26</b> of the second circle <b>22</b>. As such, the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a </i>can be described as executing a first turn maneuver (associated with the wheels turned to the lesser degree), and the vehicle <b>102</b><i>b </i>can be described as executing a second turn maneuver (associated with the wheels turned to the greater degree).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In examples of the disclosure, a first velocity (e.g., speed and direction) may be determined with respect to the first turn maneuver, and a second velocity (e.g., speed and direction) may be determined with respect to the second turn maneuver (as well as, in some examples, velocities of the vehicle when transitioning from the first velocity to the second velocity). Based on the velocities, the motion and relative position of the vehicle may be tracked and used in various operations. For example, the first velocity may be used by a localization component <b>26</b><i>a </i>to determine a pose <b>28</b><i>a </i>of the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a </i>at time n&#x2212;3, and the second velocity may be used by a localization component <b>26</b><i>b </i>to determine a pose <b>28</b><i>b </i>of the vehicle <b>102</b><i>b </i>at time n. Among other things, the pose of the vehicle at different times may be combined with map data to track vehicle movement through, and interaction with, the environment <b>100</b>. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a </i>includes a map component <b>30</b><i>a </i>with a map at n&#x2212;3 32a (e.g., of the environment <b>100</b>), and the vehicle <b>102</b><i>b </i>includes a map component <b>30</b><i>b </i>with a map at n <b>32</b><i>b </i>(e.g., of the environment <b>100</b>). In examples, the pose <b>28</b><i>a </i>may be combined with the map data <b>32</b><i>a</i>, and the pose <b>28</b><i>b </i>may be combined with the map data <b>32</b><i>b</i>. For instance, the pose and map data may be use by the planner <b>34</b><i>a </i>and <b>34</b><i>b </i>to generate and output one or more proposed trajectories <b>36</b><i>a </i>and <b>36</b><i>b </i>for the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a/b/c</i>, which may be used to compile the trajectory <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Examples of the present disclosure include determining a vehicle velocity of the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a/b/c </i>associated with a turn maneuver. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, various elements are schematically depicted in the context of the vehicle <b>102</b> executing a curved trajectory <b>200</b> (or turn maneuver, such as the first or second turn maneuver depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>), which is illustrated by the dashed line circles in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a reference point <b>205</b> of the vehicle <b>102</b> is depicted, and in some examples, the reference point <b>205</b> is a known central position on the vehicle <b>102</b> (e.g., the center of the vehicle <b>102</b>) for generally characterizing one or more states of the vehicle <b>102</b> (e.g., states of the vehicle relating to localization or other operations, such as a pose of the vehicle at which the vehicle includes a velocity). In addition, dimensions associated with the vehicle <b>102</b> are known, such as a distance from the reference point <b>205</b> to each of the wheels <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<b>120</b><i>d. </i></p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">At least some examples of the present disclosure are directed to estimating a vehicle velocity (v<sub>x</sub>, v<sub>y</sub>) at the reference position <b>205</b> based on velocities at multiple points of the vehicle. For example, the velocities at multiple points may be based on variables associated with the wheels <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<b>120</b><i>d </i>(e.g., wheel angle (or some representation of the angle such as a sine of the wheel angle) and linear speed at the wheel). In other examples, velocities at multiple points may be based on other data (e.g., bumper mounted sensor). For example, consider the following Equation 1 (based on the velocity of two points fixed on a rigid body)</p><p id="p-0034" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Vw=Vb+&#x3c9;&#xd7;BW</i>&#x2003;&#x2003;(2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0035" num="0000">where the velocity at a wheel (Vw), such as magnitude and direction, is equal to the velocity at the reference point <b>205</b> (Vb), plus the cross product between a first vector associated with the yaw rate (&#x3c9;) and a second vector (e.g., position vector) between the wheel (W) and the reference point <b>205</b> (B). In other words, from a given velocity (v<sub>x</sub>, v<sub>y</sub>) at the reference position <b>205</b>, a velocity (e.g., magnitude and orientation) at each of the wheels (or other point) may be generated. Thus it follows that, based on Equation 2, where the yaw rate is known, as well as the velocity at one or more of the points or wheels (e.g., Vw<b>1</b>, Sw<b>1</b>, Vw<b>2</b>, Sw<b>2</b>, Vw<b>3</b>, Sw<b>3</b>, Vw<b>4</b>, and Sw<b>4</b>), the velocity (v<sub>x</sub>, v<sub>y</sub>) at the reference position <b>205</b> can be solved that best matches these known measurements. In some examples, because more measurements (e.g., yaw rate, Vw<b>1</b>, Sw<b>1</b>, Vw<b>2</b>, Sw<b>2</b>, Vw<b>3</b>, Sw<b>3</b>, Vw<b>4</b>, and Sw<b>4</b>) are known than unknown (e.g., Vb or (v<sub>x</sub>, v<sub>y</sub>)), an optimization (e.g., a least squares optimization (e.g., Gauss-Newton method)) may be used to determine or solve for the vehicle velocity (v<sub>x</sub>, v<sub>y</sub>) that best matches the set of variables associated with the vehicle wheels. This vehicle velocity may then be used by downstream components for various operations (e.g., localization). Among other things, using an optimization may account for measurement noise among the set of variables, as well as outlier variables. As such, as explained below, at least some examples of the present disclosure are directed to determining a speed of the vehicle at each wheel (e.g., Vw<b>1</b>, Vw<b>2</b>, Vw<b>3</b>, and Vw<b>4</b>) and an angle or orientation (or sine thereof) of each wheel (e.g., Sw<b>1</b>, Sw<b>2</b>, Sw<b>3</b>, and Sw<b>4</b>).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0033">In at least some examples of this disclosure, a yaw rate (&#x3c9;) <b>218</b> may be received from a yaw rate sensor (e.g., IMU, gyroscope, etc.). In addition, a speed at each wheel (e.g., linear velocity (V) <b>243</b> (or Vw<b>1</b>) and linear velocity (V&#x2032;) <b>244</b> (or Vw<b>2</b>)) may be derived from a variety of different sources. For example, in some instances, linear velocity at each wheel (e.g., Vw<b>1</b>, Vw<b>2</b>, Vw<b>3</b>, and Vw<b>4</b>) may be derived from data received from a respective wheel encoder (or other sensor, such as radar).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0034">In addition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts different variables, dimensions, and relationships, which may relate to determining an estimated wheel angle of each wheel (e.g., estimated wheel angles <b>136</b><i>a </i>and <b>136</b><i>b</i>). For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a turn center <b>204</b>. In at least some examples, techniques of the present disclosure may estimate the location of a turn center <b>204</b> of the curved trajectory <b>200</b> (e.g., based on commanded wheel angles, vehicle dimensions, and geometric relationships). For example, the wheel angle for each wheel may be based on the commanded angles from a planner and/or wheel angles provided by steering components. In some examples, the wheel angles may be combined with vehicle dimensions (e.g., wheelbase) to determine the turn center <b>204</b> based on the position at which the radius (R) <b>247</b> from the wheel <b>120</b><i>a </i>intersects the radius (R&#x2032;) <b>246</b> from the wheel <b>120</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0038" num="0035">In addition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a turn-center reference line <b>140</b> (see also the turn-center reference line <b>140</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>), which extends through the turn center <b>204</b> and normal to the longitudinal axis <b>112</b> of the vehicle <b>102</b>. Further, based on the dimensions of the vehicle <b>102</b>, an offset distance <b>142</b> for the wheel <b>120</b><i>b </i>and an offset distance <b>251</b> for the wheel <b>120</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>C and <b>2</b></figref>) extends perpendicularly from the turn-center reference line <b>140</b> to the center of the wheel <b>120</b><i>b</i>. In general, the offset distances <b>142</b> and <b>251</b> extend from the wheel (e.g., a rotation axis of the wheel) to a position aligned with the turn center <b>204</b> and/or the turn-center reference line <b>140</b> (e.g., aligned along a plane or line extending through the turn center <b>204</b> and normal to the longitudinal orientation of the vehicle).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0036">The turn center <b>204</b> and the turn-center reference line <b>140</b> may be established using various techniques. For example, if a vehicle is executing a turn using only front-wheel steering (while the rear wheel do not rotate about a steering axis), such as the vehicle <b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> in which the front left wheel <b>120</b><i>b </i>and the front right wheel <b>120</b><i>a </i>rotate about a steering axis, then the turn-center reference line <b>140</b> is co-axial with a rear axle of the vehicle, and the offset distance may be pre-determined based on vehicle dimensions. In other examples, as explained above, the turn center <b>204</b> may also be at an intersection of the radius (R&#x2032;) <b>246</b> (e.g., of the curve or arc traversed by the front left wheel <b>120</b><i>b</i>) and the radius (R) <b>247</b> (e.g., of the curve or arc traversed by the front right wheel <b>120</b><i>a</i>). As indicated, these radii (and the resulting turn center) may be initially estimated from various data, such as the commanded angles the vehicle is attempting to execute (e.g., as provided by or retrieved from a trajectory planner and/or steering component). While some degree of error may exist in this initial estimate of the turn center, which is based on the commanded angles, in many instances it may only exist in the lateral orientation, which would still provide an accurate offset distance <b>142</b> based on the turn-center reference line <b>140</b> being in the same location regardless of the lateral position of the turn center. In addition, in some instances, the turn center <b>204</b> may be determined using only two radii generated from respective commanded angles (even if the vehicle is using four-wheel steering), such that noisier commanded angles may be omitted (or given less weight) when determining the turn center <b>204</b> and offset distance <b>142</b>. Furthermore, an average turn center may be determined, which may also reduce the impact of an imprecise or inaccurate commanded steering angle on the offset distance determination.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts additional variables with respect to each of the front wheels <b>120</b><i>a </i>and <b>120</b><i>b</i>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts an estimated wheel angle <b>136</b><i>a </i>(&#x398;<sub>EA</sub>) associated with the wheel <b>120</b><i>a</i>, as well as a central angle <b>249</b> (&#x398;<sub>CA</sub>) between the turn-center reference line <b>140</b>, the turn center <b>204</b>, and a radius (R) <b>247</b> intersecting the center of the wheel <b>120</b><i>a</i>. In addition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts an estimated wheel angle <b>136</b><i>b </i>(&#x398;<sub>EA</sub>&#x2032;) associated with the wheel <b>120</b><i>b</i>, as well as a central angle <b>248</b> (&#x398;<sub>CA</sub>&#x2032;) between the turn-center reference line <b>140</b>, the turn center <b>204</b>, and a radius (R&#x2032;) <b>246</b> intersecting the center of the wheel <b>120</b><i>a</i>. In examples, the estimated wheel angle associated with a wheel is equal to the central angle associated with the wheel. Based on the non-steering variables depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, various functions may be expressed to describe relationships among the variables.

As such, using Function <b>4</b>, an estimated wheel angle <b>136</b><i>a </i>(&#x398;<sub>EA</sub>) between the orientation of the wheel and the vehicle longitudinal orientation <b>112</b> may be calculated based on non-steering variables including the offset distance (B) <b>251</b>, the linear wheel velocity (V) <b>243</b>, and the yaw rate (&#x3c9;) <b>218</b>. In addition, using Function <b>4</b> with a respective linear wheel velocity <b>244</b>, an estimated wheel angle <b>136</b><i>b </i>(&#x398;<sub>EA</sub>&#x2032;) may be calculated for the wheel <b>120</b><i>b</i>. Furthermore, where the vehicle <b>102</b> is executing a front-wheel only turn maneuver, the estimated wheel angles for the wheels <b>120</b><i>c </i>and <b>120</b><i>d </i>may be determined to be 0 degrees.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0039">In examples of the present disclosure, based on the above, variables associated with each wheel <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<b>120</b><i>d </i>of the vehicle <b>102</b> may be determined, including the linear velocity (e.g., speed or wheel speed) of the vehicle <b>102</b> at each wheel (e.g., Vw<b>1</b>, Vw<b>2</b>, Vw<b>3</b>, and Vw<b>4</b>, which may be determined based on sensor data), as well as the estimated wheel angle of each of the wheels or sine thereof (e.g., Sw<b>1</b>, Sw<b>2</b>, Sw<b>3</b>, and Sw<b>4</b>, which may be determined based on Equation 4). In at least some examples, the variables associated with each wheel <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<b>120</b><i>d </i>(e.g., Vw<b>1</b>, Sw<b>1</b>, Vw<b>2</b>, Sw<b>2</b>, Vw<b>3</b>, Sw<b>3</b>, Vw<b>4</b>, and Sw<b>4</b>) are used to determine the vehicle velocity (v<sub>x</sub>, v<sub>y</sub>) at the position <b>205</b>. For example, as indicated above and based on Equation 1, a least squares method may be used to solve for the velocity that best matches the variables (e.g., by using a function and a given vehicle velocity to output variables associated with each wheel). In some instances, for the velocity of each wheel (Vw), two different factors may be constructed, including a velocity magnitude, which can be compared to the speed (e.g., from the sensor), and an orientation. That is, in some examples, when solving Equation 1 in the least squares method, the velocity at each wheel (Vw) may be represented as magnitude and orientation, since those variables can be matched against the known or measured variables. In at least some examples, a loss function (e.g., Cauchy loss function) may be added on residuals related to the velocity magnitude, which may help address outliers (e.g., such as when a wheel slips). In some examples, the sines of the angles (e.g., estimated wheel angle and orientation output by the function of the solver) may be compared when determining residual values and finding the best match. As indicated above, using a least squares method may help reduce an impact of noise and outliers (e.g., sensor noise, wheel slip, etc.) on the vehicle velocity determination.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0040">In further examples, an estimated wheel angle determined using non-steering variables may be used in various manners. For example, an estimated wheel angle <b>136</b><i>a </i>and <b>136</b><i>b </i>may be calculated for each wheel <b>120</b><i>a </i>and <b>120</b><i>b </i>using Function <b>3</b>, which may provide additional insight into the actual motion of the vehicle. Among other things, the estimated wheel angles may provide redundancy (e.g., when determined in addition to commanded angles from other systems) or may be directly used to control vehicle operations. In some examples, the estimated wheel angle <b>136</b><i>a </i>and <b>136</b><i>b </i>for each wheel <b>120</b><i>a </i>and <b>120</b><i>b </i>may be compared to a commanded angle <b>132</b><i>a </i>and <b>132</b><i>b </i>for each wheel. The comparison may be used in various manners. For example, the comparison may be used to determine whether the estimated wheel angle and/or the command angle are reliable. In some examples, if a difference (e.g., variance) between the estimated angle and the commanded angle exceeds a threshold, then the commanded angle may be down weighted (e.g., given a lower weight or give zero weight) in subsequent processes (e.g., dead reckoning algorithm or other localization processes; velocity calculations; etc.). In some examples, as indicated above, one or more of the estimated wheel angles may be used to estimate a vehicle velocity. That is, one or more of the estimated wheel angles may be used in a least squares method or algorithm to estimate the vehicle velocity. Among other things, vehicle velocity may be used to estimated relative positions (e.g., pose) of the vehicle as the vehicle executes one or more maneuvers, and in this respect, the relative position may be at least partially based on the estimated wheel angle. In some examples, a relative position of the vehicle may be based at least partially on the estimated wheel angle with or without solving for the vehicle velocity based on the least squares method.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0041">In other examples, if a difference (e.g., variance) between the estimated angle and the commanded angle exceeds a threshold, then a slip event (e.g., wheel slip, mechanical slippage, vehicle skid, etc.) may be flagged (e.g., recorded, reported, tracked, etc.) indicating the subject wheel may have lost traction or slipped or the steering components controlling the command angle may have experienced mechanical slippage. For example, when one or more tires lose traction, then a yaw rate may be higher than the wheels have commanded to. In other words, the wheels may be commanded to a particular angle that, without a loss in traction, are expected to result in a particular yaw rate; however, when a loss in traction occurs, the yaw rate may be higher, which could result in a different estimated wheel angle. This in turn may generate a signal to the vehicle to regain control, such as by adjusting the steering, applying brakes, reducing an acceleration, powering opposite wheels, depressing or releasing a throttle, etc. In further examples, if a total count or frequency of slip events exceeds a threshold, then maintenance may be suggested (e.g., check tire tread or steering components). In additional examples, if slip events are flagged at multiple wheels, then a vehicle-skid event may be flagged indicating the vehicle skidded across a ground surface. In additional examples, the estimated command angle from non-steering variables may be combined with the measured command angle (e.g., averaged) for use by downstream components (e.g., localization).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0042">In addition, the estimated angle may be directly used (e.g., independent of measured command angle) by downstream processes to determine vehicle position, which may be used for localization or other map related operations (e.g., pose estimation). In other examples, the estimated angle may be used to determine or quantify other conditions associated with a wheel suspension assembly. For example, in some examples, a relationship may exist between the command angle of the wheel, a ride height of the vehicle at the wheel (e.g., damper displacement), and a ball-joint articulation angle (e.g., associated with a ball joint in the suspension assembly), such that the command angle may be used in combination with a ball-joint articulation angle to estimate the vehicle ride height. In at least one example, the estimated command angle may be used (e.g., in combination with ball joint sensor data) to estimate vehicle ride height as described in U.S. application Ser. No. 17/246,375 (titled &#x201c;Determining Vehicle Ride Height Using A Ball Joint Sensor&#x201d; and filed Apr. 30, 2021), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and for all purposes.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, another example is depicted including a schematic of a vehicle <b>302</b> executing a curved trajectory <b>300</b>, which is illustrated by the dashed line circles. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the vehicle <b>302</b> includes four-wheel steering, such that the front wheels <b>320</b><i>a </i>and <b>320</b><i>b </i>and the back wheels <b>320</b><i>c </i>and <b>320</b><i>d </i>pivot or rotate about a respective steering axis to an angle when executing the curved trajectory. In examples of this disclosure, as between the vehicle <b>102</b> executing two-wheel steering and the vehicle <b>302</b> executing four-wheel steering, the respective turn-center reference lines may be different; however, estimated wheel angles may still be determined based on yaw rate, wheel linear velocity, and offset.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0044">For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the curved trajectory <b>300</b> includes a turn center <b>304</b>, and a turn-center reference line <b>340</b>, which extends through the turn center <b>304</b> and normal to the longitudinal axis <b>312</b> of the vehicle <b>302</b>. As explained above, the turn center <b>304</b> and the turn center-reference line <b>340</b> may be determine in various manners, such as based on the commanded angles of the wheels (e.g., at an intersection of a radius of two or more of the wheels). In addition, where the left-side wheels (e.g., front-left wheel and back-left wheel) include similar angles (except in different directions) and the right-side wheels (e.g., front-right wheel and back-right wheel) includes similar angles (except in different directions), then the turn-center reference line <b>340</b> may bisect a gap spacing apart the front axle and the rear axle. Furthermore, based on the dimensions of the vehicle <b>302</b>, an offset distance <b>342</b> extends perpendicularly from the turn-center reference line <b>340</b> to the center of each wheel. In further examples, a radius <b>346</b> of the curve or arc traversed by each wheel extends from the turn center <b>304</b> to the respective wheel. In additional examples, as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a yaw rate (&#x3c9;) <b>318</b> may be received from a yaw rate sensor (e.g., IMU, gyroscope, etc.) and a linear wheel velocity (V) <b>344</b> may be received from an encoder (or other sensor). In examples, a linear velocity for each wheel may be based on sensor data (e.g. wheel encoder). With these non-steering variables, Function <b>4</b> illustrated above may be solved for the wheel <b>320</b><i>c </i>to calculate an estimated command angle <b>336</b><i>c</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates the variables as they relate to the wheel <b>320</b><i>c</i>, and similar (but respective) variables may be determined for each of the other wheels <b>320</b><i>a</i>, <b>320</b><i>b</i>, and <b>320</b><i>d </i>to calculate a respective estimated command angle for each wheel.

The process includes, at step <b>402</b><i>a</i>, determining a trajectory for a vehicle to follow to navigate a turn maneuver. For example, the planner <b>34</b><i>a/b </i>or the planner <b>536</b> may determine a trajectory (e.g., <b>104</b> or curved trajectory <b>200</b>) for the vehicle <b>102</b> or <b>502</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0047">Step <b>404</b><i>a </i>includes determining, based at least in part on first sensor data from a first sensor, a yaw rate of the vehicle during the turn maneuver. For example, a yaw rate <b>218</b> may be based on sensor data from a yaw rate sensor <b>125</b>. In addition, at step <b>406</b><i>a</i>, the process <b>400</b><i>a </i>includes determining, in association with a first wheel of the vehicle, (a) a first speed indicating a velocity of the vehicle associated with the first wheel during the turn maneuver; and (b) a first wheel angle indicating an orientation of the first wheel during the turn maneuver. For example, a linear speed (e.g., <b>243</b> or Vw<b>1</b>) associated with the wheel <b>120</b><i>a </i>may be determined from a wheel encoder <b>126</b><i>a </i>or other sensor. In addition, an estimated wheel angle <b>136</b><i>a </i>(or <b>0</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>) of the wheel <b>120</b><i>a </i>may be determined based on non-steering variables, such as by using Equation 4 (e.g., based on the linear velocity (e.g., <b>243</b> or Vw<b>1</b>) at the associated with the wheel <b>120</b><i>a</i>, the yaw rate (e.g., <b>218</b>), and the offset distance (B) <b>251</b>.

For example, a linear speed (e.g., <b>244</b> or Vw<b>2</b>) associated with the wheel <b>120</b><i>b </i>may be determined from a wheel encoder <b>126</b><i>b </i>or other sensor.

For example, based on the Equation 1 (e.g., predicted wheel velocities (e.g., speed and angle) generated by a function based on Equation 1), an optimization (e.g., least squares optimization (e.g., Gauss-Newton method)) may be used to determine the velocity at the centralized point <b>205</b> that best matches the variables associated with the wheels determined in steps <b>406</b><i>a </i>and <b>408</b><i>a</i>.

For example, the process <b>400</b><i>b </i>may be used to determine an estimated wheel angle <b>136</b><i>b </i>of the wheel <b>120</b><i>b </i>of the vehicle <b>102</b> or the estimated wheel angle <b>136</b><i>a </i>of the wheel <b>120</b><i>a</i>. The process <b>400</b><i>b </i>includes, at step <b>402</b><i>b</i>, determining a linear velocity at a wheel, and the pictorial representation associated with step <b>402</b><i>b </i>depicts the linear velocity (V) while the wheel <b>420</b><i>b </i>is turned to an orientation represented by the vector arrow.

In some examples, the offset distance <b>142</b> may be based on the dimensions and geometry of the vehicle <b>102</b>. For example, if the vehicle is executing a front-wheel steering turn (e.g., by rotating only front wheels while rear wheels remain aligned in the longitudinal orientation) then the turn-center reference line <b>440</b> may pass through (e.g., be co-axial with) the rear axle and the offset distance, based on vehicle dimensions, is the shortest distance between the wheel and the turn-center reference line <b>440</b>. In another example, if the vehicle is executing a four-wheel steering turn, with left-side wheels rotated to similar angles (but in different directions) and right-side wheels rotate to similar angles (but in different directions), then the turn-center reference line may bisect the space between the front and rear axle and the offset distance is, based on vehicle dimensions, the shortest distance between the wheel and the turn-center reference line. In some examples, the offset distance may be determined by estimating a turn center (e.g., based on commanded wheel angles of two or more wheels) and a position of a turn-center reference line (based on the estimated turn center), and then determining the offset distance from the estimated position of the turn-center reference line.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0055">In addition, at <b>408</b><i>b</i>, the process <b>400</b><i>b </i>includes determining the estimated wheel angle (&#x398;).

In at least some examples, at step <b>410</b><i>b</i>, the estimated command angle is compared to a commanded wheel angle (e.g., from a trajectory planner and/or based on steering components) to determine whether the command angle is within a threshold value of the estimated wheel angle. If the measured command angle is within the threshold value (&#x201c;Yes&#x201d; at step <b>410</b><i>b</i>), then at step <b>412</b><i>b</i>, the vehicle may be controlled based on the commanded wheel angle.

If the commanded angle is not within the threshold value (&#x201c;No&#x201d; at step <b>410</b><i>b</i>), then at step <b>414</b><i>b</i>, the vehicle may be controlled based on the estimated wheel angle. For example, a weight value associated with the measured command angle may be reduced (e.g., receive a lower weight or zero weight) for use with downstream components based on a lower confidence in the measured command angle. In some examples, at step <b>414</b><i>b</i>, the commanded wheel angle and the estimated wheel angle may be combined (e.g., averaged) and the vehicle may be controlled based on the averaged wheel angle.

For example, the estimated wheel angle may be used in combination with one or more other estimated wheel angles (e.g., using a least squares method) to estimate a vehicle velocity, which may be used for determining relative positions as the vehicle maneuvers. In some examples, a difference may be determined between an estimated wheel angle and a commanded angle and operations that use (e.g., rely on or consume) the wheel angle could be augmented (e.g., increased or decreased accordingly) by the difference.

The command angle monitor <b>530</b> may communicate the estimated wheel angle(s) to other systems (e.g., localization component <b>524</b> and/or velocity determiner <b>525</b>) or may use the estimated command angle to validate a measured command angles. The command angle monitor <b>530</b> may include (or interface with) a steering component <b>537</b> for determining steering data, such as a rack travel distance, steering motor rotation, etc. In some examples, the command angle monitor <b>530</b> may compare an estimated wheel angle to a measured command angle, and if the difference (e.g., variance) exceed a threshold, may trigger a slip event or communicate the difference (e.g., variance) in a manner that down weights the measured command angle. Furthermore, the command angle monitor <b>530</b> may also execute other operations described in this disclosure, including those described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B, <b>1</b>C, and <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0073">The prediction component <b>534</b> can generate one or more probability maps representing prediction probabilities of possible locations of one or more objects in an environment.

In some instances, the prediction component <b>534</b> can measure a track of an object and generate a discretized prediction probability map, a heat map, a probability distribution, a discretized probability distribution, and/or a trajectory for the object based on observed and predicted behavior. In some instances, the one or more probability maps can represent an intent of the one or more objects in the environment.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0074">The planner <b>536</b> can determine a path for the vehicle <b>502</b> to follow to traverse through an environment. For example, the planner <b>536</b> can determine various routes and paths and various levels of detail. In some instances, the planner <b>536</b> can determine a route to travel from a first location (e.g., a current location) to a second location (e.g., a target location). For the purpose of this discussion, a route can be a sequence of waypoints for traveling between two locations. As non-limiting examples, waypoints include streets, intersections, global positioning system (GPS) coordinates, etc. Further, the planner <b>536</b> can generate an instruction for guiding the autonomous vehicle along at least a portion of the route from the first location to the second location. In at least one example, the planner <b>536</b> can determine how to guide the autonomous vehicle from a first waypoint in the sequence of waypoints to a second waypoint in the sequence of waypoints. In some examples, the instruction can be a path, or a portion of a path. In some examples, multiple paths can be substantially simultaneously generated (i.e., within technical tolerances) in accordance with a receding horizon technique. A single path of the multiple paths in a receding data horizon having the highest confidence level may be selected to operate the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0075">In other examples, the planner <b>536</b> can alternatively, or additionally, use data from the perception component <b>520</b> and/or the prediction component <b>534</b> to determine a path for the vehicle <b>502</b> to follow to traverse through an environment. For example, the planner <b>536</b> can receive data from the perception component <b>520</b> and/or the prediction component <b>534</b> regarding objects associated with an environment. Using this data, the planner <b>536</b> can determine a route to travel from a first location (e.g., a current location) to a second location (e.g., a target location) to avoid objects in an environment. In at least some examples, such a planner <b>536</b> may determine there is no such collision free path and, in turn, provide a path which brings vehicle <b>502</b> to a safe stop avoiding all collisions and/or otherwise mitigating damage.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0076">The memory <b>518</b> can further include a maps component <b>538</b> that can be used by the vehicle <b>502</b> to navigate within the environment.

A map can further include an object identifier, an object classification, a three-dimensional location, covariance data (e.g., represented in image data or a multi-resolution voxel space), and the like. In some instances, a map can include, but is not limited to: texture information (e.g., color information (e.g., RGB color information, Lab color information, HSV/HSL color information), and the like), intensity information (e.g., LIDAR information, RADAR information, and the like); spatial information (e.g., image data projected onto a mesh, individual &#x201c;surfels&#x201d; (e.g., polygons associated with individual color and/or intensity)), reflectivity information (e.g., specularity information, retroreflectivity information, BRDF information, BSSRDF information, and the like).
