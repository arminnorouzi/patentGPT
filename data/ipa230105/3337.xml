However, wheeled movable bases can be problematic if the wheels allow for unwanted movement. Wind and other forces can move or turn an umbrella out of a desired position, especially when supported on a wheeled base.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One aspect of the present disclosure is an movable base that includes a first frame that includes a set of wheels, such as caster wheels. The movable base also includes a second frame that is actuatable relative to the first frame. The second frame includes a plurality of feet or other structures that contact the ground to lift the first frame and the wheels out of the contact with the ground surface and thereby fix the position of the umbrella. A screw actuator couples between the second frame and the first frame to transition the movable base between a braked configuration with the second frame contacting the ground and a movable configuration with the second frame lifted above the ground and the movable base resting on the wheels.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to another aspect, the movable base can include a lever arm that is coupled at one end with a screw of the screw actuator. Rotation of the screw in a first direction can actuate the lever to move the movable base into the braked configuration. Rotation of the screw in the opposite direction can actuate the lever to move the movable base into the movable configuration. The screw actuator can be accessible by a user through an outer cover by a user.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another embodiment, a movable base is provided that includes a first frame assembly, a second frame assembly, a cover and an actuator. The first frame assembly includes an upper channel member and two spaced apart lower channel members. The lower channel members each couple with a wheel assembly. The second frame assembly can be coupled with the first frame assembly. The second frame assembly can include a lever and a plurality of feet coupled with the lever. The cover can enclose the first frame assembly and the second frame assembly. The actuator can be accessible at an outside surface of the cover. The actuator can be configured to move a first end of the lever to cause the feet to be extended in a direction away from a bottom surface of the lower channel members to cause the feet to bear at least a portion of the weight of the movable base. The feet thus provide a braking effect reducing or eliminating movement of the movable base.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, a movable base has a cowl forming a cover.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, the movable base has a superstructure. The superstructure can be disposed between the cowl or other cover and internal components, such as a frame assembly.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the movable base can have a superstructure having one or more walls for containing a portion of an actuator. In some embodiments, the movable base can have a superstructure having one or more support surface for containing and/or supporting a portion of the actuator.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the movable base can have an actuator that comprises a screw having a first end coupled with a lever and a second end having a driver interface. The second end can be accessible at an outside of the cover.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the movable base can have one or more slots disposed through a frame assembly and one or more shafts or slides disposed through the slots. The shafts or slides can transfer pivoting motion of the lever to vertical motion of the feet.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the movable base can have a transverse member coupled with the lever. The transverse member can have or be coupled with feet at each end thereof. The transverse member can be coupled with shafts or slides of a frame assembly at spaced apart locations between the feet. The transverse member can move along a travel distance within one or more lower channel members upon actuation of an actuator.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Features of the invention can be better understood from the following detailed description when read in conjunction with the accompanying schematic drawings, which are for illustrative purposes only.

The mounting portion <b>112</b> may be located directly in the center of the movable base <b>110</b> or elsewhere thereon. The mounting location <b>112</b> can include an aperture, such as a cylindrical aperture, for receiving a lower end of an upright pole of an umbrella assembly. The mounting location <b>112</b> can also include one or more apertures for receiving screws that further secure a position of the upright pole. In certain implementations, the movable base <b>110</b> can include ballast tanks or weights (not shown).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The movable base <b>110</b> can include an exterior or outer cowl <b>111</b>. The cowl <b>111</b> can be removable. When not removed, the cowl <b>111</b> covers any underlying structures that provide support to the movable base <b>110</b> and one or more frame members, as discussed further herein. The cowl <b>111</b> can be made out of a thin plastic material, or other type of material. The cowl <b>111</b> can include an aperture aligned with the mounting location <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The movable base <b>110</b> can include an actuator that can be accessed through the cowl <b>111</b>. The actuator can be a screw actuator <b>120</b> in one embodiment. The screw actuator <b>120</b> can be accessible through an aperture <b>113</b> in the exterior cowl <b>111</b>. The aperture <b>113</b> may include an additional removable or movable cover to block access to the screw actuator <b>120</b> when not in use. The screw actuator <b>120</b> can be accessible through an upper side of the cowl <b>111</b>. In other implementations, the screw actuator <b>120</b> can be located on a front or side surface of the movable base <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref> illustrate internal components of the movable base <b>110</b> with the exterior cowl <b>111</b> removed for clarity to show a superstructure <b>114</b>. The superstructure <b>114</b> can comprise a plurality of support structures that provide rigidity and strength to the movable base <b>110</b> including the mounting location <b>112</b>. The superstructure <b>114</b> can include a plurality of radial and/or circumferential ribs that extend outwardly from the mounting location <b>112</b> to an outer periphery of the movable base <b>110</b>. The ribs of the superstructure <b>114</b> can be vertically oriented and/or include one or more additional linking ribs therebetween. Other configurations for the superstructure <b>114</b> are also contemplated herein.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The screw actuator <b>120</b> can include a screw member <b>121</b> and a matching threaded member, such as a screw plate <b>122</b>. The screw plate <b>122</b> can be coupled in a fixed manner with the superstructure <b>114</b> (or alternatively with a first or fixed frame of the movable base as described below). The screw plate <b>122</b> can be positioned on a supporting surface, feature projection, slot or other mechanical support or supporting member <b>114</b>a of the superstructure <b>114</b> and/or fixed thereto. The supporting member <b>114</b><i>a </i>for the screw plate <b>122</b> can be located between the radial ribs of the superstructure <b>114</b>. Optionally, the screw plate <b>122</b> can be fixed to the superstructure <b>114</b> or to another a rigid structure of the movable base <b>110</b> by one or more mechanical fasteners such as screws, bolts, clasps, or the like. The screw plate <b>122</b> can include an aperture having one or more threads therein that receive and mate with exterior threads of the screw <b>121</b>. Accordingly, rotation of the screw <b>121</b> relative to the screw plate <b>122</b> cause the linear motion of the screw <b>121</b> through the plate <b>122</b>. The screw <b>121</b> can be mounted vertically and can move along the vertical direction, either up or down, depending on the direction of rotation. The screw <b>121</b> can extend through an aperture <b>114</b><i>b </i>in the supporting member <b>114</b><i>a</i>. The lower end of the screw <b>121</b> can be engaged with a second or movable frame <b>130</b> of the movable base <b>110</b>, as described further below. Although the screw <b>121</b> and screw plate <b>122</b> is one advantageous manner of actuating a braking assembly of the movable base <b>110</b> other mechanisms providing a load, e.g., a linear load, a vertical load, a compressive load, can be used to actuate the braking assembly.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the movable base <b>110</b> with the exterior cowl <b>111</b> and the superstructure <b>114</b> removed to illustrate a first or fixed frame <b>150</b> and a second or movable frame <b>130</b>.

The axis <b>136</b> can be located within the upper member <b>152</b><i>a</i>. A first end of the lever member <b>132</b> can be connected with the lateral member <b>131</b> outside of the upper member <b>152</b><i>a</i>. A second end of the lever member <b>132</b> can be engaged with a pivot point <b>138</b> (e.g., extending through a cutout portion of the upper member <b>152</b><i>a</i>).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As discussed further below, the hollow space defined in the upper member <b>152</b><i>a </i>can correspond to a pivot distance of the lever arm. In other words, the portion of pivot arm adjacent to the lateral member <b>131</b> sweeps a circumferential path that is accommodated by the top and bottom inside surface of the upper member <b>152</b><i>a </i>a path with a first end of the circumferential path corresponding to a free rolling state and a second end of the circumferential path corresponding to a braked state with no or limited rolling or movement. The height of the internal space of the upper member <b>152</b><i>a </i>can be the same as the height of the internal space of the first and second lower members <b>152</b><i>b</i>, <b>152</b><i>c</i>. The height of the internal space of the upper member <b>152</b><i>a </i>can be less than the height of the internal space of the first and second lower members <b>152</b><i>b</i>, <b>152</b><i>c </i>when the axis <b>136</b> is closer to the lateral member <b>131</b> than to the pivot point <b>138</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The pivot point <b>138</b> can comprise a cylindrical member to reduce friction with the second end of the lever member <b>132</b>. The pivot location <b>138</b> can be coupled with a first translating member <b>134</b>. The first translating member <b>134</b> can be configured to move vertically either up and down relative to the first frame <b>150</b>. The cylindrical member of the pivot point <b>138</b> can reduce friction with the first translating member <b>134</b>. The first translating member <b>134</b> can be disposed within the hollow spaces of the first lower member <b>152</b><i>b </i>and/or the second lower member <b>152</b>c. The first translating member <b>134</b> can be mounted on slides or shafts, as described further below. The first translating member <b>134</b> can include first and second feet <b>141</b>, <b>142</b>. A first end of the translating member <b>134</b> can include or be coupled with the first foot <b>141</b>. A second end of the translating member <b>134</b> can include or be coupled with the second foot <b>142</b>. The first and second feet <b>141</b>, <b>142</b> and/or the first and second ends of the translating member <b>134</b> can be disposed outside of, e.g., can each overhang, the respective first and second lower members <b>152</b><i>b</i>, <b>152</b><i>c</i>. The first foot <b>141</b> and the second foot <b>142</b> can be disposed forwardly and rearwardly, respectively, of the first and second wheels <b>161</b>, <b>162</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In other embodiments, one or more of the first and second feet <b>141</b>, <b>142</b> are disposed between the respective first and second lower members <b>152</b><i>b</i>, <b>152</b><i>c</i>. The first translating member <b>134</b> can be movable in the vertical direction within the hollow space of the first and second lower members <b>152</b><i>b</i>, <b>152</b><i>c</i>. The lever member <b>132</b> can be rotatable within the hollow space or at least partially within the hollow space of the upper member <b>152</b><i>a </i>about the axis <b>136</b>. Rotation of the first lever member <b>132</b> about the pivot axis <b>136</b> in a first direction (e.g., upward) can engage the second end with the pivot location <b>138</b> to cause downward translation of the first translation member <b>134</b> and the first and second feet <b>141</b>, <b>142</b> relative to the wheels <b>161</b>, <b>162</b>. Rotation of the first lever member <b>132</b> about the pivot axis <b>136</b> in a second direction opposite the first direction (e.g., downward) can cause upward translation of the first translation member <b>134</b> and the first and second feet <b>141</b>, <b>142</b> relative to the wheels <b>161</b>, <b>162</b> (or otherwise allow the weight of the umbrella and/or movable base <b>110</b> to move the wheels <b>161</b>, <b>162</b> into contact with a ground surface).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The configuration and operation of the second lever member <b>133</b> can be similar to or the same as that of the first lever member <b>132</b>. For example, the second lever member <b>133</b> can be disposed within the hollow space of the upper member <b>153</b><i>a </i>and pivotally coupled therewith by a pin or other mechanism at an axis <b>137</b> that can extend through the upper member <b>153</b><i>a</i>. A first end of the second lever member <b>133</b> can be connected with the lateral member <b>131</b> and a second end can be coupled with a second translating member <b>135</b> at a pivot location <b>139</b>. The pivot location <b>139</b> can include a cylindrical member attached with the second translating member <b>135</b>. The second translating member <b>135</b> can be disposed within the hollow spaces of the first and second lower members <b>153</b><i>b</i>, <b>153</b>. The second translating member <b>135</b> can be disposed on slides or shafts that facilitate and enable translation along a vertical direction. The second translating member <b>135</b> can include a third foot <b>143</b> and a fourth foot <b>144</b>. The third and fourth feet <b>143</b>, <b>144</b> can be disposed on respective first and second ends of the second translating member <b>135</b>. The first and second ends and/or the third and fourth feet <b>143</b>, <b>144</b>, respectively, can be exposed exteriorly to the first and second lower portions <b>153</b><i>b</i>, <b>153</b><i>c</i>. The third and fourth feet <b>143</b>, <b>144</b> can be disposed forwardly and rearwardly of the third and fourth wheels <b>163</b>, <b>164</b>, respectively. Pivoting of the lever member <b>133</b> about the pivot axis <b>137</b> in the first direction can move the second translating member <b>135</b> downwards along the vertical direction to extend the third and fourth feet <b>143</b>, <b>144</b> relative to the third and fourth wheels <b>163</b>, <b>164</b>. Rotation of the second lever member <b>133</b> about the pivot axis <b>137</b> in the second direction can cause upward translation of the second translation member <b>135</b> and the third and fourth feet <b>143</b>, <b>144</b> relative to the wheels <b>163</b>, <b>164</b> (or otherwise allow the weight of the umbrella and/or movable base <b>110</b> to move the wheels <b>163</b>, <b>164</b> into contact with a ground surface).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the screw <b>121</b> can be engaged with the lateral member <b>131</b> of the second frame <b>130</b>. The screw <b>121</b> can be coupled with a pin <b>123</b> that is received within a slot <b>131</b><i>a </i>of the lateral member <b>131</b>. Accordingly, a direction of rotation of the screw <b>121</b> (e.g., clockwise or counter-clockwise) relative to the screw plate <b>122</b> can actuate the lateral member <b>131</b> in the first or second directions to raise of lower the feet relative to the wheels. The lateral member <b>131</b> connected with the first and second lever members <b>132</b>, <b>133</b> can actuate the first and second translation member <b>134</b>, <b>135</b> to raise/lower the feet <b>141</b>-<b>144</b>. Thus, the second frame <b>130</b> and the first frame <b>150</b>, as well as the feet <b>141</b>-<b>144</b> and the screw <b>121</b> and other corresponding components comprise portions of a braking assembly of the umbrella assembly <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows the movable base <b>110</b> in the fixed or braked configuration eliminating or limiting movement, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the movable base <b>110</b> in the movable configuration. In the movable configuration, the first and second translating members <b>134</b>, <b>135</b> can be in a raised position that raises the feet <b>141</b>-<b>144</b> relative to the wheels <b>161</b>-<b>164</b> (disengaged position). The feet <b>141</b>-<b>144</b> can be raised above the lowermost surface of one or all of the wheels <b>161</b>, <b>164</b>. In the fixed or braked configuration, the wheels <b>161</b>-<b>164</b> can be lifted off the ground surface and/or some or all of the weight of the movable base <b>110</b> is shifted to the feet <b>141</b>-<b>144</b> (engaged position). Friction between ground surface and the feet <b>141</b>-<b>144</b> can be greatly increased relative to friction between the wheels <b>161</b> and the ground surface (if still touching the ground surface). The movable base <b>110</b> can be in the fixed or braked configuration while supported at least partially on the feet <b>141</b>-<b>144</b> alone. The second frame <b>130</b> can be actuated from the movable configuration to the braked configuration by rotation of the screw <b>121</b> in a first direction to actuate the second frame <b>130</b>. The second frame <b>130</b> can be actuated from the braked configuration to the movable configuration by rotation of the screw <b>121</b> in a second direction to actuate the second frame <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows the lower members <b>152</b><i>b</i>-<i>c </i>and <b>153</b><i>b</i>-<i>c </i>removed for clarity.

The first shaft <b>171</b> can be connected with the first end of the upper member <b>152</b><i>a </i>and extend through and/or connect with the first lower member <b>152</b><i>b</i>. Accordingly, an end portion of the sliding shaft <b>171</b> can be disposed within the hollow space of the first lower member <b>152</b><i>b</i>. The first translating member <b>134</b> can include an aperture that is received through which the sliding pin <b>171</b> is received to allow vertical translation of the translating member <b>134</b>. Similarly, the second sliding shaft <b>172</b> can be coupled with the second end of the upper member <b>152</b><i>a </i>and/or the second lower member <b>152</b><i>c </i>and disposed within the hollow space therein. An aperture of the first translating member <b>134</b> can receive the second sliding shaft <b>172</b>.

Apertures of the second translating member <b>135</b> can receive the sliding shafts <b>174</b>, <b>175</b> to facilitate vertical translation.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Pivot points <b>138</b> and/or <b>139</b> can also be mounted on shafts <b>173</b>, <b>176</b>. The shafts <b>173</b>, <b>176</b> can extend through one or more slots within upper and lower sides of the respective first and second translating members <b>134</b>, <b>135</b>. The slots can extend along a longitudinal axis of the translating members. The shafts <b>173</b>, <b>176</b> can be connected generally perpendicular with a longitudinal axis of the cylindrical member of the pivot points <b>138</b>, <b>139</b>. The slots facilitate movement (e.g., rolling or reduced friction sliding) of a cylindrical portion of the cylindrical members slightly with respect to an upper surface of the translating members. This can reduce friction between the lever members and the pivot points <b>138</b>, <b>139</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">While certain embodiments of the inventions have been described, these embodiments have been presented by way of example only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure.
