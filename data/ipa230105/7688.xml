Those skilled in the art may know that with evolution of the network architecture and occurrence of a new business scenario, the technical solutions provided by the examples of the present disclosure are also applicable for the similar technical problem.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Shortage of spectrum resources is an increasingly severe reality faced by a mobile communication network. Licensed frequency bands, especially high-value low-frequency-band resources, not only are limited in bandwidth, but also are being rapidly consumed by ever growing user groups. In order to meet the challenge of spectrum shortage and increase system capacity, a research plan for an NR-based unlicensed frequency band (New Radio Unlicensed, NR-U) was proposed at the RAN-75 meeting in March 2017, and a research project was started in early 2018.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Although the unlicensed frequency band is rich in resource, in order to ensure fair coexistence between different Radio Access Technologies (RATs) using the frequency band, a Listen Before Talk (LBT) technology based on Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) is introduced in Licensed Assisted Access (LAA), and the introduction of LBT into NR-U is an important way to ensure fair coexistence. However, the current LBT technology can merely detect channel conditions around a sending end. Since the sending end cannot know channel conditions around a receiving end before data transmission, a hidden node problem will be caused.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In order to solve the problem of hidden nodes, a base station is introduced in the related art to participate in coordination of unlicensed channel occupation on the unlicensed frequency bands between different nodes. However, this will result in phenomena of frequent signaling interactions of the base station, large resource occupation, and large access delay of unlicensed channels.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Examples of the present disclosure disclose a frame transmission method and apparatus, a communication end, and a storage medium.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, which shows a schematic structural diagram of a wireless communication system provided by an example of the present disclosure.

The central unit is provided with a protocol stack of a Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) layer, a Radio Link Control (RLC) protocol layer, and a Media Access Control (MAC) layer; and the distributed unit is provided with a Physical (PHY) layer protocol stack. The specific implementation of the base station <b>120</b> is not limited in the example of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">A wireless connection may be established between the base station <b>120</b> and the terminal <b>110</b> through a wireless air interface. In different implementations, the wireless air interface is a wireless air interface based on a 4<sup>th </sup>generation mobile communication network technology (4G) standard; alternatively, the wireless air interface is a wireless air interface based on a 5<sup>th </sup>generation mobile communication network technology (5G) standard, for example, the wireless air interface is a new radio; alternatively, the wireless air interface may also be a wireless air interface based on a next generation of 5G mobile communication network technology standard.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some examples, an End to End (E2E) connection may also be established between the terminals <b>110</b>, for example, vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communication, vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communication, vehicle to pedestrian (V2P) communication and other scenarios in vehicle to everything (V2X) communication.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some examples, the above wireless communication system may further contain a network management device <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The plurality of base stations <b>120</b> are respectively connected with the network management device <b>130</b>.

After receiving the RTS, the receiving end feeds back the CTS to the sending end after a short interframe space (SIFS) of 16 us, other nodes that monitor the CTS retreat according to the indicated NAV time, and the NAV (CTS) time corresponding to the CTS includes the time from the end of CTS to completion of data sending and performing of one corresponding confirmation feedback (Acknowledgement character, ACK).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">However, the RTS/CTS mechanism may prevent the receiving end in the retreat time from sending the CTS, which will further lead to a situation that the RTS sent by the sending end makes its surrounding nodes ineffectively retreat.
