It is essential that the supply of the patient with medication is ensured even in the event of a temporary disconnection of the fluid pump from a mains voltage. Such an interruption of the mains voltage can occur, for example, during transport of the patient or in the event of a power failure.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In fluid pumps in use today, an energy storage in the form of an accumulator is therefore located on the rear side of the fluid pump (on the side opposite the control panel). However, since an energy storage compartment intended for the energy storage takes up a relatively large installation space and the rear side of the fluid pump is used for various connections, the positioning of the connections on the rear side of the fluid pump is limited.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The object of the present disclosure is therefore to provide an energy storage in a medical fluid pump without restricting the configuration of a rear side of the fluid pump that is important for connections.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This object is solved by the medical fluid pump according to the disclosure with an energy storage compartment.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The medical fluid pump includes an upper housing shell, a lower housing shell and a front lid pivotably hinged to the lower housing shell. An energy storage compartment is formed on the lower housing shell and is provided and formed to receive an energy storage.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In other words, the fluid pump has a housing that includes an upper housing shell and a lower housing shell. A front lid is hinged to the lower housing shell, which preferably includes operating elements and/or a display device. The lower housing shell furthermore has an energy storage compartment. The energy storage compartment is provided and formed to receive a corresponding energy storage, in particular completely. In other words, the energy storage compartment is fully integrated into the lower housing shell of the fluid pump. The energy storage is preferably an accumulator or a battery. However, other forms of energy storage for electrical energy, such as a capacitor, are also conceivable.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Providing the energy storage compartment in the lower housing shell ensures that connections for power lines and/or data lines and/or substance lines can be freely positioned at the rear side of the fluid pump. In addition, by providing the energy storage compartment in the lower housing shell, the energy storage, which has a high weight, is mounted at the lowest possible position in the fluid pump, which ensures a favorable weight distribution and a safe standing of the fluid pump.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a first aspect, the energy storage compartment comprises an opening at/in the lower housing shell.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In other words, the lower housing shell is provided with an opening that allows access to the energy storage. In particular, the opening enables insertion and removal of the energy storage compartment. Preferably, the opening is oriented towards the underside of the housing.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a further aspect, the lower housing shell and the energy storage compartment are formed in one piece.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In other words, the energy storage compartment is formed as a part of the lower housing shell, in particular as a single piece of material. In this case, the lower housing shell with the energy storage compartment is preferably manufactured by injection molding.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a further aspect, the medical fluid pump is provided with a cover that is provided and formed to close the opening of the energy storage compartment and, in particular, to be flush with the lower housing shell.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In other words, the cover is provided and formed to close the energy storage compartment and thus an interior space of the fluid pump from the environment. The cover is formed in such a way that when the cover closes the opening, a flat surface is created with an outer surface/skin of the lower housing shell.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">On the one hand, the cover prevents the inserted energy storage from falling out of the energy storage compartment and, on the other hand, prevents foreign bodies from entering the interior of the fluid pump. The flat outer surface of the lower housing shell improves the handling and haptics of the fluid pump.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a further aspect, the cover has a circumferential seal on its inner side that seals the cover against a sealing surface formed in the lower housing shell.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In other words, on the surface of the cover that faces inward in a state in which the cover closes the opening, a seal is provided and formed that completely surrounds the opening in the state in which the cover closes the opening. A sealing surface is provided and formed on the lower housing shell, which completely surrounds/encircles the opening, against which the cover seals in an assembled state via the seal.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The seal that completely surrounds the opening ensures that moisture cannot enter the fluid pump and damage electronic components in particular, such as the energy storage, even in a damp or wet operating environment.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a further aspect, the cover is fixed with screws to the lower housing shell of the medical fluid pump, wherein cover caps are provided and formed to cover heads of the screws (screw heads) in an assembled state and in particular to be flush with the cover.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In other words, threaded holes are formed in the lower housing shell into which the screws are screwed and which fix the cover to the lower housing shell. Through holes for the screws are formed in the cover. On the outer surface of the cover, cylindrical depressions are preferably provided and formed around the through holes. These cylindrical depressions are formed to receive cover caps, preferably in a force-fit manner. In a state inserted into the depressions, the cover caps are flush with the outer surface of the cover. The cover caps are preferably made of an elastic material such as rubber. Preferably, the cover caps are provided and formed to be destructively removed.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The cover caps prevent dirt and moisture from entering the through holes/screw openings. In particular, the cover caps prevent moisture from entering the interior of the fluid pump through the through holes in the cover past the screw. Furthermore, the cover caps prevent unauthorized persons from opening the cover. The closed, flat surface also improves the handling and feel of the fluid pump.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a further aspect, the energy storage compartment is provided with a notch that is provided and formed to receive an energy storage interconnecting cable.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In other words, the energy storage compartment includes a notch that allows the energy storage interconnecting cable connecting the energy storage to loads of the fluid pump and preferably to a mains voltage supply to be routed in a predetermined manner.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A separately formed notch for the energy storage interconnecting cable prevents the energy storage cable from being damaged or pulled out of a connector when the fluid pump is moved.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a further aspect, the extension of the energy storage compartment from the lower housing shell toward the upper housing shell is greater than the extension of the energy storage compartment from the front lid toward a pump rear side opposite the front lid.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In other words, the extension of the energy storage compartment in the direction from a fluid pump bottom side towards a fluid pump top side is greater than the extension of the energy storage compartment in the direction from a fluid pump front side towards a fluid pump rear side. The fluid pump bottom side is preferably provided with feet. The fluid pump front side is preferably provided with a control panel.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a further aspect, the energy storage compartment has a recess oriented in the direction of the front lid.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In other words, the energy storage compartment is provided with a material recess in a direction parallel to the front lid or normal to the fluid pump bottom side, respectively.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The recess allows easy removal of the energy storage by a technician. In addition, the recess provides better air circulation around the energy storage, which ensures that the energy storage does not heat up excessively during discharging and/or charging.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In another aspect, at least one buffer element is provided and formed on the cover on the side facing the energy storage compartment.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In other words, at least one elastic buffer element is attached to the inside of the cover. When the cover is mounted on the underside of the housing, the elastic buffer element is compressed between the cover and the energy storage. Preferably, the buffer element is provided and formed in the form of a foam bead.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The buffer element holds the energy storage in position and absorbs shocks and vibrations, which protects the energy storage from external force, for example if the fluid pump falls.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a medical fluid pump according to the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of the medical fluid pump according to the disclosure with an opened cover of an energy storage compartment.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a detailed view of the medical fluid pump according to the disclosure with the energy storage removed.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a detailed view of the medical fluid pump according to the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a top view of the energy storage compartment of the medical fluid pump according to the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an interior view of a lower housing shell of the medical fluid pump according to the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows the cover of the energy storage compartment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a medical fluid pump <b>2</b> according to the disclosure with a housing <b>4</b>, which includes a lower housing shell <b>6</b> and an upper housing shell <b>8</b>.
