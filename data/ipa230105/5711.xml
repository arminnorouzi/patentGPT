The substrate S is loaded through the passage <b>12</b><i>a </i>and then placed in a substantially horizontal state on the upper surface of the susceptor <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The antenna <b>16</b> is a coil-type antenna disposed substantially parallel to the upper surface of the support plate <b>14</b>, and as will be described later, has 1st to n-th turns (n=an integer greater than 3) wound in a counterclockwise direction from the inner end <b>16</b><i>a</i>. The antenna <b>16</b> is connected to a RF power supply <b>19</b>, and the RF power supplies power to the antenna <b>16</b>. A matcher <b>18</b> is installed between the antenna <b>16</b> and the RF power supply <b>19</b>, and impedance matching between the antenna <b>16</b> and the RF power supply <b>19</b> can be achieved through the matcher <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The reaction gas is supplied to the inner space <b>11</b> through a showerhead (not shown) or an injection nozzle (not shown) installed in the inner space <b>11</b>, and a plasma is generated through an electric field described later.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The antenna <b>16</b> creates a magnetic field in the internal space <b>11</b> through the power supplied from the RF power supply <b>19</b>, and an induced electric field is formed by the magnetic field. To this end, the support plate <b>14</b> may be a dielectric window. At this time, the reactive gas obtains sufficient energy required for ionization from the inductively generated electric field to form plasma, and the plasma moves to the substrate to process the substrate.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an antenna and a distance control unit fixed to the support plate shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the distance control unit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the antenna <b>16</b> is disposed on the support plate <b>14</b>, and is a coil-type antenna disposed substantially parallel to the upper surface of the support plate <b>14</b>. The antenna <b>16</b> has 1st to nth turns (n=an integer greater than 3) spaced apart from each other while being wound in a counterclockwise direction from the inner end <b>16</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Meanwhile, as described above, the antenna <b>16</b> generates an electric field in the inner space <b>11</b> to generate plasma from the reaction gas supplied to the inner space <b>11</b>, thereby processing the substrate. In this case, the density distribution of the generated plasma depends on the shape of the electric field induced by the antenna <b>16</b> and the shape of the electric field generated by the antenna <b>16</b> depends on the shape of the antenna <b>16</b>. Accordingly, when the process uniformity is poor in the result of the substrate processing process through plasma, the shape of the antenna <b>16</b> can be adjusted to improve the process uniformity.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">For example, as a result of the deposition process, when the thickness of the thin film deposited on the entire surface of the substrate is significantly non-uniform, that is, the thickness of the thin film is high in the center region of the substrate and the thickness of the thin film is low in the edge region. Such process non-uniformity may have various reasons, but one reason may be the non-uniformity of plasma, that is, high plasma density in the center region of the substrate and low plasma density in the edge region of the substrate. Plasma non-uniformity can be improved by adjusting the shape of the antenna <b>16</b>. In addition, the appropriate plasma density distribution may vary depending on the process, and the method described below may be applied in various ways other than the necessity for improving the non-uniformity of the plasma.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The density distribution of the plasma in the inner space <b>11</b> depends on the distribution of the electric field induced by the antenna <b>16</b> or the distribution of the magnetic field, and the distribution of the electric field/magnetic field depend on the shape of the antenna <b>16</b>. That is, as described above, as the separation distance formed between turns of the antenna <b>16</b> is decreases, the electric field/magnetic field become stronger and the density of plasma increases. Conversely, as the separation distance formed between turns of the antenna <b>16</b> increases, the electric field/magnetic field become weaker and the plasma density decreases.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Specifically, when the separation distance between turns in the central region of the antenna <b>16</b> decreases, the electric/magnetic field in the central region of the internal space <b>11</b> become stronger and the plasma density increases, thereby increasing the process rate (or the thickness of the thin film). On the contrary, when the distance between turns in the central region of the antenna <b>16</b> increases, the electric/magnetic field in the central region of the inner space <b>11</b> become weaker and the plasma density decreases, thereby reducing the process rate. The same is true for the edge region of the antenna <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The separation distance between turns can be adjusted by winding or unwinding the inner end <b>16</b><i>a </i>of the antenna <b>16</b>, and winding or unwinding the inner end <b>16</b><i>a </i>is achieved by rotating the inner end <b>16</b><i>a </i>of the antenna <b>16</b> through the holder <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, in a state in which the antenna <b>16</b> is placed above the support plate <b>14</b>, the outer end <b>16</b><i>b </i>of the antenna <b>16</b> is fixed to the upper surface of the support plate <b>14</b>.

Accordingly, in the central region of the inner space <b>11</b>, the electric/magnetic field becomes stronger and the plasma density increases, so that the process rate (or the thickness of the thin film) increases.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">On the contrary, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, when the holder <b>42</b> rotates in a counterclockwise direction, the inner end <b>16</b><i>a </i>rotates in the direction in which the turn of the antenna <b>16</b> is wound, so that the antenna <b>16</b> is released and the separation distance between turns placed in the center area is increased. Accordingly, in the central region of the inner space <b>11</b>, the electric/magnetic field is weakened and the plasma density decreases, so that the process rate (or the thickness of the thin film) decreases.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In this way, the antenna <b>16</b> can be deformed, and the distribution of the electric/magnetic field and the density distribution of the plasma in the center region and the edge region of the inner space <b>11</b> can be adjusted, respectively.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">On the other hand, the supporter <b>32</b> is fixed to the support plate <b>14</b> and disposed between turns of the antenna <b>16</b>, and can support the turn of the antenna <b>16</b> and limit the movement when the inner end <b>16</b><i>a </i>is rotated, have. The support plate <b>14</b> has a plurality of fixing grooves <b>15</b> formed on the upper surface, and the fixing grooves <b>15</b> are disposed to be spaced apart from the center of the support plate <b>14</b>.
