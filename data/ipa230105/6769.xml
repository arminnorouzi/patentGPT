In the IBSS, all STAs <b>250</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>250</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>250</b>-<b>3</b>, <b>255</b>-<b>4</b>, and <b>255</b>-<b>5</b> may be constituted by movable STAs and are not permitted to access the DS to constitute a self-contained network.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a general link setup process.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In S<b>310</b>, a STA may perform a network discovery operation. The network discovery operation may include a scanning operation of the STA. That is, to access a network, the STA needs to discover a participating network. The STA needs to identify a compatible network before participating in a wireless network, and a process of identifying a network present in a particular area is referred to as scanning. Scanning methods include active scanning and passive scanning.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a network discovery operation including an active scanning process. In active scanning, a STA performing scanning transmits a probe request frame and waits for a response to the probe request frame in order to identify which AP is present around while moving to channels. A responder transmits a probe response frame as a response to the probe request frame to the STA having transmitted the probe request frame. Here, the responder may be a STA that transmits the last beacon frame in a BSS of a channel being scanned. In the BSS, since an AP transmits a beacon frame, the AP is the responder. In an IBSS, since STAs in the IBSS transmit a beacon frame in turns, the responder is not fixed. For example, when the STA transmits a probe request frame via channel <b>1</b> and receives a probe response frame via channel <b>1</b>, the STA may store BSS-related information included in the received probe response frame, may move to the next channel (e.g., channel <b>2</b>), and may perform scanning (e.g., transmits a probe request and receives a probe response via channel <b>2</b>) by the same method.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, scanning may be performed by a passive scanning method. In passive scanning, a STA performing scanning may wait for a beacon frame while moving to channels. A beacon frame is one of management frames in IEEE 802.11 and is periodically transmitted to indicate the presence of a wireless network and to enable the STA performing scanning to find the wireless network and to participate in the wireless network. In a BSS, an AP serves to periodically transmit a beacon frame. In an IBSS, STAs in the IBSS transmit a beacon frame in turns. Upon receiving the beacon frame, the STA performing scanning stores information related to a BSS included in the beacon frame and records beacon frame information in each channel while moving to another channel. The STA having received the beacon frame may store BSS-related information included in the received beacon frame, may move to the next channel, and may perform scanning in the next channel by the same method.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">After discovering the network, the STA may perform an authentication process in S<b>320</b>. The authentication process may be referred to as a first authentication process to be clearly distinguished from the following security setup operation in S<b>340</b>. The authentication process in S<b>320</b> may include a process in which the STA transmits an authentication request frame to the AP and the AP transmits an authentication response frame to the STA in response. The authentication frames used for an authentication request/response are management frames.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The authentication frames may include information related to an authentication algorithm number, an authentication transaction sequence number, a status code, a challenge text, a robust security network (RSN), and a finite cyclic group.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The STA may transmit the authentication request frame to the AP.

The association process includes a process in which the STA transmits an association request frame to the AP and the AP transmits an association response frame to the STA in response. The association request frame may include, for example, information related to various capabilities, a beacon listen interval, a service set identifier (SSID), a supported rate, a supported channel, RSN, a mobility domain, a supported operating class, a traffic indication map (TIM) broadcast request, and an interworking service capability. The association response frame may include, for example, information related to various capabilities, a status code, an association ID (AID), a supported rate, an enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) parameter set, a received channel power indicator (RCPI), a received signal-to-noise indicator (RSNI), a mobility domain, a timeout interval (association comeback time), an overlapping BSS scanning parameter, a TIM broadcast response, and a QoS map.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In <b>5340</b>, the STA may perform a security setup process.

A first value of the UL/DL flag field of 1 bit relates to UL communication, and a second value of the UL/DL flag field relates to DL communication.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0197">For example, the version-independent bits of the U-SIG may include information related to a TXOP length and information related to a BSS color ID.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0198">For example, when the EHT PPDU is divided into various types (e.g., various types such as an EHT PPDU related to an SU mode, an EHT PPDU related to an MU mode, an EHT PPDU related to a TB mode, an EHT PPDU related to extended range transmission, or the like), information related to the type of the EHT PPDU may be included in the version-dependent bits of the U-SIG.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0199">For example, the U-SIG may include: 1) a bandwidth field including information related to a bandwidth; 2) a field including information related to an MCS scheme applied to EHT-SIG; 3) an indication field including information regarding whether a dual subcarrier modulation (DCM) scheme is applied to EHT-SIG; 4) a field including information related to the number of symbol used for EHT-SIG; 5) a field including information regarding whether the EHT-SIG is generated across a full band; 6) a field including information related to a type of EHT-LTF/STF; and 7) information related to a field indicating an EHT-LTF length and a CP length.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0200">Preamble puncturing may be applied to the PPDU of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>. The preamble puncturing implies that puncturing is applied to part (e.g., a secondary 20 MHz band) of the full band. For example, when an 80 MHz PPDU is transmitted, an STA may apply puncturing to the secondary 20 MHz band out of the 80 MHz band, and may transmit a PPDU only through a primary 20 MHz band and a secondary 40 MHz band.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0201">For example, a pattern of the preamble puncturing may be configured in advance. For example, when a first puncturing pattern is applied, puncturing may be applied only to the secondary 20 MHz band within the 80 MHz band. For example, when a second puncturing pattern is applied, puncturing may be applied to only any one of two secondary 20 MHz bands included in the secondary 40 MHz band within the 80 MHz band. For example, when a third puncturing pattern is applied, puncturing may be applied to only the secondary 20 MHz band included in the primary 80 MHz band within the 160 MHz band (or 80+80 MHz band). For example, when a fourth puncturing is applied, puncturing may be applied to at least one 20 MHz channel not belonging to a primary 40 MHz band in the presence of the primary 40 MHz band included in the 80 MHaz band within the 160 MHz band (or 80+80 MHz band).</p><p id="p-0207" num="0202">Information related to the preamble puncturing applied to the PPDU may be included in U-SIG and/or EHT-SIG. For example, a first field of the U-SIG may include information related to a contiguous bandwidth, and second field of the U-SIG may include information related to the preamble puncturing applied to the PPDU.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0203">For example, the U-SIG and the EHT-SIG may include the information related to the preamble puncturing, based on the following method. When a bandwidth of the PPDU exceeds 80 MHz, the U-SIG may be configured individually in unit of 80 MHz. For example, when the bandwidth of the PPDU is 160 MHz, the PPDU may include a first U-SIG for a first 80 MHz band and a second U-SIG for a second 80 MHz band. In this case, a first field of the first U-SIG may include information related to a 160 MHz bandwidth, and a second field of the first U-SIG may include information related to a preamble puncturing (i.e., information related to a preamble puncturing pattern) applied to the first 80 MHz band. In addition, a first field of the second U-SIG may include information related to a 160 MHz bandwidth, and a second field of the second U-SIG may include information related to a preamble puncturing (i.e., information related to a preamble puncturing pattern) applied to the second 80 MHz band. Meanwhile, an EHT-SIG contiguous to the first U-SIG may include information related to a preamble puncturing applied to the second 80 MHz band (i.e., information related to a preamble puncturing pattern), and an EHT-SIG contiguous to the second U-SIG may include information related to a preamble puncturing (i.e., information related to a preamble puncturing pattern) applied to the first 80 MHz band.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0204">Additionally or alternatively, the U-SIG and the EHT-SIG may include the information related to the preamble puncturing, based on the following method. The U-SIG may include information related to a preamble puncturing (i.e., information related to a preamble puncturing pattern) for all bands. That is, the EHT-SIG may not include the information related to the preamble puncturing, and only the U-SIG may include the information related to the preamble puncturing (i.e., the information related to the preamble puncturing pattern).</p><p id="p-0210" num="0205">The U-SIG may be configured in unit of 20 MHz. For example, when an 80 MHz PPDU is configured, the U-SIG may be duplicated. That is, four identical U-SIGs may be included in the 80 MHz PPDU. PPDUs exceeding an 80 MHz bandwidth may include different U-SIGs.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0206">The U-SIG may be configured in unit of 20 MHz.

The mode in the common field of the EHT-SIG is omitted may be called a compressed mode. When the compressed mode is used, a plurality of users (i.e., a plurality of receiving STAs) may decode the PPDU (e.g., the data field of the PPDU), based on non-OFDMA. That is, the plurality of users of the EHT PPDU may decode the PPDU (e.g., the data field of the PPDU) received through the same frequency band. Meanwhile, when a non-compressed mode is used, the plurality of users of the EHT PPDU may decode the PPDU (e.g., the data field of the PPDU), based on OFDMA. That is, the plurality of users of the EHT PPDU may receive the PPDU (e.g., the data field of the PPDU) through different frequency bands.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0216">The EHT-SIG may be configured based on various MCS schemes. As described above, information related to an MCS scheme applied to the EHT-SIG may be included in U-SIG. The EHT-SIG may be configured based on a DCM scheme. For example, among N data tones (e.g., 52 data tones) allocated for the EHT-SIG, a first modulation scheme may be applied to half of consecutive tones, and a second modulation scheme may be applied to the remaining half of the consecutive tones. That is, a transmitting STA may use the first modulation scheme to modulate specific control information through a first symbol and allocate it to half of the consecutive tones, and may use the second modulation scheme to modulate the same control information by using a second symbol and allocate it to the remaining half of the consecutive tones. As described above, information (e.g., a 1-bit field) regarding whether the DCM scheme is applied to the EHT-SIG may be included in the U-SIG.

For example, a first type of STF (e.g., 1&#xd7; STF) may be generated based on a first type STF sequence in which a non-zero coefficient is arranged with an interval of 16 subcarriers. An STF signal generated based on the first type STF sequence may have a period of 0.8 &#x3bc;s, and a periodicity signal of 0.8 &#x3bc;s may be repeated 5 times to become a first type STF having a length of 4 &#x3bc;s.

In the 11ax standard, the subcarrier frequency spacing is 312.5 kHz or 78.125 kHz, and the subcarrier frequency spacing for the RU is 78.125 kHz. That is, a subcarrier index +1 for the RU may mean a location which is more increased by 78.125 kHz than a DC tone, and a subcarrier index &#x2212;1 for the RU may mean a location which is more decreased by 78.125 kHz than the DC tone. For example, when the location of the specific RU is expressed by [&#x2212;121:&#x2212;96], the RU may be located in a region from a subcarrier index &#x2212;121 to a subcarrier index &#x2212;96. As a result, the RU may include 26 subcarriers.</p><p id="p-0280" num="0254">The N-tone RU may include a pre-set pilot tone.</p><p id="p-0281" num="0255">2.

Bandwidth field may be included in the version independent/dependent field of Universal-SIG (U-SIG) or EHT-SIG, but for the receiving end to quickly acquire bandwidth information, it is recommended that the bandwidth field belongs to the version independent/dependent field of U-SIG. Preferred. If it belongs to the version independent field, it can be universally used in Wi-Fi after EHT. Additionally, a preamble puncturing pattern within a corresponding 80 MHz in each 80 MHz may also be indicated together with the bandwidth field. This may help STAs decoding a specific 80 MHz to decode the EHT-SIG. Therefore, assuming that such information is loaded in the U-SIG, the configuration of the U-SIG may be changed every 80 MHz.</p><p id="p-0349" num="0364">The preamble puncturing pattern applied to the entire bandwidth of the SU PPDU may be indicated using the Preamble puncturing pattern field, and this field may be included in the EHT-SIG, and the name of the field may be different. If there is a field indicating the preamble puncturing pattern within 80 MHz in the U-SIG, the preamble puncturing pattern field may be omitted in the EHT-SIG when transmitting the 80 MHz bandwidth, and the preamble puncturing pattern field may be omitted even in the bandwidth of 80 MHz or less.</p><p id="p-0350" num="0365">In addition, the version independent field may include a 3-bit version identifier and 1-bit DL/UL field indicating the Wi-Fi version after 802.11be and 802.11be, BSS color, TXOP duration, etc., and the version dependent field includes PPDU type, Bandwidth, 80 MHz preamble puncturing pattern, etc. may be included. (Information on the bandwidth, 80 MHz preamble puncturing pattern may be carried in the version independent field.) The SU PPDU may be indicated in the PPDU type field and may be the same element as the MU PPDU. In addition, in U-SIG, two symbols are jointly encoded, and each 20 MHz consists of 52 data tones and 4 pilot tones. It is also modulated in the same way as HE-SIG-A. That is, it is modulated with a BPSK &#xbd; code rate. In addition, the EHT-SIG consists only of a common field in the case of an SU PPDU, but may be divided into a common field and a user specific field in the case of an MU PPDU, and may be encoded as a variable MCS. EHT-SIG is 1 2 1 2 . . . in units of 20 MHz as in the existing 11ax. It can have a structure (it may be composed of a different structure. For example, 1 2 3 4 . . . or 1 2 1 2 3 4 3 4 . . . may also be configured in units of 80 MHz, and in a bandwidth of 80 MHz or more, EHT-SIG is duplicated in units of 80 MHz) In the case of an SU PPDU, it may have the same EHT-SIG structure as in the case of an MU PPDU, or the EHT-SIG may be duplicated and located in the same every 20/80 MHz.</p><p id="p-0351" num="0366">4.1.

In addition, as in Examples 1, 3, and 5, when the bandwidth field does not indicate whether information on whether preamble puncturing is applied or not, a 1-bit preamble puncturing field is defined at the beginning of the U-SIG version independent/dependent field or EHT-SIG. It is possible to indicate whether preamble puncturing is applied or not, and for quick indication, it is advantageous to belong to the version independent/dependent field of the U-SIG. In this case, if preamble puncturing is not applied, there is an advantage that the preamble puncturing pattern field can be replaced with other information. However, if it is not 240/160+80 MHz determined in Examples 1 and 3, information on three 80 MHz channels used is required even if preamble puncturing is not applied, so a preamble puncturing pattern field may be required. Alternatively, information on three 80 MHz channels used may be indicated in a different way. In addition to the bandwidth field, preamble puncturing information within a specific 80 MHz may be carried, and this information may be included in the bandwidth field or may be loaded by defining another field. According to an indication of the preamble puncturing field, a field for preamble puncturing information within 80 MHz may not be used.</p><p id="p-0447" num="0462">4.2. Preamble Puncturing Pattern Field</p><p id="p-0448" num="0463">A preamble puncturing pattern of the entire bandwidth may be indicated, and the corresponding preamble puncturing pattern may be 20 MHz-based preamble puncturing. If the EHT-SIG is duplicated in units of 20 MHz/80 MHz, the preamble puncturing pattern field indicating the preamble puncturing pattern of the entire bandwidth is identically repeated at every 20 MHz/80 MHz. Elements in the preamble puncturing pattern field may be composed of a combination of those designed based on 80 MHz (for example, in a 160 MHz bandwidth, it is composed of a combination of two 80 MHz puncturing pattern indicators), and 1-4 bits may be used for each 80 MHz. The bit configuration informing the preamble puncturing pattern information of each 80 MHz in the preamble puncturing pattern field can be configured the same as the information informing the preamble puncturing pattern of each 80 MHz in the U-SIG, that is, the preamble puncturing pattern field of the EHT-SIG is the U-SIG. In the SIG, it may be composed of a combination of bit elements indicating a preamble puncturing pattern for each 80 MHz. For example, suppose that the preamble puncturing pattern is indicated by using 4 bits in each 80 MHz of U-SIG in the 320 MHz bandwidth. The following are elements indicating each 80MHz preamble puncturing pattern of the U-SIG, and a to p has a value of 0 or 1.</p><p id="p-0449" num="0464">lowest 80 MHz: a b c d</p><p id="p-0450" num="0465">second lowest 80 MHz: e f g h</p><p id="p-0451" num="0466">second highest 80 MHz: i j k 1</p><p id="p-0452" num="0467">highest 80 MHz: m n o p</p><p id="p-0453" num="0468">In this case, the preamble puncturing pattern field of the EHT-SIG may be composed of a combination of these, a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p of 16 bits.</p><p id="p-0454" num="0469">In addition, the preamble puncturing pattern field can be unified into one bit width regardless of bandwidth, or the bit-width can be changed according to bandwidth. For example, if 4 bits are used to indicate the preamble puncturing pattern for each 80 MHz, 16 bits are used regardless of the bandwidth, or 4 bits at 80 MHz, 8 bits at 160/80+80 MHz, and 12 bits (If it is not determined 240/160+80 MHz, 16 bits in Examples 1,2,3,4), and 16 bits in 320/160+160 MHz may be used. Alternatively, primary 80 always uses 3 bits and the rest uses 4 bits, so 15 bits are used regardless of bandwidth, or 3 bits in 80 MHz, 7 bits in 160/80+80 MHz, 11 bits in 240/160+80 MHz (If not determined 240/160+80 MHz, 15 bits in Examples 1, 2, 3, 4), 15 bits in 320/160+160 MHz may be used.</p><p id="p-0455" num="0470">Hereinafter, the present specification will first propose a description of the preamble puncturing pattern according to various bit numbers in each 80 MHz channel, and then propose a bit configuration of the preamble puncturing pattern field.</p><p id="p-0456" num="0471"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref> shows an example of an 80_1 (primary 80) channel configuration.</p><p id="p-0457" num="0472">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>, 20_1 means primary 20 and 20_2 means secondary 20. 20_3 means a 20 MHz channel in the position corresponding to 20_1 among the secondary 40 (ie, the channel in the position corresponding to primary 20), and 20_4 means a 20 MHz channel in the position corresponding to 20_2 among the secondary 40 (ie, channel in the position corresponding to secondary 20).
