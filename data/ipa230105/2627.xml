In many coating compositions, such as interference coating compositions, layers of chromium-containing materials are used as absorbing layers in multilayer pigment flakes.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,858,977 to Baird, et al., issued on Jan. 7, 1975, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,059,245 to Phillips, et al., issued on Oct. 22, 1991, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,571,624 to Phillips, et al., issued on Nov. 5, 1996, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,132,504 to Kuntz, et al., issued on Oct. 17, 2000, and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,156,115 to Pfaff, et al., issued on Dec. 5, 2000, which are incorporated herein by reference, layers of chromium metal may be used as absorbing layers. As disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,978,394 to Ostertag, et al., issued on Dec. 18, 1990, and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,364,467 to Schmid, et al., issued on Nov. 15, 1994, which are incorporated herein by reference, layers of chromium(III) oxide (Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) may be used as absorbing layers. As disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,424,119 to Phillips, et al., issued on Jun. 13, 1995, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,235,105 to Hubbard, et al., issued on May 22, 2001, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,524,381 to Phillips, et al., issued on Feb. 25, 2003, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,648,957 to Andes, et al., issued on Nov. 18, 2003, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,759,097 to Phillips, et al., issued on Jul. 6, 2004, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,818,299 to Phillips, et al., issued on Nov. 16, 2004, and in U.S. Pat. No. 7,169,472 to Raksha, et al., issued on Jan. 30, 2007, which are incorporated herein by reference, layers of commonly available chromium-containing alloys, such as Hastelloys, Inconels, stainless steels, and nickel-chromium alloys, may be used as absorbing layers.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Unfortunately, many of the chromium-containing materials in the absorbing layers of prior-art coating compositions are harmful to human health. Chromium metal and chromium(III) oxide, for example, each cause irritation to the skin, eyes, respiratory tract, and gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, these materials may be oxidized to form chromium(VI) species, which are, generally, toxic and carcinogenic. Furthermore, the chromium-containing alloys used in the absorbing layers of prior-art coating compositions, typically, also contain nickel, which is toxic and carcinogenic. Therefore, many prior-art coating compositions based on chromium-containing materials pose potential health and environmental hazards.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Despite their advantageous corrosion-inhibiting properties, in particular, chromium-containing magnetic alloys are not, generally, used as magnetic layers in multilayer magnetic pigment flakes. Rather, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,808,806 to Phillips, et al., issued on Oct. 26, 2004, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,818,299, and in U.S. Pat.

For example, the magnetic alloy may be an iron-chromium alloy or an iron-chromium-aluminum alloy.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the magnetic alloy, the chromium atoms are bonded by metallic bonds, which involve the sharing of electrons. Thus, chromium is present in the magnetic alloy as chromium(0). If the magnetic alloy is subject to corrosion, chromium is mainly released as chromium(III), rather than potentially harmful chromium(VI). Moreover, a chromium(III)-containing oxide may be formed, which passivates the surface of the magnetic alloy, inhibiting further corrosion.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The inventors have found that a composition of the magnetic alloy including about 5 wt % to about 30 wt % chromium, about 0 wt % to about 18 wt % aluminum, and a balance of iron minimizes the undesirable release of chromium(VI), but retains desirable magnetic, optical, and corrosion-inhibiting properties. Preferably, the pigment flake releases substantially no chromium(VI). Moreover, the inclusion of aluminum in the magnetic alloy provides increased reflectance.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Preferably, the composition of the magnetic alloy consists essentially of about 5 wt % to about 30 wt % chromium, about 0 wt % to about 18 wt % aluminum, and a balance of iron. That is, the magnetic alloy may be an iron-chromium alloy having a composition consisting essentially of about 5 wt % to about 30 wt % chromium, and a balance of iron, or may be an iron-chromium-aluminum alloy having a composition consisting essentially of about 5 wt % to about 30 wt % chromium, greater than 0 wt % to about 18 wt % aluminum, and a balance of iron.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a preferred embodiment, which provides advantageous optical-absorption properties, the magnetic alloy is an iron-chromium alloy having a composition consisting essentially of about 5 wt % to about 15 wt % chromium and a balance of iron. In some instances, the magnetic iron-chromium alloy has a composition consisting essentially of about 10 wt % to about 12 wt % chromium and a balance of iron.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In another preferred embodiment, which provides advantageous optical-reflection properties, the magnetic alloy is an iron-chromium-aluminum alloy having a composition consisting essentially of about 10 wt % to about 30 wt % chromium, about 1 wt % to about 18 wt % aluminum, and a balance of iron. In some instances, the magnetic iron-chromium-aluminum alloy has a composition consisting essentially of about 18 wt % to about 25 wt % chromium, about 6 wt % to about 15 wt % aluminum, and a balance of iron.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">It should be noted that the composition of the magnetic alloy may differ, sometimes considerably, in different pigment flakes within the same batch of pigment flakes due to local variations in the deposited composition.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The pigment flake, typically, includes a plurality of magnetic layers of the magnetic alloy, in addition to a plurality of dielectric layers. Optionally, the pigment flake may also include layers of other types.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The magnetic layers of the magnetic alloy, typically, serve as absorbing layers for absorbing light and/or as reflecting layers for reflecting light. In other words, the pigment flake may include one or more absorbing magnetic layers and/or one or more reflecting magnetic layers. The magnetic layers may be formed of the same or different magnetic alloys and may have the same or different physical thicknesses. For example, the pigment flake may include one or more absorbing magnetic layers and one or more reflecting magnetic layers formed of the same magnetic alloy, but having different physical thicknesses. Generally, the magnetic layers each have a physical thickness of about 3 nm to about 1000 nm. In instances where the magnetic layers serve as absorbing layers, the magnetic layers are semi-transparent, each, typically, having a physical thickness of about 3 nm to about 50 nm. Preferably, such semi-transparent absorbing magnetic layers each have a physical thickness of about 5 nm to about 15 nm. In instances where the magnetic layers serve as reflecting layers, the magnetic layers are opaque, each, typically, having a physical thickness of about 20 nm to about 1000 nm. Preferably, such opaque reflecting magnetic layers each have a physical thickness of about 50 nm to about 100 nm. Generally, the magnetic layers are amorphous, having been deposited by evaporation in vacuum.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some instances, an opaque layer of a reflective material other than the magnetic alloy may serve as a reflecting layer for reflecting light. Suitable reflective materials include tin, aluminum, copper, silver, gold, palladium, platinum, titanium, and compounds or alloys thereof. Such an opaque reflecting layer is, preferably, formed of aluminum. Typically, such an opaque reflecting layer has a physical thickness within the same ranges as the opaque reflecting magnetic layers.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The dielectric layers, typically, serve as transparent spacer layers, and provide the pigment flake with durability and rigidity. The dielectric layers may be formed of any transparent dielectric material having a low refractive index, i.e. a refractive index of less than about 1.65, or a high refractive index, i.e. a refractive index of greater than about 1.65. Suitable dielectric materials having a low refractive index include silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>), aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), and metal fluorides, such as magnesium fluoride (MgF<sub>2</sub>). Suitable dielectric materials having a high refractive index include silicon monoxide (SiO) and zinc sulfide (ZnS). Preferably, the dielectric layers are formed of magnesium fluoride.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The dielectric layers may be formed of the same or different dielectric materials and may have the same or different physical thicknesses. For example, the pigment flake may include one or more dielectric layers formed of the same dielectric material, but having different physical thicknesses and, therefore, different optical thicknesses. Generally, the dielectric layers each have a physical thickness of about 100 nm to about 5000 nm. The physical thickness is selected to correspond with an optical thickness required by a layer structure of the pigment flake for providing a desired optical effect.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The pigment flake may have a variety of layer structures, having various compositional and layer-thickness profiles, for providing a variety of optical effects.
