The surface <b>101</b> may be a first principal surface <b>101</b> of the silicon carbide substrate <b>10</b>.

The semiconductor component <b>11</b> may take the form, for example, of a vertical component in the substrate <b>10</b> such that it extends from the second principal surface <b>102</b>, into the substrate <b>10</b>, and to an electrode to be formed on the first principal surface <b>101</b>. For example, the electronic semiconductor component <b>11</b> may be a vertical transistor, and the electrical contact <b>16</b> on the first principal surface <b>101</b> may be a drain electrode or a contact layer for a drain electrode.

In its grinding face, the grinding disk may include nickel and/or a nickel compound, such as a nickel alloy. A nickel content of the grinding disk may be between approximately 0.1 weight % and 100 weight %. In other words, the grinding disk may be made entirely or only partly of nickel. Where the grinding disk is made only partly of nickel, it may for example furthermore include a glass or ceramic material, such as SiO<sub>2</sub>, ZnO and/or CaO. The nickel may be embedded in the glass or ceramic material, for example in the form of nickel particles.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The nickel-containing grinding face may be configured, for example in respect of its roughness, such that the grinding roughens the surface <b>101</b>, and a crystal structure of the silicon carbide is damaged. Furthermore, nickel particles <b>12</b> may be incorporated into the surface <b>101</b> or <b>101</b><i>g </i>during the grinding.

The nickel particles <b>12</b> may, for example, be arranged in the recesses <b>13</b> and at points where there is damage <b>14</b> to the crystal lattice.

Conversely, the objective may be a smaller depth (for example between 10 nm and 200 nm) of the region of damage if there is provision for the electrical contact <b>16</b> that is formed to serve merely as a seed layer for depositing a further electrically conductive layer, and/or if the electrical contact <b>16</b> forms at least one front-side electrode.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">An average roughness Ra of the ground surface <b>101</b><i>g </i>may be between approximately 10 nm and approximately 500 nm, for example between approximately 10 nm and approximately 50 nm.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In various exemplary embodiments, after the grinding the substrate <b>10</b> may simultaneously have all the properties mentioned above, namely a thickness Tg of the substrate <b>10</b> of approximately 50 &#x3bc;m&#x3c;Tg&#x3c;200 &#x3bc;m, an average roughness Ra of approximately 10 nm&#x3c;Ra&#x3c;500 nm and a region of damage having a thickness of between approximately 10 nm and approximately 500 nm, and nickel and/or nickel compounds <b>12</b> that are arranged on the ground surface <b>101</b><i>g </i>and/or in the region of damage.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> shows the silicon carbide substrate <b>10</b> with the ground surface <b>101</b><i>g </i>during a hardening process.
