Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a catalyst for carbonylation of dimethyl ether and a method for preparing the same. More specifically, the present disclosure relates to a catalyst for carbonylation of dimethyl ether that may have high catalyst activity and may be regenerated using a fluidized bed reactor and a method for preparing the same.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Due to depletion of fossil fuels, production of alternative energy is becoming increasingly important. In this regard, the most promising material is ethanol. Ethanol may be produced in a variety of ways. In particular, a multi-step reaction scheme of synthesizing ethanol using syngas including carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide which are by-product gases of factories and steel mills is attracting attention.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This multi-step reaction scheme is eco-friendly because the scheme may regenerate harmful gases such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, which is a greenhouse gas, and may effectively synthesize ethanol, and is evaluated as a very economical process due to various uses of ethanol. In this regard, a multi-step ethanol production reaction using syngas is as follows.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">(Reaction 1) Synthesis of dimethyl ether (DME synthesis)</p><p id="p-0007" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>2CO+4H<sub>2</sub>-&#x3e;CH<sub>3</sub>OCH<sub>3</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">(Reaction 2) Carbonylation of dimethyl ether (DME carbonylation)</p><p id="p-0009" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>CO+CH<sub>3</sub>OCH<sub>3</sub>-&#x3e;CH<sub>3</sub>COOCH<sub>3 </sub><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0010" num="0007">(Reaction 3) Hydrogenation of methyl acetate (MA hydrogenation)</p><p id="p-0011" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>CH<sub>3</sub>COOCH<sub>3</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>-&#x3e;CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH+CH<sub>3</sub>OH<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0012" num="0008">The most essential reaction in the above-described three-step reaction is the carbonylation of dimethyl ether, which is the second reaction. This is because, in general, when a zeolite-based catalyst is used as a catalyst for the above reaction, coke specific to zeolite is produced, and deposition of coke leads to deactivation of the catalyst. Therefore, solving the problem of Reaction 2 rather than Reaction 1 and Reaction 3 which occur relatively easily, is the most important issue in the commercialization of the scheme.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0009">In previous studies on carbonylation of dimethyl ether, mordenite zeolite has been mainly used. However, when mordenite zeolite is used, coke is easily produced due to its structural characteristics, and deactivation of the catalyst occurs very quickly.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0010">When ferrierite zeolite is used, coke production may be smaller than that when mordenite zeolite is used, such that the deactivation of the catalyst is suppressed to some extent. However, ferrierite zeolite reported to date does not completely suppress the deactivation. For this reason, research to regenerate the deactivated catalyst is being actively conducted.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0011">In general, a method using a fluidized bed reactor is widely used to regenerate the catalyst. When ferrierite zeolite is used, a density thereof is too small and thus flow does not occur. Thus, a method to increase the density includes pellet preparation via extrusion and compression, and particle size adjustment via a spray method which inevitably lead to use of a special apparatus, thereby causing infrastructure-related and economic problems.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0012">This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description.

For example, a commercial FCC (fluid catalytic cracking) catalyst having a density of 750 to 800 kg/m<sup>3 </sup>may be used as the support. That is, the support has the density set such that the support may flow in the fluidized bed reactor. Thus, when the catalyst according to the present disclosure is deactivated, the catalyst may be regenerated in the fluidized bed reactor.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0059">In one embodiment, a size of the support may be in a range of 50 to 150 &#x3bc;m, preferably in a range of 75 to 95 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0060">The ferrierite zeolite catalyst particles act as active materials for carbonylation of dimethyl ether, are bonded to the surface of the support via the polymer binder and have a second density smaller than that of the support. In this regard, a molar ratio (Si/Al) between a content of silicon and a content of aluminum in the ferrierite zeolite catalyst particle is preferably in a range of 5 to 30. Further, the ferrierite zeolite catalyst particles may include commercially available ferrierite zeolite catalyst particles, or H-form ferrierite that is synthesized by a known seed synthesis method and then is subjected to ion exchange.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0061">In one embodiment, a size of each of the ferrierite zeolite catalyst particles may be in a range of 100 nm and 1 &#x3bc;m, preferably in a range of 200 and 400 nm.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0062">Further, a ratio between a size of the support and a size of the ferrierite zeolite catalyst particle may be in a range of 150:1 to 500:1, preferably 275:1.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0063">In one embodiment, a surface of each of at least some of the ferrierite zeolite catalyst particles may be exposed to an outside. Increase in the exposed area of the ferrierite zeolite catalyst particles may improve the catalyst activity.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0064">In one embodiment, the catalyst according to the present disclosure may have a core-shell structure in which the ferrierite zeolite catalyst particles are coated on the surface of the support. Therefore, when the catalyst according to the present disclosure is used for carbonylation of dimethyl ether, deactivation of the catalyst may be prevented due to the core-shell structure, and coke production may be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0065">Further, the catalyst according to the present disclosure may be regenerated in a fluidized bed reactor, and the regenerated catalyst may be reused. Thus, process continuity may be increased and thus production of methyl acetate may be increased.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0066">The polymer binder may be a material for binding the ferrierite zeolite catalyst particles to the surface of the support, and may be preferably a water-soluble polymer or a polymer having a functional group capable of binding to the ferrierite zeolite catalyst particles.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0067">In one embodiment, the polymer binder may include at least one selected from polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and methyl cellulose. Specifically, a viscosity of the polyethylene glycol (PEG) may be preferably in a range of 114 to 142 mPa&#xb7;s, a viscosity of the polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) may be preferably in a range of 35 to 55 mPa&#xb7;s, and a viscosity of the methyl cellulose may be preferably in a range of 12 to 8000 cP.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0068">In one embodiment, the polymer binder may be a polymer binder including a functional group including at least one selected from a methoxyl group (CH<sub>3</sub>O&#x2014;), a carboxyl group (&#x2014;COOH), a glycerate (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>4</sub>&#x2014;) and a hydroxyl group (&#x2014;OH) as a functional group capable of binding to the ferrierite zeolite catalyst particles. When the polymer binder including the exemplified functional group is contained in the catalyst, the number of the ferrierite zeolite catalyst particles that may be bound to the support via the same amount of the polymer binder may be increased, thereby increasing the catalyst activity.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0069">In one embodiment, a molecular weight of the polymer binder is preferably in a range of 146000 to 186000 g/mol. When the molecular weight of the polymer binder is in a range of 146000 to 186000 g/mol, as a chain length of the polymer binder increases, the number of the ferrierite zeolite catalyst particles that may be bound to the support via the same amount of the polymer binder may increase, thereby increasing the catalyst activity.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0070">In one example, in the catalyst according to the present disclosure, a weight ratio between a content of the support and a content of the ferrierite zeolite catalyst particles is preferably in a range of 2.5:1 to 10:1. When the weight ratio (support/ferrierite zeolite catalyst particles) is smaller than 2.5:1, there is an excessive amount of ferrierite zeolite catalysts such that agglomeration occurs between the ferrierites rather than a uniform coating thereof occurs, thereby resulting in uneven coating. When the ratio exceeds 10:1, there is a problem in that an amount of the active material is too small and the catalyst reaction occurs insignificantly.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0071">Further, in the catalyst according to the present disclosure, when the polymer binder is polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), a content of the polymer binder may be in a range of 9 to 73% by weight, preferably, of 50 to 60% by weight, based on a total weight of the support and the ferrierite zeolite catalyst particles. When the content of the polymer binder is smaller than 9% by weight based on the total weight of the support and the ferrierite zeolite catalyst particles, the ferrierite zeolite particles are not entirely coated on the support due to an insufficient amount of the binder relative to the catalyst and are partially removed from the support so that the catalyst activity is reduced. When the content exceeds 73 wt%, an exposed area of the ferrierite zeolite catalyst particles is reduced, so that the catalyst activity is reduced.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0072">In another example, when the polymer binder is methyl cellulose, a content of the polymer binder is preferably in a range of 15 to 25% by weight of the total weight of the support and the ferrierite zeolite catalyst particles. When the content of the polymer binder is smaller than 15% by weight based on the total weight of the support and the ferrierite zeolite catalyst particles, the ferrierite zeolite particles are not entirely coated on the support due to an insufficient amount of the binder relative to the catalyst and are partially removed from the support so that the catalyst activity is reduced. When the content exceeds 25 wt %, an exposed area of the ferrierite zeolite catalyst particles is reduced, so that the catalyst activity is reduced.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0073">As described above, in the catalyst according to the present disclosure, the content of each of the support, the ferrierite zeolite catalyst particles, and the polymer binder may be controlled to an appropriate range such that the ferrierite zeolite catalyst particles are uniformly coated on the surface of the support while maintains crystallinity thereof. Thus, the catalyst according to the present disclosure may exhibit high activity in a conversion reaction from dimethyl ether to methyl acetate, and the deactivated catalyst may be regenerated in the fluidized bed reactor and then reused.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0074">Further, since the catalyst according to the present disclosure has the core-shell structure and is present in a form of a particle, deactivation thereof may be prevented, and coke deposition during the catalyst reaction may be suppressed, thereby enabling a stable process.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Method for Preparing Catalyst for Carbonylation of Dimethyl Ether</heading><p id="p-0079" num="0075">A method for preparing a catalyst according to one embodiment of the present disclosure includes mixing a support having a first density, ferrierite zeolite catalyst particles having a second density smaller than the first density, and a polymer binder with each other in a solvent to prepare a mixture in S100, drying the mixture in S200, and firing the dried mixture in S300.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0076">In one embodiment, S100 may include a first step S110 of mixing the support having a first density and the ferrierite zeolite catalyst particles having a second density smaller than the first density with each other, and a second step S120 of adding and mixing a mixture of the support and the ferrierite zeolite catalyst particles to and with a polymer binder solution.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0077">The polymer binder solution in S120 may be prepared by dissolving the polymer binder in a solvent for 1 to 6 hours under conditions of pH 6 to 8 and 80 to 100&#xb0; C.

id="h-0036" level="1">Catalyst Activity Based on Content of Each of Support, Ferrierite Zeolite Catalyst Particles, and Polymer Binder</heading><p id="p-0136" num="0130">Referring to Table 2, it may be identified that the dimethyl ether conversion of each of the catalysts of Present Examples 1-1 to 1-14 varies based on the weight content of the added ferrierite zeolite catalyst particles. As described above, the reactivity or activity of the catalyst may be controlled by appropriately adjusting the content of each of the support, the ferrierite zeolite catalyst particles, and the polymer binder.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0131">To the contrary, in Present Example 1-15 where the content of the polymer binder exceeds 73% by weight based on the total weight of the support and the ferrierite zeolite catalyst particles, the ferrierite zeolite catalyst particles may not bind to the support surface, resulting in no catalyst reactivity or activity.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0132">Therefore, in order for the catalyst according to the present disclosure to exhibit high activity, the weight ratio of the support and the ferrierite zeolite catalyst particles may be in a range of 2.5:1 to 10:1, and the content of the polymer binder may be in a range of 9 to 73% by weight based on the total weight of the support and the ferrierite zeolite catalyst particles.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0133">Further, it may be identified from Tables 1 and 2 that as an amount of the ferrierite zeolite catalyst particles coated on the support surface increases while the above defined content range is satisfied, the number of the acid sites that play an important role in DME carbonylation may increase, resulting in high reactivity or activity.</p><heading id="h-0037" level="1">Optimal Content of Polymer Binder Remaining in Entirety of Catalyst</heading><p id="p-0140" num="0134">Using the Table 2 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A to <b>5</b>C</figref> showing the results of TGA analysis, a content of the polymer binder remaining in the catalyst after the firing was identified.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0135">First, it may be identified that in a catalyst of Present Example 2 and a catalyst of each of Present Examples 20 to 23, when the content of the added binder is 54 wt %, 50 to 60% of the polymer binder remains after the firing at an optimum temperature, and in this case, the reactivity or activity of the catalyst has a maximal level. This is because, when the content of the residual binder is too high, the exposed area of the ferrierite particles is reduced and thus the catalyst activity decreases, whereas when the content of the residual binder is too low, the catalyst activity decreases because the number of ferrierite particles bound to the support decreases.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0136">Further, it may be identified that in Present Examples 6 to Present Example 14 using the methyl cellulose polymer binder, the reactivity or activity of the catalyst is excellent when the content of the remaining polymer binder is about 20%.</p><heading id="h-0038" level="1">Catalyst Activity Based on Viscosity (Molecular Weight) of Polymer Binder</heading><p id="p-0143" num="0137">Using Table 2 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A to <b>5</b>C</figref> showing the results of TGA analysis, the catalyst activity based on a viscosity of the polymer binder was identified.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0138">First, each of the catalysts of Present Examples 24 to 26 using PVA with a short polymer chain exhibits lower reactivity or activity than that of each of the catalysts of Present Example 2 and Present Examples 20 to 23 using PVA with a longer polymer chain.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0139">Further, when methyl cellulose is used as the polymer binder, the catalyst of each of Present Examples 18 to 19 having methyl cellulose having a long polymer chain exhibits better reactivity or activity, compared to the catalyst of each of Examples 6 to 14 having methyl cellulose having a short polymer chain.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0140">This is because as the chain length of the polymer binder increases (that is, as the viscosity (molecular weight) thereof increases), the number of ferrierite particles that may be bound to the support at the same amount of the binder may increase.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0141">A scope of protection of the present disclosure should be construed by the scope of the claims, and all technical ideas within the scope equivalent thereto should be construed as being included in the scope of the present disclosure.
