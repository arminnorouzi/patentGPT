Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is the most prevalent type of scoliosis which develops during adolescence in an otherwise healthy patient and typically ceases at the onset of skeletal maturity. The cause of the disease is presently unknown.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Current surgical treatment of scoliosis involves manipulation of the spinal column and attachment of corrective devices for fusion of a portion of the spine. One such system, the Cotel-Dubousset system utilizes rigid metal rods attached to the spine. The rods are manipulated during surgery in an attempt to reduce abnormal curvatures and rotations of the spinal column. Large loads are exerted on the spine for correction which risks the patient's neurological condition. Recovery from these procedures can be lengthy and painful. Also, if normal lordosis and kyphosis are not restored, a condition called &#x201c;flat back syndrome&#x201d; may occur causing chronic pain. Even a successful procedure rarely results in a normal spinal curvature and the patient is left with an immobile spinal section. The discs above and below the fusion zone are at risk of future degeneration due to the increased mechanical demands placed on them.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is therefore evident that there are flaws in prior art methods and devices. Most prior art devices are part of the load path of the spinal column. For example, it is understood that the Cotel-Dubgousset system rigidly attaches stiff metal rods to the spine. A structure having two roughly parallel support members relies primarily on the stiffer of the two members for transmission of loads. Therefore, loads exerted on an instrumented spine are transferred through the implant instead of through the spine. Spinal loads can be significantly large, and the implants will not support such loads indefinitely. Fatigue failure of the implant will occur if fusion is delayed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, there is an unaddressed need that exists to provide a new and better system for correcting spinal deformities.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The current invention describes methods and devices for treating spinal deformity which offer significant improvements over prior art methods and devices. In general terms the present invention is used to secure the distance between an ilium and the spine to either correct or maintain spinal curvature. There are many embodiments of the invention which will achieve the stated objectives, some of which will be presented in the following summary.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment of the invention, at least one device is attached between the spine and the pelvis which incorporates at least one flexible tether. Attachment of the flexible tether to the spine and ilium involves implantation of anchoring means and then attachment of the tether to the anchoring means. For example, at least one bone screw, pedicle screw, cannulated bone screw, clamp, plate, bone anchor, or shackle might be anchored to at least one vertebra and another to a portion of the ilium and the flexible tether may be attached to both. Other means of attachment will be clear to one practiced in the art. Alternatively, a loop of material may be placed around a bony structure (e.g. spinous process, transverse process, lamina or pars) or a hole through a bony structure through which the flexible tether is passed.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It should be noted that the present invention enables manipulating the vertebral column to correct the deformity by securing the tether to a portion of the ilium and a portion of the vertebral column; the ability to correct deformity by correcting the effective length of the tether between the ilium and vertebra over time; and correcting deformity by the natural growth of the spine by allowing the tether to maintain effective length between the vertebral column and the ilium.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Adjustment of the distance between the spine and ilium is achieved by varying the location at which the tether is attached to the anchoring means. The tether does not change lengths during the adjustment process, but the distance between the attachment points does, much like adjusting a belt around your waist. Taking advantage of the inherent viscoelasticity of spinal structures, the curvature may be gradually corrected by small incremental corrections over a protracted period of time, whereby the original incision is re-opened, or a new incision next to the original incision is created and the attachment means is disengage and then reengaged at a different location along the tether. Alternatively the patient's growth may be used to achieve correction.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Alternatively, the tether may branch into multiple tethers to provide multiple attachments to the spine and/or ilium. If more than one tether is used, each can be attached to a different vertebra, or multiple tethers can be attached to the same vertebra. Tethers can be attached to either or both sides of the vertebral column and either opposing sides of ilium as needed to generate correction of the spinal deformity. A crossing pattern whereby a tether is attached to the right side of the vertebra (e.g. the right pedicle) and left ilia, or vice versa, is possible. Also, a tether may be attached to a vertebra and then passed through an eye screw or other guiding device which is attached to the ilium (or both ilia) and then attached to a second vertebra with a pedicle screw or other means. In can be envisioned by one skilled in the art that guiding devices may be utilized on a number of vertebrae or one the ilium or ilia. The tether may also originate with an attachment to the pelvis, pass through any number of guide members attached to the spine, and then terminate at the pelvis again.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to another embodiment, a spinal system for correcting a deformity in the spine includes a tether, an anchor, an elongate rod and two bone fasteners, a clamp, and a fastener. The clamp is securable to the elongate rod. The clamp includes a clamp body and a hasp body hingedly connected to the clamp body. The clamp body has a first opening extending through the clamp body, and the hasp body has a second opening extending through the hasp body. When the clamp is closed, the first and second openings are aligned with one another, and the fastener is configured to be received through the first and second openings to securely lock the tether within the clamp. The hasp body may include a hinge sleeve portion having an opening extending therethrough, and a pivot pin received in the opening and connected to the clamp body to allow for pivotal movement of the hasp body relative to the clamp body. The tether may be temporarily secured to the clamp body, before the clamp is closed, by first and second elongate slots extending through the clamp body, which are configured to receive the tether. Alternatively, the clamp body may include an elongate pin member with opposing ends configured to be received in the clamp body so that the tether wraps around the elongate pin to temporarily secure the tether in the clamp.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">These and other aspects of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of the embodiments taken in conjunction with the following drawings, although variations and modifications therein may be affected without departing from the spirit and scope of the novel concepts of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention provides an improved method of arresting a spinal deformity whereby at least one device is surgically attached between the spine and the ilium. Also, the present invention provides a system and a method for correcting a spinal deformity whereby at least one device is surgically attached between the spine and the ilium.

The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an illustration of a posterior view of a deformed spine <b>104</b> whereby the preferred embodiment of the device <b>200</b> is attached to an ilium <b>102</b> and a vertebra <b>100</b>. Device <b>200</b> includes a tether <b>204</b> having a free end <b>206</b> and that is configured to be attached to the ilium and a portion of the vertebra. Specifically, in one embodiment, two attachment mechanisms such as pedicle screws <b>300</b> are anchored to the vertebra of the spine by insertion into opposing pedicles, and a transverse rod <b>311</b> is attached to the pedicle screws <b>300</b>. It should be noted that although pedicle screws are provided in this particular embodiment, any other type of anchoring mechanism such as hooks may also be used. A tether clamp <b>310</b> is attached to rod <b>311</b> and the tether <b>204</b> is passed though tether clamp <b>310</b> and then passed down to the ilium <b>102</b> thereby securing a connection between the attached vertebra and the ilium. To attach the tether <b>204</b> to the ilium <b>102</b>, an ilium anchor <b>210</b> is provided. The ilium anchor <b>210</b> includes a bore <b>211</b> and is configured to be attached to the ilium by inserting the anchor <b>210</b>(threading) into a hole which has been drilled or punched through the ilium <b>102</b>. It should be noted that any other similar mechanism to attach anchor <b>210</b> to the ilium <b>102</b> may also be utilized. Tether <b>204</b> is passed through hole or bore <b>211</b> in the ilium anchor <b>210</b> and then brought back to the vertebra <b>100</b> and passed again through the tether clamp <b>310</b>. In other embodiments, the tether <b>204</b> may only be passed once through the tether clamp and ilium anchor <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates the correction of the spine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> using device <b>200</b>.

For instance, different curvatures of the spine can be achieved by changing the position of the anchor and the clamp on the tether with respect to the vertebral column and the ilium. The locations along the tether where the clamp and anchor are attached determine an effective length of the tether, which in turn maximizes the distance that the attached vertebra may move relative to the position where the tether is attached at in the ilium. The scoliotic curve is corrected (or maintained) by adjusting the clamping and anchoring locations along the tether.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a detailed view of pedicle screws <b>300</b>, transverse rod <b>311</b>, tether clamp <b>310</b> and tether <b>204</b>.

The clamp body <b>624</b> further includes an enlarged opening <b>630</b> extending through the clamp body <b>624</b>. The enlarged opening <b>630</b> and through hole <b>622</b> may join to form a single irregular opening (e.g., a key-shaped opening defined by the outer U-shaped clamp body <b>624</b>). An elongate pin member <b>642</b> may connect a first side to a second side of the U-shaped clamp body portion <b>624</b>. In particular, opposing ends of the pin member <b>642</b> are each configured to be received in and engage one or more openings extending through the clamp body <b>624</b>. The tether <b>204</b> is configured to be received around the elongate pin member <b>642</b> in any suitable configuration to at least temporarily hold the tether <b>204</b> in the clamp body <b>624</b>.

The radial grooves <b>325</b> may be in the form of radial slots, protrusions, or the like extending around the opening <b>324</b> in the elongate rod <b>326</b>. The corresponding radial grooves include mating radial slots, protrusions, or the like extending around the opening <b>622</b> in the clamp body <b>624</b>.

As described elsewhere in this document, the implanted device may include two attachment mechanisms, such as pedicle screws <b>300</b>, which are anchored to the vertebra of the spine by insertion into opposing pedicles, and a transverse rod <b>311</b> connected between the pedicle screws <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">An ilium anchor <b>210</b> is attached to the ilium <b>102</b> to secure one end of the tether <b>204</b>. The ilium anchor <b>210</b> may be in the form of a bushing inserted through a hole drilled in the ilium <b>102</b>. The anchor <b>210</b> may have threads on its exterior surface to bite into the bone. The exterior surface may also include a coating of porous material, hydroxyapatite, bioconductive material, and/or bioinductive material. The tether <b>204</b> may be passed through the anchor <b>210</b> and secured, for example, with a buckle, a loop, or other connection mechanism. The free end <b>206</b> of the tether <b>204</b> is passed through a tether clamp, for example, tether clamp <b>320</b> described elsewhere herein or any other suitable tether clamp. The tether clamp <b>320</b> may be attached to the transverse rod <b>311</b> at any suitable location along its length. For example, the tether clamp <b>320</b> may be connected to the transverse rod <b>311</b> at one end of the transverse rod <b>311</b>. The tether <b>204</b> may be tensioned until the deformity is corrected as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The tether system may have a number of advantages. Because the tether <b>204</b> connects the spine <b>104</b> to the ilium <b>102</b>, the tether <b>204</b> uses the pelvis as a foundation from which to exert corrective forces onto a scoliotic spine. The tether system is not in the axial load path of the spine so forces typically borne by the spine continue to be borne by the spine. There may be no need for fusion during the life of the implant, but the system may be used prior to fusion if desired (e.g., a surgeon may use the tether system to prevent curve progression or correct a curve and then later fuse the spine with a subsequent surgery). The procedure is minimally invasive and may reduce operating room time and/or recovery time. The tether <b>204</b> is adjustable with a small incision to accommodate progressive correction and to prevent overcorrection during growth modulation procedures.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>26</b> and <b>27</b></figref>, a method and device for scoliosis correction are shown. In particular, the device and method may include de-rotating the vertebra in the axial plane. While traditional scoliosis correction attempts to laterally shift the spine, this method de-rotates the spine because axial rotation and lateral shift are mechanically coupled in the thoracic spine by the ribcage. In other words, axial rotation of one or more vertebra correlates to a lateral shift in the spine and correction of the scoliotic spine. This method does not need to involve fusion to correct the spinal deformity.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>, a non-fusion implant <b>700</b> may be used to impose a de-rotating tension on a pedicle screw <b>702</b> by using the posterior-most aspect of the ribs <b>110</b> as an anchor point. The implantation may be a minimally invasive surgical procedure, for example, through a small midline incision. The implant <b>700</b> may include one or more plates <b>704</b> configured to contact the ribs <b>110</b> and a pedicle screw <b>702</b> extending through the plate <b>704</b>. The plate <b>704</b> may be substantially straight, curved, or contoured as necessary to extend to the posterior-most aspect of the ribs <b>110</b> on either side of the vertebra <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The plate <b>704</b> may be implanted to abut the posterior aspect of the ribs <b>110</b> on both sides of the patient. The plate <b>704</b> may be coupled to the ribs <b>110</b> or may merely contact the ribs <b>110</b> without coupling thereto. The pedicle screw <b>702</b> with a threaded shank <b>706</b> may be passed through a slot <b>708</b> in the plate <b>704</b>. The slot <b>708</b> may be sized to receive the shank <b>706</b> or may be elongated to allow for movement of the shank <b>706</b> along the length of the plate <b>704</b>. A coupling element, such as a nut <b>710</b>, may be used to secure the screw <b>702</b> to the plate <b>704</b>. By rotating the nut <b>710</b> onto the threaded shank <b>706</b>, the pedicle is pulled closer to the plate <b>704</b>. This action causes de-rotation of the vertebra <b>108</b> and alignment of the spine. The de-rotation can be performed acutely or progressively over a period of time by re-accessing the nut <b>710</b> with a small incision and adjusting at one or more different points in time after the initial surgery.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In another embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>, instead of coupling with a nut, the threaded shank <b>706</b> may be received in a coupling sleeve <b>712</b>. The coupling sleeve <b>712</b> may include a threaded opening extending longitudinally therethrough sized and dimensioned to receive the threaded shank <b>706</b> of the screw <b>702</b>. The coupling sleeve <b>712</b> may include an enlarged head portion configured to engage with the slot <b>708</b> in the plate <b>704</b>. By rotating the coupling sleeve <b>712</b> onto the threaded shank <b>706</b>, the pedicle is once again pulled closer to the plate <b>704</b> in order to de-rotate the vertebra <b>108</b> in the axial plane. Although depicted entering one pedicle of the vertebra <b>108</b>, it is envisioned that the pedicle screw <b>702</b> could enter the opposite pedicle screw to apply torque to the vertebra <b>108</b> in the other direction. Alternatively, if pedicle screws cannot be used, for example, in the case of a small pediatric patient, a sublaminar band or wire can be attached to the plate <b>704</b> and tensioned as necessary to provide the desired axial movement. Regardless of the mechanism, the axial rotation of one or more vertebrae provides for a lateral shift in the spine and correction of the deformity.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention.
