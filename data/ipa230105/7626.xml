For example, aspects of the present disclosure relate to systems and techniques for indicating non-preferred resources for sidelink communications.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Wireless communications systems are deployed to provide various telecommunications and data services, including telephony, video, data, messaging, and broadcasts. Broadband wireless communications systems have developed through various generations, including a first-generation analog wireless phone service (1G), a second-generation (2G) digital wireless phone service (including interim 2.5G networks), a third-generation (3G) high speed data, Internet-capable wireless device, and a fourth-generation (4G) service (e.g., Long-Term Evolution (LTE), WiMax). Examples of wireless communications systems include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) systems, etc. Other wireless communications technologies include 802.11 Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, among others.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A fifth-generation (5G) mobile standard calls for higher data transfer speeds, greater number of connections, and better coverage, among other improvements. The 5G standard (also referred to as &#x201c;New Radio&#x201d; or &#x201c;NR&#x201d;), according to Next Generation Mobile Networks Alliance, is designed to provide data rates of several tens of megabits per second to each of tens of thousands of users, with 1 gigabit per second to tens of workers on an office floor. Several hundreds of thousands of simultaneous connections should be supported in order to support large sensor deployments. Consequently, the spectral efficiency of 5G mobile communications should be significantly enhanced compared to the current 4G/LTE standard. Furthermore, signaling efficiencies should be enhanced and latency should be substantially reduced compared to current standards. Aspects of 5G mobile communications may support direct communications between devices, which may be referred to as sidelink communications. Sidelink can also be referred to as PC5. Wi-Fi also includes a protocol for direct device-to-device communications, referred to as a Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) protocol.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The following presents a simplified summary relating to one or more aspects disclosed herein.

Alternate aspects may be devised without departing from the scope of the disclosure. Additionally, well-known elements of the disclosure will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the disclosure. Some of the aspects and embodiments described herein may be applied independently and some of them may be applied in combination as would be apparent to those of skill in the art. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the application. However, it will be apparent that various embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. The figures and description are not intended to be restrictive.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The ensuing description provides example embodiments, and is not intended to limit the scope, applicability, or configuration of the disclosure. Rather, the ensuing description of the exemplary embodiments will provide those skilled in the art with an enabling description for implementing an exemplary embodiment. It should be understood that various changes may be made in the function and arrangement of elements without departing from the spirit and scope of the application as set forth in the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Wireless communication networks are deployed to provide various communication services, such as voice, video, packet data, messaging, broadcast, and the like. A wireless communication network may support both access links and sidelinks for communication between wireless devices. An access link may refer to any communication link between a client device (e.g., a user equipment (UE), a station (STA), or other client device) and a base station (e.g., a 3GPP gNodeB (gNB) for 5G/NR, a 3GPP eNodeB (eNB) for LTE, a Wi-Fi access point (AP), or other base station). In one example, an access link between a UE and a 3GPP gNB can be over a Uu interface. In some cases, an access link may support uplink signaling, downlink signaling, connection procedures, etc.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A sidelink may refer to any communication link between client devices (e.g., UEs, STAs, etc.). For example, a sidelink may support device-to-device (D2D) communications, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) and/or vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, message relaying, discovery signaling, beacon signaling, or any combination of these or other signals transmitted over-the-air from one UE to one or more other UEs. In some examples, sidelink communications may be transmitted using a licensed frequency spectrum or an unlicensed frequency spectrum (e.g., 5 gigahertz (GHz) or 6 GHz). As used herein, the term sidelink can refer to 3GPP sidelink (e.g., using a PC5 sidelink interface), Wi-Fi direct communications (e.g., according to a Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) protocol), or using any other direct device-to-device communication protocol.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some examples, sidelink communications can be performed in a first mode (e.g., mode 1) in which a base station allocates the resources (e.g., time and/or frequency resources such as frame, sub-frame, sub-carrier, resource block, resource element, etc.) that are used for the sidelink transmissions. In some cases, sidelink communications can be performed in a second mode (e.g., mode 2) in which a UE can autonomously select the resources that are used for the sidelink transmissions. In some examples, one or more of the time and/or frequency resources that are allocated for sidelink communications (e.g., by a base station or by a UE) may result in degraded performance. In some instances, degraded performance of sidelink communications can be due to frequency selectivity of a channel, inter-cell interference, interference from other sidelink transmissions, environmental factors, device position, device mobility, etc. For example, a first UE may experience interference on its sidelink communications from a second UE that is served by a different base station and that is scheduled to use one or more resources that overlap with resources used by the first UE. In some cases, identifying time and/or frequency resources that are associated with poor performance (e.g., interference, frequency selectivity, etc.) and avoiding use of these non-preferred resources can improve sidelink communications.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Systems, apparatuses, processes (also referred to as methods), and computer-readable media (collectively referred to as &#x201c;systems and techniques&#x201d;) are described herein for performing wireless communications and determining (e.g., identifying, indicating, classifying) non-preferred time and/or frequency resources associated with sidelink communications. The systems and techniques provide the ability for a base station and/or a UE to obtain measurements and/or parameters associated with sidelink communications and determine non-preferred time and/or frequency resources that can be avoided and/or deprioritized in subsequent sidelink transmissions.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some aspects, a user equipment (UE) device can be configured to monitor performance of sidelink reception by taking measurements and collecting data associated with sidelink communications received from one or more other UEs (referred to herein as sidelink receptions). For example, a UE can measure signal strength, signal to interference ratio, signal to noise ratio, signal throughput, location data, environmental factors, and/or other measurements/parameters associated with sidelink receptions and can associate each of these measurements/parameters with one or more of the time and/or frequency resources used in the corresponding sidelink receptions. In some aspects, a UE can determine non-preferred resources based on the parameters/measurements and/or a UE can determine a preference level that is associated with the resources. In some examples, a UE can implement machine learning algorithms (e.g., a neural network) that can be used for determining the non-preferred resources and/or for assigning a preference level to one or more of the resources.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some cases, the UE can provide an indication of the non-preferred resource(s) to a base station and/or to a transmitting UE (e.g., a different UE that transmitted one or more sidelink communications to the receiving UE). For example, in a mode 1 configuration (where a base station allocates resources, as described above), the UE can send an indication of the non-preferred resource(s) to the base station and the base station can provide a new allocation of resource(s) that can exclude one or more of the non-preferred resource(s). In another example, in a mode 2 configuration (where the UE can autonomously select the resources, as described above), the UE can send an indication of the non-preferred resource(s) to the transmitting UE and the transmitting UE can select new resources that can exclude one or more of the non-preferred resources.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some aspects, the indication from the receiving UE to the base station (e.g., in a mode 1 configuration) and/or the transmitting UE (e.g., in a mode 2 configuration) can include measurement data corresponding to the sidelink communications. In one illustrative example, the indication can include channel state information (CSI) associated with the sidelink communications. In some examples, the base station and/or the transmitting UE can implement machine learning algorithms (e.g., one or more neural networks) that can be used for determining the non-preferred resources and/or for assigning a preference level to one or more of the resources. For instance, a neural network can be configured on the base station and/or the transmitting UE, such as using a neural processing unit (NPU) or other chip or component that can execute the neural network. Using the measurement data (e.g., CSI data) in the indication as input, the neural network can determine non-preferred resource(s) and/or can assign a preference level to resource(s).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Various aspects of the systems and techniques will be discussed below with respect to the figures. According to various aspects, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example of a wireless communications system <b>100</b>. The wireless communications system <b>100</b> (which may also be referred to as a wireless wide area network (WWAN)) may include various base stations <b>102</b> and various user equipment devices (UEs) <b>104</b>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;UE&#x201d; may be referred to interchangeably as an &#x201c;access terminal&#x201d; or &#x201c;AT,&#x201d; a &#x201c;user device,&#x201d; a &#x201c;user terminal&#x201d; or UT, a &#x201c;client device,&#x201d; a &#x201c;wireless device,&#x201d; a &#x201c;subscriber device,&#x201d; a &#x201c;subscriber terminal,&#x201d; a &#x201c;subscriber station,&#x201d; a &#x201c;mobile device,&#x201d; a &#x201c;mobile terminal,&#x201d; a &#x201c;mobile station,&#x201d; or variations thereof.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The base stations <b>102</b> may include macro cell base stations (high power cellular base stations) and/or small cell base stations (low power cellular base stations). In an aspect, the macro cell base station may include eNBs and/or ng-eNBs where the wireless communications system <b>100</b> corresponds to a 4G/LTE network, or gNBs where the wireless communications system <b>100</b> corresponds to a 5G/NR network, or a combination of both, and the small cell base stations may include femtocells, picocells, microcells, etc.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The base stations <b>102</b> may collectively form a RAN and interface with a core network <b>170</b> (e.g., an evolved packet core (EPC) or a 5G core (5GC)) through backhaul links <b>122</b>, and through the core network <b>170</b> to one or more location servers <b>172</b> (which may be part of core network <b>170</b> or may be external to core network <b>170</b>). In addition to other functions, the base stations <b>102</b> may perform functions that relate to one or more of transferring user data, radio channel ciphering and deciphering, integrity protection, header compression, mobility control functions (e.g., handover, dual connectivity), inter-cell interference coordination, connection setup and release, load balancing, distribution for non-access stratum (NAS) messages, NAS node selection, synchronization, RAN sharing, multimedia broadcast multicast service (MBMS), subscriber and equipment trace, RAN information management (RIM), paging, positioning, and delivery of warning messages. The base stations <b>102</b> may communicate with each other directly or indirectly (e.g., through the EPC/5GC) over backhaul links <b>134</b>, which may be wired and/or wireless.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The base stations <b>102</b> may wirelessly communicate with the UEs <b>104</b>. Each of the base stations <b>102</b> may provide communication coverage for a respective geographic coverage area <b>110</b>. In an aspect, one or more cells may be supported by a base station <b>102</b> in each coverage area <b>110</b>. A &#x201c;cell&#x201d; is a logical communication entity used for communication with a base station (e.g., over some frequency resource, referred to as a carrier frequency, component carrier, carrier, band, or the like), and may be associated with an identifier (e.g., a physical cell identifier (PCI), a virtual cell identifier (VCI), a cell global identifier (CGI)) for distinguishing cells operating via the same or a different carrier frequency. In some cases, different cells may be configured according to different protocol types (e.g., machine-type communication (MTC), narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), or others) that may provide access for different types of UEs. Because a cell is supported by a specific base station, the term &#x201c;cell&#x201d; may refer to either or both of the logical communication entity and the base station that supports it, depending on the context. In addition, because a TRP is typically the physical transmission point of a cell, the terms &#x201c;cell&#x201d; and &#x201c;TRP&#x201d; may be used interchangeably. In some cases, the term &#x201c;cell&#x201d; may also refer to a geographic coverage area of a base station (e.g., a sector), insofar as a carrier frequency can be detected and used for communication within some portion of geographic coverage areas <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">While neighboring macro cell base station <b>102</b> geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> may partially overlap (e.g., in a handover region), some of the geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> may be substantially overlapped by a larger geographic coverage area <b>110</b>. For example, a small cell base station <b>102</b>&#x2032; may have a coverage area <b>110</b>&#x2032; that substantially overlaps with the coverage area <b>110</b> of one or more macro cell base stations <b>102</b>. A network that includes both small cell and macro cell base stations may be known as a heterogeneous network. A heterogeneous network may also include home eNBs (HeNBs), which may provide service to a restricted group known as a closed subscriber group (CSG).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The communication links <b>120</b> (e.g., access links) between the base stations <b>102</b> and the UEs <b>104</b> may include uplink (also referred to as reverse link) transmissions from a UE <b>104</b> to a base station <b>102</b> and/or downlink (also referred to as forward link) transmissions from a base station <b>102</b> to a UE <b>104</b>. The communication links <b>120</b> may use MIMO antenna technology, including spatial multiplexing, beamforming, and/or transmit diversity. The communication links <b>120</b> may be through one or more carrier frequencies. Allocation of carriers may be asymmetric with respect to downlink and uplink (e.g., more or less carriers may be allocated for downlink than for uplink).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may further include a wireless local area network (WLAN) access point (AP) <b>150</b> in communication with WLAN stations (STAs) <b>152</b> via communication links <b>154</b> in an unlicensed frequency spectrum (e.g., 5 GHz). When communicating in an unlicensed frequency spectrum, the WLAN STAs <b>152</b> and/or the WLAN AP <b>150</b> may perform a clear channel assessment (CCA) or listen before talk (LBT) procedure prior to communicating in order to determine whether the channel is available. In some examples, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> can include devices (e.g., UEs etc.) that communicate with one or more UEs <b>104</b>, base stations <b>102</b>, APs <b>150</b>, etc. utilizing the ultra-wideband (UWB) spectrum. The UWB spectrum can range from 3.1 to 10.5 GHz.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The small cell base station <b>102</b>&#x2032; may operate in a licensed and/or an unlicensed frequency spectrum (e.g., utilizing LTE or NR technology and use the same 5 GHz unlicensed frequency spectrum as used by the WLAN AP <b>150</b>). The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may further include a millimeter wave (mmW) base station <b>180</b> that may operate in mmW frequencies and/or near mmW frequencies in communication with a UE <b>182</b>. In some cases, mmW frequencies can be referred to as the FR2 band (e.g., including a frequency range of 24250 MHz to 52600 MHz). In some examples, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> can include one or more base stations (referred to herein as &#x201c;hybrid base stations&#x201d;) that operate in both the mmW frequencies (and/or near mmW frequencies) and in sub-6 GHz frequencies (referred to as the FR1 band, e.g., including a frequency range of 450 to 6000 MHz). In some examples, the mmW base station <b>180</b>, one or more hybrid base stations (not shown), and the UE <b>182</b> may utilize beamforming (transmit and/or receive) over a mmW communication link <b>184</b> to compensate for the extremely high path loss and short range. The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may further include a UE <b>164</b> that may communicate with a macro cell base station <b>102</b> over a communication link <b>120</b> and/or the mmW base station <b>180</b> over a mmW communication link <b>184</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some examples, in order to operate on multiple carrier frequencies, a base station <b>102</b> and/or a UE <b>104</b> may be equipped with multiple receivers and/or transmitters. For example, a UE <b>104</b> may have two receivers, &#x201c;Receiver <b>1</b>&#x201d; and &#x201c;Receiver <b>2</b>,&#x201d; where &#x201c;Receiver <b>1</b>&#x201d; is a multi-band receiver that can be tuned to band (i.e., carrier frequency) &#x2018;X&#x2019; or band &#x2018;Y,&#x2019; and &#x201c;Receiver <b>2</b>&#x201d; is a one-band receiver tuneable to band &#x2018;Z&#x2019; only.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may further include one or more UEs, such as UE <b>190</b>, that connect indirectly to one or more communication networks via one or more relay devices (e.g., UEs) by using device-to-device (D2D) peer-to-peer (P2P) links (referred to as &#x201c;sidelinks&#x201d;). In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, UE <b>190</b> has a D2D P2P link <b>192</b> with one of the UEs <b>104</b>, which can be configured to operate as a relay device (e.g., through which UE <b>190</b> may indirectly communicate with base station <b>102</b>). In another example, UE <b>190</b> also has a D2D P2P link <b>194</b> with WLAN STA <b>152</b>, which is connected to the WLAN AP <b>150</b> and can be configured to operate as a relay device (e.g., UE <b>190</b> may indirectly communicate with AP <b>150</b>). In an example, the D2D P2P links <b>192</b> and <b>194</b> may be supported with any well-known D2D RAT, such as LTE Direct (LTE-D), Wi-Fi Direct (Wi-Fi-D), Bluetooth&#xae;, UWB, and so on.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As noted above, UE <b>104</b> and UE <b>190</b> can be configured to communicate using sidelink communications. In some examples, UE <b>104</b> and UE <b>190</b> can operate using one or more different modes for sidelink communications. For example, in mode 1 the cellular network (e.g., base station <b>102</b>) can select and manage the radio resources used by the UEs for performing sidelink communications. In another example, the UE <b>104</b> and UE <b>190</b> can be configured to operate using mode 2 in which the UEs can autonomously select the radio resources for sidelink communications. Mode 2 can operate without cellular coverage, and in some cases can be considered a baseline sidelink communications mode as devices and/or applications may not depend on the availability of cellular coverage. In some examples, mode 2 can include a distributed scheduling scheme for UEs to select radio resources.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some aspects, the radio resources that are selected and used for sidelink communications may be undesirable due to factors such as interference (e.g., inter-cell interference, inter-UE interference, channel frequency selectivity, etc.). In some examples, a receiving UE (e.g., UE <b>190</b>) may identify non-preferred (e.g., undesirable) resources and provide an indication to the base station (e.g., base station <b>102</b>) and/or the transmitting UE (e.g., UE <b>104</b>) of the non-preferred resources. In some cases, the base station (e.g., base station <b>102</b>) and/or the transmitting UE (e.g., UE <b>104</b>) can select and/or allocate one or more radio resources that exclude non-preferred resources.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a block diagram of a design of a base station <b>102</b> and a UE <b>104</b> that enable transmission and processing of signals exchanged between the UE and the base station, in accordance with some aspects of the present disclosure.

Transmit processor <b>220</b> may also generate reference symbols for reference signals (e.g., the cell-specific reference signal (CRS)) and synchronization signals (e.g., the primary synchronization signal (PSS) and secondary synchronization signal (SSS)). A transmit (TX) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processor <b>230</b> may perform spatial processing (e.g., precoding) on the data symbols, the control symbols, the overhead symbols, and/or the reference symbols, if applicable, and may provide T output symbol streams to T modulators (MODs) <b>232</b><i>a </i>through <b>232</b><i>t. </i>The modulators <b>232</b><i>a </i>through <b>232</b><i>t </i>are shown as a combined modulator-demodulator (MOD-DEMOD).

Other wireless communications technologies may have different frame structures and/or different channels.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">NR (and LTE) utilizes OFDM on the downlink and single-carrier frequency division multiplexing (SC-FDM) on the uplink. Unlike LTE, however, NR has an option to use OFDM on the uplink as well. OFDM and SC-FDM partition the system bandwidth into multiple (K) orthogonal subcarriers, which are also commonly referred to as tones, bins, etc. Each subcarrier may be modulated with data. In general, modulation symbols are sent in the frequency domain with OFDM and in the time domain with SC-FDM. The spacing between adjacent subcarriers may be fixed, and the total number of subcarriers (K) may be dependent on the system bandwidth. For example, the spacing of the subcarriers may be 15 kHz and the minimum resource allocation (resource block) may be 12 subcarriers (or 180 kHz). Consequently, the nominal fast Fourier transform (FFT) size may be equal to 128, 256, 512, 1024, or 2048 for system bandwidth of 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 megahertz (MHz), respectively. The system bandwidth may also be partitioned into subbands. For example, a subband may cover 1.08 MHz (i.e., 6 resource blocks), and there may be 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 subbands for system bandwidth of 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 MHz, respectively.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">LTE supports a single numerology (subcarrier spacing, symbol length, etc.).

Each node can represent a piece of information. Information associated with the nodes is shared among the different layers and each layer retains information as information is processed. Information can be exchanged between the nodes through node-to-node interconnections between the various layers. The nodes of the input layer <b>403</b> can activate a set of nodes in the first hidden layer <b>404</b>A. For example, as shown, each input node of the input layer <b>403</b> is connected to each node of the first hidden layer <b>404</b>A. The nodes of the hidden layer <b>404</b>A can transform the information of each input node by applying activation functions to the information. The information derived from the transformation can then be passed to and can activate the nodes of the next hidden layer (e.g., <b>404</b>B), which can perform their own designated functions. Example functions include convolutional, up-sampling, data transformation, pooling, and/or any other suitable functions. The output of hidden layer (e.g., <b>404</b>B) can then activate nodes of the next hidden layer (e.g., <b>404</b>N), and so on. The output of last hidden layer can activate one or more nodes of the output layer <b>406</b>, at which point an output is provided. In some cases, while nodes (e.g., nodes <b>408</b>A, <b>408</b>B, <b>408</b>C) in the neural network <b>400</b> are shown as having multiple output lines, a node has a single output and all lines shown as being output from a node represent the same output value.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070">In some cases, each node or interconnection between nodes can have a weight that is a set of parameters derived from training the neural network <b>400</b>. For example, an interconnection between nodes can represent a piece of information learned about the interconnected nodes. The interconnection can have a numeric weight that can be tuned (e.g., based on a training dataset), allowing the neural network <b>400</b> to be adaptive to inputs and able to learn as more data is processed.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">The neural network <b>400</b> can be pre-trained to process the features from the data in the input layer <b>403</b> using different hidden layers <b>404</b> in order to provide the output through the output layer <b>406</b>. For example, in some cases, the neural network <b>400</b> can adjust weights of nodes using a training process called backpropagation. Backpropagation can include a forward pass, a loss function, a backward pass, and a weight update. The forward pass, loss function, backward pass, and parameter update can be performed for one training iteration. The process can be repeated for a certain number of iterations for each set of training data until the weights of the layers are accurately tuned (e.g., meet a configurable threshold determined based on experiments and/or empirical studies).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0072">Once trained, the neural network <b>400</b> can receive as input one or more parameters associated with a communication channel between the UE <b>104</b> and UE <b>190</b>.

As noted herein, the channel conditions can include indoor and/or outdoor channel conditions, UE mobility status, multipath channel characteristics, and/or other channel conditions, or any combination thereof. For example, the trained neural network <b>400</b> can determine which resources were used for sidelink communications that are associated with particular measurements, parameters, metrics, etc., and can identify a preference level (e.g., non-preferred, preferred, etc.) that is associated with those resources so that they can be used in the future.

In some cases, a sidelink primary synchronization signal (S-PSS) and/or a sidelink secondary synchronization signal (S-SSS) can be used by a receiver to synchronize the receiver to the transmitter of the signals. In some aspects, a sidelink channel state information reference signal (SL CSI-RS) can be used for measuring channel state information (C SI) at the receiver that can then be provided to the transmitter as feedback that can be used for adjusting transmission parameters.

In some aspects, one or more time and/or frequency resources may be determined to be non-preferred due to frequency selectivity of the channel, inter-cell interference, interference due to other sidelink transmissions (e.g., UE performing sidelink autonomously in mode 2), location, environmental conditions, etc. In one example, the UE <b>606</b> can determine that sidelink transmissions corresponding to a particular frequency sub-carrier are associated with poor signal to noise ratio. Based on determining that the sidelink transmissions corresponding to the particular frequency sub-carrier are associated with poor signal to noise ratio, the UE <b>606</b> can determine that the particular frequency sub-carrier is a non-preferred resource.
