Sulfide solid electrolyte are materials having a high ion conductivity but have a disadvantage in terms of oxidation resistance.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0020">In International Publication No. 2019/135322, a halide solid electrolyte containing bromine is used. As a result of extensive studies, the present inventor has found that when a halide solid electrolyte containing bromine is included in a positive electrode material, the halide solid electrolyte is subjected to oxidative decomposition during charging of a battery, and the charge-discharge efficiency of the battery decreases accordingly.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0021">Specifically, in a material that contains bromine as an anion constituting a solid electrolyte, in the case of using a positive electrode active material having a potential of greater than or equal to 3.7 V relative to Li on average, the solid electrolyte may be decomposed by an oxidation reaction during charging, and the resulting oxidative decomposition product may function as a resistive layer. Herein, the oxidation reaction means, in addition to a normal charging reaction in which lithium and an electron are abstracted from a positive electrode active material in a positive electrode material, a side reaction in which an electron is also abstracted from a solid electrolyte containing an anion and in contact with the positive electrode active material. It is considered that, with this oxidation reaction, an oxidative decomposition layer having a poor lithium ion conductivity is formed between the positive electrode active material and the solid electrolyte, and the oxidative decomposition layer functions as a large interfacial resistance.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0022">Bromine has a smaller electronegativity and a larger ionic radius than chlorine. It is considered that, therefore, the interaction force between bromine and a cationic component constituting the halide solid electrolyte is weak, and bromine is likely to be oxidized. Accordingly, a battery using a solid electrolyte that contains chlorine as an anion constituting the solid electrolyte is considered to exhibit good oxidation resistance, and the charge-discharge efficiency of the battery may be improved.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0023">To suppress oxidative decomposition of a solid electrolyte and to suppress the formation of a high-resistance layer between a positive electrode active material and the solid electrolyte, it is necessary to select a solid electrolyte having good oxidation resistance. Furthermore, to improve the charge-discharge efficiency of a battery, it is necessary to reduce the interfacial resistance between the positive electrode active material and the solid electrolyte. However, in a battery using a positive electrode active material covered with a solid electrolyte, it is difficult to satisfy both the suppression of the formation of the high-resistance layer and the improvement in the charge-discharge efficiency of the battery.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0024">On the basis of the above finding, the present inventor has conceived forming a covering layer with a solid electrolyte that contains chlorine as an anion constituting the solid electrolyte. As a result, it has been found that an oxidation reaction of the solid electrolyte can be suppressed to further improve the charge-discharge efficiency of a battery.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0025">As a result of further extensive studies, the present inventor has ascertained a structure that is effective for reducing the interfacial resistance&#x2014;the structure having recessed portions of uneven portions of the surface of the positive electrode active material being filled with the solid electrolyte, and having protruding portions of the uneven portions of the surface of the positive electrode active material being exposed on the surface of a covered positive electrode active material is effective for reduce the interfacial resistance. Specifically, the present inventor has found that the realization of a covered positive electrode active material having a smooth surface enables a decrease in the interfacial resistance between the positive electrode active material and the solid electrolyte and a further improvement in the charge-discharge efficiency of the battery.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Summary of Aspects According to the Present Disclosure</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0026">A covered positive electrode active material includes a particulate positive electrode active material and a solid electrolyte that covers a surface of the positive electrode active material,</p><p id="p-0032" num="0027">wherein the solid electrolyte forms a covering layer,</p><p id="p-0033" num="0028">the covering layer is formed such that recessed portions of the surface of the positive electrode active material are filled with the solid electrolyte, and</p><p id="p-0034" num="0029">protruding portions of the surface of the positive electrode active material are exposed on a surface of the covered positive electrode active material,</p><p id="p-0035" num="0030">wherein a degree of unevenness &#x3b6; of a group of particles is defined by formula (1) below.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x3b6;=1<i>/n&#x3a3;</i><sub>i=1</sub><sup>n</sup>(<i>L</i><sub>ei</sub><i>/L</i><sub>pi</sub>) &#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0037" num="0031">In formula (1), n is an integer of greater than or equal to 3, the integer representing the number of measured particles, Lpi represents a perimeter of a contour of a sectional image of each particle, Lei represents a perimeter of an equivalent smooth ellipse having a long-short ratio and an area equal to a long-short ratio and an area of the sectional image of the particle, and the long-short ratio represents a ratio of a minor axis of the sectional image to a major axis of the sectional image, and</p><p id="p-0038" num="0032">a degree of unevenness of a group of particles of the positive electrode active material is defined as &#x3b6;<sub>1</sub>, and a degree of unevenness of a group of particles of the covered positive electrode active material is defined as &#x3b6;<sub>2</sub>, and</p><p id="p-0039" num="0033">a degree of change in unevenness R defined by formula (2) below is greater than or equal to 1.1.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>R=&#x3b6;</i><sub>2</sub>/&#x3b6;<sub>1 </sub>&#x2003;&#x2003;(2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0041" num="0034">The solid electrolyte has a composition represented by formula (3) below.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Li<sub>&#x3b1;</sub>M<sub>&#x3b2;</sub>Cl<sub>&#x3b3;</sub>&#x2003;&#x2003;(3)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0043" num="0035">In formula (3), &#x3b1;, &#x3b2;, and &#x3b3; are values greater than 0, and M includes at least one selected from the group consisting of metal elements other than Li and metalloid elements.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0036">According to a first aspect, the charge-discharge efficiency of a battery can be improved.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0037">In a second aspect of the present disclosure, for example, in the covered positive electrode active material according to the first aspect, a ratio of a mass of the solid electrolyte to a mass of the positive electrode active material may be in a range of greater than or equal to 3/100 and less than or equal to 1/10.
