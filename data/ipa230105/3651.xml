The present invention is based on the analysis of Excitation-Emission matrices (or EEM matrices in the rest of the disclosure) and is of interest in all fields relating to the identification of microorganisms, in particular the medical sector, for example in research laboratories, microbiology, bacteriology or parasitology-mycology laboratories, Hospital Centres and medical biology analysis laboratories.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Infections due to microorganisms such as bacteria, yeasts, filamentous fungus, parasites or micro-algae affect immunodeficient individuals as well as immunocompetent individuals. Immunodeficient individuals however have a higher risk of severe infections. The infections affecting immunodeficient individuals are often associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality. In order to initiate the suitable treatment, it is essential to correctly and quickly identify the microorganism that is responsible for the infection.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The reference method for identifying microorganisms is based on the sequencing of a particular region of the genome of said microorganism. This method involves extracting the DNA and analysing the sequence obtained. This method is extremely reliable but requires equipment and suitable premises. In the absence of automation, this method is expensive and time consuming.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The limits of these molecular techniques led to the development of alternative methods, based on mass spectrometry, in particular mass spectrometry of the MALDI-TOF type which is increasingly widely used in microbiology, bacteriology, or parasitology-mycology laboratories of hospital centres as in medical biology analysis laboratories for identifying microorganisms.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The cost of a mass spectrometer of the MALDI-TOF type is high. This equipment requires annual maintenance which immobilises the equipment for 24 to 48 h, with in particular as a possible consequence for accredited laboratories non-compliance with commitments in terms of lead time for rendering results.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the framework of a method for identification by mass spectrometry of the MALDI-TOF type, depositing the microorganism on a target determines the quality of the spectral fingerprints, and the resolution power. Indeed, the deposition has to be regular and thin, i.e. in a &#x201c;thin layer&#x201d;. After drying and deposition of a matrix, it must be possible to extract the proteins from the microorganism and to ionise them so as to obtain after separation in the column of the MALDI-TOF a mass spectrum that makes it possible, via the analysis of ions with a low molecular weight, to determine the identity of the microorganism.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The profile of the peaks obtained by mass spectrometry of the MALTI-DOF type is then compared to a database constituted of reference spectra established for each one of the microorganisms present in the base. The base is supplied with individual spectra obtained for different strains of microorganisms, sometimes cultivated in different conditions (culture mediums, age of the cultures), from which superspectra characteristic of the species and independent of the culture conditions can be defined.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">There are however differences, including in the reference spectra, according to the MALTI-DOF equipment used. The performances, in terms of discriminating power and of reliability in the final identification, are also according to the algorithms used. Thus, two laboratories that have two different pieces of equipment can sometimes conclude to contrary identifications for the same microorganism.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The method of identification by mass spectrometry of the MALTI-DOF type thus has several disadvantages. The equipment used and the annual maintenance thereof make it an expensive method. For certain suppliers, the equipment is bulky. It is therefore difficult for a laboratory to consider holding several pieces of equipment of this type, and this equipment cannot be transported from one department or from one laboratory to another.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL PROBLEM</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The inventors have implemented a method for identifying microorganisms that is as reliable as the methods known by a person skilled in the art until today, that do not have the disadvantages listed hereinabove.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The method for identifying that improves the current situation is based on an analysis of the main components of an Excitation Emission matrix (EEM) characteristic of a microorganism using at least one reference matrix (EEMr), the matrices being obtained for example using a fluorometer.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The microorganism is illuminated with a light characterised by its wavelength.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the framework of the present disclosure, the term light means a visible or invisible electromagnetic wave, more preferably an electromagnetic wave chosen from ultraviolet (UV) to infrared (IR) and passing through the visible range.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The microorganism thus illuminated then passes from a so-called fundamental state to an excited state by absorbing photons called excitation photons. The excited microorganism then recovers its fundamental state by re-emitting photons called emission photons. According to the excitation wavelength, i.e. the wavelength of the excitation photos, the emission wavelengths, i.e. the wavelengths of the re-emitted photons, can change and thus according to the microorganism studied.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The method then consists of collecting, for each given excitation wavelength, the emission spectrum of the sample. The emission spectrum represents the quantities of emission photos measured at different wavelengths, the quantity of emission photos being directly proportional to a power or a light energy according to the classical laws of photonics and to the specific interaction with the sample studied.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The method is rendered all the more reliable as for the same microorganism, different excitation wavelengths are used and as for each excitation wavelength an emission spectrum is collected.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Identifying a microorganism thus consists of measuring and analysing the emission spectra emitted by the microorganism after having been successively illuminated by lights of different wavelengths.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">An object of the method is thus a method for identifying a microorganism to be identified comprising the following steps:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0019">obtaining an Excitation-Emission EEM of the microorganism to be identified,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0020">analysing the main components of said EEM matrix using at least one Excitation-Emission reference matrix EEMr,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0021">projecting the result of the analysis onto a plane defined by two main components, and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0022">identifying the microorganism to be identified.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0020" num="0023">Identifying a microorganism using the method disclosed herein is quick.
