description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0002" level="1">1. Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a waveguide for use in thermally-assisted magnetic recording to write data on a recording medium with the coercivity thereof lowered by applying near-field light thereto, and a manufacturing method thereof.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">With recent increases in recording density of magnetic recording devices such as magnetic disk drives, there has been demand for improved performance of thin-film magnetic heads and recording media. Among the thin-film magnetic heads, a composite thin-film magnetic head has been used widely. The composite thin-film magnetic head has such a structure that a read head unit including a magnetoresistive element (hereinafter, also referred to as MR element) for reading and a write head unit including an induction-type electromagnetic transducer for writing are stacked on a substrate. In a magnetic disk drive, the thin-film magnetic head is mounted on a slider configured to slightly fly above the surface of a recording medium. The slider has a medium facing surface configured to face the recording medium.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To increase the recording density of a magnetic recording device, it is effective to make the magnetic fine particles of the recording medium smaller. Making the magnetic fine particles smaller, however, disadvantageously lowers the thermal stability of magnetization of the magnetic fine particles. To overcome this problem, it is effective to increase the anisotropic energy of the magnetic fine particles. However, increasing the anisotropic energy of the magnetic fine particles leads to an increase in coercivity of the recording medium, thereby making it difficult to perform data writing with existing magnetic heads.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As a solution to the problems described above, there has been proposed a technology called thermally-assisted magnetic recording. The technology uses a recording medium having high coercivity. When writing data, a write magnetic field and heat are applied almost simultaneously to the area of the recording medium where to write data, so that the area rises in temperature and drops in coercivity for data writing. The area where data is written subsequently falls in temperature and rises in coercivity to increase in thermal stability of magnetization. Hereinafter, a magnetic head for use in thermally-assisted magnetic recording will be referred to as a thermally-assisted magnetic recording head.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In thermally-assisted magnetic recording, near-field light is typically used as a means for applying heat to the recording medium. A known method for generating near-field light is to use a plasmon generator, which is a piece of metal that generates near-field light from plasmons excited by irradiation with laser light. The laser light to be used for generating near-field light is typically emitted from a laser diode mounted on the slider, and is guided, by a waveguide provided in the slider, to the plasmon generator disposed near the medium facing surface of the slider.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 8,619,514 B1 and U.S. Pat. No. 8,908,482 B1 disclose waveguides for use in a thermally-assisted magnetic recording head. U.S. Pat. No. 8,619,514 B1 discloses a waveguide formed of a core material that reduces in width with decreasing distance to the air bearing surface of a slider. U.S. Pat. No. 8,908,482 B1 discloses a waveguide core that increases in width with decreasing distance to a near-field transducer (NFT) located near a medium facing surface.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A waveguide core is formed by photolithographically patterning a dielectric layer, for example. In photolithographically forming a core having a sharp tip portion, like the cores of the waveguides disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 8,619,514 B1 and U.S. Pat. No. 8,908,482 B1, a photoresist mask needs to be removed while preventing the breaking of the tip portion of the core. Specifically, for example, the photoresist mask needs to be removed without the use of ultrasonic waves which can enhance the exfoliation efficiency of the photoresist mask. This, however, can result in residue due to the photoresist mask. Moreover, high resolution photolithography is needed to make the tip portion sharp. However, high resolution photolithography contributes to increased cost.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the present invention is to provide a waveguide having high reliability and capable of cost reduction.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A waveguide according to the present invention includes a core allowing light to propagate therethrough and a cladding located around the core. The core is formed of a first dielectric material having a first refractive index and has an inlet on which the light is incident. The cladding is formed of a second dielectric material having a second refractive index lower than the first refractive index. The core includes a front portion and a rear portion located between the front portion and the inlet. The front portion and the rear portion each have a thickness that is a dimension in a first direction and a width that is a dimension in a second direction. The first direction is orthogonal to a propagation direction of the light. The second direction is orthogonal to the propagation direction of the light and the first direction. The thickness of the front portion decreases with increasing distance from the inlet.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the waveguide according to the present invention, the width of the front portion may decrease with increasing distance from the inlet. In such a case, the front portion may have a front end farthest from the inlet. The width of the front portion at the front end may be greater than the thickness of the front portion at the front end.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the waveguide according to the present invention, the front portion may have a top surface and a bottom surface located at both ends in the first direction. The bottom surface may be inclined so as to approach the top surface with increasing distance from the inlet. In such a case, an angle that the bottom surface forms with respect to the propagation direction of the light may fall within a range of 0.1&#xb0; to 5&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the waveguide according to the present invention, the front portion may have a minimum thickness of 80 nm or less. The dimension of the front portion in the propagation direction of the light may fall within a range of 50 to 120 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the waveguide according to the present invention, the thickness of the rear portion may be greater than or equal to the maximum thickness of the front portion. The width of the rear portion may be greater than or equal to the maximum width of the front portion.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the waveguide according to the present invention, the core may include a first layer including the front portion and the rear portion, and a second layer stacked on the first layer.

In this step, a dielectric layer, which later becomes the first layer <b>141</b> of the core <b>140</b>, is initially formed on the cladding layer <b>19</b>. Next, a hard mask composed of a nonmagnetic metal material such as Ru, Ta, and NiCr is formed on the dielectric layer. The hard mask is formed by photolithographically patterning the nonmagnetic metal layer. The hard mask has a planar shape corresponding to that of the first layer <b>141</b>. The nonmagnetic metal layer is patterned by using a first photoresist mask having a planar shape corresponding to that of the first layer <b>141</b>.

Next, the cladding layer <b>19</b> and the dielectric layer are etched by, for example, RIE, where the hard mask is used as an etching mask. This etching makes the dielectric layer into the first layer <b>141</b> of the core <b>140</b>. The second photoresist mask is formed to stabilize the etching of the dielectric layer by RIE. Next, the second photoresist mask is removed. At this point in time, the front end <b>141</b><i>b </i>of the first layer <b>141</b> is exposed. As described above, the front end <b>141</b><i>b </i>of the first layer <b>141</b> is a sharp edge formed by the first side surface <b>141</b><i>e </i>and the second side surface <b>141</b><i>f </i>intersecting with each other. The second photoresist mask is therefore removed by wet etching and ashing without using ultrasonic waves so that the front end <b>141</b><i>b </i>of the first layer <b>141</b> is not broken. The subsequent steps are similar to those of forming the first layer <b>41</b> in the present embodiment.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">As described above, in the comparative example, the second photoresist mask needs to be removed without the use of ultrasonic waves that can enhance the exfoliation efficiency of the photoresist mask. This, however, can result in residue due to the second photoresist mask.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">By contrast, in the present embodiment, the first layer <b>41</b> can be formed without exposing the front end <b>41</b><i>b </i>of the first layer <b>41</b>. Thus, in the present embodiment, ultrasonic waves can be used in the step of removing the photoresist mask <b>84</b> after the formation of the first layer <b>41</b>. According to the present embodiment, the reliability can be enhanced by preventing the occurrence of residues.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">To make the front end <b>141</b><i>b </i>of the first layer <b>141</b> sharp, the first and second photoresist masks need to be formed so that the portions corresponding to the front end <b>141</b><i>b </i>of the first layer <b>141</b> have a sharp planar shape. For that purpose, for example, high resolution photolithography using KrF excimer laser needs to be applied to the first and second photoresist masks. However, the high resolution photolithography contributes to increased cost.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">By contrast, in the present embodiment, the planar shape of the front end <b>41</b><i>b </i>of the first layer <b>41</b> is not as sharp as that of the front end <b>141</b><i>b </i>of the first layer <b>141</b>. Thus, according to the present embodiment, photolithography having lower resolution than in the comparative example can be used. According to the present embodiment, cost can thereby be reduced.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">As described above, the angle that the bottom surface of the front portion <b>41</b>A of the first layer <b>41</b> forms with respect to the X direction preferably falls within, for example, the range of 0.1&#xb0; to 5&#xb0;. Here, the angle that the bottom surface of the front portion <b>41</b>A forms with respect to the X direction will be referred to as the inclination angle of the bottom surface of the front portion <b>41</b>A.

This result shows that the transmittance increases as the inclination angle decreases. The core <b>140</b> of the waveguide of the comparative example showed a transmittance ranging from 92% to 95%. For the core <b>40</b> to have a transmittance higher than or equivalent to that of the core <b>140</b>, the inclination angle of the bottom surface of the front portion <b>41</b>A therefore preferably falls within the range of 0.1&#xb0; to 5&#xb0;.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0142" num="0141">Next, a manufacturing method for a waveguide according to a second embodiment of the present invention will be described.

The subsequent steps are similar to those of the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">As described above, in the manufacturing method for the waveguide according to the present invention, the step of forming the core <b>40</b> includes the steps of forming the nonmagnetic metal layer <b>85</b> on the cladding layer <b>19</b> and forming the anti-reflective coating <b>86</b> on the nonmagnetic metal layer <b>85</b> before the step of forming the photoresist mask <b>81</b>.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">To improve the patterning precision of the photoresist mask <b>81</b>, it is preferable to cut off reflection light from under the photoresist mask <b>81</b> or make the reflectance under the photoresist mask <b>81</b> uniform. According to the present embodiment, the reflection light can be cut off by the nonmagnetic metal layer <b>85</b>, and the reflectance of the nonmagnetic metal layer <b>85</b> can be reduced by the anti-reflective coating <b>86</b>. For example, with the formation of the nonmagnetic metal layer <b>85</b> and the anti-reflective coating <b>86</b>, the reflectance at 365 nm is approximately 4%.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">The remainder of configuration, function and effects of the present embodiment are similar to those of the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">The present invention is not limited to the foregoing embodiments, and various modifications may be made thereto.
