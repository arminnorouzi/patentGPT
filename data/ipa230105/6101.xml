In contrast, currently commercialized major displays are represented by LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) and AMOLED (Active Matrix Organic Light Emitting Diodes).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, in the case of LCD, there are problems in that the response time is not fast and flexible implementation is difficult, and in the case of AMOLED, there is a weakness in that the lifespan is short, the mass production yield is not good, and the degree of flexibility is weak.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Meanwhile, a light emitting diode (LED) is a well-known semiconductor light emitting device that converts electric current into light. Starting with the commercialization of a red LED using a GaAsP compound semiconductor in 1962, it has been used as a light source for display images of electronic devices, including information and communication devices, along with GaP:N-based green LEDs. Accordingly, a method for solving the above problems by implementing a flexible display using the semiconductor light emitting device can be proposed.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The semiconductor light emitting device is transferred onto the substrate in various ways. As one of the transfer methods of semiconductor light emitting devices, a transfer method using an anisotropic conductive layer is used. The use of the anisotropic conductive layer has an advantage in that the semiconductor light emitting device and the wiring electrode can be electrically connected only by thermal compression, but there is a problem in that poor contact between the semiconductor light emitting device and the wiring electrode occurs when the area of the wiring substrate increases.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One object of the present invention is to provide a structure and a manufacturing method for preventing contact failure between a semiconductor light emitting device and a wiring electrode when the semiconductor light emitting device is pressed to a wiring electrode using an anisotropic conductive layer.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to achieve the above object, the present invention provides a display device characterized in that including a substrate, a wiring electrode disposed on the substrate, a plurality of semiconductor light emitting devices electrically connected to the wiring electrode, and an anisotropic conductive layer disposed between the semiconductor light emitting devices and made of a mixture of conductive particles and an insulating material, and a light-transmitting layer formed between the semiconductor light emitting devices .The anisotropic conductive layer includes a plurality of anisotropic conductive layers, and any one of the plurality of anisotropic conductive layers is formed to surround one semiconductor light emitting device or to surround a plurality of semiconductor light emitting devices adjacent to each other.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an embodiment, the plurality of anisotropic conductive layers can be disposed to be spaced apart from each other.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an embodiment, the wiring electrode can include a first region overlapping the anisotropic conductive layer and a second region not overlapping the anisotropic conductive layer.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an embodiment, the second region can overlap the light-transmitting layer.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an embodiment, the anisotropic conductive layer can be formed to surround a side surface of the semiconductor light emitting device.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention also provides a method of manufacturing a display device by transferring a plurality of semiconductor light emitting devices to a substrate on which wiring electrodes are formed.

Through this, the present invention can prevent a contact failure between the semiconductor light emitting device and the wiring electrode.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In addition, according to the present invention, when the semiconductor light emitting device is pressed onto the wiring substrate, since the buffer unit maintains a constant distance between the semiconductor light emitting device and the wiring electrode, uniform pressure can be applied to each of the semiconductor light emitting devices even when the wiring substrate is widened.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram showing an embodiment of a display device using a semiconductor light emitting device of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a partially enlarged view of part A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> are cross-sectional views taken along lines B-B and C-C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating the flip-chip type semiconductor light emitting device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A to <b>5</b>C</figref> are conceptual views illustrating various forms of implementing colors in relation to a flip-chip type semiconductor light emitting device.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating a method of manufacturing a display device using the semiconductor light emitting device of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a perspective view showing another embodiment of a display device using the semiconductor light emitting device of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line D-D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating the vertical semiconductor light emitting device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref> are conceptual views illustrating problems occurring during compression described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref> are conceptual views illustrating a method of manufacturing a display device according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b> to <b>16</b></figref> are conceptual views illustrating a method of transferring a semiconductor light emitting device after forming an anisotropic conductive layer.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view showing a cross section of a display device according to the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0008" level="1">MODE FOR INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Hereinafter, the embodiments disclosed in the present specification will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, but the same or similar components are given the same reference sign regardless of the reference numerals, and the redundant description thereof will be omitted.

When the second electrode <b>240</b> is positioned after the transparent insulating layer is formed, the second electrode <b>240</b> is positioned on the transparent insulating layer.

Accordingly, the present invention has the advantage of not using a transparent electrode such as ITO by locating the second electrode <b>240</b> between the semiconductor light emitting devices <b>250</b>. Therefore, it is possible to improve light extraction efficiency by using a conductive material having good adhesion to the n-type semiconductor layer as a horizontal electrode without being limited by the selection of a transparent material.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">As shown, a barrier wall <b>290</b> can be positioned between the semiconductor light emitting devices <b>250</b>.
