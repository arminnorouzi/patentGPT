homogeneously and over their entire surface with sunlight-like illumination (Standard Testing Conditions&#x2014;STC), and the currents and voltages that occur have to be measured at appropriate contacts. Solar simulators, what are known as flashers, in this case simulate a spectral width and a spectral intensity distribution that largely correspond to sunlight. Solar simulators used for illumination are highly complex in terms of instrumentation and not arbitrarily scalable in length. Usual solar simulators illuminate areas of up to 3 m<sup>2</sup>. The illumination area of solar simulators for determining the performance of solar cells is finite; especially in the case of particularly large and lengthy solar cells, the area of the solar cells cannot be illuminated all at once with the solar simulator. Measurements of natural sunlight are highly error-prone and practically impossible to achieve with a reasonable throughput.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The homogeneous illumination of solar cells as required in the relevant standards, for example IEC 60904, during an inspection cannot be implemented technically for solar cells having arbitrary lengths and/or widths.

The method comprises the following steps:</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">a) providing a photovoltaic element,</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">b) providing a dark characteristic curve of the photovoltaic element at a specific voltage applied to the photovoltaic element,</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">c) dividing the photovoltaic element into individual segments,</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">d) measuring characteristic curves of the individual segments of the photovoltaic element in a time sequence, wherein the individual segments are illuminated by way of an illumination device at the specific voltage applied to the photovoltaic element, wherein the photovoltaic element is moved along a running direction relative to the illumination device and/or the illumination device is moved along a running direction relative to the photovoltaic element, and</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">e) ascertaining an overall characteristic curve of the photovoltaic element as a function of the dark characteristic curve and the measured characteristic curves of the individual segments, such that the photovoltaic element is able to be inspected.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">An overall photocurrent for the entire photovoltaic element is preferably obtained, wherein the overall photocurrent results from the sum of all of the photocurrents of the individual segments.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The method according to the Disclosure makes it possible to inspect photovoltaic elements of theoretically any length and/or width, in particular through segment-wise illumination and the mathematical composition of the overall characteristic curve.

A requirement, for example in the usual standards, whereby a photovoltaic element has to be fully illuminated during the measurement, is therefore not met, but the division of the photovoltaic element into individual segments and the measurement of these homogeneously illuminated individual segments in accordance with the method according to the Disclosure does not exhibit any, or at least exhibits only a very small, deviation in comparison with the full-area illumination of the entire photovoltaic element.

An organic photovoltaic element is understood to mean in particular a photovoltaic element having at least one organic photoactive layer, in particular a polymeric organic photovoltaic element or an organic photovoltaic element on the basis of small molecules. While polymers are distinguished by being not evaporable and therefore only being able to be applied from solutions, small molecules are usually evaporable and may be applied either like polymers as a solution, but also by way of vapor deposition technology, in particular by vapor deposition from a vacuum. Small molecules are understood to mean in particular non-polymeric organic molecules having monodisperse molar masses between 100 and 2000 g/mol that exist in the solid phase at standard pressure (air pressure of the ambient atmosphere) and at room temperature.
