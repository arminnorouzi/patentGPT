The printer <b>1</b> applies a liquid to a sheet P conveyed from the loading device <b>10</b> by the printing device <b>20</b> to perform desired printing, dries the liquid adhering to the sheet P by the drying device <b>30</b>, and ejects the sheet P to the ejection device <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The loading device <b>10</b> includes a loading tray <b>11</b> on which a plurality of sheets P are stacked, a feeding unit <b>12</b> to separate and feed the sheets P one by one from the loading tray <b>11</b>, and a resist roller pair <b>13</b> to feed the sheet P to the printing device <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Any feeding unit <b>12</b> such as a device using a roller or a device using air suction may be used as the feeding unit <b>12</b>. The sheet P delivered from the loading tray <b>11</b> by the feeding unit <b>12</b> is delivered to the printing device <b>20</b> by the resist roller pair <b>13</b> being driven at a predetermined timing after a leading end of the sheet P reaches the resist roller pair <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The printing device <b>20</b> includes a sheet conveyor <b>21</b> to convey the sheet P. The sheet conveyor <b>21</b> includes a drum <b>51</b> and a suction device <b>52</b>. The drum <b>51</b> is a bearer (rotating member) that bears the sheet P on a circumferential surface of the drum <b>51</b> and rotates. The suction device <b>52</b> generates a suction force on the circumferential surface of the drum <b>51</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The printing device <b>20</b> includes a liquid discharge device <b>22</b> that discharges the liquid toward the sheet P borne on the drum <b>51</b> of the sheet conveyor <b>21</b> to apply the liquid onto the sheet P.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The printing device <b>20</b> further includes a transfer cylinder <b>24</b> and a delivery cylinder <b>25</b>. The transfer cylinder <b>24</b> receives the sheet P fed from the resist roller pair <b>13</b> and transfers the sheet P to the drum <b>51</b>. The delivery cylinder <b>25</b> delivers the sheet P conveyed by the drum <b>51</b> to the drying device <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">A leading end of the sheet P conveyed from the loading device <b>10</b> to the printing device <b>20</b> is gripped by a sheet gripper provided on a surface of the transfer cylinder <b>24</b> and is conveyed in accordance with a rotation of the transfer cylinder <b>24</b>. The transfer cylinder <b>24</b> forwards the sheet P to the drum <b>51</b> at a position opposite (facing) the drum <b>51</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Similarly, the drum <b>51</b> includes a sheet gripper on a surface of the drum <b>51</b>, and the leading end of the sheet P is gripped by the sheet gripper of the drum <b>51</b>. Multiple suction holes are dispersedly formed on the surface of the drum <b>51</b>. The suction device <b>52</b> generates a suction airflow from desired multiple suction holes of the drum <b>51</b> toward an interior of the drum <b>51</b>. The suction device <b>52</b> serves as a suction device.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The sheet gripper <b>106</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) of the drum <b>51</b> grips the leading end of the sheet P forwarded from the transfer cylinder <b>24</b> to the drum <b>51</b>, and the sheet P is attracted to and borne on the drum <b>51</b> by the suction airflow generated by the suction device <b>52</b>. As the drum <b>51</b> rotates, the sheet P is conveyed.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The liquid discharge device <b>22</b> includes discharge units <b>23</b> (<b>23</b>A to <b>23</b>F) that discharge liquids. For example, the discharge unit <b>23</b>A discharges a liquid of cyan (C), the discharge unit <b>23</b>B discharges a liquid of magenta (M), the discharge unit <b>23</b>C discharges a liquid of yellow (Y), and the discharge unit <b>23</b>D discharges a liquid of black (K), respectively. Further, the discharge units <b>23</b>E and <b>23</b>F are used to discharge any one of YMCK or special liquid such as white and gold (silver). Further, the liquid discharge device <b>22</b> may further include a discharge unit to discharge a processing liquid such as a surface coating liquid.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The discharge unit <b>23</b> is a full line head and includes multiple liquid discharge heads <b>125</b> arranged in a staggered manner on a base <b>127</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). Each of the multiple liquid discharge heads <b>125</b> includes multiple nozzle arrays <b>126</b> and multiple nozzles arranged in each of the multiple nozzle arrays <b>126</b>, for example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Hereinafter, the &#x201c;liquid discharge head <b>125</b>&#x201d; is simply referred to as a &#x201c;head <b>125</b>&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">A discharge operation of each of the discharge units <b>23</b> of the liquid discharge device <b>22</b> is controlled by drive signals corresponding to print information. When the sheet P borne on the drum <b>51</b> passes through a region facing the liquid discharge device <b>22</b>, the liquid of each color is discharged from the discharge units <b>23</b>, and an image corresponding to the print information is printed on the sheet P.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The drying device <b>30</b> includes a drying mechanism <b>31</b> and a suction conveyance mechanism <b>32</b>. The drying mechanism <b>31</b> dries the liquid adhered on the sheet P by the printing device <b>20</b>. The suction conveyance mechanism <b>32</b> conveys (suctions and conveys) the sheet P while suctioning the sheet P conveyed from the printing device <b>20</b> onto the suction conveyance mechanism <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">After the sheet P conveyed from the printing device <b>20</b> is received by the suction conveyance mechanism <b>32</b>, the sheet P is conveyed to pass through the drying mechanism <b>31</b> and delivered to the ejection device <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">When the sheet P passes through the dying mechanism <b>31</b>, the liquid on the sheet P is subjected to a drying process by the drying mechanism <b>31</b>. Thus, the liquid component such as water in the liquid evaporates. The colorant contained in the liquid is fixed on the sheet P. Thus, curling of the sheet P is reduced.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The ejection device <b>40</b> includes an ejection tray <b>41</b> on which multiple sheets P are stacked. The sheets P conveyed from the drying device <b>30</b> are sequentially stacked and held on the ejection tray <b>41</b> of the ejection device <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The printer <b>1</b> can further include, for example, a pretreatment device disposed upstream from the printing device <b>20</b>, or a post-processing device disposed between the drying device <b>30</b> and the ejection device <b>40</b>. The pretreatment device performs pretreatment on the sheet P. The post-processing device performs post-processing of the sheet P onto which the liquid has been applied.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">For example, the pretreatment device may perform a pretreatment process that applies a treatment liquid onto the sheet P before image is printed on the sheet P. The treatment liquid reacts with the liquid to reduce bleeding of the liquid to the sheet P. However, the content of the pretreatment process is not particularly limited to the process as described above. Further, the post-processing device may perform a sheet reversing process and a binding process to bind the multiple sheets P, for example. The sheet reversing process reverses the sheet P, on which image has been printed by the printing device <b>20</b>, and conveys the reversed sheet P again to the printing device <b>20</b> to print on both sides of the sheet P.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The printing device <b>20</b> according to the first embodiment includes the discharge unit <b>23</b> to discharge a liquid. However, the printing device <b>20</b> according to the first embodiment may perform printing by a method other than the liquid discharge operation such as an electrographic method.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The sheet suction device <b>50</b> according to a first embodiment of the present disclosure is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.
