application is an Utility Application, claiming priority based on European Patent Application No. 21183466.8 filed Jul. 2, 2021.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention lies in the field of horology, and in particular of mechanical horological movements.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">More particularly, the invention relates to an escapement wheel, a tool for manufacturing an escapement wheel and a method for manufacturing an escapement wheel.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Technological Background</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An escapement wheel is well known in the field of horology and is intended to be connected to a mainspring that supplies it with energy in order to maintain the oscillation of a balance via pallets.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">More particularly, the escapement wheel includes teeth distributed around the periphery of a felloe connected to a hub by radial branches. The pallets include pallet-stones intended to cooperate with the teeth of the escapement wheel.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This cooperation generates friction, the intensity of which it has been sought to minimise for many years in order to increase the service life of the escapement wheel and the precision of the measurement of time.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The most routine solutions are the generation of a bevel at the end of each tooth of the escapement wheel in order to reduce the contact surface between said teeth and the gathering-pallets. This arrangement is coupled with the lubrication of the end of said teeth.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Although these solutions are satisfactory, the manufacturing of the escapement poses some difficulties. In particular, the bevel of each tooth is made individually, by specific machining.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition to being relatively slow, this manufacturing method engenders problems of guaranteeing the tight tolerances required by the horological use.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention solves the aforementioned disadvantages by proposing a solution allowing to easily and quickly obtain an escapement wheel, the respect of the dimensional requirements of which is guaranteed.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">For this purpose, the present invention relates to a method for manufacturing an escapement wheel comprising steps of:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0012">making an escapement wheel &#xe9;bauche intended to be driven in rotation about an axis of rotation, and comprising a hub connected to a felloe by radial arms, and teeth regularly distributed around the periphery of the felloe,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0013">simultaneous machining of a reduction of cross-section of the free end of each tooth, by a cutting tool aligned coaxially with the escapement wheel &#xe9;bauche.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0013" num="0014">The terms &#x201c;coaxial&#x201d;

Moreover, the term &#x201c;thickness&#x201d; used in the rest of the text refers to a dimension considered according to a direction parallel to the axis of rotation of the escapement wheel <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0050">As shown in the detailed view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, each of the teeth <b>14</b> includes a reduced end portion <b>140</b> connected to the felloe <b>12</b> by an intermediate portion <b>120</b>.

The notion of &#x201c;impulse plane&#x201d; is known to a person skilled in the art for defining a surface intended to come in contact with a pallet-stone of pallets in order to transmit stresses to it.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0052">Moreover, the reduced end portion <b>140</b> of each of the teeth <b>14</b> includes a surface of revolution <b>142</b> arranged so that all of the surfaces of revolution <b>142</b> of each of the teeth <b>14</b> share the same axis of revolution.
