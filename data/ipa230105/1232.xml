Typically, radiation therapy involves directing a beam of high energy proton, photon, ion, or electron radiation (&#x201c;therapeutic radiation&#x201d;) into a target or target volume (e.g., a tissue volume that includes a tumor, lesion, etc.).</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Typically, before a patient is treated with radiation, a treatment plan specific to that patient is developed. The plan usually defines various aspects of the therapy using simulations and optimizations based on past experiences. In general, the purpose of the treatment plan is to deliver sufficient radiation to the unhealthy tissue while minimizing exposure of surrounding healthy tissue to the radiation.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Usually, the planner's goal is to find a solution that is optimal with respect to multiple clinical goals. The clinical goals may be contradictory in the sense that an improvement toward one goal may have a detrimental effect on reaching another goal. For example, a treatment plan that spares the liver from receiving a dose of radiation may result in the stomach receiving too much radiation. These types of tradeoffs often lead to an iterative process in which the planner creates different plans to find the plan that is best suited to achieving the desired outcome.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recent radiobiology approaches have demonstrated a desirable effectiveness of delivering an entire, relatively high therapeutic radiation dose to a target within a single short period of time. For example, a target can be treated with multiple radiation beams, with each beam delivering at least 40 Grays in less than or equal to one second (e.g., 40 Gy/s, etc.), and may deliver much more (e.g., 50 Gy, 100 Gy, etc.) in less than one second. This type of treatment is referred to generally herein as FLASH radiation therapy (FLASH RT).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Evidence to date suggests that FLASH RT is effective at treating target tissue, while advantageously sparing normal healthy tissue from damage. The effectiveness of FLASH is highly tied to the new dose rate scheme of exposing tissue to a high radiation dose for only a very short period of time, and thus introduces important dose and dose rate constraints and issues that are not typically considered in or achieved with conventional radiation treatment planning.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Presented systems and methods enable efficient and effective radiation treatment planning and treatment for high radiation rate approaches, including considering and adjusting for various uncertainties. In one embodiment, a computer system, comprises a processor and a memory configured to perform radiation treatment methods (e.g., a treatment plan uncertainty adjustment method, etc.). The memory is coupled to the processor and includes instructions that, when executed, cause the processor to perform the method. In one embodiment the method comprises accessing information associated with a treatment plan, accessing information corresponding to an uncertainty associated with implementation of the radiation treatment plan, and performing an optimization process including generating a graphical element, wherein the graphical element conveys results of the optimization process including an impact of the uncertainty. The graphical element can be a histogram. The histogram can be a dose rate volume histogram with a volume indication on a first axis and a dose rate indication on a second axis.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is appreciated there can be different types of uncertainties. The uncertainty can be associated with a radiation system performance tolerance. The uncertainty can be associated with a patient set up. The uncertainty can include a tolerance variance associated with a parameter that impacts a dose rate. The method can also include finalizing the radiation treatment plan, including evaluating information associated with the graphical element and analyzing robustness of the treatment plan against uncertainties.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment, a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium has computer-executable instructions for causing a computer system to perform a method comprising: ascertaining treatment plan information and corresponding uncertainty information associated with a target volume, generating a histogram of a plurality of uncertainty adjusted optimized dose rates for the target volume and organs at risk in accordance with the treatment plan information and corresponding uncertainty information, and evaluating the histogram results. The histogram can be utilized to test a degree of robustness of a treatment plan (e.g., including allowance for uncertainty scenarios, etc.). Generating a histogram can include generating a plurality of graphs, wherein respective ones of the plurality of graphs correspond to respective ones of a plurality of uncertainties. The plurality of uncertainties can be the basis for the plurality of uncertainty adjusted optimized dose rates.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The plurality of graphs can correspond to a dose rate band which defines a region in which a graph curve for an actual treatment lies. In one exemplary implementation, a proportion of irradiated volume receiving a threshold dose rate Dth and the dose rate received by (100&#x2212;p) percent of the volume is displayed for uncertainty scenarios associated with the histogram. The uncertainty information can be associated with at least one of radiation system performance tolerances, position of a treatment target, a beam intensity scenario, a range uncertainty, different transmission tables, and spot times (e.g., pencil beam scanning in particle therapy). The histogram can be included in graphical user interface (GUI). Evaluating the histogram results can include analyzing if a dose rate prescription is met for the target and healthy tissue.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, a radiation system comprises an accelerator and a control component. The accelerator is configured to generate radiation and direct the radiation towards a treatment target. The control component is configured to control the accelerator in accordance with a treatment plan, wherein the treatment plan is generated in accordance with a radiation treatment planning method including uncertainty scenario analysis. In one exemplary implementation, the radiation treatment planning method comprises ascertaining treatment plan and uncertainty scenario information, determining a dose rate distribution based upon the uncertainty scenario information, and generating a histogram visualization of the dose rate distribution based upon the uncertainty scenario information. The radiation treatment planning method can include displaying a dose rate volume histogram and parameters are shown for regions of interest.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts that are further described below in the detailed description that follows.

In some radiation therapy techniques the intensity of the particle beam is either constant or modulated across a field of delivery (e.g., intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), intensity modulated particle therapy (IMPT), etc.) and beam intensity is varied across treatment regions (e.g., target volumes, etc.) in a patient. Depending on the treatment modality, the degrees of freedom available for intensity modulation can include beam shaping (e.g., via collimation, etc.), beam weighting (e.g., via spot scanning, etc.), and angle of incidence (which may be referred to as beam geometry). These degrees of freedom can lead to an effectively infinite number of potential treatment plans, and therefore consistently and efficiently generating and evaluating high-quality treatment plans is beyond the capability of a human. Effective development of practical treatment plans relies on the use of a various systems (e.g., computer systems, radiation systems, specialized systems, etc.), particularly considering the time constraints associated with the use of radiation therapy to treat ailments like cancer, as well as the large number of patients that are undergoing or need to undergo radiation therapy during any given time period.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Presented systems and methods can enable efficient and effective radiation treatment planning and treatment for high radiation rate approaches (e.g., FLASH RT, etc.). In one embodiment, a dose rate-volume histogram (different from a dose-volume histogram) is generated for a target volume. The dose rate-volume histogram indicates dose rates and percentages of the target volume that receive the dose rates. The dose rate-volume histogram can be stored in computer system memory and used to generate a radiation treatment plan. Values of parameters that can have an effect on a dose rate can be adjusted until the dose rate-volume histogram satisfies objectives associated with the radiation treatment plan.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">It is appreciated there can be various different parameters that can have an effect on a dose rate. In one embodiment, the parameters can include a number of irradiations of the target volume, a duration of each of the irradiations, and a dose deposited in each of the irradiations. The parameters can include directions of beams to be directed into the target volume, and beam energies for each of the beams. The parameters can also include a period of time during which the irradiations are applied (e.g., the irradiations are intermittently applied over a period of time, such as an hour, etc.), and an interval of time between each of the periods of irradiations (e.g., each hour-long period is separated by a day, etc.).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In one embodiment, an irradiation time-volume histogram (also different from a dose-volume histogram) is generated for the target volume. The irradiation time-volume histogram indicates irradiation times (durations) and percentages of the target volume that are irradiated for those amounts of time. The irradiation time-volume histogram can be stored in computer system memory and used in the generation of a radiation treatment plan. Values of parameters that can have an effect on irradiation time can be adjusted until the irradiation time-volume histogram satisfies objectives associated with the radiation treatment plan.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Various combinations of histograms, (e.g., a dose rate-volume histogram, an irradiation time-volume histogram, both, etc.) can be generated, evaluated, and used to generate a radiation treatment plan.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">It is appreciated that different uncertainty scenarios (e.g., associated with tolerances in patient positioning, machine performance, etc.) can arise during treatment. In one embodiment, consideration of different uncertainty scenarios and adjustments based on the results can be implemented. In one exemplary implementation, dose volume histograms (DVHs) and dose rate volume histograms (DRVHs) relating doses and dose rates, respectively, to tissue volumes are calculated, displayed and visualized for different uncertainty scenarios. Additional description of different uncertainty scenarios and impacts on various aspects (e.g., doses, DVHs, DRVHs, etc.) of radiation planning and treatment are set forth below in later paragraphs of this detailed description.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one embodiment, a graphical user interface (GUI) that includes a representation of a target volume and sub-volumes of the target volume is rendered and displayed. Information that includes a dose rate received by each sub-volume is accessed (e.g., information stored in a computer system memory, etc.). In one exemplary implementation, a value of an attribute is associated with each sub-volume, where the value corresponds to an amount of the dose rate received by that sub-volume. Each sub-volume can then be rendered according to that value. The rendering of the target volume can be a two-dimensional cross-section of the target volume or a virtual three-dimensional representation of the target volume.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In one embodiment, the GUI can include a dose rate-volume histogram. The GUI can include an irradiation time-volume histogram for the target volume.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Presented systems and methods can improve radiation treatment planning and the treatment itself by expanding treatment (e.g., FLASH RT, etc.) to a wider variety of treatment platforms and target sites (e.g., tumors, etc.). Treatment plans generated as described herein are superior for sparing healthy tissue from radiation in comparison to conventional techniques for FLASH dose rates by optimizing the balance between the dose rate delivered to unhealthy tissue (e.g., a tumor, etc.) in a target volume and the dose rate delivered to surrounding healthy tissue. When used with FLASH dose rates, management of patient motion can be simplified because the doses are applied in a short period of time (e.g., less than a second). Treatment planning, while still a complex task, is improved relative to conventional treatment planning. In addition to these benefits, presented GUI capabilities facilitate treatment planning by allowing a planner to readily visualize key elements of a proposed treatment plan (e.g., the dose rate per sub-volume, etc.), to readily visualize the effects on those elements of changes to the proposed plan, to readily visualize impacts of treatment uncertainty scenarios, and to readily visualize a comparison between different plans.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of an exemplary computer system <b>100</b> in accordance with one embodiment.

In one embodiment, depending on the type of beam, the beam system <b>404</b> includes components that direct (e.g., bend, steer, or guide) the beam system in a direction toward and into a nozzle <b>406</b>. The radiation therapy system can include a multileaf collimator (MLCs); each MLC leaf can be independently moved back-and-forth by the control system <b>410</b> to dynamically shape an aperture through which the beam can pass, to block or not block portions of the beam and thereby control beam shape and exposure time.

In one embodiment, the control system <b>410</b> includes a computer system having a processor, memory, an input device (e.g., a keyboard), and perhaps a display in well-known fashion. The control system <b>410</b> can receive data regarding operation of the system <b>400</b>.

Thus, the nozzle <b>406</b> can include a component that affects (e.g., decrease, modulate) the energy of the beam. The term &#x201c;beam energy adjuster&#x201d; is used herein as a general term for a component or components that affect the energy of the beam, in order to control the range of the beam (e.g., the extent that the beam penetrates into a target), to control the dose delivered by the beam, and to control the depth dose curve of the beam, depending on the type of beam. For example, for a proton beam or an ion beam that has a Bragg peak, the beam energy adjuster can control the location of the Bragg peak in the target volume.

A maximum energy (e.g., 80 MeV) is specified for the beam <b>502</b>, and an energy level is defined for each of the beam segments as a percentage or fraction of the maximum energy. In essence, each of the beam segments is weighted in terms of its energy level; some beam segments are weighted to have a higher energy level than other beam segments.

The proposed radiation treatment plan includes values of parameters that can affect dose rate, as well as other parameters. The parameters that can affect dose rate include a number of irradiations of the target volume, a duration of each of the irradiations (irradiation times), and a dose deposited in each of the irradiations. The parameters can include directions of beams to be directed into the target volume, and beam energies for each of the beams. The parameters can also include a period of time during which the irradiations are applied (e.g., a number of irradiations are applied over a period of time such as an hour, with each irradiation in the period of time separated from the next by another period of time) and an interval of time between each period of irradiations (e.g., each hour-long period is separated from the next by a day). If the target volume is divided into sub-volumes or voxels, then the values of the parameters can be on a per-sub-volume or per-voxel basis (e.g., a value per sub-volume or voxel).</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Appropriate dose threshold curve(s) (e.g., normal tissue sparing dose versus dose rate or irradiation time) can be utilized in the optimization model <b>150</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) to establish dose limits for radiation treatment planning. For example, the appropriate (e.g., tissue-dependent) dose threshold curve can be used to determine beam directions (gantry angles) and beam segment weights (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>). That is, parameters that affect dose can be adjusted during radiation treatment planning so that the limits in the dose threshold curve are satisfied.

A dose rate can be determined per sub-volume or voxel. The average dose rate is the dose deposited in each irradiation divided by the sum of the durations of the irradiation, times the number of irradiations (e.g., number of fractions). The dose rate can be determined and recorded using a fine time index (e.g., time increments on the order of a millisecond); that is, for example, the dose to each sub-volume or voxel can be recorded for time increments on the order of per-millisecond per beam and per fraction. The dose rate per sub-volume or voxel can be calculated to include ray tracing (and Monte Carlo-like simulations), where each beam particle is tracked to determine the primary, secondary, etc., scatters for each particle to get a realistic voxel-based or sub-volume-based dose rate over the course of each irradiation.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In an embodiment, an irradiation time-volume histogram is generated. An irradiation time-volume histogram can be generated essentially in the same manner as that just described for generating a dose rate-volume histogram.

The clinical goals or objectives may be expressed in terms of a set of quality metrics, such as target homogeneity, critical organ sparing, and the like, with respective target values for the metrics. Another way to evaluate the dose rate-volume histogram and the irradiation time-volume histogram is a knowledge-based approach that incorporates and reflects present best practices gathered from multiple previous, similar treatments of other patients. Yet another way to assist the planner is to use a multi-criteria optimization (MCO) approach for treatment planning. Pareto surface navigation is an MCO technique that facilitates exploration of the tradeoffs between clinical goals. For a given set of clinical goals, a treatment plan is considered to be Pareto optimal if it satisfies the goals and none of the metrics can be improved without worsening at least one of the other metrics.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">As mentioned above, for FLASH RT, dose rates of at least 40 Gy in less than or equal to one second (e.g., 40 Gy/s, etc.), and as much as 20 Gy to 50 Gy or 100 Gy or more in less than or equal to one second, may be used. Thus, another way to evaluate a dose rate-volume histogram is to define a dose rate threshold value (e.g., a minimum dose rate) based on the FLASH RT dose rates, and to also specify a target volume percentage threshold value for dose rate. A dose rate-volume histogram can be evaluated by determining whether the percentage of the target volume that receives a dose rate above the dose rate threshold value satisfies the percentage threshold value.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Another way to evaluate an irradiation time-volume histogram is to define an irradiation time threshold value or values (e.g., a maximum limit on irradiation time for each sub-volume or voxel inside the target volume and a maximum limit on irradiation time for each sub-volume or voxel outside the target volume), and to also specify a target volume percentage threshold value or values for irradiation time inside and outside the target volume. An irradiation time-volume histogram can be evaluated by determining whether the percentage of the tissue inside the target volume that is irradiated for less than the corresponding irradiation time threshold value satisfies the corresponding percentage threshold value, and by similarly determining whether the percentage of the tissue outside the target volume that is irradiated for less than the corresponding irradiation time threshold value satisfies the corresponding percentage threshold value.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In block <b>810</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, some or all of the parameter values for the proposed radiation treatment plan can be iteratively adjusted to generate different dose rate-volume histograms and the irradiation time-volume histograms, to determine a final set of parameter values that produce a histogram (or histograms) that results in a prescribed (final) radiation treatment plan that best satisfies the objectives (clinical goals) for treatment of the patient or that satisfies the threshold values described above.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In block <b>812</b>, the final set of parameter values is then included in the prescribed radiation treatment plan used to treat the patient.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Generally speaking, embodiments according to the invention optimize a radiation treatment plan based on dose rate and irradiation time.

However, there are various uncertainties that can affect the actual dose rate finally experienced by an irradiated volume during treatment plan delivery. The uncertainty can be associated with potential variations associated with tolerances (e.g., radiation system/machine performance tolerance, patient characteristic tolerances, etc.) and set up issues (e.g., variation in initial system/machine set up, variation patient setup/position, etc.). The uncertainties can affect the actual dose rate finally experienced by an irradiated volume during treatment plan delivery. Radiation system performance tolerances can correspond to accelerator or machine-specific operations (e. g., beam current fluctuations, spot size variations, etc.). Uncertainties can also relate to other tolerance variations (e.g., changes in patient characteristics, weight, etc.). Setup variations or errors (e.g., patient location/orientation, initial machine settings/calibration, etc.) can also typically impact or influence the dose rate distribution. In one embodiment, individual tolerances (based on uncertainties/variations) of parameters impacting the dose rate are currently not considered for radiation treatment planning. Thus, in one exemplary implementation radiation treatment plans generated to meet a prescribed dose rate (beside other treatment plan prescription parameters) can typically achieve a planned dose rate within a dedicated tolerance during actual treatment delivery only. Dose rate conformity analysis as part of treatment plan quality evaluation can be essential for radiation treatment plans that include dose rate prescriptions. However, calculation, display, and visualization of dose rate distributions for a given set of uncertainty scenarios is not previously typically available in commercial radiation treatment planning.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0126">In one embodiment, similar to dose volume histograms in radiotherapy described above, a histogram relating dose rate to tissue volume is calculated, displayed and visualized for different uncertainty scenarios, arising from tolerances in patient positioning and machine performance. For each uncertainty scenario, users (e.g., physicians, clinicians, technicians, etc.) can assess the proportion of irradiated volume (in absolute or relative numbers) receiving a user-selectable dose rate. Depending on the likelihoods of the analyzed uncertainty scenarios a decision can be made regarding the acceptability/robustness of treatment plan prescription parameters (e.g., dose, dose rate, etc.).</p><p id="p-0129" num="0127">In one embodiment, an uncertainty parameter can be associated with a set of uncertainty scenarios and a plurality of DRVH graph curves can be generated in a histogram. In one exemplary implementation, a different one of the plurality of DRVH graph curves is created for respective ones of the multiple different uncertainty parameter values. The plurality of DRVH graph curves can form a DRVH band. In one embodiment, a combination of multiple different uncertainty parameters are associated with a set of multiple different uncertainty scenarios. Respective ones of the multiple different uncertainty parameters can be associated with a set of uncertainty scenarios. In one exemplary embodiment, histogram generation conditions can include multiple different scenarios, each scenario giving exponential rise to multiple different types of uncertainty parameters, with each type of uncertainty parameter giving rise exponentially to multiple different uncertainty parameter values. These conditions result in potential involvement of an immense number of different considerations/factors/values in the generation of histogram information. Thus, in addition to the numerous parameter and degrees of freedom in radiation beam generation (e.g., beam intensity, energy, angle of incidence, etc.) and different types of histograms (e.g., DRVH, etc.) previously described, inclusion of the numerous different possible uncertainty scenarios and values for a respective histogram further complicate and place consistent and effective generation of high-quality treatment plans further beyond the capability of a human as a practical matter without the aid of systems and methods presented herein.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0128"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a graphical representation of an exemplary dose rate volume histogram <b>1400</b> in accordance with one embodiment.

The DRVH graph curves are shown in dotted/dashed lines (e.g., <b>1411</b>, <b>1412</b>, <b>1419</b>, etc.) corresponding to different uncertainty scenarios. In one embodiment, the solid line (e.g., <b>1412</b>, etc.) indicates/highlights a selection of one of the dotted/dashed lines or rather one of the uncertainty scenarios. In one exemplary implementation, solid line <b>1412</b> was originally a dotted/dashed line (e.g., similar to dashes line <b>1411</b>, etc.), but when selected became a solid line as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>. If the uncertainty scenarios associated with graph curve <b>1413</b> is selected as active or one or interest, then graph curve line <b>1413</b> would change from dotted/dashed to solid and graph line <b>1412</b> would change from solid to dotted/dashed. In one exemplary implementation, a nominal DRVH curve is shown as a solid curve line. Collectively the dotted line curves and solid line curve can form a DRVH band (e.g., <b>1420</b>, etc.). In one embodiment, such a DRVH band defines the region in which a graph curve for an actual treatment delivery would have a high probability of &#x201c;lying&#x201d; or being included in. If the band width is too large and a prescription parameter (e.g., the dose, the dose rate, etc.) does not fulfill or comply with the prescription, replanning might become necessary.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0129">In one embodiment, a planning or prescription parameter (e.g., dose, dose rate, etc.) distribution calculated based on a radiation system or machine specific parameters by a treatment planning system represents only an estimate. In one exemplary implementation, the estimated prescription parameter distribution depends on a particular instance grabbed snapshot of radiation system or machine performance characteristics used as base data for a treatment planning machine. An actual prescription parameter distribution for other instances can deviate more or less depending on the tolerances for system/machine performance and patient setup errors. By neglecting such influencing factors, a prescribed parameter value might not be achieved during actual treatment delivery. Plan robustness with regard to prescribed parameters can be crucial, particularly in cases that have a radiation dose rate prescription (e.g., FLASH irradiations, etc.). With the help of histograms (e.g., DRH, DRVHs, etc.), the degree of robustness against different levels of uncertainties can be tested. In one exemplary implementation, if a plan is not sufficiently robust against uncertainty scenarios, the plan can be modified during treatment planning (e.g., before beginning actual treatment delivery, etc.).</p><p id="p-0132" num="0130">In one embodiment, the prescription parameter robustness evaluation is an integrated tool in the treatment planning system.

In one embodiment, a patient positioning uncertainty in the X, Y, and Z directions is created resulting in six different scenarios (e.g., six different positions of the patient, etc.).

In one exemplary implementation, the proportion of irradiated volume (in absolute or relative numbers) receiving a threshold dose rate Dth and the dose rate received by (100&#x2212;p) percent of the volume is displayed for uncertainty scenarios. The D<sub>th </sub>and p are variables that can be defined by the user. The histogram and DRVH parameters can be displayed for regions of interest (ROIs) selected by the user. The DRVH parameters and regions of interest can be similar to the DVH functionality set forth above, as well as other existing DVH functionality. In one embodiment, it is possible to define ROIs based on isodose levels to evaluate for example high dose regions. Thus, a user (e.g., physician, nurse, clinician, technician, etc.) can check whether prescribed parameter values are met for healthy tissue and relevant tissue/organs at risk (e.g., the target, tumor, etc.), respectively.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0137">It is appreciated the potential results associated with various uncertainties can also be depicted in various types of histograms (e.g., a dose volume histogram (DVH), dose rate volume histogram (DVRH), etc.). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a graphical representation of an objective definition input interface <b>1600</b> in accordance with one embodiment.

Thus, a DVH for multiple scenarios is typically represented by a band of DVH curve graph lines.

In one embodiment, a system and method can allow more efficient and effective treatment plans to be generated quickly. Also, a system and method incorporating uncertainty in radiation treatment can help improve the functioning of computers because, for example, by reducing the complexity of generating treatment plans, fewer computational resources are needed and consumed, meaning also that computer resources are freed up to perform other tasks. The improvement can include expanding FLASH RT to a wider variety of treatment platforms and target sites. Treatment plans generated as described herein are superior for sparing normal tissue from radiation in comparison to conventional techniques even for non-FLASH dose rates by reducing, if not minimizing, the magnitude (and the integral in some cases) of the dose to normal tissue (outside the target) by design. When used with FLASH dose rates, management of patient motion is simplified because the doses are applied in a short period of time (e.g., less than a second). Treatment planning, while still a complex task of finding a balance between competing and related parameters, is simplified relative to conventional planning. The techniques described herein may be useful for stereotactic radiosurgery as well as stereotactic body radiotherapy with single or multiple metastases.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0158">Although the subject matter has been described in language specific to structural features and methodological acts, it is to be understood that the subject matter defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or acts described above.
