More specifically, the disclosure relates to methods of forming microelectronic devices comprising at least two microelectronic device structures, and to related microelectronic devices and electronic systems.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Microelectronic device designers often desire to increase the level of integration or density of features within a microelectronic device by reducing the dimensions of the individual features and by reducing the separation distance between neighboring features. In addition, microelectronic device designers often desire to design architectures that are not only compact, but offer performance advantages, as well as simplified designs.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One example of a microelectronic device is a memory device. Memory devices are generally provided as internal integrated circuits in computers or other electronic devices. There are many types of memory devices including, but not limited to, volatile memory devices, such as dynamic random access memory (DRAM) devices; and non-volatile memory devices such as NAND Flash memory devices. A typical memory cell of a DRAM device includes one access device, such as a transistor, and one memory storage structure, such as a capacitor, Modern applications for semiconductor devices can employ significant quantities of memory cells, arranged in memory arrays exhibiting rows and columns of the memory cells. The memory cells may be electrically accessed through digit lines (e.g., bit lines, data lines) and word lines access lines) arranged along the rows and columns of the memory cells of the memory arrays. Memory arrays can be two-dimensional (2D) so as to exhibit a single deck (e.g., a single tier, a single level) of the memory cells, or can be three-dimensional (3D) so as to exhibit multiple decks (e.g., multiple levels, multiple tiers) of the memory cells.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Control logic devices within a base control logic structure underlying a memory array of a memory device have been used to control operations (e.g., access operations, read operations, write operations) of the memory cells of the memory device. However, as the number of memory cells in a memory device increase, the quantities, dimensions and arrangements of the different control logic devices employed within the base control logic structure can also impede reductions to the size (e.g., horizontal footprint) of the memory device, and/or improvements in the performance (e.g., faster memory cell ON/OFF speed, lower threshold switching voltage requirements, faster data transfer rates, lower power consumption) of the memory device. Furthermore, as the density and complexity of the memory array have increased, so has the complexity of the control logic devices. In some instances, the control logic devices consume more real estate than the memory devices, reducing the memory density of the memory device.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F</figref> are simplified partial cross-sectional views (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F</figref>) and a partial top-down view (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) illustrating a method of forming a microelectronic device, in accordance with embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> are simplified partial cross-sectional views illustrating a method of forming a microelectronic device, in accordance with additional embodiments of the disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic block diagram of an electronic system, in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The illustrations included herewith are not meant to be actual views of any particular systems, microelectronic structures, microelectronic devices, or integrated circuits thereof, but are merely idealized representations that are employed to describe embodiments herein.
