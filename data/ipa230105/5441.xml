Most of the liquid crystal displays currently available on the market are backlight liquid crystal displays, which include a liquid crystal panel and a backlight module. The working principle of the liquid crystal panel is to place liquid crystal molecules in two parallel glass substrates, and apply driving voltages on the two glass substrates to control the rotation direction of the liquid crystal molecules to refract the light of the backlight module to generate a picture.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Organic Light-Emitting Diode (OLED) is an advanced technique of current flat-panel display, and has become an important research direction in modern IT and video products. The main driving principle of the OLED is: a system mainboard connects an R/G/B compression signal, a control signal and a power supply to a connector on a PCB board through a wire. Data is processed by a Timing Controller (TCON) IC on the PCB board, passes through the PCB board, and is connected to a display region through a Source-Chip on Film (S-COF) and a Gate-Chip on Film (G-COF), so that the screen display obtains the required power and signals.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, the OLED is correspondingly improved, for example, techniques such as a display driving architecture for the OLED are a research method that is highly sought by those skilled in the art.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of the drawbacks of the foregoing exemplary technique, the present application provides a driving circuit, a driving method, and a display panel that are beneficial to save scan lines and/or data lines.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">To achieve the foregoing objective, the present application provides a driving circuit, including:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">a plurality of pixels, each pixel including a first sub-pixel and a second sub-pixel;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">a scan line connected to gate terminals of the first sub-pixel and second sub-pixel;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">a data line connected to source terminals of the first sub-pixel and second sub-pixel; and</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">a switching circuit configured to switch connection relations of the scan line, the data line, the first sub-pixel and the second sub-pixel so that one or both of the first sub-pixel and the second sub-pixel communicate with the scan line and the data line.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The first sub-pixel and the second sub-pixel are connected to the same scan line and the same data line.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the driving circuit of the present application, the first sub-pixel and the second sub-pixel are respectively connected to the same scan line and the same data line, and a switching circuit is provided to switch the conduction relations of the first sub-pixel and the second sub-pixel to the scan line and the data line. In this way, during operation, the driving circuit can control that one of the sub-pixels is connected to the scan line and the data line, and the other sub-pixel is not connected, or the two sub-pixels are connected to the scan line and the data line. In this way, the first sub-pixel and the second sub-pixel are controlled to operate respectively through a scan line and a data line, thereby saving the use of the scan line and the data line. Moreover, if necessary, one of the first sub-pixel and the second sub-pixel is disconnected to the scan line and the data line, and thus, the problem of &#x201c;burn-in&#x201d; caused by displaying the same image with the first sub-pixel and the second sub-pixel for a long time can be reduced, thereby prolonging the service life of the display panel.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The drawings are included to provide understanding of embodiments of the present application, which constitute a part of the specification and illustrate the embodiments of the present application, and describe the principles of the present application together with the text description.
