Orthodontic treatment may be classified into a method of using an orthodontic appliance made of metal brackets, a transparent orthodontic method of correction by mounting a transparent straightening aligner made of transparent materials on the teeth and the like.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Since the transparent orthodontic method is a method in which a transparent straightening aligner made of transparent materials is covered over the teeth like a mouthpiece, the straightening aligner is not visible from the outside, and since it is possible to attach or detach the straightening aligner, it has an advantage in which it is easy to manage the teeth during orthodontic treatment. For this reason, the transparent orthodontic method has been widely used in recent years.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Transparent orthodontics is performed by generating orthodontic alignment information divided into multiple orthodontic steps that are reached sequentially by correcting a patient's current tooth alignment information, and then making transparent straightening aligners corresponding to orthodontic alignment information for each orthodontic step to make the patient wear the transparent straightening aligners corresponding to each orthodontic step.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When operating a digital computer program for setting multiple orthodontic steps, a plurality of moving step data (set up data) are required. In one orthodontic step, when each tooth is moved by 1 mm, the orthodontic force applied to the corresponding tooth is 150 gw (gram weight). The optimal orthodontic force suggested by dental orthodontics is about 150 gw, and when multiple teeth are moved at the same time by 1 mm in one orthodontic step, the total sum of orthodontic forces applied to the multiple teeth exceeds 150 gw.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">If, in one orthodontic step, the total orthodontic force, which is the sum of orthodontic forces applied to individual teeth, exceeds 500 to 700 gw, pain, tooth damage and the like may be induced. However, when designing transparent straightening aligners in the transparent orthodontic method, no technology has been introduced that takes into account the total sum of orthodontic forces applied to the patient's teeth in one orthodontic step.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention is to solve the aforementioned problems of the prior

corresponding orthodontic step is more than the preset total sum of orthodontic forces, the orthodontic force or movement distance for the patient's individual teeth is reduced by a predetermined

In setting multiple orthodontic steps that are reached sequentially, the method for designing straightening aligners according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention sets the multiple orthodontic steps such that the total sum of orthodontic forces applied to the patient's teeth per one orthodontic step is equal to or less than a preset total sum of orthodontic forces. Therefore, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, it is possible to prevent side effects, such as pain, tooth damage and the like, from occurring during the transparent orthodontic process.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the method for designing straightening aligners according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention is performed by including the following steps.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">First, generating current alignment information S<b>10</b> is performed, which indicates the patient's current tooth alignment state. The current alignment information may be created by utilizing an X-ray image of the patient's teeth, front and side images of the patient, orthodontic instructions written by the attending dentist, an impression of the patient's teeth, the patient's <b>3</b>D-scanned current tooth data and the like.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of current alignment information in the method for designing straightening aligners according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the current alignment information may present an arrangement of the patient's current teeth and a center of rotation (CR) of each tooth.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Meanwhile, the patient's teeth may be divided into upper and lower jaws to identify a current alignment state. Accordingly, the current alignment information may include those relating to the upper jaw and the lower jaw.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Next, generating orthodontic alignment information S<b>30</b> is performed by multiple orthodontic steps which are sequentially reached by correcting the current alignment information. In generating orthodontic alignment information S<b>30</b>, the multiple orthodontic steps may be set such that the total sum of orthodontic forces applied to the patient's teeth per one orthodontic step to reach the tooth alignment state corresponding to the orthodontic alignment information of each orthodontic step is less than or equal to a preset total sum of orthodontic forces.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In this case, the total sum of the orthodontic forces may be calculated by summing the orthodontic forces applied to the patient's individual teeth in one orthodontic step. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the preset total sum of orthodontic forces may be selected from 500 to 700 gw (gram weight). For example, the preset total sum of orthodontic forces may be 500 gw.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The orthodontic force suggested as appropriate in orthodontics is 150 gw, and it is known that pain, tooth damage and the like are induced when the total sum of orthodontic forces, which is the sum of orthodontic forces applied to individual teeth, is more than 500 to 700 gw. The method for designing straightening aligners according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention limits the preset total sum of orthodontic forces not to exceed a certain level based on these orthodontic facts.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the multiple orthodontic steps, teeth to be corrected among the patient's teeth are moved or rotated. That is, the multiple orthodontic steps may be divided based on an arbitrary point in the process of moving or rotating the patient's teeth. In addition, the orthodontic alignment information of each orthodontic step may be obtained by moving or rotating the orthodontic target tooth that needs to be corrected in the current alignment information or the orthodontic alignment information of the previous step.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Meanwhile, in generating the orthodontic alignment information S<b>30</b>, the multiple orthodontic steps may be set such that the orthodontic force or movement distance per the patient's individual teeth per one orthodontic step is set to be a preset individual orthodontic forces or a preset individual movement distance. When the total sum of orthodontic forces applied to the patient's teeth in the corresponding orthodontic step is more than a preset total sum of orthodontic forces, the orthodontic force or movement distance per the patient's individual teeth may be reduced by a predetermined ratio.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">For example, in one orthodontic step, individual teeth to be corrected may be set to move by 1 mm. In this case, the orthodontic force applied to the corresponding tooth when the tooth is moved by 1 mm may be calculated as 150 gw. When there are many teeth to be corrected and the total sum of the orthodontic forces exceeds 500 gw, one orthodontic step may be set by reducing the movement distance per individual tooth. If the total sum of orthodontic forces is expected to be 600 gw, it is possible to reduce the movement distance of each tooth by 20% such that the total sum does not exceed 500 gw. Accordingly, the total number of orthodontic steps may be increased.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Meanwhile, in generating the orthodontic alignment information S<b>30</b>, the multiple orthodontic steps may be set such that the total sum of orthodontic forces applied to the patient's teeth per one orthodontic step is less than or equal to the preset total sum of orthodontic forces, and the orthodontic force applied to the patient's individual teeth is also less than or equal to a preset individual orthodontic forces</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">For example, the preset individual orthodontic forces may be selected from 100 to 200 gw.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Meanwhile, in generating the orthodontic alignment information S<b>30</b>, the multiple orthodontic steps may be set such that the total sum of orthodontic forces applied to the patient's teeth per one orthodontic step is less than or equal to the preset total sum of orthodontic forces, and the movement distance of the patient's individual teeth is also less than or equal to a preset individual movement distance.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In addition, the preset individual movement distance may be selected from 0.5 to 1.5 mm.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The method for designing straightening aligners according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention may be performed by a computer device. For example, the method for designing straightening aligners according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention may be performed automatically by a computer device.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">When the method for designing straightening aligners according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention is performed by a computer device, the number of steps to divide the multiple orthodontic steps into may be automatically set by software. In addition, the preset total sum of orthodontic forces may be corrected in the control panel (commander board) of the computer device.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of orthodontic alignment information corresponding to the last orthodontic step among multiple orthodontic steps in the method for designing straightening aligners according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of orthodontic alignment information corresponding to an orthodontic step in which the space between teeth to be corrected is secured at maximum among multiple orthodontic steps in the method for designing straightening aligners according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in the last orthodontic step among the multiple orthodontic steps, the teeth may be positioned to form a final align arch (1<sup>st </sup>Align Arch). Herein, the final orthodontic step means a state in which the correction is completed when cutting of the teeth is not required, and when additional cutting of the teeth is required after alignment, it refers to a state in which the teeth are aligned just before cutting. Meanwhile, the orthodontic alignment information corresponding to the last orthodontic step may present a contact point (CP) between the patient's teeth.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In order for the teeth to form a final align arch (Is Align Arch) and to be aligned through the multiple orthodontic steps, a space for moving and rotating the teeth to be corrected during the orthodontic process is required. In other words, the multiple orthodontic steps include a process of expanding the teeth to be corrected such that a space for moving and rotating the teeth to be corrected is secured in the current tooth alignment state, and a process of retracting the teeth to be corrected to form a final align arch (1<sup>st </sup>Align Arch) to be arranged after expansion</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Therefore, in an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the multiple orthodontic steps include an orthodontic step in which the space between the teeth to be corrected is secured at maximum. In other words, the first part of the multiple orthodontic steps may correspond to a process of forming an interim align arch, and the second half of the multiple orthodontic steps may correspond to a process of moving the teeth forming the interim align arch to form a final align arch (1st Align Arch).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of orthodontic alignment information corresponding to an orthodontic step in which the space between teeth to be corrected is secured at maximum among multiple orthodontic steps in the method for designing straightening aligners according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in the orthodontic step in which the space S between the teeth to be corrected is secured at maximum, the patient's teeth are arranged to form an interim align arch.
