Specifically, a line image of the working unit is created in a position corresponding to the working unit in a photographed video of a camera provided in the working machine. The line image is wirelessly transmitted and displayed on the monitor to be superimposed on the photographed video of the camera. Accordingly, a line image with a small time lag due to the transmission is used. The working unit is displayed in a position close to an actual position. Consequently, even if an image delay occurs in the display of the monitor, an operator can perform operation of the working unit while complementing the image delay of the monitor based on the line image displayed on the monitor.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0003">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent No. 5919022</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, since means for creating a line image is mounted on the working machine, when a failure occurs in the transmission of the line image, it is likely that the line image superimposed on the photographed video of the camera temporarily disappears or deviation of the position of the line image with respect to the actual position of the working unit increases.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a remote operation device and a remote operation system that can reduce or eliminate deviation of the position of an indicator image of a working unit such as a line image in an image with respect to the position of the working unit in a real space.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A remote operation device of the present invention is a remote operation device for remotely operating a working machine including a working mechanism, the remote operation device including:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">remote wireless communication equipment having a communication function with real machine wireless communication equipment mounted on the working machine;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">a remote image output device;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">a remote operation mechanism;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">a remote control element that recognizes an operation form of the remote operation mechanism by an operator and causes the remote wireless communication equipment to transmit a command signal corresponding to the operation form to the real machine wireless communication equipment;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">a first output control element that causes the remote image output device to output a work environment image including a working unit of the working mechanism acquired through an imaging device mounted on the working machine, transmitted from the real machine wireless communication equipment, and received by the remote wireless communication equipment;
