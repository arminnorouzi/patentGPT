These tools and machines may be used to create designs for personalizing books and journals, such as may be desired to memorialize events and memories. Scrap booking software may be used to create designs for cutting on the mechanical cutting tools. Generally, scrap booking software provides rudimentary design capabilities and/or is incapable of interacting with electronic cutting machines.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Software applications, such as rich internet applications (RIAs), which are web applications that generally have the features and functionality of traditional desktop applications, may include client and server portions for execution on a respective client computing device and a server computing device. RIAs typically form a stateful client application with a separate services layer on the backend. RIAs typically run in a web browser, or do not require software installation on a local machine, and run locally in a secure environment called a sandbox. A sandbox is generally a security mechanism for safely running programs. Sandboxes are often used to execute untested code, or non-trusted programs from unverified third-parties, suppliers and non-trusted users.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One aspect of the disclosure provides a method of electronically displaying glyphs. The method includes receiving a glyph spacing, moving a first glyph toward a second glyph along an axis, identifying an intersection of a first axis coordinate of the first glyph with a second axis coordinate of the second glyph, and moving at least one of the glyphs along the axis to separate the first and second axis coordinates of the respective first and second glyphs by the glyph spacing.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another aspect of the disclosure provides a method of electronically displaying glyphs that includes receiving first and second glyphs and determining a collision space between the first glyph and the second glyph by providing a bounding box around each glyph and identifying any intersections of the two bounding boxes.

The projects can be realized by cutting the designs on an electronic cutting machine. Users may wish to create or add to scrap designs at his/her leisure in various locations and at various times. Design software that provides the user with design creation tools, content access, and/or portable access allows the user to maximize creative moments to create designs.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, design software <b>100</b> may be used for creating and/or managing content as well as for interacting with an electronic cutting machine <b>150</b>. The design software <b>100</b> may be stored in memory and executed on a processor of a computer <b>120</b>, a hand-held controller <b>130</b>, and/or the electronic cutting machine <b>150</b>, each of which may provide a platform to store, use, and review digital content. In addition, the design software <b>100</b> may provide interaction with other design systems and/or community programs (e.g., uploading-publishing to blogs and other community websites, as well as downloading designs from the same). The design software <b>100</b> may interface with an electronic cutting machine <b>150</b> to realize designs by cutting out the constituent components of the designs, such as paper cutouts. Additionally, the digital content accessed in the design software <b>100</b> to create the designs can be compatible with the electronic cutting machine <b>150</b>, and other devices, such as printers. In some implementations, the design software <b>100</b> provides access to digital content in a secure manner so as to allow for unfettered use by the owner while providing security against unauthorized duplication.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some implementations, the design software <b>100</b> executes on a cloud client <b>110</b> of a cloud computing scheme. Cloud computing allows users to use applications without installation and provides access to their personal files at any computer or computing device with internet access. In general, cloud computing is virtualized third-party hosting, for example, where a user's server runs inside a virtual container which can be moved from one physical server to another without interruption of service. Such a container is also capable of spanning multiple physical machines, giving it potentially limitless resources. This allows for much more efficient computing by centralizing storage, memory, processing and bandwidth. In some implementations, the design software executes on a cloud client <b>110</b> that relies on cloud computing for application delivery, or is specifically designed for delivery of cloud services (e.g., content, design applications, etc.). The design software <b>100</b> may be a rich internet application (RIA) received through cloud computing. The design software <b>100</b> may provide design creation tools and capabilities. Moreover, the user may receive design applications and/or content on demand to the user's own computer <b>120</b> (e.g., laptop) or other computing devices, such as a hand held controller <b>130</b> of the electronic cutting machine <b>150</b>, by accessing a subscription service. The digital content can be delivered by the cloud client <b>110</b> (e.g., a web server executing in a virtual container).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some implementations, the user may access content (e.g., glyphs) for use with the design software <b>100</b> through a cartridge <b>140</b>, which may be in communication with the electronic cutting machine <b>150</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, or the hand held controller <b>130</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The cartridge <b>140</b> may store content in memory of the cartridge and/or content associated with the cartridge <b>140</b> may be stored on a cloud client <b>110</b> accessible by the design software <b>100</b>. The user may access and design with content not otherwise owned by the user; however, when the user executes a cutting operation on the electronic cutting machine <b>100</b>, the user may be required to verify ownership of any content used in a design to be cut. Ownership of content can be verified by establishing communication of any respective cartridges <b>140</b> with the design software <b>100</b> (e.g., via the hand held controller <b>130</b>) and/or the electronic cutting machine <b>150</b>. Moreover, the user may be prompted to purchase any content not owned by the user before allowing execution of the cutting operation on the electronic cutting machine <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The user may access the design software <b>100</b> as a rich internet application (RIA), create designs or projects using content provided by the design software, and save the designs or projects for later execution on an electronic cutting machine <b>150</b>. The user may establish communication between the electronic cutting machine <b>150</b> and the design software <b>100</b> for executing cutting operations by wireless or electrical (e.g., Ethernet) connections to a computer <b>120</b> or other computing device <b>130</b> (e.g., hand-held device) running the design software <b>100</b> or to a network having internet connectivity for accessing the design software <b>100</b>. While in communication with or executing the design software <b>100</b>, the electronic cutting machine <b>150</b> may access information, such as machine type, cartridge type or content specific information from a cloud source (e.g., data storage in the cloud). Moreover, the design software <b>100</b> may access information from the electronic cutting machine <b>150</b> (such as make, model, owner information, stored content, etc.).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some implementations, the design software <b>100</b> receives credit card information from the user to authenticate the user's log in. The design software <b>100</b> may require connection or communication with the controller device <b>130</b> of the electronic cutting machine <b>150</b> to authentication of the user. In some examples, the design software <b>100</b> tracks the browsing and usage of content for creating designs and delivers content (e.g., visually) to the user based on past usage of similar content (e.g., by category, keyword, etc.) and/or statistical analysis. Content may also be delivered to the user based on promotional activities or incentives.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in some implementations, the design software <b>100</b> includes a cartridge view <b>300</b> that allows the user to locate, browse, and/or access cartridges <b>140</b> (e.g., to view content). In the example shown, the cartridge view <b>300</b> provides a list view <b>310</b> of cartridges <b>140</b> accessible by the user. The cartridge view <b>300</b> may include a search text box <b>310</b> that can receive search terms for locating cartridges according to the received search term(s) (e.g., by querying a database). In the example shown, the cartridge view <b>300</b> includes a filter drop down combo box <b>330</b> that can provide a list of cartridge categories. Once a cartridge category has been selected, the design software <b>100</b> can provide a collection of cartridges <b>140</b> associated with the selected cartridge category in the list view <b>310</b> (e.g., by querying a database).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in some implementations, the design software <b>100</b> includes a design view <b>400</b> for creating and editing projects <b>315</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the design view <b>400</b> includes a toolbar <b>410</b>, a virtual mat view <b>420</b>, and a content portion <b>430</b> (e.g., navigation bar or view). The toolbar <b>410</b> includes one or more commands <b>412</b> for editing, manipulating, or otherwise interacting with a project <b>315</b>. For one or more (or all) of the commands, the design software <b>100</b> may provide visual feedback of the executed command by indicating which command was selected and by showing a selected design object <b>450</b> change or alter as a result of the executed command. Moreover, the design software <b>100</b> may show on the virtual mat <b>422</b> how much available paper has be used or occupied as a result of the executed command.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As used herein, the term &#x201c;design object&#x201d; refers to something that is or can be selected by the user for manipulation, such as by executing a user initiated command. A design object <b>450</b> may be a glyph <b>455</b> or part of a glyph <b>455</b> (e.g., a subset of a glyph). For example, a command can be executed on a region of a multi region glyph <b>455</b>. An exemplary single region glyph <b>455</b> is a circle, while an exemplary multi region glyph <b>455</b> is a figure-eight. A glyph <b>455</b> having multiple closed vector loops will have multiple regions defined by those vector loops. Each of these regions can be selected by the user. For example, when executing a copy command, the user first selects the glyph <b>455</b> and then a region of the glyph <b>455</b> that is to be copied.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">A design object <b>450</b> may be a single glyph project as an entire project <b>315</b>. For example, a project <b>315</b> may include data for orientation and size, but as long as only one glyph is in the job or project <b>315</b>, then the project <b>315</b> may be considered single glyph. A design object <b>450</b> may be a multi-glyph project <b>315</b> as an entire project <b>315</b> (e.g., a project having multiple glyphs). In some examples, a design object <b>450</b> is a single glyph of a multi-glyph project <b>315</b>. For example, the user can select a single glyph <b>455</b> from among multiple glyphs <b>455</b> in a project <b>315</b> and execute a command on the selected glyph <b>455</b>. Moreover, in some examples, the user can select multiple glyphs <b>455</b> of a multi-glyph project <b>315</b> (e.g., a subset of a project <b>315</b>) as a design object <b>450</b> and execute a command on the selected glyph <b>455</b>. The design object <b>450</b> may be a single exploded layer, which can be a layer that is no longer part of a composite image. A composite image that has been exploded into multiple layers may have each layer treated as an individual glyph <b>455</b> or design object <b>450</b>. In additional examples, the design object <b>450</b> can be a single layer of a composite image (e.g., a paletted or non-exploded image).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Examples of toolbar commands <b>412</b> include undo <b>412</b><i>a </i>(e.g., undo x number of commands) and redo <b>412</b><i>b </i>(e.g., redo or re-execute n number of commands). The user may execute the undo command <b>412</b><i>a </i>to undo or cancel one or more previous actions or commands <b>412</b>. The actions or commands <b>412</b> may be undone in reverse chronology. The user may also redo or re-execute actions or commands that have been undone by executing the redo command <b>412</b><i>b. </i>In some examples, the toolbar <b>410</b> includes a clear all command (not shown) that clears the entire job (e.g., from memory and/or the virtual matt <b>422</b>). The design software <b>100</b> may indicate that the clear all command has been selected or executed and may offer a confirmation screen to confirm the user's action to clear the entire job.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The toolbar <b>410</b> may include toolbar commands for viewing the project <b>315</b> in different ways. Exemplary viewing commands may include outline <b>412</b><i>c </i>(e.g., to provide an outline cut view of the project), zoom in <b>412</b><i>d </i>(e.g., zoom in on a portion of the virtual mat), and zoom out <b>412</b><i>e </i>(e.g., zoom out on a portion of the virtual mat). A type command <b>412</b><i>f </i>may be sued to create a text field for typing characters or strings. Additional examples of toolbar commands may include cut <b>412</b><i>g, </i>copy <b>412</b><i>h, </i>paste <b>412</b><i>i, </i>group <b>412</b><i>j, </i>ungroup <b>412</b><i>k, </i>flip horizontal <b>412</b><i>l </i>(e.g., flip a selected design object about a y-axis), flip vertical <b>412</b><i>m </i>(e.g., flip a selected design object about an x-axis), move a selected layer to top <b>412</b><i>n, </i>move a selected layer to bottom <b>412</b><i>o, </i>and delete <b>412</b><i>p. </i>In some examples the toolbar <b>410</b> includes height <b>412</b><i>q </i>(e.g., set a height of a selected design object), width <b>412</b><i>r </i>(e.g., set a width of a selected design object), and scale locking <b>412</b><i>s </i>(e.g., lock a height to width relationship). In some examples, the user may customize the toolbar <b>410</b> by adding, removing, and/or arranging commands on the toolbar <b>410</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The virtual mat view <b>420</b> includes a virtual mat <b>422</b>, which may include at least one virtual paper <b>424</b> (representing actual paper for cutting on the electronic cutting machine <b>150</b>). The user may place design objects <b>450</b> (e.g., glyphs) on the virtual mat <b>422</b> and/or virtual paper <b>424</b> for creating and/or editing a project <b>315</b>. The virtual mat view <b>420</b> any include a cut command for sending the project <b>315</b> to an electronic cutting machine <b>150</b> in communication with the design software for execution of a cutting operation. The virtual mat view <b>420</b> may also include a panning command (e.g., up, down, left, right arrows) for moving a view of the virtual mat <b>422</b> in the virtual mat view <b>420</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, in some implementations, the virtual mat view <b>420</b> includes a floating ruler <b>426</b> (e.g., along one or more edges (X and/or Y) of the virtual mat <b>422</b>. As the user zooms in or out on the virtual mat <b>422</b>, the floating ruler adjusts correspondingly to provide the user with actual or relative size dimensions of the viewed mat space on the virtual mat <b>422</b>. An actual mat used on the electronic cutting machine <b>150</b> may have a dimensions printed or applied thereto for alignment and sizing of designs. The virtual mat <b>422</b> may include a replicated dimensioned portion along one or more edges; however, as the user zooms into a specific region of the virtual mat <b>422</b>, the edge dimensions may no longer be viewable. The floating ruler <b>426</b> can provide these dimensions and optionally other dimensions, such as relative dimensions with respect to the virtual mat and/or other objects. The floating ruler <b>426</b> may remain visible to the user irrespective of a zoom level on the virtual mat <b>422</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in some implementations, the design view <b>400</b> includes a command menu <b>440</b> (e.g., accordion menu) having one or more command palettes (e.g., tabs). One or more of the commands of the command menu <b>440</b> may be executable on one or more design objects <b>450</b> in the design view <b>400</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the command menu <b>440</b> includes a shapes palette <b>500</b>, a fonts palette <b>600</b>, a colors palette <b>700</b>, and an options palette <b>800</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The shapes palette <b>500</b> may include transformation commands, such as a rotation command <b>510</b><i>a </i>for setting a rotation of a selected design object <b>450</b> with respect to an axis, such as an X axis. For example, the design software <b>100</b> may allow a user to select a design object <b>450</b> and set an orientation of the design object <b>450</b> (e.g., landscape or portrait, or change the orientation of the object by an angle, such as 0&#xb0;, 45&#xb0;, 90&#xb0;, 180&#xb0;, etc.). Moreover, the user may select design objects <b>450</b> (e.g., glyphs <b>455</b>) and all respective nested attributes (i.e., patterns from a palette) and change their orientation. If a selected design object <b>450</b> has already been rotated, the rotation command <b>510</b><i>a </i>is added to the existing orientation of that design object <b>450</b>. The design software <b>100</b> can provide visual feedback of the executed command by showing the design object <b>450</b> change orientation with respect to a previous orientation and/or by showing how much available paper <b>424</b> has be used or occupied as a result of the executed command. Other transformation commands may include scale-X <b>510</b><i>b </i>(e.g., to set a scaling factor along the X axis of the virtual mat <b>422</b> for sizing a selected design object <b>450</b>), and scale-Y <b>510</b><i>c </i>(e.g., to set a scaling factor along a Y axis of the virtual mat <b>422</b> for sizing a selected design object <b>450</b>).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The shapes palette <b>500</b> may include slant-X <b>510</b><i>d </i>(e.g., for setting a character slant with respect to an x axis) and slant-Y <b>510</b>e (e.g., for setting a character slant with respect to an y axis).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, in some implementations, the command menu <b>440</b> includes a font size command <b>510</b>f for adjusting a font size of text and a letter spacing command <b>510</b><i>g </i>(e.g., kerning) for setting a spacing S between adjacent letters or glyphs <b>455</b> of a selected design object <b>450</b>. The user may select a character spacing option <b>512</b><i>g </i>or a block spacing option <b>514</b><i>g </i>to have the letter spacing command <b>510</b><i>g </i>determine a character spacing S based on a character path intersection offset or a character perimeter box offset, respectively.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">For executing the letter spacing command <b>510</b><i>g </i>using the character spacing option <b>512</b><i>g, </i>the letter spacing command <b>510</b><i>g </i>can execute a routine for determining a distance between visible edges of adjacent first and second characters C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>. In some implementations, the spacing command <b>510</b><i>g </i>identifies a point of intersection between any path of the first character C<b>1</b> and any path of the adjacent second character C<b>2</b> along an X-axis. For example, an intersection between two adjacent characters C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b> can be identified as a location along the X-axis where an X-coordinate of a first point P<b>1</b> of a path of the first character C<b>1</b> is equal to an X-coordinate of a second point P<b>2</b> of a path of the second character C<b>2</b> as the two characters C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b> are moved toward each other along the X-axis. The character spacing S can be defined as a distance along the x-axis between the first and second points P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>. A character path can be defined as stroke path of the character (letter) or a Bezier curve of the character. In additional examples, first and second characters C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b> can be moved toward each other along the X-axis until a path of the first character C<b>1</b> intersects a path of the second character C<b>2</b>. The letter spacing command <b>510</b><i>g </i>can identify corresponding first and second points P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b> on the intersecting paths of the first and second characters C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b> at the location of intersection. The letter spacing command <b>510</b><i>g </i>may then set a spacing S between the first and second points P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b> (e.g., along the X-axis), thus setting a spacing between the corresponding characters C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>. In some examples, the letter spacing command <b>510</b><i>g </i>can be broadened to a design object spacing command that determines a spacing between adjacent design objects <b>450</b>, using the same principles.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some examples, each character has an associated character box surrounding or circumscribing the character. The letter spacing command <b>510</b><i>g </i>positions first and second adjacent characters to have a user specified distance between edges of their corresponding character boxes (e.g., along the X-axis).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">A method of determining the character spacing S between the first and second characters C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b> (or a design object spacing between first and second adjacent design objects <b>450</b>) may include receiving a list of elements (e.g., characters C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b> or design objects <b>450</b>) and determining which elements are touching or colliding (e.g., positioned or arranged on the virtual mat <b>422</b>, such that the two elements intersect at at least one point). The list of elements may be a multi-dimensional array. In some examples, the method includes iterating through the list of elements and comparing each element against all of the other elements in the list of elements. For each comparison, the method may include determining a collision space (e.g., a rectangle) between the two elements (e.g., design objects <b>450</b>) by instantiating bounding boxes around the two elements in a common coordinate space and finding an intersection of the two bounding boxes, if any. The bounding boxes may be rectangular, circular, polyhedron or any other suitable shape (e.g., a perimeter path). If the collision space has a zero size, then the method includes returning that the elements do not touch. If the collision space (or an intersection region of the two bounding boxes) has a size greater than zero, then the method may include recording that the elements intersect and/or determining a minimum spacing between the two elements.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Instantiating a bounding box may include identifying sub-elements of an element, determining a bounding region for each sub-element (e.g., a rectangle or other suitable shape circumscribing the sub-element), and unionizing or combining the sub-element bounding regions or determining an element bounding region that bounds or circumscribes the sub-element bounding regions (e.g., a rectangular, circular, polyhedron or other shaped boundary around the element). In examples where the element or a sub-element has been rotated in the coordinate space, the method may include determining a bounding region that does not include any padding or non-element space around the rotated element or sub-element.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some implementations, the method includes positioning the compared elements to have a spacing S between their respective bounding boxes along at least one of the X and Y axes.

A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">The processes and logic flows described in this specification can be performed by one or more programmable processors executing one or more computer programs to perform functions by operating on input data and generating output. The processes and logic flows can also be performed by, and apparatus can also be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application specific integrated circuit).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">Processors suitable for the execution of a computer program include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors, and any one or more processors of any kind of digital computer. Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a read only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for performing instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally, a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto optical disks, or optical disks. However, a computer need not have such devices. Moreover, a computer can be embedded in another device, e.g., a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile audio player, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, to name just a few. Computer readable media suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of non volatile memory, media and memory devices, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto optical disks; and CD ROM and DVD-ROM disks. The processor and the memory can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, special purpose logic circuitry.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">Implementations of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, e.g., an application server, or that includes a front end component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described is this specification, or any combination of one or more such back end, middleware, or front end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network (&#x201c;LAN&#x201d;) and a wide area network (&#x201c;WAN&#x201d;), e.g., the Internet.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0079">While this specification contains many specifics, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the invention or of what may be claimed, but rather as descriptions of features specific to particular implementations of the invention.
