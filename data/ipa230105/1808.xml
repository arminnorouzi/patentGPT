Although the invention will be described with reference to the exemplary embodiments shown in the drawings, it should be understood that the invention can be embodied in many alternate forms of embodiments. In addition, any suitable size, shape or type of elements or materials could be used.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> the personal mobility vehicle is embodied as a wheelchair system <b>10</b>, although this is not a limitation upon the use and practice of the exemplary embodiments of this invention. As employed herein a wheelchair system is considered as a vehicle that may be capable of controlled, self-powered (e.g., battery powered) movement for a sitting person.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The wheelchair system <b>10</b> includes a seat portion <b>12</b>, a power source <b>14</b>, such as a battery and related power conversion, conditioning and recharging circuitry, and at least two wheels <b>16</b> that are driven by the power source <b>14</b> via at least one motor <b>14</b>A. One or more other wheels <b>18</b> provide stability and enable steering of the wheelchair system <b>10</b>. In this regard there is a user-actuated hand control system (or user interface) <b>20</b>. An attendant control system <b>22</b> may also be provided. The control system <b>20</b> operates with a control system of controller (or control unit) <b>24</b> to provide functions that include, but need not be limited to, starting and stopping motive power to the drive wheels <b>16</b>, controlling the direction of rotation and speed of rotation of the drive wheels <b>16</b>, and controlling a pointing direction of the wheels <b>18</b> to provide steering of the wheelchair <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a simplified block diagram of a portion of the controller <b>24</b>. The controller <b>24</b> can be assumed to include a software system <b>28</b> that includes at least one data processor <b>28</b>A, such as a microprocessor or microcontroller, and a memory <b>28</b>B that stores programs to control operation of the data processor <b>28</b>A and, thereby, to control the overall operation of the wheelchair <b>10</b>. The operating programs, also referred to as system control software (SW) <b>29</b>A, may include firmware, such as computer programs that are permanently stored in, by example, non-volatile flash memory, or system control SW <b>29</b>A may be stored in volatile random access memory (RAM) <b>29</b>B that is loaded from an SD card or flash type of memory storage medium. The exemplary embodiments of this invention are also usable with a system where a system control SW <b>29</b>A is stored in a mass memory device, such as SD card(s) and/or flash memory(ies), and loaded into RAM as needed.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The data processor <b>28</b>A is coupled via general use input/output hardware <b>26</b> to various input/outputs, including general input/outputs, such as input/outputs <b>24</b>A going to and from the user-actuated hand control system <b>20</b> and inputs/outputs <b>24</b>B providing control to the motor(s) <b>14</b>. A clock function or module <b>28</b>C can be included for maintaining an accurate time of day and calendar function.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to some embodiments of the invention, the controller <b>24</b> can further be connected to a wireless interface (WI) <b>30</b>, such as a Bluetooth&#x2122; interface, for example. However, any suitable type of wireless interface or connection may be provided.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring now also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the user-actuated hand control system (or user interface) <b>20</b> includes a housing <b>32</b>, a joystick type controller <b>34</b>, a first keypad <b>36</b>, a second keypad <b>38</b>, a charger port <b>39</b>, and a display <b>40</b>, such as an LCD, LED or other suitable type of display system. The first keypad <b>36</b> is located in front of the joystick <b>34</b> (and between the joystick <b>34</b> and the display <b>40</b>). The second keypad <b>38</b> is located behind (or on the rear side of) the joystick <b>34</b>. Each of the keys on the keypad <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> may comprise any suitable type of key such as press keys, toggle keys, touch, virtual/soft keys, etc. Additionally, it should be noted that although the figures illustrate the first keypad as having six press keys and the second keypad as having four toggle keys, one skilled in the art will appreciate that the various embodiments of the invention are not necessarily so limited and that any suitable number, type, or combination of keys may be provided. The charger port <b>39</b> is configured to have a battery charger connected thereto to allow recharging of the battery <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The user-actuated hand control system <b>20</b> generally allows the user to control the various functions of the wheelchair. For example, the user-actuated hand control system <b>20</b> operates with the control system of the controller <b>24</b> or a seat or auxiliary module (or auxiliary seating module) <b>25</b> to provide functions that include, but need not be limited to, starting and stopping motive power to the drive wheels <b>16</b>, controlling the direction of rotation and speed of rotation of the drive wheels <b>16</b>, controlling a pointing direction of the wheels <b>18</b> to provide steering of the wheelchair <b>10</b>, controlling a seat function, and controlling auxiliary functions. According to various exemplary embodiments of the invention, the user-actuated hand control system <b>20</b> may be directly connected to the controller <b>24</b> (such as by a cable, for example).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The user-actuated hand control system <b>20</b> provides improvements over single keypad conventional configurations by allowing for operation of the personal mobility vehicle <b>10</b> with user input from a keypad in front of the joystick, and/or for operation of the personal mobility vehicle <b>10</b> with user input from a keypad behind the joystick.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Various exemplary embodiments of the invention provide a solution which allows the handcontrol to be fully adjustable with regard to usability, based on the current need of a user. For example, for a user that is comfortable with the keypad in front of the joystick, the keys on the rear side of the joystick can be freely configured for every possible function the wheelchair offers and suits the user. Typically, these keys would be configured for easy/fast access of functions (e.g. seat functions). For a user who has difficulty operating the keys in front of the joystick, the keys on the rear side of the joystick can be freely configured to access all available functions, to the extent of obviating the need for the front keypad. Additionally, since the keys from the keypad on the rear side are freely configurable, the actual functions they contain will be displayed on an area of the display. Furthermore, for the keys on the rear side, there may be more than one set of functions for the keys. If there is more than one set of functions, the set of functions can be chosen by operating one of the keys as a &#x2018;master&#x2019; (e.g. the leftmost or the rightmost keys). The keys in front of the joystick also are freely configurable as well. This provides for the capability that the functionality of each key on each keypad <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> can be configured.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring now also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, there is shown an exemplary configuration of the keys of the keypads <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, wherein the current functions of the keys on the second keypad <b>38</b> are displayed in an area of the display <b>40</b>. For example, key <b>42</b> of the second keypad <b>38</b> corresponds to a first area <b>50</b> of the display <b>40</b> and shows that there is more than just one set of functions. The active set of functions can be chosen by operating this key <b>42</b>.

This provides for greater usability (based on the current needs of the user) when compared to conventional configurations. Many of the conventional power wheel chair handcontrols are typically comprised of a joystick, a display, and a single keypad (on only a single side of the display).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Some users of personal mobility vehicles prefer having the keypad in front of the joystick.

For these users, operating keys on the rear side of the joystick is preferred and advantageous. It is also possible that a user may be initially comfortable using the keys in the front of the joystick but as the disability progresses the keys in the back of the joystick are preferred.
