present disclosure relates to integrated circuit devices. The integration density of an integrated circuit device may be increased to satisfy the demand for products with excellent performance and economic feasibility. In particular, the integration density of an integrated circuit device may be a significant factor for determining the economic feasibility of a product. Because the integration density of a two-dimensional memory device is mainly determined by an area occupied by a unit memory cell, the integration density of a two-dimensional memory device may be significantly influenced by a level of a fine pattern forming technique. However, expensive equipment may be used to form a fine pattern, and an area of a chip die may be limited, and thus, the increase in the integration density of a two-dimensional memory device may still be limited. Accordingly, a vertical memory device having a three-dimensional structure may be demanded.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The inventive concept provides an integrated circuit device having a vertical memory device, wherein the occurrence of a leakage current through a dummy contact plug is inhibited/prevented in advance by forming a ground select line to have a relatively short horizontal length in a connection region in which the dummy contact plug is arranged.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The inventive concept is not limited to the problem described above, and other problems which are not mentioned may be clearly understood by those of ordinary skill in the art from the disclosure below.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to some embodiments of the inventive concept, there is provided an integrated circuit device including: a semiconductor substrate including a cell region and a connection region adjacent to the cell region; a gate stack including a plurality of gate electrodes and a plurality of insulating layers extending on a main surface of the semiconductor substrate in a horizontal direction and alternately stacked thereon in a vertical direction, the gate stick having a stair structure in the connection region; a channel structure in the cell region and extending through the plurality of gate electrodes in the vertical direction; and a plurality of contact plugs in the connection region, wherein, in a portion of the connection region, a first length, in the horizontal direction, of a first gate electrode that is located in the lowest layer among the plurality of gate electrodes is less than a second length, in the horizontal direction, of a second gate electrode that is located above the first gate electrode.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to some embodiments of the inventive concept, there is provided an integrated circuit device including: a semiconductor substrate including a cell region and a connection region adjacent to the cell region and including a first part and a second part neighboring to each other; a first gate stack including a plurality of gate electrodes and a plurality of insulating layers extending on a main surface of the semiconductor substrate in a horizontal direction and alternately stacked thereon in a vertical direction, the first gate stack having a stair structure in the connection region; a channel structure in the cell region and extending through the plurality of gate electrodes in the vertical direction; and a plurality of contact plugs in the connection region.
