For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources. For example, a web page can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation with a web page, for example, along with search results.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Slots can be allocated to content sponsors through a reservation system or an auction. For example, content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content. In turn, a reservation can be made or an auction can be performed, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of the sponsored content to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the sponsored content.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method for associating content items with informational pages and queries that are relevant to the informational pages. The method includes: for each of a plurality of content items in an inventory of content items: identifying an entity associated with the content item and a plurality of page types for a vertical associated with a product or service described in the content item; locating a plurality of informational pages associated with the entity; classifying each informational page based on the page types; identifying queries associated with the entity, wherein a query is used as a selection criteria for delivering one or more content items associated with the entity; for each informational page of the plurality of informational pages determining relevant queries from the identified queries; and storing in a data structure an association between the content item, data associated with the relevant queries and associated informational pages.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In general, another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method for associating a content sponsor and a content item with associated informational pages. The method includes: identifying a content item and an entity associated with the content item; identifying a plurality of informational pages associated with the entity; determining a plurality of page types associated with informational content that are related to the entity; classifying each informational page based on the page types; determining which of the informational pages relate to the content item based on one or more criteria; and storing in a database an association between the content item, the content sponsor, and related informational pages based on page type.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In general, another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in computer program products. A computer program product is tangibly embodied in a computer-readable storage device and comprises instructions. The instructions, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to: for each of a plurality of content items in an inventory of content items: identify an entity associated with the content item and a plurality of page types for a vertical associated with a product or service described in the content item; locate a plurality of informational pages associated with the entity; classify each informational page based on the page types; identify queries associated with the entity, wherein a query is used as a selection criteria for delivering one or more content items associated with the entity; for each informational page of the plurality of informational pages determine relevant queries from the identified queries; and store in a data structure an association between the content item, data associated with the relevant queries and associated informational pages.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In general, another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in systems. A system includes a link and criteria identification system, an annotation serving system, an annotation rendering system, and a content selector. The content selector is configured to: receive a request for content; and identify a content item responsive to the request. The link and criteria identification system is configured to identify one or more informational pages associated with the content item based at least in part on a content sponsor associated with the content item and terms included in the request and/or the landing page associated with the content item. The annotation serving system is configured to: generate a link for an informational page of the one or more informational pages; and augment the content item with the generated link. The annotation rendering system is configured to provide the augmented content item responsive to the request.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. The entity can be a content sponsor. Determining relevant queries from the identified queries can include determining one or more keywords for a given informational page and identifying a relevant query can include finding one or more queries that include the determined one or more keywords. A request for content can be received and a content item can be identified responsive to the request. One or more informational pages associated with the content item can be identified based at least in part on a content sponsor associated with the content item and terms included in the request and/or the landing page associated with the content item. A link can be generated for an informational page of the one or more informational pages, the content item can be augmented with the generated link and the augmented content item can be provided responsive to the request. Identifying a plurality of page types for a vertical associated with a product or service described in the content item can include retrieving a set of page types from a database based on the vertical. Identifying the plurality of page types can include evaluating a corpus of documents associated with a document sponsor to determine the page types. Evaluating the corpus can include evaluating titles of documents in the corpus including extracting n-grams from the titles that do not include a product, service or brand name associated with the content sponsor and using the extracted n-grams to identify the page types. A determination can be made as to which of the identified page types to assign to a content item by evaluating one or more of URL (Uniform Resource Locator) patterns or title n-grams. Locating a plurality of informational pages associated with the content sponsor can include receiving a list of informational pages associated with the content sponsor. Locating a plurality of informational pages associated with the content sponsor can include evaluating a corpus of documents associated with the content sponsor to identify the plurality of informational pages. Locating a plurality of informational pages associated with the content sponsor can include identifying a set of URLs that constitute informational links for the page types of the plurality of page types chosen from a total set of URLs associated with the content sponsor. The page types can be associated with informational needs of a user selected from how-to, buying guide, reviews, product walkthrough, product gallery, customer reviews, question and answer, live chat, technical specifications, technical support, top lists, or side-by-side comparisons. Identifying one or more informational pages can include selecting, based on one or more criteria, one or more informational pages from the identified informational pages and generating an informational link based on a selected informational page. A determination can be made as to a task associated with the request, wherein the task is located along a path toward conversion and wherein the criteria relates to furthering the user along the path toward conversion. The generated informational links can be assembled in an order and the assembled informational links can be provided along with the content item responsive to the request. A determination can be made as to a subset of the informational pages to present based on one or more criteria and augmenting can include presenting informational links associated with the subset. The criteria can be based on a function of a task that is inferred that the user is performing related to the request. A title for the generated link can be automatically constructed. The title can be automatically constructed based on one or more criteria including page type and available screen space. Locating a plurality of informational pages associated with the content sponsor can include submitting a request to a search system for the search system to locate informational pages that include one or more page type n-grams and receiving information from the search system identifying the located informational pages.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Particular implementations may realize none, one or more of the following advantages. Annotations can be added to a content item presented to a user which inform the user as to informational content available from a content sponsor, including informational content located on a landing page associated with the content item or at other locations designated or associated with the content item sponsor. The annotations can be presented in a structured, consistent manner which can create a predictable user experience in which the user knows what to expect when interacting with an annotation. Annotations can be provided that help fulfill an informational need of the user. Annotations can be provided that can move a user forward in a conversion funnel and thus provide a return on investment for the content item sponsor.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example environment for providing an annotated content item to a user.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example system for providing an annotated content item to a user.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flowchart of an example process for associating content items with informational pages and queries that are relevant to the informational pages.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flowchart of an example process for providing an annotated content item to a user.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flowchart of an example process for associating a content sponsor and a content item with associated informational pages.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a block diagram of computing devices that may be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document, as either a client or as a server or plurality of servers.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Systems and methods presented provide structured annotations for presentation along with content items. For example, a request for content can be received from a user device and a content item can be identified in response to the request. One or more informational pages associated with the content item can be identified based at least in part on a content sponsor associated with the content item and terms included in the request and/or on the landing page associated with the content item. A link can be generated for an informational page and the content item can be augmented with the generated link. The augmented content item can be provided to the user device in response to the request.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">For situations in which the systems discussed here collect information about users, or may make use of information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be manipulated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that certain information about the user is removed. For example, a user's identity may be manipulated so that no identifying information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information about the user is collected and used by a content server.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example environment <b>100</b> for providing an annotated content item to a user. The example environment <b>100</b> includes a network <b>102</b>, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. The network <b>102</b> connects websites <b>104</b>, user devices <b>106</b>, content sponsors <b>108</b>, publishers, and a content management system <b>110</b>. The example environment <b>100</b> may include many thousands of websites <b>104</b>, user devices <b>106</b>, and content sponsors <b>108</b>. The content management system <b>110</b> may be used for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content. The content sponsors <b>108</b> can be, for example, advertisers. Other types of content sponsors are possible.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A website <b>104</b> includes one or more resources <b>105</b> associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. An example website <b>104</b> is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Each website <b>104</b> can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A resource <b>105</b> can be any data that can be provided over the network <b>102</b>. A resource <b>105</b> can be identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource <b>105</b>. Resources <b>105</b> include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few. The resources <b>105</b> can include content, such as words, phrases, videos, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as scripts).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A user device <b>106</b> is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources <b>105</b> over the network <b>102</b>. Example user devices <b>106</b> include personal computers, tablet computers, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), televisions, set top boxes, personal digital assistants and other devices that can send and receive data over the network <b>102</b>. A user device <b>106</b> typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network <b>102</b>. The web browser can interact with various types of web applications, such as a game, a map application, or an e-mail application, to name a few examples.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A user device <b>106</b> can request resources <b>105</b> from a website <b>104</b>. In turn, data representing the resource <b>105</b> can be provided to the user device <b>106</b> for presentation by the user device <b>106</b>. User devices <b>106</b> can also submit search queries <b>116</b> to the search system <b>112</b> over the network <b>102</b>. In response to a search query <b>116</b>, the search system <b>112</b> can, for example, access an indexed cache <b>114</b> to identify resources <b>105</b> that are relevant to the search query <b>116</b>. The search system <b>112</b> identifies the resources <b>105</b> in the form of search results <b>118</b> and returns the search results <b>118</b> to the user devices <b>106</b> in search results pages. A search result <b>118</b> is data generated by the search system <b>112</b> that identifies a resource <b>105</b> that is responsive to a particular search query <b>116</b>, and includes a link to the resource <b>105</b>. An example search result <b>118</b> can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL (Unified Resource Locator) of the web page.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The data representing the resource <b>105</b> or the search results <b>118</b> can also include data specifying a portion of the resource <b>105</b> or search results <b>118</b> or a portion of a user display (e.g., a presentation location of a pop-up window or in a slot of a web page) in which other content (e.g., advertisements) can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots or impressions. An example slot is an advertisement slot.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">When a resource <b>105</b> or search results <b>118</b> are requested by a user device <b>106</b>, the content management system <b>110</b> may receive a request for content to be provided with the resource <b>105</b> or search results <b>118</b>. The request for content can include characteristics of one or more slots or impressions that are defined for the requested resource <b>105</b> or search results <b>118</b>. For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to the resource <b>105</b> or search results <b>118</b> for which the slot is defined, a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot can be provided to the content management system <b>110</b>. Similarly, keywords associated with a requested resource (&#x201c;resource keywords&#x201d;) or a search query <b>116</b> for which search results <b>118</b> are requested can also be provided to the content management system <b>110</b> to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource or search query <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Based, for example, on data included in the request for content, a content selector <b>111</b> included in the content management system <b>110</b> can select content items that are eligible to be provided in response to the request, such as content items having characteristics matching the characteristics of a given slot. As another example, content items having selection criteria (e.g., keywords) that match the resource keywords or the search query <b>116</b> may be selected as eligible content items by the content selector <b>111</b>. One or more selected content items can be provided to the user device <b>106</b> in association with providing an associated resource <b>105</b> or search results <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some implementations, the content selector <b>111</b> can select content items based at least in part on results of an auction. For example, content sponsors <b>108</b> can provide bids specifying amounts that the content sponsors <b>108</b> are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content items. In turn, an auction can be performed and the slots can be allocated to content sponsors <b>108</b> according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of a content item to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the content item. For example, when a slot is being allocated in an auction, the slot can be allocated to the content sponsor <b>108</b> that provided the highest bid or a highest auction score (e.g., a score that is computed as a function of a bid and/or a quality measure). When multiple slots are allocated in a single auction, the slots can be allocated to a set of bidders that provided the highest bids or have the highest auction scores.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some implementations, some content sponsors <b>108</b> prefer that the number of impressions allocated to their content and the price paid for the number of impressions be more predictable than the predictability provided by an auction. For example, a content sponsor <b>108</b> can increase the likelihood that its content receives a desired or specified number of impressions, for example, by entering into an agreement with a publisher <b>109</b>, where the agreement requires the publisher <b>109</b> to provide at least a threshold number of impressions (e.g., 1,000 impressions) for a particular content item provided by the content sponsor <b>108</b> over a specified period (e.g., one week). In turn, the content sponsor <b>108</b>, publisher <b>109</b>, or both parties can provide data to the content management system <b>110</b> that enables the content management system <b>110</b> to facilitate satisfaction of the agreement.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">For example, the content sponsor <b>108</b> can upload a content item and authorize the content management system <b>110</b> to provide the content item in response to requests for content corresponding to the website <b>104</b> of the publisher <b>109</b>. Similarly, the publisher <b>109</b> can provide the content management system <b>110</b> with data representing the specified time period as well as the threshold number of impressions that the publisher <b>109</b> has agreed to allocate to the content item over the specified time period. Over time, the content management system <b>110</b> can select content items based at least in part on a goal of allocating at least a minimum number of impressions to a content item in order to satisfy a delivery goal for the content item during a specified period of time.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A content sponsor <b>108</b> can create a content campaign associated with one or more content items using tools provided by the content management system <b>110</b>. For example, the content management system <b>110</b> can provide one or more account management user interfaces for creating and managing content campaigns. The account management user interfaces can be made available to the content sponsor <b>108</b>, for example, either through an online interface provided by the content management system <b>110</b> or as an account management software application installed and executed locally at a content sponsor's client device.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">A content sponsor <b>108</b> can, using the account management user interfaces, provide campaign parameters <b>120</b> which define a content campaign. The content campaign can be created and activated for the content sponsor <b>108</b> according to the parameters <b>120</b> specified by the content sponsor <b>108</b>. The campaign parameters <b>120</b> can be stored in a content sponsor parameters datastore <b>122</b>. Campaign parameters <b>120</b> can include, for example, a campaign name, a preferred content network for placing content, a budget for the campaign, start and end dates for the campaign, a schedule for content placements, content (e.g., creatives), bids, and selection criteria. Selection criteria can include, for example, a language, one or more geographical locations or websites, and/or one or more selection terms.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">A user of a user device <b>106</b> may, for example, submit a search query <b>116</b> that is a query to fulfill an informational need of a user regarding a product or service. For example, the user may be looking for information about how to use a product, how to buy a particular kind of product, a comparison between similar products, or reviews of a product. The content management system <b>110</b> can annotate a content item of a content sponsor <b>108</b> and provide the annotated content item to the user device <b>106</b> to fulfill an informational need represented by such a search query <b>116</b> while also moving the user along a conversion funnel to increase ROI (Return On Investment) for the content sponsor <b>108</b>. An annotated content item, for example, with links to informational content such as a buying guide or reviews, may be more useful for a user than a content item that includes products available for purchase but not other informational content about the products.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A link identification system <b>124</b> can, for each content item in an inventory <b>126</b> of content items, identify a content sponsor <b>108</b> associated with the content item and a set of page types for a vertical associated with a product or service described in the content item. The link identification system <b>124</b> can identify the set of page types for the vertical, for example, by querying a page types data store <b>128</b>. For example, for a retail vertical, the pages types data store <b>128</b> may include a set of predefined page types including how-to guides, buying guides, and/or other page types. For a travel vertical, the page types data store <b>128</b> may include pre-defined page types of transportation, lodging, nearby-destinations, travel guide, and/or other page types. As described in more detail below, a set of page types can be programmatically generated.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The link identification system <b>124</b> can locate a set of informational pages associated with the content sponsor <b>108</b>, such as by using the search system <b>112</b>. Other approaches for locating informational pages are discussed in more detail below. The link identification system <b>124</b> can classify each informational page based on the page types. For example, a particular informational page can be classified as having a page type of buying guide. A link title synthesis system <b>130</b> can associate one or more titles with each informational page identified by the link identification system <b>124</b>. Identification and generation of link titles is described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A criteria identification system <b>132</b> can identify selection criteria for the informational pages identified by the link identification system <b>124</b>. For example, the criteria identification system <b>132</b> can identify queries associated with a content sponsor <b>108</b> in the content sponsor parameters datastore <b>122</b>, such as queries that are used as selection criteria for delivering one or more content items associated with the content sponsor <b>108</b>. The criteria identification system <b>132</b> can determine relevant queries from the identified queries for each informational page associated with the content sponsor <b>108</b>. For example, the criteria identification system <b>132</b> can determine one or more keywords for a given informational page and identify relevant queries by finding one or more queries that include the determined one or more keywords. The criteria identification system <b>132</b> (or the link identification system <b>124</b>) can store, in an associations datastore <b>134</b>, for each content item associated with a content sponsor <b>108</b>, an association between the content item, data associated with the relevant queries, and informational pages associated with the content item.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">When the content management system <b>110</b> receives a request for content, the content selector <b>111</b> can identify a content item responsive to the request, as described above. An annotation serving system <b>136</b> can identify one or more informational pages associated with the content item, for example, by querying the associations datastore <b>134</b> using an identifier of the content sponsor <b>108</b> associated with the content item and terms included in the request for content. The annotation serving system <b>136</b> can rank and/or filter the identified informational pages, as described in more detail below, to determine a set of ranked and selected informational pages. The annotation serving system <b>136</b> can generate a link for each selected informational page and annotate (e.g., augment) the content item with the generated links, for example, using link titles determined by the link title synthesis system <b>130</b>. The annotated content item can be provided to the requesting user device <b>106</b>, as illustrated by an annotated content item <b>140</b>. A user device can include tools for rendering content delivered by the content management system. In the example shown, an annotation rendering system <b>142</b> is used to display the annotated content item <b>140</b>, including generated links and, for example, a header associated with the generated links, to the user of the user device <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example system <b>200</b> for providing an annotated content item to a user. A content server <b>202</b> can provide content in response to requests for content. The content server <b>202</b> can augment (e.g., annotate) a content item with one or more links to informational pages that are associated with an entity (e.g., a content sponsor) that is associated with the content item. In some implementations, the informational pages are identified after a request for content is received. In some implementations, the informational pages are identified before the request is received.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">A link identification system <b>204</b> can identify, for a given content sponsor, a set of informational links (e.g., URLs) for various page types. In some implementations, the link identification system <b>204</b> can identify page types based on a determined vertical. A vertical can be determined, for example, for each content sponsor, based on information stored or known about the content sponsor. As another example, a vertical can be determined for a content item based on information included in or associated with the content item. The link identification system <b>204</b> can query a page types datastore <b>206</b> to determine a set of page types associated with a vertical. For instance, as illustrated by example data <b>208</b>, the link identification system <b>204</b> can determine page types of &#x201c;how-to&#x201d;, buying guide, reviews, product walkthrough, product gallery, and top lists for a retail vertical.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some implementations, a set of one or more n-grams are associated with each page type. For example, n-grams of &#x201c;buying guide&#x201d;, &#x201c;purchase guide&#x201d;, and &#x201c;how to choose&#x201d; can be associated with the page type &#x201c;buying guide&#x201d;. Associations of n-grams to page types can be stored in the page types data store <b>206</b>. The page types data store <b>206</b> can include a version of a page type definition, including mappings of verticals to page types and page types to associated n-grams, for each of multiple languages (e.g., English, German, Japanese).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some implementations, the link identification system <b>204</b> programmatically determines a set of page types, such as for a particular content sponsor or for a group of content sponsors. For example, the link identification system <b>204</b> can identify a set of product-related pages that include product names or keywords, for the content sponsor or for the group of content sponsors. For example, the set of product-related pages can be identified using a search system <b>210</b>, such as by querying for product names and keywords and using a domain restricted search using the domain of a given content sponsor. As another example, a set of product-related pages can be received by a content sponsor. For example, a content sponsor <b>211</b> can use a campaign management user interface <b>212</b> presented on a content sponsor client device <b>214</b> to provide a set of links to product-related pages, as illustrated by a product-pages input included in example content sponsor inputs <b>216</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The link identification system <b>204</b> can process each identified product-related page. For each product-related page, the link identification system <b>204</b> can identify a title for the product-related page, create a copy of the title, remove product names and keywords from the copy of the title, optionally remove stop words from the copy of the title, optionally remove n-grams that match a content sponsor name or a site name, and optionally perform stemming on remaining n-grams included in the copy of the title. The link identification system <b>204</b> can identify the remaining n-grams included in the copy of the title as candidate page types. For instance, an example title of a product-related page may be &#x201c;Example.com&#x2014;Product Reviews for Camera Y&#x201d;. The site-name n-gram of &#x201c;Example.com&#x201d;, the stop word &#x201c;for&#x201d;, and the product-name n-gram of &#x201c;Camera Y&#x201d; can be removed from a copy of the example title, leaving the text &#x201c;Product Reviews&#x201d; in the copy of the example title. The n-grams &#x201c;Reviews&#x201d; and &#x201c;Product Reviews&#x201d; can be identified as candidate page types, for example. In some implementations, candidate page-types are identified by processing one or more page heading elements in a manner similar to the processing of page titles described above.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some implementations, some candidate page types are weighted as being more or less relevant than other candidate page types. For example, candidate page types that are adjacent to a product name or keyword in a product-related page title can be weighted higher than candidate page types that are not adjacent to a product name or keyword. The link identification system <b>204</b> can determine a frequency of occurrence for each candidate page type across all of the processed product-related pages. The link identification system <b>204</b> can select a set of page types from the candidate page types, such as by selecting page types associated with the top N (e.g., ten) highest frequencies of occurrence across product-related pages, or selecting page types having a frequency of occurrence across product-related pages that is higher than a threshold frequency.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The link identification system <b>204</b> can identify, for a given content sponsor, a set of informational links (e.g., URLs) associated with the selected page types. The informational links can be identified, for example, from a set of total URLs that are associated with (e.g., owned) by the content sponsor. The set of total URLs for the content sponsor can be identified, for example, by the search system <b>210</b>. The search system <b>210</b> can, for example, identify (e.g., &#x201c;crawl&#x201d;) the URLs that are associated with one or more domains associated with the content sponsor and can store information on the identified URLs in an indexed cache <b>218</b>. The link identification system <b>204</b> can query the search system <b>210</b> to determine the total set URLs for the content sponsor.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As another example, the link identification system <b>204</b> can identify the total set of URLs for the content sponsor by identifying a set of pre-defined landing page URLs that are associated with the content sponsor, such as by querying a content sponsor parameters datastore <b>220</b>. As yet another example, in some implementations, the content sponsor can provide the total set of URLs for the content sponsor, such as by providing landing page and/or other URLs. For example, the content sponsor <b>211</b> can use the campaign management user interface <b>212</b> to provide the total set of URLs for the content sponsor, as illustrated by a URLs input included in the example content sponsor inputs <b>216</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some implementations, the link identification system <b>204</b> identifies informational links from the total set of URLs for a content sponsor by analyzing the title of each page corresponding to a URL in the total set of URLs. For example, the link identification system <b>204</b> can determine if a title includes an n-gram that is associated with a particular page type. In some implementations, the link identification system <b>204</b> determines whether the title includes a page-type related n-gram after stemming and stop-word removal processing. If a title includes a page-type related n-gram, the page that includes the title can be identified as an informational page of the particular page type and the address associated with the page can be identified as an informational link associated with the particular page type.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some implementations, the link identification system <b>204</b> uses the search system <b>210</b> to identify informational pages associated with a particular content sponsor. For example, the link identification system <b>204</b> can request the search system <b>210</b> to perform searches that include page-type related n-grams and a site restriction on a domain associated with the content sponsor. For example, the search system <b>210</b> can perform a search of &#x201c;&#x2018;buying guide&#x2019; site:example.com&#x201d; to determine buying-guide pages associated with the content sponsor having a domain of &#x201c;example.com&#x201d;. As another example, the search system <b>210</b> can perform a search of &#x201c;&#x2018;buying guide&#x2019; site:example.com &#x2018;Camera Y&#x2019; to find buying guides for a &#x201c;Camera Y&#x201d; product sold by a content sponsor having a domain of &#x201c;example.com&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some implementations, the link identification system <b>204</b> identifies informational links by matching patterns, such as regular expressions, to sets of URLs associated with a particular content sponsor. For example, the link identification system can search for and identify patterns in URLs provided by the content sponsor, identify informational links based on analyzing page titles, and identify informational links using the search system <b>210</b>, and/or other sets of URLs. For example, each URL in a set of URLs associated with a content sponsor of &#x201c;example&#x201d; may have a pattern of &#x201c;www.example. com/products/{id} ?view=comparison {otherOptionalParams}, where each URL in the set is a product comparison page. If another URL which matches the pattern is identified, such as &#x201c;www.example.com/products/2392348?view=comparison&#x26;tracking=campaignId&#x201d;, the URL can be automatically identified as a product comparison page.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Other approaches can be used to identify informational pages. For example, content of landing pages associated with a content sponsor can be evaluated, such as to determine whether a link included in a landing page is an informational link (e.g., such as by identifying page-type related n-grams in link title text). As another example, in some implementations a content sponsor can include metadata in pages associated with the content sponsor (e.g., HTML metadata), and the link identification system <b>204</b> can identify informational pages by determining which pages have metadata indicating a page is an informational page. As yet another example, the link identification system <b>204</b> can query a page classification system (not shown), where the page classification system includes a datastore of page classifications. The page classification system may, for example, classify pages using a machine learning model.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Information can be associated with each identified informational link. For example, a link title synthesis system <b>221</b> can associate one or more titles with each informational page identified by the link identification system <b>204</b>. A title can be, for example, used as a link title in an annotation used for a content item. The link title synthesis system <b>221</b> can determine a title for an informational page, for example, by identifying a title element associated with the informational page or by using a page-type n-gram as a link title (e.g., all buying guide pages may get a link title of &#x201c;buying guide&#x201d;). As another example, the link title synthesis system <b>221</b> can receive a title for an informational page from a content sponsor, such as illustrated by a &#x201c;titles&#x201d; input included in the example content sponsor inputs <b>216</b>. As yet another example, the link title synthesis system <b>221</b> can programmatically generate a title, such as by using one or more of a content sponsor name, a page type, frequent queries associated with the informational page, and/or content from the informational page. For example, a generated link title can be &#x201c;56 Product Reviews from example.com&#x201d;. Frequent queries are discussed in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some implementations, a snippet of text is associated with an informational page, in addition to a title that is associated with the informational page. The snippet and the title can each be included, for example, in an annotation associated with the informational page. A snippet can be received, for example, from a snippet generator (not shown) or from the search system <b>210</b>. As another example, a snippet can be generated from the content of the informational page, such as by identifying a non-boilerplate portion of text included in the informational page, such as the first N words or sentences of non-boilerplate text. Other approaches for generating a snippet can be used. A snippet can be included in an annotation, for example, before or after a link associated with the informational page. For example, an annotation can include a link for a tennis racquet buying guide informational page and can include a snippet associated with the informational page. The annotation can appear, for example, as &#x201c;Tennis Racquet Buying Guide&#x2014;The best racquet on the market is . . . &#x201d; or &#x201c;The best racquet on the market is . . . Tennis Racquet Buying Guide&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Other information can be associated with each identified informational link. For example, a criteria identification system <b>224</b> can identify selection criteria for the informational pages identified by the link identification system <b>204</b>. For example, the criteria identification system <b>224</b> can identify queries associated with one or more content sponsors in the content sponsor parameters datastore <b>220</b>, such as queries that are used as selection criteria for delivering one or more content items associated with a given content sponsor. The criteria identification system <b>224</b> can determine relevant queries from the identified queries for each informational page. For example, the criteria identification system <b>224</b> can determine one or more keywords for a given informational page and identify relevant queries by finding one or more queries that include the determined one or more keywords. In some implementations, the criteria identification system <b>224</b> receives selection criteria from a content sponsor, such as illustrated by a selection criteria input included in the example content sponsor inputs <b>216</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some implementations, the criteria identification system <b>224</b> identifies criteria for an informational page by analyzing the title of the informational page. For example, for each informational page, the criteria identification system <b>224</b> can create a copy of the title, remove page-type n-grams from the title, optionally perform stemming and stop-word removal on the copy of the title, optionally remove site names from the copy of the title, and identify remaining n-grams in the copy of the title. The remaining n-grams can be identified as candidate criteria for the informational page. For example, suppose a title of an informational page is &#x201c;example.com&#x2014;Product Reviews for Camera Y&#x201d;. A &#x201c;Product Reviews&#x201d; page-type n-gram, a stop-word &#x201c;for&#x201d;, and a site name &#x201c;example.com&#x201d; can be removed from a copy of the title, leaving the copy of the title as &#x201c;Camera Y&#x201d;. N-grams of &#x201c;Y&#x201d; and &#x201c;Camera Y&#x201d; can be identified as candidate criteria. In some implementations, candidate criteria that are adjacent to a page-type n-gram in the original title can be weighted higher than candidate criteria that are not adjacent to a page-type n-gram.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some implementations, candidate criteria are identified by processing one or more page heading elements in a manner similar to the processing of page titles described above. In some implementations, candidate criteria are identified by analyzing URLs of informational pages, such as by identifying a particular URL pattern that is shared across a set of URLs for the content sponsor, identifying one or more portions of the pattern as corresponding to a candidate keyword, and identifying particular candidate keywords by identifying portions of respective URLs that correspond to the identified URL-pattern portions.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The criteria identification system <b>224</b> can process each informational page for a content sponsor to determine candidate criteria for the content sponsor. In some implementations, the criteria identification system <b>224</b> identifies a frequency of occurrence of each candidate criteria across all of the informational pages. The criteria identification system <b>224</b> can, for example, select as criteria candidate criteria that have a frequency of occurrence across the informational pages that is greater than a threshold frequency. As another example, the criteria identification system <b>224</b> can select as criteria the candidate criteria that have the N (e.g., ten) highest frequencies. As yet another example, the criteria identification system <b>224</b> can select criteria using a formula that takes into account frequency of candidate criteria across informational pages and whether a respective candidate criterion is used as a selection criterion by the content sponsor for a content item associated with the content sponsor.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some implementations, a keyword hierarchy <b>226</b> data structure is accessed to identify keywords to associate with informational pages. For example, the keyword hierarchy <b>226</b> can include multiple sets of related keywords, where each set of related keywords is associated with a concept, with keywords in the set ordered from general to specific. For example, a set of keywords related to a camera of a model XYZ9 from a camera maker named Camera-Maker-A can include the keywords &#x201c;camera&#x201d;, &#x201c;digital camera&#x201d;, &#x201c;Camera-Maker-A camera&#x201d;, &#x201c;XYZ9&#x201d;, and &#x201c;Camera-Maker-A XYZ9&#x201d;, with the keywords being ordered from more general to more specific. The criteria identification system <b>224</b> can determine that a selected criterion for an informational page is included in a set of related keywords in the keyword hierarchy <b>226</b> and can identify one or more other keywords in the set to use as other selected criteria for the informational page. For example, the criteria identification system <b>224</b> can identify &#x201c;Camera-Maker-A camera buying guide&#x201d; and &#x201c;XYZ buying guide&#x201d; as additional selected criteria for the informational page based on criteria &#x201c;Camera-Maker-A XYZ<b>9</b>&#x201d; being an existing criteria for the informational page.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some implementations, the criteria identification system <b>224</b> can identify a set of frequent queries most often associated with a particular candidate informational page. For example, the criteria identification system <b>224</b> can, for a given candidate informational page, identify queries which result in the candidate informational page being displayed in a search result or that result in a content item associated with the candidate informational page being selected for a content request that is associated with one or more identified queries. For example, the content item can be configured to have the candidate informational page as a landing page. In addition to impressions of search results or content items relating to the identified queries, other factors, such as a click through rate of a search result or content item can be used to identify and rank the frequent queries.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">For example, a particular number of queries can be identified as frequent queries for the candidate informational page. For example, a relevance score can be determined for each query associated with the candidate informational page (e.g., based on impressions, click-through rate) and queries having relevance scores above a threshold can be identified or queries having a top N (e.g., five) relevance scores can be identified. For each identified query, the link identification system <b>204</b> can use the query to determine whether the associated candidate informational page is identified as an informational page for the content sponsor and a page type for the informational page. For example, the queries can be evaluated in a manner similar to the evaluation of titles and URLs described above. In general, the content system <b>202</b> can use one or more approaches of evaluating titles, URLs, page headings, and queries to identify informational pages and page types of identified informational pages.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">For example, a query of &#x201c;dslr camera buying guide&#x201d; can be identified as a frequent query for a candidate informational page having a URL of &#x201c;www.example.com/cameras?guide=1&#x201d;. A page type n-gram of &#x201c;buying guide&#x201d; can be identified in the query of &#x201c;dslr camera buying guide&#x201d;, and the candidate informational page can be identified as an informational page having a page type of &#x201c;buying guide&#x201d;. Frequent queries can be provided to the link title synthesis system <b>221</b> and the link title synthesis system <b>221</b> can use a frequent query to generate a title to be associated with an informational page. For example, if a query of &#x201c;dslr cameras buying guide&#x201d; is provided to the link title synthesis system <b>221</b> for an informational page having a URL of &#x201c;www.example.com/cameras?guide=1&#x201d;, the link title synthesis system <b>221</b> can generate a link title to be associated with the informational page that is or that includes &#x201c;DSLR Camera Buying Guide&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The criteria identification system <b>224</b> (or the link identification system <b>204</b>) can store, in an associations datastore <b>228</b>, for each content item for which selection criteria and informational pages have been identified, an association between the content item, data associated with the selection criteria determined to be relevant to the content item, and informational pages associated with the content item. The data in the associations datastore <b>228</b> can be keyed, for example, by a content sponsor identifier and by selection criteria. For example, for each content sponsor identifier and selection criteria combination, one or more tuples can be stored that include a page type, an informational page URL, and a link title. For instance, example associations data <b>232</b> keyed by multi-valued key <b>234</b> of a content sponsor id of &#x201c;sponsor <b>123</b>&#x201d; (which can be, for example, an identifier associated with the content sponsor <b>211</b>) and selection criteria of &#x201c;DSLR Camera&#x201d; includes tuples <b>235</b>, <b>236</b>, and <b>237</b> for page types of buying guide, reviews, and product comparison, respectively.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">When the content system <b>202</b> receives a request for content, a content selector <b>240</b> can select a content item to serve in response to the request, such as identifying a content item in a content items data store <b>242</b>. For example, a request for content can be received from a user device <b>244</b> of a user <b>246</b>, for a content slot <b>248</b> included in a web page <b>250</b> displayed on the user device <b>244</b>. The web page <b>250</b> is a search results page presented to the user <b>246</b> in response to the user <b>246</b> entering a search query <b>251</b> of &#x201c;DSLR camera buying guide&#x201d;. The content selector <b>240</b> can select, for example, a content item <b>252</b>. The content item <b>252</b> can be associated, for example, with the content sponsor <b>211</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">An annotation serving system <b>254</b> can select one or more informational pages associated with the content item <b>252</b>, for example, by querying the associations datastore <b>228</b> using an identifier of the content sponsor <b>211</b> and the search query <b>251</b>. The annotation serving system <b>254</b> can generate a link for each selected informational page and annotate (e.g., augment) the content item <b>252</b> with the generated links. For example, the content item <b>252</b> includes an annotation <b>256</b> which includes links <b>257</b>, <b>258</b>, and <b>259</b>. The links <b>257</b>, <b>258</b>, and <b>259</b> are associated with the tuples <b>235</b>, <b>236</b>, and <b>237</b>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The annotation <b>256</b> can be displayed to the user using an annotation rendering system <b>262</b>. In the example shown, annotation <b>256</b> includes a header (e.g., &#x201c;Info:&#x201d;). Other headers can be used, such as &#x201c;Learn More&#x201d;. Headers can be descriptive of the informational content that is associated with the one or more of the informational links provided or of the form of a call to action that moves the user farther along the conversion funnel. In some implementations, the annotation rendering system <b>256</b> selects a header based on an amount of available screen space. For example, the annotation rendering system <b>256</b> can select a header so that the annotation <b>256</b> occupies one line of the content item <b>252</b>. The annotation rendering system <b>256</b> (or the annotating serving system <b>254</b>) can also select titles for the links <b>257</b>, <b>258</b>, and <b>259</b> based on available screen space.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">A generated header may include information identifying the content sponsor and information about selection criteria. For example, suppose selection criteria associated with the content item <b>252</b> is &#x201c;CameraBrand DSLR ZY200&#x201d; from example.com and that informational pages identified by the link identification system <b>204</b> are associated with criteria of &#x201c;DSLR Cameras&#x201d;. In such an instance, a header can be &#x201c;About DSLR cameras&#x201d;, &#x201c;From example.com&#x201d;, or &#x201c;More about DSLR cameras from example.com&#x201d;, to name a few examples.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The annotation rendering system <b>256</b> can select titles based on how many items (e.g., links) are shown in an annotation. For example, if a larger number of items are to be shown, shorter titles can be used, and if a smaller number of items are to be shown, longer titles can be used. For example, an annotation <b>264</b> can be included in a content item <b>266</b>. The content item <b>266</b> can be provided to the user device <b>244</b> in response to a request for content for a content slot <b>270</b> included in a search results page <b>272</b>. The annotation <b>264</b> includes items <b>274</b>, <b>275</b>, <b>276</b>, and <b>277</b>. Since the annotation <b>264</b> includes more items than the annotation <b>256</b>, shorter titles may be used for the items included in the annotation <b>264</b> as compared to items included in the annotation <b>256</b>. For example, the item <b>274</b>, which is a link to a buying guide, has a title of &#x201c;Buy. Guide&#x201d;, while a corresponding link <b>257</b> has a longer title of &#x201c;Buying Guide&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">As shown in the annotation <b>264</b>, some items in an annotation (e.g., items <b>275</b>, <b>276</b>, and <b>277</b>) can be &#x201c;badges&#x201d;, or words to flag or mark the annotation <b>264</b> and/or the content item <b>266</b>. A badge can inform the user about informational content that is available from the content sponsor associated with the content item <b>266</b> (e.g., the content sponsor <b>211</b>), such as information available from a landing page associated with the content item <b>266</b> (e.g., reviews, product comparison, or a product gallery). A badge, for example, may not be a link, meaning the badge may not respond specifically to user interaction. If a user selects a badge such as the item <b>275</b>, <b>276</b>, or <b>277</b>, for example, the selection action may be interpreted as a selection of the content item <b>266</b>, which can result in a display of a landing page associated with the content item <b>266</b>. The link <b>274</b> may, for example, be a link to the landing page associated with the content item <b>266</b>, a link to a particular section of the landing page, or a link to a different web page associated with the content sponsor <b>211</b>. Badges to include in an annotation can be determined, for example, by analyzing page heading elements of the landing page in a manner similar to the determination of candidate page-types based on page heading elements, as described above.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The annotation serving system <b>254</b> may use various approaches to rank and/or filter the items included in an annotation. For example, the annotation serving system may select zero or one item (e.g., link, badge) for every page type, up to a threshold number of items (e.g., seven), so that a diversity and balance of page types are included in the annotation. The threshold number of items can be predefined (e.g., seven), or can be dynamically determined based on the length of potential title text for candidate items that may be included in the annotation.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some implementations, candidate items for an annotation may be ranked based on relevance to a query associated with the request for content for which the content item is selected. For example, for the annotation <b>256</b>, the associated content item <b>252</b> may have been selected based on the search query <b>251</b> of &#x201c;DSLR camera buying guide&#x201d;. Informational links associated with the page type of buying guide may be ranked higher by the annotation serving system <b>254</b> than informational pages of other page types for the given vertical. In this example, one informational page associated with the content sponsor <b>211</b> has a page type of buying guide, but in other examples, multiple informational pages having a page type of buying guide can be selected and included in the annotation <b>256</b>, based on the buying guide page type having a higher weight than other page types. In some implementations, a page type can be ranked higher than other page types if the page type corresponds to selection criteria associated with the content item that includes the annotation, or with other criteria, such as being associated with a user task that is inferred or a user's determined current activity or location in a conversion funnel.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The annotation serving system <b>254</b> can use other approaches for filtering or ranking candidate items considered for inclusion in an annotation. For example, the annotation serving system can select items so that each item is at a same or similar level of granularity, such as is maintained in the keyword hierarchy datastore <b>226</b>. For example, if the annotation serving system <b>254</b> includes in an annotation a link to a buying guide for a particular DSLR camera, the annotation serving system <b>254</b> may also select a link to a reviews page for the same DSLR camera rather than selecting a link to a reviews page for DSLR cameras in general or for some other camera model.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">A content sponsor (e.g., the content sponsor <b>211</b>) can receive reports <b>280</b> which can include information related to user interaction with the content items that include annotations, including interactions with items included in annotations. The reports <b>280</b> can include information about interactions with annotations that can be associated with various other user interactions, such as conversion actions. In some implementations, the content sponsor <b>211</b> can use the campaign management user interface <b>212</b> to register for or to opt out of inclusion of annotations in content items associated with the content sponsor <b>211</b>. In some implementations, the content sponsor <b>211</b> can register for or opt out of automatic creation and/or serving of content items whose content includes information about and/or links to informational pages that have been determined for the content sponsor by the link identification system <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">For example, a content creator <b>282</b> can automatically create a content item <b>284</b> based on informational content identified by the link identification system <b>204</b>. For example, the content item <b>284</b> includes a title <b>285</b> and a link <b>286</b>, based on the link identification system <b>204</b> identifying the link <b>284</b> as a link to an informational page. The content item <b>284</b> includes an annotation <b>287</b> that includes links for reviews, product comparison, and a product gallery, respectively.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some implementations, the content creator <b>282</b> automatically creates the content item <b>284</b> and presents the content item <b>284</b> to the content sponsor <b>211</b> (e.g., on the campaign management user interface <b>212</b>) as a suggestion for a new content item for the content sponsor <b>211</b> to include in a content campaign. When the content sponsor <b>211</b> approves the suggestion, the campaign can be activated and the content item <b>284</b> can be served in response to requests for content that are received. In some implementations, the content item <b>284</b> is automatically created and served in response to requests for content without specific approval from the content sponsor <b>211</b>. That is, the content sponsor <b>211</b> may have registered to have content items automatically created and served without requiring specific approval of each created content item. The content item <b>284</b> can be provided, for example, to a user device <b>288</b> of a user <b>289</b>, for presentation in a content slot <b>290</b> included in a web page <b>291</b>. The content item <b>284</b> can be selected, for example, based at least in part on the content item <b>284</b> having associated keywords that match, for example, the content of the web page <b>291</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some implementations, the annotation serving system <b>254</b> creates annotations that can be included in other types of content items. For example, the annotation system <b>254</b> can create an annotation that can be used to augment a search result generated by the search system <b>210</b>. For example, a search results web page <b>293</b> is displayed on a user device <b>294</b> of a user <b>295</b>. The search results web page <b>293</b> includes a search result <b>296</b>. The search result <b>296</b> includes an annotation <b>297</b> created by the annotation serving system <b>254</b> and displayed by, for example, the annotation rendering system <b>262</b>. The link identification system <b>204</b> can, for example, determine informational pages associated with an entity (e.g., a publisher, a content sponsor) associated with the search result <b>296</b> and the annotation serving system <b>254</b> can create the annotation <b>297</b> which includes links to the identified informational pages, such as links to a buying guide, reviews, a product comparison, and/or a product gallery, as shown in the annotation <b>297</b>. In some implementations, links identified by the link identification system <b>204</b> can be merged or combined in the annotation <b>297</b> with other links (e.g., other site links) identified, for example, by the search system <b>210</b> or some other system.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Although generally described above as operations being performed, in order, by the link identification system <b>204</b>, the link title synthesis system <b>221</b>, the criteria identification system <b>224</b>, the annotation serving system <b>254</b>, and the annotation rendering system <b>262</b>, operations can be performed in different orders and by different systems. The functionality of two or more systems can be combined into a single system. For example, the link title synthesis system <b>221</b> and the criteria identification system <b>224</b> can be combined. As another example, the criteria identification system <b>224</b> can identify a set of keywords for a content sponsor before the link identification system <b>204</b> identifies informational pages, and the link identification system <b>204</b> can use the identified keywords for locating informational pages.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flowchart of an example process <b>300</b> for associating content items with informational pages and queries that are relevant to the informational pages.

In some implementations, determining which of the identified page types to assign to a content item includes evaluating title n-grams. For example, an informational page can be classified as a particular page type if the title of the informational page includes a page type n-gram (e.g., after optional stemming and stopword removal). Other approaches can be used to classify the informational page based on page type.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Queries associated with the entity are identified (<b>308</b>), wherein a query is used as selection criteria for delivering one or more content items associated with the entity.
