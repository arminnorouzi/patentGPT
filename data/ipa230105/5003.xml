This small monetary value often rounds up the purchase price to the nearest dollar (or other currency denomination), may add several cents (e.g., pennies), or may otherwise amount to a small fraction of the purchase price. Rather than going towards the actual purchase transaction, the added amount may be directed to another purpose, such as a donation to a charity.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In addition, the retail transactions themselves may provide various useful data points. For example, the types of products purchased, frequency and timing of purchases, etc., may reveal certain consumer trends. Such consumer trends may be useful for investment decisions.

Additional examples of computing device <b>202</b> include, without limitation, laptops, tablets, desktops, servers, cellular phones, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), multimedia players, embedded systems, wearable devices (e.g., smart watches, smart glasses, etc.), smart vehicles, smart packaging (e.g., active or intelligent packaging), gaming consoles, so-called Internet-of-Things devices (e.g., smart appliances, etc.), payment terminals, variations or combinations of one or more of the same, and/or any other suitable computing device.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Server <b>206</b> generally represents any type or form of computing device that is capable of receiving, analyzing, and providing data. Server <b>206</b> may be a back-end server with restricted access, such as access restricted to a fund manager. Additional examples of server <b>206</b> include, without limitation, application servers, web servers, storage servers, database servers and/or security servers, configured to run certain software applications and/or provide various web, storage, database, and/or security services. Although illustrated as a single entity in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, server <b>206</b> may include and/or represent a plurality of servers that work and/or operate in conjunction with one another.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Network <b>204</b> generally represents any medium or architecture capable of facilitating communication or data transfer. In one example, network <b>204</b> may facilitate communication between computing device <b>202</b> and server <b>206</b>. In this example, network <b>204</b> may facilitate communication or data transfer using wireless and/or wired connections. Examples of network <b>204</b> include, without limitation, an intranet, a Wide Area Network (WAN), a Local Area Network (LAN), a Personal Area Network (PAN), the Internet, Power Line Communications (PLC), a cellular network (e.g., a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) network), portions of one or more of the same, variations or combinations of one or more of the same, and/or any other suitable network. In some examples, data transferred through network <b>204</b> may be encrypted or otherwise protected. In some examples, computing device <b>202</b> and/or server <b>206</b> may correspond to nodes of a distributed computing paradigm, such as edge computing. For example, computing device <b>202</b> and/or server <b>206</b> may correspond to a cloud server, an edge server, etc.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, data elements <b>120</b> and/or portions thereof, may be stored on server <b>206</b> and/or computing device <b>202</b>, and may be transferred therebetween via network <b>204</b>. In some examples, data elements <b>120</b> may be locally stored and/or transferred within a local network. In some examples, different portions of data elements <b>120</b> may be stored across multiple computing devices <b>202</b> such that server <b>206</b> may partially or fully aggregate data elements <b>120</b>. For example, in a decentralized computing system or peer-to-peer (&#x201c;P2P&#x201d;) system, each computing device <b>202</b> may include local copies of one or more modules <b>102</b> along with locally relevant portions of data elements <b>120</b>. Moreover, in such examples, server <b>206</b> may further manage certain functions, even with the P2P or decentralized system, to ensure fidelity across the various nodes. For instance, server <b>206</b> may, in addition to performing aggregation functions, manage user accounts and logins, may ensure that the various nodes follow protocols, propagate updates to software or code (e.g., one or more modules <b>102</b>), interface with other third-party systems (e.g., banking systems), verify records (e.g., transactions written to ledgers), etc.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flow diagram of an example computer-implemented method <b>300</b> for incentivizing sharing of transaction information.

For example, transaction module <b>104</b> may, as part of computing device <b>202</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, receive transaction data <b>122</b> of a transaction between a user and a merchant.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Transaction data <b>122</b> may include data relating to various aspects of a transaction between the user and the merchant. In some examples, the user may be a person (e.g., a consumer, customer, etc.) conducting a transaction involving a financial exchange with the merchant. In some examples, the user may be an entity or other party (e.g., an agent for the person, a group of persons, an organization, etc.). In some examples, user data may include user accounts, user country, user financial details, user opt-ins, etc. In some examples, the merchant may be an entity or party (e.g., a retail business, an organization, a company, another user, an agent for a user, etc.) that may provide goods and/or services to the user in exchange for financial compensation reflected in the transaction amount (e.g., a single amount of money, one or more payments, etc.).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some examples, the transaction may be a retail transaction, such as a purchase of goods and/or services. In other examples, the transaction may be any other type of transaction that may involve financial compensation. For example, the transaction may be a refund or other modification of a prior transaction. In such examples, some or all of transaction data <b>122</b> may be re-identified in order to match with the prior transaction.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some examples, transaction data <b>122</b> may be anonymized so as to preserve the user's privacy. For example, certain analysis, particularly aggregated data analysis, may not access user-identifiable information. Anonymizing may include, for example, deidentification (e.g., removing, genericizing, and/or otherwise modifying identifying information such as names), stratification (e.g., classifying certain characteristics such as age into a range or other category), and/or masking (e.g., obfuscating a portion or all of identifying information such as names). In some examples, transaction data <b>122</b> may maintain certain data in order to properly associated the user with the reserved portion of the transaction amount, for instance to appropriately credit the user's allocation of the fund.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The user may have provided permission for the systems and services described herein to collect transaction data <b>122</b>. In some examples, the user may have signed up for a service as described herein to collect the user's transaction data, including transaction data <b>122</b>. In some examples, the user may provide permission to collect transaction data, such as transaction data <b>122</b>, for each transaction during or after the transaction is completed. In some examples, the user may provide permission for collecting transaction data from one or more types or classes of transactions, such as transactions involving a particular merchant, a particular payment method (e.g., a credit card, financial institution, etc.), particular types of goods and/or services, or other criteria. In addition, the user may provide permission as to what aspects of the transaction data may be collected, for instance allowing or restricting collection of demographic information or other personally identifiable information in order to preserve the user's privacy. In some examples, transaction module <b>104</b> may collect transaction data <b>122</b> that may include only data that the user has allowed. In other examples, transaction module <b>104</b> may strip data from transaction data <b>122</b> to conform with the user's preferences. In some examples, the user may specify what types of analysis to perform, which data may be analyzed, etc. For example, the user may select between value-based analysis (e.g., high yield), privacy-based (e.g, sharing more data for more robust analysis). In some examples, the analysis performed by transaction module <b>104</b> may depend of what data is shared. For example, transaction module <b>104</b> may automatically select what types of analysis to perform based on which user opt-in data is shared by the user.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The transaction amount may refer to the actual financial compensation provided by the user to the merchant as part of the transaction for goods and/or services from the merchant. The transaction amount may refer to the entire financial compensation amount, including the reserved portion. The reserved portion may refer to a portion of the transaction amount to be reserved for a fund as described herein. The reserved portion may be a calculated portion (e.g., a percentage of the retail transaction amount between the user and the merchant, a rounded up amount such as an amount to bring the transaction amount to the nearest dollar or other denomination) or a fixed portion (e.g., a fixed dollar amount). In some examples, the user may designate the reserved portion, such as by designating a desired percent, rounding, custom fixed amount, etc., and the user may further designate the reserved portion (which may be a percentage and/or absolute a mount) for each transaction, class of transactions, or designate a default value to be used when the user does not specify for a particular transaction.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one example, the user may be a consumer purchasing a good from a retailer, for instance, either online or in a brick and mortar store. The user may have previously provided permission for collecting transaction data relating to this transaction, using a round-up amount as the reserved portion.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some examples, transaction data <b>122</b> may be further processed, either before and/or after step <b>302</b>. For example, transaction data <b>122</b> may be anonymized as described herein. In addition, a master data lookup may retrieve additional data for enriching the transaction data for analysis based on stored lookup keys, metadata, or anonymized values.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some examples, transaction data <b>122</b> may be recorded or otherwise stored in a distributed ledger. A distributed ledger may refer to digital data that may be replicated, shared, and synchronized across multiple nodes (e.g., computing devices), such as in a peer-to-peer network or other decentralized computing system. A consensus algorithm may ensure that the data is properly replicated across the nodes. In some examples, computing devices <b>202</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> may be nodes of a P2P or other decentralized system. In such examples, each computing device <b>202</b> may manage a particular ledger. For instance, computing device <b>202</b> associated with a user (e.g., a mobile device) may manage at least portions of transaction data <b>122</b> of transactions by the user in a distributed ledger. Computing device <b>202</b> associated with a merchant (e.g., a merchant POS device) may manage at least portions of transaction data <b>122</b> for the merchant in a distributed ledger. These distributed ledgers may be made available to other nodes (e.g., server <b>206</b>) for aggregation, as described herein.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some examples, when a merchant completes a transaction, for example on a POS device, the POS device may send transaction data <b>122</b> for the transaction to interested parties. For example, the users' computing device <b>202</b> and/or server <b>206</b> may subscribe to events from the POS device such that transaction events (or other events described herein) may be sent to the subscribed devices. Alternatively or additionally, the interested parties may poll the POS device periodically to received updated transaction data <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">At step <b>304</b> one or more of the systems described herein may receive the reserved portion for adding to a fund. For example, fund module <b>106</b> may, as part of computing device <b>202</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, receive or otherwise facilitate transfer of the reserved portion for adding to a fund associated with fund module <b>106</b>. Fund module <b>106</b> may track or otherwise record data on the transfer of the reserved portion in fund data <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some examples, fund module <b>106</b> may directly facilitate transfer of the reserved portion. For example, fund module <b>106</b> may directly access the user's financial institution to transfer the reserved portion to the fund's financial institution. Alternatively, fund module <b>106</b> may directly access the merchant's financial institution to transfer the reserved portion (which may have been transferred from the user's financial institution to the merchant's financial institution) to the fund's financial institution. In such examples, receiving the reserved portion may include directly receiving the reserved portion into the fund.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some examples, fund module <b>106</b> may indirectly facilitate transfer of the reserved portion. For example, fund module <b>106</b> may provide instructions to an agent permitted to access the user's and/or the merchant's financial institution to direct the reserved portion to the fund's financial institution. In such examples, receiving the reserved portion may include indirectly receiving the reserved portion, or receiving access to the reserved portion for redirecting into the fund.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some examples, fund module <b>106</b> may further associate the reserved portion with the user. Fund module <b>106</b> may associate the reserved portion with the user by recording the reserved portion amount with a user ID, which may be anonymized but may allow identifying the appropriate user with the reserved portion. For instance, fund module <b>106</b> may record how much the user added to the fund in fund data <b>126</b>. In some examples, such as in examples where transaction data <b>122</b> may be deidentified, portions of transaction data <b>122</b> may be re-identified in order to associate the reserved portion with the user. For instance, transaction data <b>122</b> may be associated with one or more keys for re-identification or otherwise reassociating transaction data <b>122</b> with the user. The keys may be securely stored remotely in order to preserve data privacy.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some examples, fund module <b>106</b> may track how much the user has contributed to the fund. In some examples, fund module <b>106</b> may further calculate a dividend of the fund to distribute to the user based on the reserved portion. For example, fund module <b>106</b> may determine how much the user contributed to the fund (e.g., an aggregate amount of reserved portions provided by the user via transactions) and appropriately calculate the dividend, for instance based on percent of the total fund amount contributed by the user. Fund module <b>106</b> may calculate and/or distribute the dividend to the user on a periodic basis, such as monthly, yearly, etc. In some examples, fund module <b>106</b> may distribute the dividend to the user in response to a trigger condition. For example, fund module <b>106</b> may collect calculated dividends for the user and distribute the collected dividend when the collected dividend reaches a threshold amount. Other trigger conditions may include time-based conditions, transaction-based conditions (e.g., after n transactions, after a certain type of transaction is completed, etc.). Fund module <b>106</b> may have access or permission to transfer the dividend, although in other examples, fund module <b>106</b> may instruct an agent to do so. In some examples, the dividend may be a non-zero value, although in other examples the dividend may be zero, trivial, or otherwise nominal in value.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Fund module <b>106</b> may further manage and/or facilitate management of the fund. For example, fund module <b>106</b> may track how much capital the user invested into the fund (e.g., the combined amount of reserved portions from the user). If the user leaves the fund, fund module <b>106</b> may determine how much of the fund's current value is attributable to the user and disburse the appropriate amount. In some examples, the user may withdraw a portion of the user's capital, such as an amount specified by the user or as part of a refund of a prior transaction. Fund module <b>106</b> may facilitate withdrawal of the specified amount, or may facilitate withdrawal of a particular value (e.g., if the user wishes to withdraw the current value of a particular initial amount).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some examples, fund module <b>106</b> may manage fund data <b>126</b> as a distributed ledger. For example, fund module <b>106</b> may attribute the reserved portion to the user as a record in the distributed ledger. In such examples, fund module <b>106</b> may operate as part of computing device <b>202</b> and fund data <b>126</b> may comprise a separate ledger than that of transaction data <b>122</b> or any other ledger described herein.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">At step <b>306</b> one or more of the systems described herein may aggregate the transaction data with collected transaction data from a plurality of users. For example, analysis module <b>108</b> may, as part of computing device <b>202</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, aggregate transaction data <b>122</b> with aggregated transaction data <b>124</b> that may comprise collected transaction data from a plurality of users.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Analysis module <b>108</b> may aggregate aggregated transaction data <b>124</b> periodically, for instance monthly, yearly, weekly, etc. In some examples, analysis module <b>108</b> may aggregate aggregated transaction data <b>124</b> in response to one or more trigger conditions. For example, analysis module <b>108</b> may aggregate aggregated transaction data <b>124</b> after every n number of transactions have been recorded, after the associated fund (which may be reflected in fund data <b>126</b>) has reached a threshold amount or milestone, in conjunction with any other event (e.g., any of the steps described herein), etc. In some examples, analysis module <b>108</b> may aggregate aggregated transaction data <b>124</b> based on a time window, such as portions of transaction data <b>122</b> that may fall within a specified date range. The time window may be the same for each iteration or may vary for each iteration, and may be determined automatically or manually set by an associated user, such as the user, a user with access to the associated fund, etc. In some examples, analysis module <b>108</b> may aggregate aggregated transaction data <b>124</b> in response to a user request from any associated user, such as the user, a user with access to the associated fund, etc.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Aggregated transaction data <b>124</b> may include transaction data (e.g., transaction data <b>122</b> once aggregated) of one or more transactions from one or more users. In some examples, aggregated transaction data <b>124</b> may include or otherwise incorporate data (which may have been anonymized as described herein) relating to all transactions recorded for all users associated with the given fund. In some examples, aggregated transaction data <b>124</b> may be limited to data relating to a subset of users. Aggregated transaction data <b>124</b> may be stored in a database or other data storage system.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">To further leverage aggregated transaction data <b>124</b>, analysis module <b>108</b> may analyze aggregated transaction data <b>124</b> to generate analysis data <b>128</b>. In some examples, analysis module <b>108</b> may identify at least one transaction characteristic from aggregated transaction data <b>124</b>. For example, the transaction characteristic may be one or more of: a merchant characteristic (e.g., type of merchant, category of goods and/or services provided by the merchant, corporate structure of the merchant, size of the merchant, location and/or agent of the merchant performing the transaction, marketing campaigns of the merchant associated with the transaction, promotions associated with the merchant, point-of-sale terminal characteristics, card terminal location, etc.), an anonymized user characteristic (e.g., demographic information, geographic information, method of performing the transaction, descriptions/comments/instructions regarding the transaction, etc.), the transaction amount (e.g., the retail transaction amount, the total transaction amount, the reserved portion, associated discounts for the transaction, etc.), a transaction timestamp (e.g., a time of the transaction, a time of day/week/month/year of the transaction, a season/holiday associated with the transaction, a time to complete the transaction, frequency of transactions, etc.), a transaction product (e.g., details and/or descriptions of the goods and/or services provided, category of transaction product, age of transaction product, etc.), and a transaction mechanism (e.g., payment terminal, payment intermediary, credit card number and/or bank routing information which may be anonymized, etc.). In some examples, the user may provide permission to perform aggregations and/or analysis on potentially identifying information such as user ID data.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Analysis module <b>108</b> may perform analysis on aggregated transaction data <b>124</b> for the transaction characteristic to generate analysis data <b>128</b>. The analysis may include statistical analysis for the identified transaction characteristic(s), predictive analysis for the identified transaction characteristic(s) (e.g., a data prediction and/or prediction relating to one or more future transactions, etc.), prescriptive analytics, or any other analysis. Analysis module <b>108</b> may use machine learning or other artificial intelligence scheme to analyze aggregated transaction data <b>124</b> and generate analysis data <b>128</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Analysis data <b>128</b> may reveal trends, patterns, and/or other statistically significant features from aggregated transaction data. For example, analysis data <b>128</b> may indicate that at certain times of the year, users may increasingly purchase particular product categories. In another example, analysis data <b>128</b> may indicate that certain products may be consistently or increasingly purchased above or below their retail prices. Other trends revealed by analysis data <b>128</b> may include, without limitation, correlations between sales/advertising and purchases, spending habits of anonymized categories of consumers, times of day when certain products are purchased, etc. In yet another example, analysis data <b>128</b> may provide purchasing trends of particular retailers.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Analysis module <b>108</b> may be able to provide real-time or near real-time analysis of aggregated transaction data <b>124</b> such that analysis data <b>128</b> may reveal real-time or near real-time trends. In some examples, analysis module <b>108</b> may interface with fund module <b>106</b> such that fund module <b>106</b> may use analysis data <b>128</b>, or portions thereof, to manage the fund. Fund module <b>106</b> may utilize various signals, such as trends revealed in analysis data <b>128</b>, for investing some or all of the fund. Fund module <b>106</b> may be able to respond to real-time or near real-time analysis provided by analysis module <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Moreover, fund module <b>106</b> may provide or otherwise facilitate customized management of the fund. For example, the user, or a class of users, may wish for their portion of the fund to be invested in certain designated businesses/industries/entities, at certain specific times, in response to certain triggers, etc. The user may also wish for certain transactions and/or categories of transactions to be invested in certain ways. Fund module <b>106</b> may allow macro to granular management of the fund, as well as automated management of the fund. For example, based on the user's preferences, fund module <b>106</b> may invest reserved portions from specific transactions into specific commodities in response to analysis module <b>108</b> detecting a trend with respect to the commodities.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some examples, analysis module <b>108</b> may operate as a part of server <b>206</b> in a P2P or decentralized system. For example, server <b>206</b> may access transaction data <b>122</b>, which may be a distributed ledger maintained by computing device <b>202</b>. Server <b>206</b> may further access fund data <b>126</b> to verify its records.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, at step <b>308</b> one or more of the systems described herein may provide the aggregated transaction data. For example, data module <b>110</b> may, as part of computing device <b>202</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, provide aggregated transaction data <b>124</b> for display on a computing device. In some examples, providing aggregated transaction data <b>124</b> may include providing the results of the analysis (e.g., analysis data <b>128</b>). Alternatively, providing aggregated transaction data <b>124</b> may be indirect. Rather than providing aggregated transaction data <b>124</b>, data module <b>110</b> may provide analysis data <b>128</b> instead.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Data module <b>110</b> may provide aggregated transaction data <b>124</b> and/or analysis data <b>128</b> to a user requesting such data, such as the user (e.g., the retail consumer), a fund user (e.g., a fund manager with access to the fund associated with fund data <b>126</b>), and/or any other authorized user (e.g., retailer, consultant, etc.). In some examples, data module <b>110</b> may ensure that only authorized users may access such data, for instance by requiring verification/authentication of the requesting user, encrypting aggregated transaction data <b>124</b> and/or analysis data <b>128</b>, and other security measures.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some examples, data module <b>110</b> may format analysis data <b>128</b> and/or aggregated transaction data <b>124</b> for display. Data module <b>110</b> may facilitate transforming analysis data <b>128</b> and/or aggregated transaction data <b>124</b> for display, for input into another module (e.g., fund module <b>106</b> to enable fund module <b>106</b> to respond to analysis data <b>128</b> and/or aggregated transaction data <b>124</b> as described herein), etc. In some examples, data module <b>110</b> may, alone or in conjunction with another module such as fund module <b>106</b> and/or analysis module <b>108</b>, determine certain aspects of analysis data <b>128</b> and/or aggregated transaction data <b>124</b> to be highlighted. For example, if analysis data <b>128</b> indicates a drastic or otherwise abnormal trend (e.g., satisfying certain predetermined and/or dynamic trigger conditions and/or thresholds, or if the trend runs counter to prior trends, represents a deviation, or other statistically significant deviation), data module <b>110</b> may prioritize the abnormal trend. Data module <b>110</b> may prioritize the abnormal trend by highlighting the related data (e.g., by making visually distinct, presenting first, etc.) and/or by sending specific notifications/alerts with respect to the abnormal trend.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some examples, data module <b>110</b> may format analysis data <b>128</b> and/or aggregated transaction data <b>124</b> based on an intended recipient. For example, data module <b>110</b> may present, to the user or retailer, data directly associated with the user or retailer, respectively. Data module <b>110</b> may format the data for aggregated analysis to the fund manager. Formatting may include, for instance, modifying the data based on the intended recipient. For instance, data module <b>110</b> may limit how much deep analysis is provided to the user. In addition, based on an intended recipient, data module <b>110</b> may anonymize all or a portion of analysis data <b>128</b> and/or aggregated transaction data <b>124</b>, such as appropriate for consumption by third parties.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">As explained above in connection with example method <b>300</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a retail transaction system may incentivize users to share transaction information by investing a small amount of the transaction into a fund. The systems and methods described herein may facilitate the collection of retail transaction data as well as transferring a reserved portion each transaction to an investment fund. The systems and methods described herein may periodic (e.g. calendar monthly, 30-day windows, quarterly, weekly, yearly, etc.) aggregate data of spending by members for retail companies to provide company specific aggregates as reports to the fund.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some examples, a fund manager may use the reports to better manage the fund.

If a user leaves the fund, the user may receive back their accrued capital. If the fund hits below a performance threshold (e.g., the capital left is 80% of a nominal total invested amount), the user may be paid back a proportional fraction of their initial capital invested.
