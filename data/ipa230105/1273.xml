For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 11-114112 discloses a putter head in which a front portion provided with a face surface for hitting a ball and including a shaft attachment portion and a rear portion behind the face surface are bonded to form a head body, the front portion is formed by cutting an ingot, and the rear portion is formed by casting.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, a technique has also been proposed in which, by making a front half body and a rear half body replaceable, the putter characteristics can be adjusted according to the physical condition on the playing day, the type and situation of the turf of the putting green, and the like. For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2009-297210 discloses a putter head including a front half body having a shaft attachment portion and a front surface serving as a face surface, a rear half body detachably attached to the rear side of the front half body, and an insert made of rubber or a synthetic resin and disposed between the front half body and the rear half body, in which the insert includes a first insert having a flat plate shape and a second insert that is integral with or separate from the first insert, has a smaller area than the first insert, and is disposed on the front surface side of the first insert, and a recess portion into which the second insert is fitted is provided on the rear surface of the front half body.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 11-114112 A</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Patent Literature 2: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2009-297210 A</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, in the putter head disclosed in Patent Literature 1, it is intended to closely attach the insert between the front member and the rear member without a gap, and there is a problem that it is difficult to perform customization according to required performance in the first place.

In addition, by reducing the specific gravity of the intermediate member, it is possible to suppress an increase in the overall weight of the head even when the size is increased, and therefore it is possible to maintain the overall balance of the head and to increase the moment of inertia by arranging members having large specific gravity in the front and the rear.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the results of the velocity, the angular velocity, and the spin amount for each embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>4</b></figref> (in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, both WIDE and WIDE <b>360</b> are included) are illustrated separately for 0.03 s after impact and for 0.01 s after first bound. Measurement is performed three times for each embodiment, and the results are illustrated taken together with the average value. Here, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, as described above, the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is illustrated as corresponding to STD, the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is illustrated as corresponding to MID, and the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is illustrated as corresponding to WIDE and WIDE <b>360</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">First, the test results of STD and MID are compared. As illustrated, in STD, the average velocity is 2.19 m/s and the average angular velocity is &#x2212;180 deg/s at impact, and the average velocity is 2.12 m/s and the average angular velocity is 713 deg/s at the first bound, whereas in MID, the average velocity is 2.27 m/s and the average angular velocity is &#x2212;181 deg/s at impact, and the average velocity is 2.22 m/s and the average angular velocity is 664 deg/s at the first bound.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In addition, as illustrated, in STD, the average spin amount at impact is &#x2212;30.0 rpm and the average spin amount at the first bound is 118.9 rpm, whereas in MID, the average spin amount at impact is 30.1 rpm and the average spin amount at the first bound is 110.7 rpm.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">From these results, it can be seen that STD has a smaller depth of the center of gravity and a smaller moment of inertia (MOI) than MID, and thus STD is suitable for a player who has a smaller swing stroke and adjusts a sense of distance by a tempo or a stroke feeling to control directivity or a distance by himself/herself according to the sense. In addition, it can be seen that STD has a feature that too much rolling does not happen as compared with MID even when a strong impact is made with a short stroke. In contrast, it can be seen that MID is suitable for a player who has a large swing stroke and who adjusts a sense of distance by a tempo or a swing width to swing more stably.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Next, the test results of WIDE and MID are compared. As illustrated, in WIDE, the average velocity is 2.41 m/s and the average angular velocity is &#x2212;180.6 deg/s at impact, and the average velocity is 2.27 m/s and the average angular velocity is 548 deg/s at the first bound, whereas in MID, the average velocity is 2.27 m/s and the average angular velocity is &#x2212;181 deg/s at impact, and the average velocity is 2.22 m/s and the average angular velocity is 664 deg/s at the first bound.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In addition, as illustrated, in WIDE, the average spin amount at impact is &#x2212;30.1 rpm and the average spin amount at the first bound is 91.3 rpm, whereas in MID, the average spin amount at impact is 30.1 rpm and the average spin amount at the first bound is 110.7 rpm.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">From these, it can be seen that, in WIDE, as compared with MID, the depth of the center of gravity is larger, the moment of inertia (MOI) is larger, and when the value of the moment of inertia (MOI) is larger, although it is more difficult for the player to adjust the directivity and the sense of distance, the stability of stroke and impact is further improved.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Next, the test results of WIDE and WIDE <b>360</b> are compared. As illustrated, in WIDE, the average velocity is 2.41 m/s and the average angular velocity is &#x2212;180.6 deg/s at impact, and the average velocity is 2.27 m/s and the average angular velocity is 548 deg/s at the first bound, whereas in WIDE <b>360</b>, the average velocity is 2.26 m/s and the average angular velocity is &#x2212;121 deg/s at impact, and the average velocity is 2.22 m/s and the average angular velocity is 412 deg/s at the first bound.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In addition, as illustrated, in WIDE, the average spin amount at impact is &#x2212;30.1 rpm and the average spin amount at the first bound is 91.3 rpm, whereas in WIDE <b>360</b>, the average spin amount at impact is &#x2212;20.13 rpm and the average spin amount at the first bound is 68.6 rpm.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">From these, it can be seen that, in WIDE, as compared with WIDE <b>360</b> that is lightweight and whose weight is approximately equal to that of STD, the depth of the center of gravity is larger, the moment of inertia (MOI) is larger, and when the value of the moment of inertia (MOI) is larger, although it is more difficult for the player to adjust the directivity and the sense of distance, the stability of stroke and impact is further improved. In addition, the appearance of WIDE <b>360</b> is the same as that of WIDE, but performance close to MID overall can be exhibited, and selection according to the preference of the player can be performed.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Furthermore, a modification example of the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> to <b>9</b></figref> as to what embodiments are conceivable as different intermediate members <b>30</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a perspective view schematically illustrating a configuration of the putter head <b>1</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.
