The melt-blown webs of the invention are made out of a polypropylene composition with specified melting temperature and molecular weight distribution. The present invention is also related to the process to produce said filtration media.</p><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A melt-blown web, being a non-woven structure consisting of melt-blown fibers, is typically made in a one-step process in which high-velocity air blows a molten thermoplastic resin from an extruder die tip onto a conveyor or take-up screen to form fine fibered self-bonding web. Although many types of polymers can be employed for melt-blown fibers and fabrics, polypropylene is one of the most commonly used polymers.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Melt-blown webs are widely used in hygiene and filtration industry, for which the key properties are the barrier properties, meaning hydrohead (water/liquid barrier) and filtration efficiency (with particles).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Web quality is controlled by many factors such as the uniformity of the fiber distribution in the air stream and adjustment of other manufacturing variables such as processing temperature. Another factor controlling fabric quality is the properties of the polypropylene. Several defects can result from a poor selection of polymer physical properties such as roping, fly, and shot. Shots are pinpoint-sized polypropylene beads in the fabric that affect porosity, uniformity, and hand (texture) of the fabric, and are a principle cause of off-quality fabric. The presence of shots decreases the hydrohead of the web, which is an indirect measure of the porosity and proportional to the liquid barrier of the fabric. The processing temperature is one factor in the final fabric properties. The &#x201c;optimum&#x201d; processing temperature is one at which ideal properties of the fabric are achieved such as low shot with good hand and high barrier properties, or good filtration properties.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The processability of polypropylene is crucial in the production of melt-blown webs. The molecular weight distribution (MWD) of the polymer significantly determines the properties and the performance in processing, this characteristic must be controlled. Control of MWD of the PP in conventional reactors is difficult because it requires the addition of chain terminators and chain transfer agents. These operations decrease output of the reactor and are often uneconomical. Therefore, as an alternative, this control is accomplished via a post-reactor operation that is commonly known as degradation of polypropylene (PP).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The degradation of PP is a well-known procedure in polymer processing engineering and the plastics industry. Its importance is based on the fact that by thermally decomposing and, as a result, reducing the length of the carbon chain of the PP, one can obtain different products with controlled rheological properties. Because of that, these products are referred to as Controlled-Rheology Polypropylenes (CR-PP).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In general, it has been concluded that CR-PP resins have lower molecular weight, narrower MWD and reduced viscosity.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The process of degradation needs what is called a &#x201c;radical initiator&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">This is a chemical substance which&#x2014;under particular circumstances&#x2014;will promote the formation of free radicals inducing chain degradation. Especially for the PP resins, peroxides have dominated as free radical initiators; CR-PP resins have been produced industrially for years using reactive extrusion processes, which employ peroxides as free radical initiators. But also the use of hydroxylamine esters as other source of free radicals is known since some years.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">WO 97/49737 describes a process for reducing the molecular weight of polymers at temperatures above 280&#xb0; C. using so-called NOR-HALS (HALS: Hindered Amino Light Stabilizers) compounds containing the group:</p><p id="p-0012" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="23.45mm" wi="28.70mm" file="US20230001340A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0013" num="0011">wherein G is hydrogen or methyl and G<sub>1 </sub>and G<sub>2 </sub>are each hydrogen, methyl or are together oxo.

For example, avoidance of shots and improved hydrohead (water barrier) of these systems are desired.

The particulate support material used is preferably an organic or inorganic material, such as silica, alumina or zirconia or a mixed oxide such as silica-alumina, in particular silica, alumina or silica-alumina. The use of a silica support is preferred. The skilled man is aware of the procedures required to support a metallocene catalyst.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0170">Especially preferably, the support is a porous material so that the complex may be loaded into the pores of the support, e.g. using a process analogous to those described in WO94/14856, WO95/12622 and WO2006/097497.

Thus, no external support material, such as inert organic or inorganic carrier, for example silica as described above is employed.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0173">In order to provide the catalyst of the invention in solid form but without using an external carrier, it is preferred if a liquid/liquid emulsion system is used. The process involves forming dispersing catalyst components (i) and (ii) in a solvent, and solidifying said dispersed droplets to form solid particles.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0174">In particular, the method involves preparing a solution of one or more catalyst components; dispersing said solution in an solvent to form an emulsion in which said one or more catalyst components are present in the droplets of the dispersed phase; immobilizing the catalyst components in the dispersed droplets, in the absence of an external particulate porous support, to form solid particles comprising the said catalyst, and optionally recovering said particles.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0175">This process enables the manufacture of active catalyst particles with improved morphology, e.g. with a predetermined spherical shape, surface properties and particle size and without using any added external porous support material, such as an inorganic oxide, e.g. silica. By the term &#x201c;preparing a solution of one or more catalyst components&#x201d; is meant that the catalyst forming compounds may be combined in one solution which is dispersed to the immiscible solvent, or, alternatively, at least two separate catalyst solutions for each part of the catalyst forming compounds may be prepared, which are then dispersed successively to the solvent.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0176">Full disclosure of the necessary process can be found in WO03/051934, which is herein incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0177">The invention is also industrially advantageous, since it enables the preparation of the solid particles to be carried out as a one-pot procedure.

These leached catalyst components are very active possibly causing problems during polymerization. Therefore, the amount of leached components should be minimized, i.e. all catalyst components should be kept in heterogeneous form.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0180">Furthermore, the self-supported catalysts generate, due to the high amount of catalytically active species in the catalyst system, high temperatures at the beginning of the polymerization which may cause melting of the product material. Both effects, i.e. the partial dissolving of the catalyst system and the heat generation, might cause fouling, sheeting and deterioration of the polymer material morphology.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0181">In order to minimize the possible problems associated with high activity or leaching, it is possible to &#x201c;off line prepolymerize&#x201d; the catalyst before using it in polymerization process.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0182">It has to be noted that off line prepolymerization in this regard is part of the catalyst preparation process, being a step carried out after a solid catalyst is formed.

The visbreaking of polypropylene involves several steps including the decomposition of the initiator at the elevated temperature which forms free radicals. The free radicals may abstract the hydrogen atom from polypropylene chain (H-abstraction) hydrogen atom from polypropylene chain (H-abstraction). The tertiary radicals of polypropylene are therefore not stable and goes to the &#x3b2;-scission reaction, which cuts the chain and reduces the molecular weight (or viscosity) of the polypropylene. Haiping Xing et al., Polymer 55 (2014) 5435-5444 has investigated the mechanism of visbreaking and suggested detecting method of the visbroken polymer. As a consequence of &#x3b2;-scission reaction, unsaturation (carbon-carbon double bond) forms as end group of the new polymer molecules. This type of structure can be detected by different methods, e.g. <sup>1</sup>H NMR. On <sup>1</sup>H NMR the chemical shits at 4.72 and 4.78 ppm can correspond to the vinylidene terminated PP chains due to the &#x3b2;-scission of tertiary PP macroradicals. Furthermore, during the visbreaking process, the side reaction could happen, one of the major side reaction of tertiary PP macroradicals is disproportion termination of PP macroradicals, leading to the formation of interval vinylidene bonds, this can be detected by the <sup>1</sup>H NMR with a signal at 4.85 ppm.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0198">Preferred mixing devices suited for visbreaking are known to an art skilled person and can be selected inter alia from discontinuous and continuous kneaders, twin screw extruders and single screw extruders with special mixing sections and co-kneaders and the like.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0199">Preferably, the visbreaking step is performed with any one or more visbreaking agents selected from peroxide, hydroxylamine ester and sulphur compound as source of free radicals or by purely thermal degradation.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0200">Typical peroxide visbreaking agents are 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-bis(tert.butyl-peroxy)hexane (DHBP) (for instance sold under the tradenames Luperox 101 and Trigonox 101), 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-bis(tert.butyl-peroxy)hexyne-3 (DYBP) (for instance sold under the tradenames Luperox 130 and Trigonox 145), dicumyl-peroxide (DCUP) (for instance sold under the tradenames Luperox DC and Perkadox BC), di-tert.butyl-peroxide (DTBP) (for instance sold under the tradenames Trigonox B and Luperox Di), tert.-butyl-cumyl-peroxide (BCUP) (for instance sold under the tradenames Trigonox T and Luperox 801) and bis(tert.butylperoxy-isopropyl)benzene (DIPP) (for instance sold under the tradenames Perkadox 14S and Luperox DC).</p><p id="p-0163" num="0201">Preferred peroxides are 5-dimethyl-2,5-bis(tert.butyl-peroxy)hexane (DHBP) and tert.-butyl-cumyl-peroxide (BCUP)</p><p id="p-0164" num="0202">It is within the scope of the present invention to use either one specific peroxide or mixtures of different peroxides.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0203">The peroxide may be part of a masterbatch.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0204">In the sense of the present invention, &#x201c;masterbatch&#x201d; means a concentrated premix of a propylene polymer with a free radical forming agent (peroxide).</p><p id="p-0167" num="0205">The peroxide compound may preferably be contained in the peroxide masterbatch composition in a range of from 1 to 50 wt %, like from 5 to 40 wt %, based on the total composition of the masterbatch.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0206">Preferably the visbreaking step is performed with a hydroxylamine ester or a sulphur compound as source of free radicals (visbreaking agent), more preferably the visbreaking step is performed with a hydroxylamine ester as source of free radicals (visbreaking agent).</p><p id="p-0169" num="0207">Suitable visbreaking agent selected from the group of hydroxylamine esters are known in the state of the art, for example as described in WO 2007/126994, where it is stated that any hydroxylamine ester known in the art for reducing the molecular weight of or viscosity breaking, polyolefin compounds, particularly propylene polymers can be used.
