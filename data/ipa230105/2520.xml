THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a preparation process of a solid acrylic resin and more particularly to a preparation process of a solid acrylic resin suitable for use in a UV curing system, it belongs to the technical field of preparation of functional materials.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In recent years, with the rise of environmental awareness and in response to various environmental protection policies introduced in China, the industrial sector has experienced tremendous changes. As one of the most affected, the chemical industry is faced with new challenges in this new era. Since the UV curing technology is an environment-friendly and low-VOC emission technology, and the use of UV curing in film formation provides a wide variety of advantages including high efficiency, energy savings, environmental friendliness, economy and excellent adaptability, the UV curing technique has become the main development and one of the research hotspots.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">And because an acrylic resin has the advantages of good gloss and color retention, weather resistance, fast drying, convenient construction, easy coating, recoating and rework, etc., the acrylic resin is usually added to a UV curing system in the prior art, in order to adjust the composition's viscosity, reduce its shrinkage, lower its cost, increase its initial adhesion, accelerate its surface drying, enhance its interlayer adhesion, or for other purposes. However, the acrylic resins currently used in UV curing systems are mainly saturated resins, which cannot undergo further cross-linking reaction during the process of photo-curing film formation. They are only used as inert additives/auxiliaries in UV curing systems. This combination of physical coating affects the physical and chemical properties of the coating film, such as coating hardness, adhesion to the substrate, alcohol resistance and corrosion resistance, and thus the application scope of the acrylic resin is limited.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, with the increasing environmental protection requirements, more and more coating material manufacturers desire to increase solid contents of their solvent-based coating material products. However, using the existing acrylic resin to increase the solid content will encounter the following two problems: it is difficult to continue to dissolve under high solid content; and under high solid content, the viscosity of the coating is too large, so that the product cannot be normally coated. Therefore, the acrylic resin with high solid content and low viscosity properties has also become an ideal product for craving in the field of UV curing application.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Also, the current solid acrylic resins for coatings and inks are mainly produced by suspension polymerization. Due to the self-acceleration effect of bulk polymerization in the middle and late stages of polymerization, it is easy to cause problems such as explosive polymerization and difficult control of polymerization temperature, so that the obtained solid acrylic resin can easily lead to too wide molecular weight distribution, large molecular weight distribution coefficient, and too many residual monomers. If such solid acrylic resin is used to prepare coatings or inks, it is easy to cause defects in the produced coatings or inks, such as poor storage stability, easy precipitation, delamination and floating during storage, a considerable odor, weak adhesion to a substrate and frequent bubbling, peeling, discoloration, shrinkage and other defects. However, as well known in the art, a suspension polymerization process has the problem of wastewater treatment, so it can't meet the current environmental protection requirements; additionally, the suspension polymerization requires the addition of a polymerization inhibitor at the late stage to terminate the reaction, which necessitates strict requirements on process control and leads to unsatisfactory product quality consistency and a high defect rate. In contrast, the bulk polymerization method only needs to add monomers, initiators and molecular weight regulators, it doesn't require solvents so that no waste water is generated. Since bulk polymerization has many advantages such as environmental friendliness, high production efficiency, low production cost, pure product, uniform product color and good product quality consistency, bulk polymerization has now become a polymerization process encouraged by today's industrialization.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, how to realize the industrial production of solid acrylic resins with narrow molecular weight distribution, low residual monomers and excellent comprehensive properties by bulk polymerization has also become one of the current hot research issues in this field.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of the problems and demands in the prior art discussed above, it is an object of the present invention to provide a preparation process of a solid acrylic resin suitable for use in a UV curing system.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">To achieve the above object, the subject matter of the present invention is as follows:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A preparation process of a solid acrylic resin suitable for use in a UV curing system, which is a bulk polymerization method and comprises the steps:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">adding 100 parts by mass of at least one monofunctional monomer(s) having one polymerizable double bond per molecule, 1-10 parts by mass of one difunctional monomer having two polymerizable double bonds per molecule, 0.1-5.0 parts by mass of an initiator and 1-10 parts by mass of a chain transfer agent to a bulk polymerization reactor capable of water bath heating;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">homogenizing them by stirring;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">and then heating the bulk polymerization reactor with a constant temperature water bath at 40-90&#xb0;
