Thus, in one or more embodiments, electrical connections may serve as mechanical connections from the paddles to the artificial muscle actuators. In these embodiments, the artificial muscle actuators <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> are not rigidly held in a diagonal position, but rather are flexible. Also, each artificial muscle actuator <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> is connected to both paddles <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, which is necessary to facilitate the desired motion. Further, when one of artificial muscle actuators <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> is activated to close the hinge, the hinge may close without the artificial muscle actuators <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> colliding with each other and hindering the motion.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In these embodiments, the contacts <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> may be electrical, and addition physical contacts may be provided between the artificial muscle actuators <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> and the paddles <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>.

However, the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may provide more torque during actuation. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the configuration may be selected or modified depending on the specific application.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The embodiments disclosed above and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> may be used for any hinge-type actuation. For example, self-opening and closing hatches, doors, laptops, lids, books, origami, and the like. For example, a possible device may be a simple box that can be configured to automatically unfold and refold with the application of electric current. The configurations presented herein would be resistant to actuating with changes in ambient temperature because the two muscle actuators would oppose each other's movement.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Embodiments disclosed herein also include smooth reversal of actuation. For example, one or more embodiments of artificial muscle actuator device may be configured to rotate a paddle in an arc, reverse direction and then rotate in the opposite direction. In some applications, if sensitive devices are mounted onto the paddle, it may be desirable that a stop of the actuation and a reversal of direction be made as smoothly as possible. In these embodiments, the applied currents are decreased slowly for a few steps, stopped, and then ramped up in the reverse direction equally slowly. As such, for example, the actuation of a paddle with a mounted device may come to a smooth stop and reverse direction with no jerking behavior.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one or more embodiments, an artificial muscle actuator may be a linear displacement, or button-type, device. In one or more embodiments, a linear displacement device may exhibit spring-like behavior, but yet can still be controlled electrically. The artificial muscle actuators suspending the linear displacement device are capable of providing the elastic ability similar to a spring, while still being controllable using electronics. If spring-like motion is not desired, then the linear displacement device may be configured to have one or more latching mechanisms, for example, mechanical or magnetic latches, that hold the linear displacement device in position. The latching mechanisms may be desired to prevent the linear displacement device from moving slightly. A predetermined amount of force may then be required to displace the linear displacement device from a latched position. The spring-like behavior of the artificial muscle actuators would return the linear displacement device to the stable latched position when the external force is removed. In one or more embodiments, there may be two or more stable positions for the artificial muscle actuators with latching mechanisms. The artificial muscle actuators may also be electrically activated to displace the displacement device into or out of one or more of these stable positions.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The latching mechanisms may be utilized fully with either linear or rotational artificial muscle actuators and may be combined with the use of bi-stable artificial muscle actuators if desired. A bi-stable artificial muscle actuator is one which may not require a continuous supply of energy to remain actuated. A bi-stable artificial muscle actuator can maintain its position without the need for external latches, gears, magnets or the constant application of current to produce heat. Bi-stable artificial muscle actuators may be used in combination with the latches, gears and magnets, to produce a more robust design.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one or more embodiments, a linear displacement device providing linear displacement comprises a rotational artificial muscle actuator. A rotational artificial muscle actuator, also referred to as a torsional artificial muscle actuator, is one that twists (or untwists) upon actuation. These rotational artificial muscle actuators may have an attached piece, or arm, that converts the rotational motion of the artificial muscle actuators into linear motion for a body.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Among the advantages of the linear displacement device are the low cost of materials, a simple design, and the ability to replace springs with a device that allows for control and does not require the device to return to a specific position when not activated. In addition, the linear displacement device may be actively or passively thermally controlled. An example of passive thermal control may be actuation based on ambient temperature. Active control may include activation of the artificial muscle actuator using electrical current. Further, the materials comprising the linear displacement device may be selected to provide necessary resistance to heat, corrosion, and the like.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in one or more embodiments, the linear displacement device <b>300</b> may comprise at least one artificial muscle actuator <b>306</b> (shown in end view) designed to rotate with application of heat. The heat may be provided by passive or active thermal control. Passive thermal control may be a direct response to the ambient temperature. In one or more embodiments, active thermal control is provided through electrical current passing through a wire (not shown) wound around the artificial muscle fiber. Attached to the artificial muscle actuator is a means to convert the rotational motion of the muscle actuator into the linear motion of the linear displacement device. The means may include a gear system attached to the artificial muscle actuator <b>306</b>. This may comprise a simple arm <b>330</b> attached to the artificial muscle actuator. In one or more embodiments, the arm <b>330</b> may be a straight piece. The arm <b>330</b> may be attached at or near the midpoint of the length of the artificial muscle actuator <b>306</b>. When the artificial muscle actuator <b>306</b> is rotated, the arm <b>330</b> rotates with it. In other words, the arm <b>330</b> rotates in concert with the rotational artificial muscle actuator <b>306</b>. A body <b>334</b> may be positioned on the surface of the arm <b>330</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one or more embodiments, the arm <b>330</b> includes a channel <b>332</b> in which body <b>334</b> may be constrained to move. Further, a stationary channel <b>346</b> may also be provided to constrain, or restrict, the motion of body <b>334</b> to be linear along the direction of stationary channel <b>346</b>. In one or more embodiments, stationary channel <b>346</b> may be simply another surface while another force, for example gravity, provides a constraint to keep body <b>334</b> in contact with stationary channel <b>346</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">When the rotational artificial muscle actuator <b>306</b> is rotated the arm <b>330</b> will exert a rotational force on the body <b>334</b>. Either the connection between the body <b>334</b> and the arm <b>330</b> or the body <b>334</b> itself should be configured so that the body <b>334</b> may be displaced only in a linear direction.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one or more embodiments, a rack and pinion system may be used to translate rotational motion into linear displacement.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one or more embodiments, the linear displacement device <b>300</b> comprises two artificial muscle actuators, each having an arm operating so that both artificial muscle actuators produce linear displacement simultaneously.

Latching mechanisms may be mechanical, magnetic, or any other suitable method for fixing the position of the linear displacement device.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In one or more embodiments, the arms may be designed to open and close valves, in a gate fashion. In one or more embodiments, the arm described above may comprise a paddle. Two or more artificial muscle actuators with said paddles attached may then be configured so that their paddles meet precisely, sealing a valve. With the application of heat, either passively or actively, the artificial muscle actuators may rotate and open the valves. The valves may be configured to open in the same direction, or they may each open in opposite directions. They may also be configured to operate independently of each other. Furthermore, the artificial muscle actuators with paddles attached may be laid out end to end, so a large span may be controlled by many of these artificial muscle actuators. This approach may provide for better control over fluid flow in a pipe, tube, or similar object, with many small apertures opening rather than a few large apertures. This arrangement of artificial muscle actuators with paddles may prevent non-uniform fluid flow.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in one or more embodiments, linear actuating muscle actuators <b>406</b>, <b>408</b> may be used in a linear displacement device <b>400</b>. In one or more embodiments using linear actuating muscle actuators, one homochiral <b>406</b> and one heterochiral <b>408</b> muscle actuator may be placed directly beside each other. A homochiral muscle actuator <b>406</b> is one that contracts linearly when heated, the direction of twist being the same as the direction of coiling. In contrast, a heterochiral muscle actuator <b>408</b> expands linearly when heated; the direction of twist being the opposite from the direction of coiling.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The linear displacement device <b>400</b> may be used to expose a body <b>434</b> from an otherwise flush surface. Similarly, the linear displacement device <b>400</b> may be used to hide a body <b>434</b> that extends from a flush surface. Upon the application of force the body <b>434</b> will return to its position like a spring, yet can still be controlled as if connected to a motor. In one or more embodiments, a linear displacement device may be used as a camera lens extender, a Braille e-reader, texture control (e.g., an array of pins), changing surface roughness, and automatic suction cups.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">To move this linear displacement device <b>400</b> from the down position into the up position, the heterochiral muscle actuator <b>408</b> is activated causing the muscle actuator <b>408</b> to expand, pushing the linear displacement device <b>400</b> to the extended position. In one or more embodiments, a latching mechanism <b>448</b> is used to maintain the position of the linear displacement device <b>400</b> in the extended state. In order to retract the linear displacement device <b>400</b> into its retracted state the homochiral muscle actuator <b>406</b> is activated, which contracts and pulls the linear displacement device <b>400</b> into its retracted state.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one or more embodiments, the homochiral muscle actuator <b>406</b> may be replaced by any actuator which retracts lengthwise.

The module <b>500</b> may comprise a piston <b>550</b> in a housing <b>554</b>. The housing face opposite the piston <b>550</b> may comprise a copper ground <b>552</b> for artificial muscle actuators <b>506</b>, <b>507</b>, and <b>508</b>. Artificial muscle actuators <b>506</b>, <b>507</b>, <b>508</b> may attach at one end to the housing at the copper ground and to the piston at the other end. In one or more embodiments, the piston module <b>500</b> comprises at least one puller artificial muscle actuator <b>506</b>, <b>507</b>. The puller artificial muscle actuator <b>506</b>, <b>507</b> may be used to pull piston <b>550</b> toward the copper ground <b>552</b>. The puller artificial muscle actuator <b>506</b>, <b>507</b> may be a homochiral muscle actuator. The piston module <b>500</b> may also comprise a pusher artificial muscle actuator <b>508</b>. The pusher artificial muscle actuator <b>508</b> may be used to push the piston <b>550</b> away from the copper ground <b>552</b>. The pusher artificial muscle actuator <b>508</b> may be a heterochiral muscle actuator. The artificial muscle actuators <b>506</b>, <b>507</b>, <b>508</b> may be actuated individually or in various combinations. Actuation may be by electrical current or by other actuation means as disclosed herein. In one or more embodiments, piston module <b>500</b> may comprise a high-temperature material for non-actuator and non-metallic parts. This material may be, for example, Teflon.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, in one or more embodiments, a single linear actuating muscle actuator may be used in a linear displacement device <b>600</b>. A pin <b>668</b> may be secured into the center of the artificial muscle actuator <b>606</b>. The actuating muscle actuator <b>606</b> may be considered divided into two segments by the pin <b>668</b>. One end of the first segment <b>670</b> may be attached to the center pin. The other end of the first segment may be attached to the body <b>634</b> that one desires to displace. The first segment <b>670</b> may be activated by passing electric current through it. The electric current may cause the artificial muscle actuator <b>606</b> to expand, lifting the body <b>634</b> into its extended state. A side effect is that the second segment <b>672</b> will up-twist and contract. Up-twist means that the fiber in the coiled segment being compressed is receiving twist from the coil. Up-twist may be the result of compressing a homochiral coil. Once the body <b>634</b> has reached its desired extended position, then it may be held there by latches or other latching mechanisms <b>648</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">To retract the body <b>634</b> into its retracted state the second artificial muscle actuator segment <b>672</b> is activated causing it to extend and up-twist the first segment <b>670</b>. The up-twisting causes the first segment <b>670</b> to contract forcing the body <b>634</b> into the retracted position.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The linear displacement device may be made to operate in many ways. The artificial muscle actuators, in any configuration, may be used to place the linear displacement device in the extended position. An electric current may be used to heat and actuate the muscle actuators causing linear motion of the body. The device may then have a series of latches or magnets which hold the device in the extended position without requiring that the artificial muscle actuators be continuously heated. Upon the application of sufficient external force, the latching mechanism may be overcome and the linear displacement device may be positioned in its retracted position. If desirable the device may be maintained in its retracted position using a latching mechanism or through muscle actuation. Alternatively, the linear displacement device may be configured to return the device to its extended position through muscle actuation.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In one or more embodiments, the artificial muscle actuator may be operated bi-stable mode so that it automatically returns to the extended position. In this case the latching mechanism on the extended position can be used to simply prevent small oscillations in the muscle actuator and to provide a threshold amount of force necessary to cause the linear displacement device to displace. In this way the artificial muscle actuator may passively act as a spring, returning the linear displacement device to its original state and can be actively actuated.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In one or more embodiments, the artificial muscle actuators may be designed to operate as bi-stable polymer actuators. This would enable the artificial muscle actuators to maintain their position without the need for external latches, gears, magnets or the constant application of current to produce heat. In one or more embodiments, the bi-stable artificial muscle actuators may be used in combination with the latches, gears, and magnets, to produce a more robust design.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, one or more embodiments of the invention are directed to a mechanical accumulator <b>700</b>, or catapult, that utilizes an artificial muscle actuator <b>706</b>. In one or more embodiments, the artificial muscle actuator <b>706</b> may comprise a plurality of artificial muscle actuators <b>706</b>, <b>708</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In these embodiments, an artificial muscle actuator <b>706</b>, <b>708</b> may be used in conjunction with a latching mechanism <b>748</b>. The latching mechanism <b>748</b> is designed to prevent the artificial muscle actuator <b>706</b>, <b>708</b> from causing movement when the artificial muscle actuator is first activated. Possible latching mechanisms include magnets, mechanical latches, and other artificial muscle actuators among others. Any means to hold the muscle actuators at a particular position, until the muscle actuator can generate sufficient force to break free of the latching mechanism may be used. Another artificial muscle actuator can be used as latching mechanism <b>748</b> to hold the position of artificial muscle actuator <b>706</b>, <b>708</b> while torque is generated in accordance with embodiments disclosed herein. The latching mechanism artificial muscle actuator may be caused to release allowing the torque generating artificial muscle actuator <b>706</b>, <b>708</b> to overcome it and rapidly actuate.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">An advantage of using an artificial muscle actuator as a latching mechanism is it allows for user control over the exact tension required to actuate to be done by using software at the local level. Thus, the predetermined amount of force required to overcome the latching mechanism artificial muscle actuator may be varied by a user. A single product may be produced with the user programming the linear displacement device to release at specific tension. An actuating means causes the artificial muscle actuator, or fiber, to initially accumulate energy. When the accumulated energy is sufficient to overcome the latching mechanism <b>748</b>, the latching mechanism suddenly releases resulting in a forceful actuation. In one or more embodiments, a bundle of artificial muscle fibers may be used because of the increased torque produced by a bundle of artificial muscle fibers in comparison to a single artificial muscle actuator of comparable dimensions. However, embodiments disclosed herein are not limited as such.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Examples of the actuating means include, but are not limited to, a heater, or electrically applying heat to the artificial muscle fibers. Examples of the latching mechanism <b>748</b> include, but are not limited to, magnets, mechanical latches, other artificial muscle actuators, or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Any means to hold the artificial muscle fibers in a particular position, until the muscle actuator can generate sufficient force to break free of the latching mechanism may be used. For example, another artificial muscle actuator may be used to hold the position of another actuator while it generates torque. In these embodiments, the holding artificial muscle actuator may be actuated to release.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In one or more embodiments of the mechanical accumulator <b>700</b>, the mechanical accumulator may include multiple latching mechanisms to grant a multitude of stable positions. For example, an artificial muscle actuator may have two stable positions to function as a valve designed to be either completely closed or completely open. In such embodiments, the artificial muscle actuator may be initially activated to generate torque and, when the latching mechanism is deactivated, the artificial muscle actuator will release and quickly transfer into another stable position. The rapid application of force in these embodiments may be beneficial to overcoming any resistance in such a valve, for example by a fluid flowing through the valve. The rapid application of force may also prevent the valve from being in an intermediate state between open and closed.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Electrical current is used to heat the artificial muscle actuator, either an individual fiber or a plurality of fibers in a bundle, which is held steady by a latching mechanism. While the muscle actuators are being heated, they generate internal stresses which would normally be relieved by the rotational motion of the artificial muscle actuators, but the latching mechanism prevents rotation, forcing the energy to accumulate within the muscle actuator. When the internal tension is sufficiently strong, it will overcome the resistance of the latching mechanism and the muscle actuator will actuate rapidly and forcefully.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">As always with artificial muscle actuators, they may be actively powered using electrical current or they may be passively powered from environmental temperature conditions.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Further, without having the benefit of a latching mechanism to accumulate tension, a similar rapid actuation may be achieved. A large current applied very quickly to a thick artificial muscle actuator may to generate rapid actuation. Such large currents applied so quickly require a capacitor and conductors which can withstand said large currents. Both the capacitor and the more durable conductor, for example a thicker gauge wire, may increase manufacturing complexity and cost.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The mechanical accumulator may effectively diminish the need for large currents applied quickly and prevent the commensurate strain on supporting electrical systems and the artificial muscle actuator itself.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Although the disclosure has been described with respect to only a limited number of embodiments, those skilled in the art, having benefit of this disclosure, will appreciate that various other embodiments may be devised without departing from the scope of the present invention.
