Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to LED drive circuits, and more particularly to a noise reduction circuit for a matrix LED driver.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of the Prior Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Recently, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have been extensively used for various applications like LED lamps due to its advantages in terms of, for example, power efficiency, sustainability, impact resistance, anti-lightning ability, and service life. One noticeable issue to be address coining along with the popularity of LED-based devices is how to drive LEDs effectively and efficiently. As known, LED drivers are typically used to drive LED-based devices like LED lamps.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order to relax the requirements for leads of LED drivers in LED lamps, a matrix LED driver LD as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> has been developed for driving an LED array LA. The matrix LED driver LD has a plurality of matrix switches S and a plurality of current channels L. Each of the matrix switches S of the matrix LED driver LD controls whether LED lamps D in a row of the LED array LA are on or off. Each of the current channels L in the matrix LED driver LD is connected to a respective row of LED lamps D in the LED array LA. Therein, the matrix switches S of the matrix LED driver LD are turned on sequentially during one cycle of its scan clock. When the cycle length of the scan clock is short enough, the LED lamps D of the matrix LED array LA look like being turned on simultaneously to human eyes. For controlling the illumination of the LED lamps D, each of the current channels L generates a PWM current signal for the corresponding LED lamp D to accordingly modulate its own illumination. The PWM current signal has a frequency higher than the frequency of the scan clock. Since the PWM current signals of different current channels L may be different in terms of duty ratio, the total working circuit of the matrix LED array LA can vary during the period when each of the matrix switches S is on, so that the total current of the matrix LED array LA shows abrupt change during every cycle of the scan clock. In addition, as the matrix switches S of the matrix LED driver LD are turned on periodically, such abruptness is periodically seen in the total current of the matrix LED array. The periodic, abrupt change of the total current of the matrix LED array LA in turn leads to periodic jitter in the voltage of the power supply to the matrix LED driver LD, resulting in supply jitter-induced noise reoccurring at a fixed frequency. Generally, the frequency of the supply jitter-induced noise is lower than the frequency of the PWM current signal, and the supply jitter-induced noise can cause electromagnetic interference and even noise hearable to human ears, which is averse to comfort of users of the matrix LED driver LD.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One objective of the present invention is to provide a noise reduction circuit for a matrix LED driver, which prevents supply jitter-induced noise from occurring periodically, thereby reducing energy of supply jitter-induced noise.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to achieve the foregoing objective, the present invention provides the following solution:</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A noise reduction circuit for a matrix LED driver comprises a pseudo random number generator, an up counter, a clock module, and N matrix switch controllers, where N is a decimal integer greater than or equal to two.

The up counter adds one to the random power-on number and outputs a resulting value every time the cycle length of the count clock elapses. In a said cycle of the scan clock, where a decimal numerical value of the random power-on number is equal to N, the up counter calibrates the random power-on number to zero and outputs the calibrated random power-on number, wherein the random power-on number is a binary integer and has the decimal numerical value set to be ranging [0, N&#x2212;1].

The pseudo random number generator generates a working random number for the up counter during every cycle of the scan clock. The up counter receives the working random number between the start time and the storage time of a cycle of the scan clock and outputs the working random number as a random power-on number. Therein, the length between the start time and the storage time of a said cycle of the scan clock is smaller than the cycle length of the count clock. The up counter adds one to the random power-on number and outputs a resulting value every time the cycle length of the count clock elapses. In a cycle of the scan clock, where the decimal numerical value of the random power-on number is equal to N, the up counter calibrating the random power-on number to zero and outputting the calibrated random power-on number. In this way, across different cycles of the scan clock, the up counter outputs the random power-on numbers in a randomly changing sequence. Since every matrix switch controller only outputs the matrix switch power-on signal when the random power-on number it receives at its second input port is identical to the criterion numeral input to its first input port, the present invention allows the matrix switch controllers to output matrix switch power-on signals in a randomly changing sequence throughout cycles of the scan clock.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In use of the present invention, the individual matrix switch controllers are configured to control whether the individual matrix switches of the matrix LED driver are on, respectively. When one of the matrix switch controllers outputs a matrix switch signal, the matrix switch controlled by that matrix switch controller is turned on. Since the matrix switch controller its matrix switch power-on signals at random ranking places in the randomly changing sequence for different cycles of the scan clock, the present invention allows the matrix switches to have a randomly changing power-on sequence throughout different cycles of the scan clock, thereby making the total current of the matrix LED array controlled by the matrix LED driver not have periodic abruptness, and in turn making the supply jitter-induced noise generated by the matrix LED driver not periodic. As compared to periodic supply jitter-induced noise reoccurring at a fixed frequency, non-periodic supply jitter-induced noise distributes energy across different sub-frequencies, thereby effectively reducing noise energy.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an applied diagram of a conventional matrix LED driver;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a circuit diagram of the circuit of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a circuit diagram of a pseudo random number generator in a first embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a circuit diagram of an up counter in the first embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a circuit diagram of a pseudo random number generator in a second embodiment of the present invention; and</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a circuit diagram of an up counter in the second embodiment of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">For further explaining the technical schemes of the present invention, the following description is made with reference to some specific embodiments.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the present invention discloses a noise reduction circuit for a matrix LED driver.

Further because the pseudo random number generator <b>1</b> generates a working random number for the up counter <b>2</b> in a cycle of the scan clock, the up counter <b>2</b> outputs the random power-on numbers in a sequence that changes randomly in different cycles of the scan clock. Taking a case where N=4 for instance, if the working random number the pseudo random number generator <b>1</b> outputs to the up counter <b>2</b> has a decimal numerical value of 2, the random power-on number output by the up counter <b>2</b> in a cycle of the scan clock have their decimal numerical values as 2, 3, 0, and 1 successively.

The Q end of the latch D flip-flop <b>211</b> of the k<sup>th </sup>up-count unit <b>21</b> is connected to the CLK end of the latch D flip-flop <b>211</b> of the (k+1)<sup>th </sup>up-count unit <b>21</b>, where k is a decimal integer, and k has a decimal numerical value of [1, W&#x2212;1]. The input end of the first up-count unit <b>21</b> of the up counter <b>2</b> through the input end of the W<sup>th </sup>up-count unit <b>21</b> are configured to receive the value of each order digit of the working random number from the low-order digit to the high-order digit successively. The output end of the first up-count unit <b>21</b> of the up counter <b>2</b> through the output end of the W<sup>th </sup>up-count unit <b>21</b> are configured to output the value of each order digit of the random power-on number from the low-order digit to the high-order digit successively. The calibrating unit <b>22</b> includes a calibrating comparator <b>221</b>. The calibrating comparator <b>221</b> is a numerical comparator. The calibrating number is input to the calibrating comparator <b>221</b> at its first input port. The calibrating number is a binary integer, and the calibrating number has a decimal numerical value of N. The second input port of the calibrating comparator <b>221</b> receives the random power-on number. When the random power-on number the calibrating comparator <b>221</b> receives at its second input port is identical to the calibrating number input to its first input port, the output end of the calibrating comparator <b>221</b> outputs a high-level signal.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the second embodiment of the present invention, the up counter <b>2</b> works on the principle as explained below.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">According to the second embodiment of the present invention, when the random power-on number is smaller than the calibrating number, or to say, when the decimal numerical value of the random power-on number is smaller than N, the output end of the calibrating comparator <b>221</b> outputs a low level. The level at the output end of the OR gate <b>215</b> of every up-count unit <b>21</b> depends on the level at the output end of the second AND gate <b>213</b>. In other words, the level at the SET end of the latch D flip-flop <b>211</b> of every up-count unit <b>21</b> depends on the level at the output end of the second AND gate <b>213</b> of the up-count unit <b>21</b>. In this case, the up counter <b>2</b> of the second embodiment of the present invention generates the random power-on number in the same way as the up counter <b>2</b> of the first embodiment of the present invention does.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to the second embodiment of the present invention, when the random power-on number is equal to the calibrating number, or to say, when the decimal numerical value of the random power-on number is equal to N, the output end of the calibrating comparator <b>221</b> outputs a high level. Consequently, the level at the output end of the OR gate <b>215</b> of every up-count unit <b>21</b> is high, so that the level at the SET end of the latch D flip-flop <b>211</b> of every up-count unit <b>21</b> is high. At this time, the latch D flip-flop <b>211</b> of every up-count unit <b>21</b> performs setting operation, thereby making the level at the output end of every up-count unit <b>21</b> become low. Consequently, the random power-on number is calibrated to zero.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The embodiments described as depicted are not intended to in any way limit forms and makes of possible implementations of the present invention, and people of ordinary skill in the art may perform modification and adaptation any of these without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
