Apparently, the described embodiments are merely some rather than all of the embodiments. All other embodiments obtained by a person of ordinary skill in the art based on the embodiments of the application without creative efforts shall fall within the protection scope of the application.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, an embodiment of the application provides a humidifier. The humidifier can generate at least hot mist, is provided with a mist outlet, and mainly comprises two mainly separate bodies, namely a water tank <b>1</b> and a seat <b>2</b>, wherein a main structure of the water tank <b>1</b> is a water tank for accommodating water, and the separate body further comprises other structures, such as a mist discharge pipe <b>14</b> configured to discharge mist from the inside of the humidifier to the outside of the humidifier. The seat <b>2</b> is a part for mounting and supporting the water tank <b>1</b>, which ensures that most of normally-operating components of the humidifier are disposed in the seat <b>2</b>. After the water tank <b>1</b> is dismantled from the seat <b>2</b>, the top of the seat <b>2</b> exposes a mounting surface <b>3</b> (after the water tank <b>1</b> is mounted on the seat <b>2</b>, the mounting surface <b>3</b> is covered by the water tank <b>1</b>), and the mounting surface <b>3</b> is provided with functional structures and functional components.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Specifically, a water groove <b>4</b> is disposed on the mounting surface <b>3</b>, the water groove <b>4</b> is configured to receive and store water flowing out of the water tank <b>1</b>, and the mounting surface <b>3</b> is further provided with a heating assembly.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The heating assembly is configured to heat water to generate steam, and comprises a heating cavity <b>5</b> and a heating component <b>6</b>, and the heating cavity <b>5</b> is disposed on the seat <b>2</b>, and is implemented by recessing the mounting surface <b>3</b> to form a recess, that is, the heating cavity <b>5</b> is a recess disposed on the mounting surface <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The mounting surface <b>3</b> is provided with a first water channel <b>9</b>, and the first water channel <b>9</b> is an elongated recess provided on the mounting surface <b>3</b>, and communicates the water groove <b>4</b> with the heating cavity <b>5</b> to guide the water in the water groove <b>4</b> into the heating cavity <b>5</b>. The heating component <b>6</b> (such as a PTC heater) is disposed at the bottom of the heating cavity <b>5</b>. When the water flows into the heating cavity <b>5</b>, the heating component <b>6</b> at the bottom of the water can heat the water until the water boils to generate steam.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">A first air duct <b>01</b> (because the first air duct is composed of a plurality of structures, when the first air duct is marked in the figure, to fully reflect a distribution method of the entire first air duct, a label is marked on an arrow that reflects an extension path of the first air duct, and a method for marking a second air duct <b>02</b> and a third air duct <b>03</b> described subsequently are the same as this.) and an air inlet component <b>10</b> for introducing airflow into the humidifier are disposed inside the humidifier, and the first air duct <b>01</b> enables the airflow introduced by the air inlet component <b>10</b> to flow through the first water channel <b>9</b>. In the specific arrangement, a space above the first water channel <b>9</b> and/or a space not occupied by water in the first water channel <b>9</b> may be set as the first air duct <b>01</b>. Because the water is heated in the heating cavity <b>5</b> and the first water channel <b>9</b> is communicated with the heating cavity <b>5</b>, the heat in the heating cavity <b>5</b> is transferred to the first water channel <b>9</b>, so that the water in the first water channel <b>9</b> reaches 70&#xb0; C.-80&#xb0; C., that is, the hot water in the heating cavity <b>5</b> may flow back into the first water channel <b>9</b>, or even the hot water may flow back into the water groove <b>4</b>, which may cause the water temperature in the water groove <b>4</b> to be excessively high. The backflow of the hot water may cause a housing of the seat <b>2</b> to have a relatively high temperature, so that blowing into the first water channel <b>9</b> through the first air duct <b>01</b> can cool the water in the first water channel <b>9</b>, effectively lower the temperature of the water in the first water channel <b>9</b> and prevent heat from being transferred in the first water channel <b>9</b>, and therefore the temperature of the housing of the seat <b>2</b> can be lowered.

In this process, the airflow purges the cold mist generated in the atomization cavity <b>7</b> to drive the cold mist to enter the mist discharge pipe <b>14</b> after the cold mist passes through the water receiving structure, to implement discharge to the outside of the humidifier. In this process, the airflow can be controlled by the air inlet component <b>10</b> (for example, closing the air outlets toward the second channel section <b>131</b>) to only flow along the first air duct <b>01</b> described above and only drive the cold mist to be discharged, or the air outlets on two sides of the air inlet component <b>10</b> may be caused to emit air, that is, part of the airflow is caused to flow through the third air duct <b>03</b>. However, in this case, the heating component <b>6</b> does not heat water, that is, the heating assembly does not generate steam, and therefore the objective of only discharging cold mist can also be achieved. When the humidifier needs to discharge hot mist, the air outlets on two sides of the air inlet component <b>10</b> are caused to emit air, a part of the airflow generally flows through the first air duct <b>01</b> as described above so that the cold mist enters the mist discharge pipe <b>14</b>, and the other part of the airflow sequentially flows through the second channel section <b>131</b> of the air inlet channel <b>13</b>, the second airflow inlet <b>116</b>, the heating cavity <b>5</b>, and the second airflow outlet <b>117</b>. In this process, the airflow purges the steam (heated airflow) generated in the heating cavity <b>5</b> to drive the steam into the mist discharge pipe <b>14</b>, and the steam and cold mist entering the mist discharge pipe <b>14</b> are mixed in the mist discharge pipe <b>14</b> to generate hot mist with a moderate temperature.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In this embodiment, further preferably, one of the two air outlets of the air inlet component <b>10</b> facing the first airflow inlet <b>114</b> has a larger opening area, and the other air outlet facing the second airflow inlet <b>116</b> has a smaller opening area, so that the quantity of airflow flowing to the atomization cavity <b>7</b> is greater than the quantity of airflow flowing to the heating cavity <b>5</b>, to discharge the cold mist and heat more fully, and the atomization cavity <b>7</b> can also be a main atomization cavity of the humidifier.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the application, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the water tank <b>1</b> is provided with a mist discharge pipe <b>14</b> for discharging mist to the outside of the humidifier, and the mist outlet is an outlet of the mist discharge pipe <b>14</b>; the first airflow outlet <b>115</b> is a plurality of air outlet holes that are provided in the first cover body part <b>110</b> and disposed close to an inlet of the mist discharge pipe <b>14</b>, and the second airflow outlet <b>117</b> is connected to a mist guide pipe <b>118</b> that extends into the mist discharge pipe <b>14</b>. The mist discharge pipe <b>14</b> is a component for discharging mist to the outside of the humidifier and mixing steam with cold mist. Arranging the first airflow outlet <b>115</b> close to the mist discharge pipe <b>14</b> (preferably aligned with each other) is more conductive to discharging the heat to the outside of the humidifier, so that the water in the first water channel <b>9</b> can be cooled in time. In addition, in the application, to discharge heat more timely and fully, and improve heat discharge efficiency, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, preferably, the second airflow outlet <b>117</b> includes a plurality of air outlet holes that run through a top wall of the first cover body part <b>110</b>, and the air outlet holes are elongated holes with a larger opening area. In addition, because the atomization cavity <b>7</b> and the first water channel <b>9</b> simultaneously covered by the first cover body part <b>110</b> are communicated inside the first cover body part <b>110</b>, the first airflow outlet <b>115</b> for discharging heat may not be specifically arranged, but the heat is discharged through the first through hole <b>112</b>, the in-tube space and the cover body opening <b>120</b> of the water receiving structure under the driving of the airflow. The mist guide pipe <b>118</b> communicated with the second airflow outlet <b>117</b> protrudes on the second cover body part <b>111</b>, and the mist guide pipe <b>118</b> extends into the mist discharge pipe <b>14</b>, which can not only more fully introduce the steam to the mist discharge pipe <b>14</b>, but also avoid a heat loss, so that the working effect of the humidifier is improved.

The air blocking part <b>18</b> is a plate-shaped part. The air blocking part <b>18</b> is disposed on an inner wall of the second cover body part <b>111</b> and is aligned with the second airflow inlet <b>116</b>, so that the air blocking part <b>18</b> can block airflow entering from the second airflow inlet <b>116</b>, to disturb the airflow and change the flow direction of the airflow. Therefore, the airflow can flow in the heating cavity <b>5</b> disorderly in a plurality of directions to more fully purge the hot water surface and the internal space of the heating cavity <b>5</b>, thereby promoting the flow of steam to the second airflow outlet <b>117</b> and preventing the steam from flowing back out of the heating cavity <b>5</b> from the second airflow inlet <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the water groove <b>4</b> is communicated with the atomization cavity <b>7</b> through the second water channel <b>15</b>, and a covering portion (specifically, a top wall of the covering part) of the first cover body part <b>110</b> is connected with an isolation side wall <b>119</b> extending into the second water channel <b>15</b>. An edge of the isolation side wall <b>119</b> away from the top wall can extend below the water surface in the second water channel <b>15</b>, so as to block a part of the second water channel <b>15</b> above the water surface, and therefore cold mist can be prevented from diffusing from the atomization cavity <b>7</b> into the water groove <b>4</b>. Because the water groove <b>4</b> and the atomization cavity <b>7</b> are adjacently disposed and communicated through the second water channel <b>15</b>, cold mist generated in the atomization cavity <b>7</b> may diffuse to the water groove <b>4</b> through the second water channel <b>15</b>, which results in waste of the cold mist.

When the first cover body part <b>110</b> covers the atomization cavity <b>7</b> and the first water channel <b>9</b>, the isolation side wall <b>119</b> extends into the second water channel <b>15</b>. In addition, because water exists in the second water channel <b>15</b> and the cold mist diffuses above the water surface, when the isolation side wall <b>119</b> is used to block the second water channel <b>15</b>, the isolation side wall <b>119</b> only needs to extend to below the water surface from the mounting surface <b>3</b>, and does not need to extend to a bottom wall of the second water channel <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">It can be learned from the above that the covering part <b>11</b> in the application is a comprehensive component that can achieve a plurality of functions such as noise reduction, heat transfer prevention and air duct formation. The component disposed in the humidifier can improve performances of the humidifier in many aspects, and significantly improve a use effect of the humidifier.

The hot water cover <b>16</b> is added into the heating cavity <b>5</b> because the hot water cover <b>16</b> with a downward opening can cover the water in the heating cavity <b>5</b>, thereby isolating noise during the process of heating and boiling of water. The hot water cover <b>16</b> can further form a double-layer plastic cover with the second cover body part <b>111</b>. In this way, the noise generated during the water heating process can be isolated to a greater extent, so that the humidifier has a better mute effect.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the hot water cover <b>16</b> is provided with: a water inlet hole <b>160</b> provided at a position of the hot water cover <b>16</b> close to the opening of the hot water cover <b>16</b> (in the following content, this opening is referred to as the opening of the hot water cover), and communicated with a communication port of the heating cavity <b>5</b> away from the first water channel <b>9</b>; and a mist outlet hole <b>161</b> provided in a top wall of the hot water cover <b>16</b>, so that steam is capable of entering the heating cavity <b>5</b> from a space inside the hot water cover <b>16</b>. In this structure, because the opening of the hot water cover is located at the bottom of the heating cavity <b>5</b>, the water inlet hole <b>160</b> is provided at a position of the hot water cover <b>16</b> close to the opening of the hot water cover, so that the water inlet hole <b>160</b> is also located in the middle and lower part of the heating cavity <b>5</b>, and therefore the water can enter the hot water cover <b>16</b> more conveniently. In addition, when the side wall of the hot water cover <b>16</b> is provided with the water inlet hole <b>160</b>, the water inlet hole <b>160</b> is preferably kept away from the communication port of the first water channel <b>9</b> that is communicated with the heating cavity <b>5</b>, so that a distance between the water inlet hole <b>160</b> and the first water channel <b>9</b> can be increased, and the difficulty of hot water flowing into the first water channel <b>9</b> in the hot water cover <b>16</b> can be increased, thereby further lowering the water temperature in the first water channel <b>9</b>, and better avoiding the increase in the temperature of the humidifier housing. The mist outlet hole <b>161</b> is provided in a top wall of the hot water cover <b>16</b> close to the second cover body part <b>111</b>, so that steam generated when the water boils can pass through the mist outlet hole <b>161</b> and flow to the second airflow outlet <b>117</b>, which is beneficial to the discharge of the steam.

Because the flow rate of the water at the water inlet hole <b>160</b> is relatively slow, the water inlet hole <b>160</b> can further function to reduce heat return, so that the water temperature in the first water channel <b>9</b> is not excessively high.

To prevent the temperature increase of the housing of the seat <b>2</b> caused by the increase of the temperature of the water in the first water channel <b>9</b>, the first water channel <b>9</b> is disposed on the mounting surface <b>3</b> based on such a principle that the first water channel <b>9</b> is disposed far away from the side wall of the seat <b>2</b> to the largest extent, so as to reduce the heat transfer to the housing.
