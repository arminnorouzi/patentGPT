The laser radar usually includes an emission system, a receiving system, an information processing system, and other parts. The emission system usually includes various forms of laser beams and emission optical systems. The receiving system usually includes various forms of photoelectric detectors and receiving optical systems. The emission optical system and the receiving optical system may be independent or share a group of lenses. For laser radar with a non-coaxial optical system (that is, an emission optical system and a receiving optical system of laser radar use separate group of lenses, and optical axis of the group of emission lenses and optical axis of the group of receiving lenses do not coincide), during the ranging of a long-range target object, a beam emitted from a laser and the field of view of a detector are aligned at a long distance. That is, light obtained after the beam emitted from the laser is reflected by a long-range object is completely received by the detector. The laser and the detector that match in the field of view form one channel. Multi-line laser radar includes a plurality of channels. Within a relatively short range of the laser radar, light obtained after a beam emitted from a laser is reflected by an object reaches a detector, and a spot deviates and diffuses to fail to be completely received by a detector corresponding to a channel, resulting in the deterioration of short ranging performance.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To solve the problem of reduced short ranging capability and accuracy of laser radar caused by a non-coaxial optical system, two main technical solutions are available. In the first technical solution, a part of beam is split from an emitted beam, and the direction of the beam is changed to make the beam deviate toward the field of view of a detector. In the second technical solution, a micro-reflector is mounted near a detector to expand the field of view of the detector. The first method reduces laser energy used for long ranging. The ranging capability of the system is reduced, and the split small beam of the emitted beam may cause a problem that a false target is detected in extreme cases (for example, a corner-reflective road sign). In the second method, the field of view of the detector is expanded. The ambient light is increased, and the ranging capability of the system is reduced. The additionally increased field of view of the detector may also cause the problem that a false target is detected in extreme cases (for example, a corner-reflective road sign). In addition, in both the methods, the optical path of laser radar becomes more complex, the costs of material and alignment are increased, and the reliability of the system is reduced.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The content of the related art is merely technologies known to the inventor, and does not represent existing technologies in the field.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Laser radar in the present invention uses a method of emitting a laser beam by using a single channel and receiving a laser beam by using multiple channels to solve the problem of insufficient detection capability due to a weak short-range echo signal of laser radar in the prior art.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of at least one defect in the prior art, the present invention provides laser radar, including:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">an emitter, including a laser array, the laser array being configured to emit a plurality of laser beams for detecting a target object;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">a receiver, including a detector array, the detector array being configured to receive echoes, reflected by the target object, of the plurality of laser beams emitted from the laser array and converting the echoes into electrical signals, where the laser array and the detector array form a plurality of detection channels, and each detection channel includes one laser and one detector;

It should be understood that the preferred embodiments described herein are merely used to explain the present invention but are not intended to limit the present invention.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of laser radar <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in the figure, the laser radar <b>100</b> includes an emitter <b>110</b>, a receiver <b>120</b>, and a processor <b>130</b>. The emitter <b>110</b> includes a laser array <b>111</b> (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). The laser array <b>111</b> is configured to be capable of emitting a plurality of laser beams for detecting a target object OB. The laser beam is diffusely reflected by the target object OB. Reflected echoes return to the laser radar and are received by the receiver <b>120</b>. The receiver <b>120</b> includes a detector array <b>121</b> (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). The detector array <b>121</b> is configured to be capable of receiving echoes, reflected by the detected target object OB, of the laser beams. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the emitter <b>110</b> further includes a group of emission lenses <b>112</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). The group of emission lenses <b>112</b> is arranged downstream in an optical path of the laser array <b>111</b> and is configured to modulate (collimate) the laser beams emitted from the laser array <b>111</b> and emit the modulated laser beams into ambient space around the laser radar <b>100</b>. The receiver <b>120</b> further includes a group of receiving lenses <b>122</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). The group of receiving lenses <b>122</b> is arranged upstream in an optical path of the detector array <b>121</b> and is configured to converge the echoes, reflected by the detected target object OB, of the emitted laser beams to the detector array <b>121</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a laser beam L<b>1</b> emitted from the laser array <b>111</b> is modulated by the group of emission lenses to be projected onto the target object OB. Diffuse reflection occurs. A part of the laser beam is reflected to form an echo L<b>1</b>&#x2032;. The detector array <b>121</b> receives the echo L<b>1</b>&#x2032; reflected after the laser emits the laser beam, and converts the echo into an electrical signal. The laser array <b>111</b> and the detector array <b>121</b> form a plurality of detection channels, and each detection channel includes one laser and one detector, thereby forming a one-to-one correspondence relationship. In an ideal case, when one laser emits a laser beam, within a reserved time window, a detector corresponding to the laser receives a reflected echo, generates an electrical signal, and calculates a distance of the target object according to the electrical signal generated by the detector, to form point cloud data. The processor <b>130</b> may be coupled to the emitter <b>110</b> and the receiver <b>120</b>, and configured to read a first electrical signal of the detector of one detection channel and a second electrical signal of the detector of at least another detection channel in response to a laser beam emitted from the laser of one detection channel. The processor <b>130</b> analyzes, for example, the first electrical signal and the second electrical signal, and performs determination and calculation on the signals according to a preset threshold, to generate point cloud data or determine that the point cloud data is an ineffective point cloud. Therefore, according to the embodiments of the present invention, when one laser emits a detection beam, both an electrical signal of a detector (that is, a detector of a channel in which the laser is arranged) corresponding to the laser and an electrical signal of at least another detector are read. This technical solution is especially very beneficial to the detection of a short-range target object. Details are described below.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the emitter <b>110</b> and the receiver <b>120</b> may be arranged transversely in a horizontal direction or may be arranged vertically in a vertical direction in the laser radar <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> show a case in which the emitter <b>110</b> and the receiver <b>120</b> are arranged transversely in the horizontal direction. The laser radar <b>100</b> includes a rotating shaft <b>101</b>, a motor (not shown), and a rotor. The rotating shaft <b>101</b> is arranged inside the laser radar <b>100</b>. The motor drives the rotor to rotate around the rotating shaft <b>101</b>. The emitter <b>110</b> and the receiver <b>120</b> are arranged on the rotor, and rotate around the rotating shaft <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> show a case in which the emitter <b>110</b> and the receiver <b>120</b> are arranged vertically in the vertical direction. The laser radar <b>100</b> further includes a rotating mirror <b>140</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) and a motor. The rotating mirror <b>140</b> is arranged downstream in an optical path of the emitter <b>110</b> and upstream in an optical path of the receiver <b>120</b>. The motor is used for driving the rotating mirror <b>140</b> to rotate. A laser beam emitted from the emitter <b>110</b> is reflected outside the laser radar <b>100</b> by the rotating mirror <b>140</b>. Echoes, reflected by the target object, of the laser beam are reflected by the rotating mirror <b>140</b> to the receiver <b>120</b>. Further description is provided below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, referring to the coordinate system, the horizontal direction is a direction along an X axis in the figure. The rotating shaft <b>101</b> is in a direction along a Z axis. When the laser radar <b>100</b> is placed at the top of or around a vehicle, the Z axis is a direction basically perpendicular to the ground. The laser array <b>111</b> of the emitter <b>110</b> includes a plurality of independently controllable lasers, as shown by A&#x2032;, B&#x2032;, and C&#x2032;, including an edge-emitting laser or a vertical cavity surface emitting laser. The laser array <b>111</b> may be a laser array formed by individual lasers or linear array lasers or area array lasers. The detector array <b>121</b> is, for example, an array of detectors such as APDs, SiPMs and SPADs, as shown by A, B, or C shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. The detector array <b>121</b> is arranged in a plurality of columns in the horizontal direction (that is, the X direction in the figure). Each column includes at least one laser. When one column includes a plurality of laser beams, the plurality of laser beams are arranged in the vertical direction (that is, a direction perpendicular to the horizontal direction, that is, the Z direction). The arrangement of the laser array <b>111</b> corresponds to the arrangement of the detector array <b>121</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the laser array <b>111</b> is also arranged in a plurality of columns in the horizontal direction. Each column includes at least one detector distributed in the vertical direction. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is designed that the laser array <b>111</b> and the detector array <b>121</b> have a translation relationship in the horizontal direction, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. Certainly, the laser array <b>111</b> and the detector array <b>121</b> may be arranged symmetrically in the horizontal direction. A laser and a detector that match in a long-range field of view usually form one channel (or detection channel). In the design of multi-line laser radar, the long ranging performance is generally preferentially ensured. In the design of an optical structure and an electronic circuit, the maximum efficiency of the radar is reached as much as possible at a long distance. When the detection channel includes one laser and one detector, in an ideal case, a laser beam emitted from the laser is diffusely reflected by a long-range target object to form echoes to be irradiated to the detector of the detection channel in which the laser is arranged. An example of a detection channel <b>1</b> and a detection channel <b>2</b> is used for description below. The detection channel <b>1</b> includes a laser A&#x2032; and a detector A. The detection channel <b>2</b> includes a laser B&#x2032; and a detector B. The detector B and the detector A are arranged adjacently in the horizontal direction. For example, in an ideal case, echoes generated after a laser beam emitted from the laser A&#x2032; is diffusely reflected by a long-range target object are irradiated to the detector A of the detection channel <b>1</b> in which the laser A&#x2032; is arranged. In an ideal case, echoes generated after a laser beam emitted from the laser B&#x2032; is diffusely reflected by the long-range target object are irradiated to the detector B of the detection channel <b>2</b> in which the laser B&#x2032; is arranged. Similar to the detection channel <b>1</b> and the detection channel <b>2</b>, a detection channel <b>3</b> includes a laser C&#x2032; and a detector C. The detector C and the detector A are arranged at an interval in the horizontal direction. Details are not described herein again. The plurality of laser beams of the laser array <b>111</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> are arranged on one substrate. The plurality of laser beams may be arranged on a plurality of substrates, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. The lasers are arranged at different heights in the vertical direction of a focal plane of the group of emission lenses. All these fall within the protection scope of the present invention. In addition, it needs to be noted that the emitter and the receiver are transversely interchangeable.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of the reflection of a long-range object and a short-range object by laser radar <b>100</b> on a non-coaxial optical path according to an embodiment of the present invention. The non-coaxial optical path represents that an optical axis (that is, a receiving optical axis, as shown by <b>1221</b> in the figure) of a group of receiving lenses and an optical axis (that is, an emission optical axis, as shown by <b>1121</b> in the figure) of a group of emission lenses of the laser radar do not coincide. Similarly, a coaxial optical path represents that an optical axis of a group of receiving lenses and an optical axis of a group of emission lenses of the laser radar coincide. Detailed description is provided below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the emitter and the receiver are arranged transversely in the horizontal direction. When the laser radar <b>100</b> is used to detect a long-range object OB<b>1</b>, an echo that returns to the laser radar after the beam emitted from the laser A&#x2032; of the detection channel <b>1</b> is reflected by the object are approximately parallel laser beams. A reflected spot of the echoes can be precisely received by the detector A (arranged in a focal plane of a receiving lens system), as shown by the upper left portion in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. This is a relatively ideal case. However, when the laser radar <b>100</b> is used to detect a short-range object OB<b>2</b>, a reflected spot deviates in one direction, for example, the direction of the arrow in the figure, that is, a direction pointing from the emission optical axis <b>1121</b> to the receiving optical axis <b>1221</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and referring to the description in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, after the beam emitted from the laser A&#x2032; of the detection channel <b>1</b> is reflected by a short-range object, approximately parallel laser beams cannot be formed. Therefore, the laser beams cannot be converged by the receiving lens system to the detector A (arranged in the focal plane of the receiving lens system) of the detection channel <b>1</b>. The detector B of the detection channel <b>2</b> is also arranged in the focal plane of the receiving lens system, but is arranged in a deviation direction adjacent to the detector A of the detection channel <b>1</b>. However, the deviation direction is the direction pointing from the emission optical axis <b>1121</b> to the receiving optical axis <b>1221</b> (the direction of the arrow shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), and has a height different from a height of the detector A of the detection channel <b>1</b> in the focal plane. Due to spot diffusion, the detector B of the detection channel <b>2</b> also receives a part of the laser beams, or even most reflected spot is received by the detector B of the detection channel <b>2</b>, as shown by the lower left portion in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. When the distance between the target object OB and the laser radar <b>100</b> is small enough, the spot continues to diffuse in the deviation direction, and even the detector C of the detection channel <b>3</b> at an interval from the detection channel <b>1</b> also receives some laser beams or most laser beams (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). Such spot deviation and diffusion cause optical crosstalk between the detection channels of the laser radar, which affects the ranging precision and the ranging accuracy of the laser radar.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an emitter and a receiver being arranged vertically according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in figure, referring to the coordinate system, the horizontal direction is a direction along an X axis in the figure, and the vertical direction is a direction along a Z axis in the figure. When the laser radar <b>100</b> is placed at the top of or around a vehicle, the Z axis is a direction perpendicular to the ground.

Referring to the case in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, When the laser radar <b>100</b> is used to detect a long-range object OB<b>1</b>, an echo that returns to the laser radar after the beam emitted from the laser A&#x2032; of the detection channel <b>1</b> is reflected by the object are approximately parallel laser beams. A reflected spot of the echoes can be precisely received by the detector A. This is a relatively ideal case. However, when the laser radar <b>100</b> is used to detect a short-range object OB<b>2</b>, a reflected spot deviates in one direction, for example, the direction of the arrow in the figure, that is, a direction pointing from the emission optical axis <b>1121</b> to the receiving optical axis <b>1221</b>.

Therefore, the laser beams cannot be converged by the receiving lens system to the detector A of the detection channel <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The detector B of another detection channel, that is, the detection channel <b>2</b>, is also arranged in the focal plane of the receiving lens system, but is arranged in a deviation direction adjacent to the detector A of the detection channel <b>1</b>. However, the deviation direction is the direction pointing from the emission optical axis <b>1121</b> to the receiving optical axis <b>1221</b> (the direction of the arrow shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), and has a height different from a height of the detector A of the detection channel <b>1</b> in the focal plane.

Such spot deviation and diffusion cause optical crosstalk between the detection channels of the laser radar, which affects the ranging precision and accuracy of the laser radar.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a structural diagram of laser radar according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in the figure, the emitter and the receiver of the laser radar are arranged vertically in the vertical direction (that is, the direction along the Z axis in the figure). Specifically, in the vertical direction, the laser array <b>111</b> is at the bottom and the detector array <b>121</b> is at the top. The group of emission lenses <b>112</b> is arranged downstream in an optical path of the laser array <b>111</b>. The group of receiving lenses <b>122</b> is arranged upstream in an optical path of the detector array <b>121</b>. The laser array <b>111</b> emits a laser beam. The laser beam is collimated by the group of emission lenses <b>112</b> to enter the rotating mirror <b>140</b>. The motor drives the rotating mirror <b>140</b> to rotate around the rotating shaft <b>101</b> to implement a scan in the horizontal direction. The rotating shaft <b>101</b> is, for example, the direction along the Z axis perpendicular to the ground. The emitted beam is projected to a target object for diffuse reflection. A part of the laser beam is reflected back to form echoes. The echoes are converged by the group of receiving lenses <b>122</b> to enter the detector array <b>121</b>. The processor <b>130</b> performs signal processing on the echoes to obtain the distance or/and reflectivity of the target object OB. In addition, it needs to be noted that the emitter and the receiver are vertically interchangeable. The rotating mirror is provided as a scan device in the foregoing embodiments. A person skilled in the art may understand that other similar scan mirrors such as a swinging mirror and a galvo also fall within the protection scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">It needs to be noted that the horizontal direction and the vertical direction discussed above are respectively a basically horizontal direction or a basically vertical direction. Due to factors such as a lamination error of a laser or a detector, there may be an error of, for example, &#x2212;5&#xb0; to 5&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In summary, when a target object to be detected is near the laser radar, a part or most of a reflected spot of the target object may fail to be received by a detector of a current detection channel, but instead is received by a detector of a detection channel beside the current detection channel. When a target object to be detected is very close to the laser radar, very high energy is received by the detector of the detection channel beside the current detection channel, but a signal received by the detector of the current detection channel is very weak. In this case, if an electrical signal of the detector of the current detection channel is still used to calculate the distance of the target object, a large error may be generated, or even an incorrect conclusion may be reached.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">A person skilled in the art should know that the described examples of the distance between the laser radar and the detected target object in the foregoing embodiments, for example, &#x201c;far&#x201d;, &#x201c;near&#x201d;, and &#x201c;very close&#x201d; are relative description but are not limited to absolute values. For the distance, a preset distance value may be determined according to spot deviation and diffusion degrees that are obtained from the lens parameters of the laser radar and change with a distance and the capability of recognizing an output signal of a detector by the system. Optionally, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, when the distance between the detected target object and the laser radar is less than five meters (certainly, the distance may be three meters or one meter), it is considered that the detected target object is near the laser radar. When the distance is greater than five meters, it is considered that the distance between the detected target object and the laser radar is relatively large.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Based on that the detector array <b>121</b> of the laser radar <b>100</b> cannot receive most echoes of a laser beam emitted from a laser in a current detection channel during the detection of a short-range target object, the applicant of the present invention proposes that when a laser of a detection channel emits a laser beam, both an electrical signal of a detector corresponding to one detection channel and an electrical signal of at least another detector are received. The electrical signal of the at least another detector is, for example, an electrical signal of a detector corresponding to a detection channel right next to the detector of the detection channel in the deviation direction, and is used as a short-range backup signal. For laser radar with an emitter and a receiver arranged transversely, the selection of another detector is further related to the field of view corresponding to the current detection channel. Preferably, another detector is closer to the zero-degree field of view of the laser radar than the current detector. In the present invention, the zero-degree field of view of the laser radar is the field of view corresponding to an optical axis of a group of emission lens/a group of receiving lens. When the field of view corresponding to a detection channel is higher than the zero-degree field of view, the field of view is positive, for example, further points to the sky direction relative to the zero-degree field of view. When the field of view corresponding to a detection channel is lower than the zero-degree field of view, the field of view is negative, for example, further points to the ground relative to the zero-degree field of view. For example, when the field of view corresponding to the current detection channel is negative, a detector corresponding to a detection channel right next to the detector of the detection channel in the deviation direction in a focal plane should be lower than the detector of the current detection channel. When the field of view corresponding to the current detection channel is positive, a detector corresponding to a detection channel right next to the detector of the detection channel in the deviation direction in a focal plane should be higher than the detector of the detection channel. If detecting that the electrical signal of the detector corresponding to the current detection channel is very weak or even detecting no electrical signal, the processor <b>130</b> starts to detect a short-range backup signal. If it is calculated that a distance value of the short-range backup signal is less than or equal to the preset distance value, the short-range backup signal is used as a short-range echo of the current channel. That is, for laser radar with a non-coaxial optical system, a method of using a single detection channel to emit a laser beam and multiple detection channels to receive echoes is used, so that the short ranging capability of non-coaxial laser radar can be greatly enhanced.

The figures schematically show two adjacent detection channels, namely, a detection channel <b>1</b> and a detection channel <b>2</b>. The detection channel <b>2</b> is optionally a channel adjacent to the detection channel <b>1</b> in the horizontal direction. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, a detector B of the detection channel <b>2</b> is a detector that is adjacent to a detector A of the detection channel <b>1</b> in the horizontal direction and is in a deviation direction. Preferably, the detector B is lower than the detector A in a focal plane of a group of receiving lenses <b>122</b>. The laser of the detection channel <b>1</b> is configured to emit a laser beam, and at the same time, it is set that the laser of the detection channel <b>2</b> beside the detection channel does not emit a laser beam. When a target object is relatively far away from the laser radar, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, a laser beam emitted from the laser of one detection channel <b>1</b> is collimated and emitted by a group of emission lenses and reflected by the target object. Subsequently, a group of receiving lenses converges echoes of the laser beam. The echoes are received by the detector of the detection channel <b>1</b>, and the detector of the detection channel <b>2</b> nearly receives no echoes. In this case, an echo signal of the detection channel <b>1</b> is a valid detection value of the detection channel. When a target object is relatively close to the laser radar, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, a laser beam emitted from the laser of one detection channel <b>1</b> is collimated and emitted by a group of emission lenses and reflected by the target object. Subsequently, a group of receiving lenses converges echoes of the laser beam. Most of the echoes are received by the detector of the detection channel <b>2</b>, and the detector of the detection channel <b>1</b> only receives a small part of echoes or even receives no echoes. In this case, an echo signal received by the detection channel <b>2</b> is used as the echo signal of the detection channel <b>1</b> for processing and computation and used as a valid detection value of the detection channel <b>1</b>. As can be seen, when only the laser of the detection channel <b>1</b> is turned on, the distance between the detected target object and the laser radar has great impact on the echo reception of the detection channel <b>1</b> and the adjacent detection channel <b>2</b>. According to an embodiment of the present invention, when a target object is close enough to the laser radar, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a laser beam emitted from the laser of one detection channel <b>1</b> is collimated and emitted by a group of emission lenses and reflected by the target object. Subsequently, the group of receiving lenses converges echoes of the laser beam for detection by the detector. As discussed above, a spot further diffuses in the deviation direction. In this case, the echoes are received by a detector (that is, the detector of the detection channel <b>2</b>) that is adjacent to and a detector (that is, a detector of a detection channel <b>3</b>) at an interval from the detector of the detection channel <b>1</b>. The detector of the detection channel <b>1</b> nearly receives no echoes. In this case, in addition to reading a signal (a first electrical signal) of the detector of the detection channel <b>1</b>, a signal (a second electrical signal) of the detector of the detection channel <b>2</b> and a signal (a third electrical signal) of the detector of the detection channel <b>3</b> further need to be read. To simplify the description, in the following processing process, an example of reading signals of detectors of two channels is used. The idea of reading signals of detectors of a plurality of channels is also similar. Details are not described again.

When the first electrical signal converted from the echo received by the detection channel <b>1</b> is greater than or equal to the first preset threshold, the processor calculates the distance between the target object and the laser radar according to the first electrical signal. For example, the distance between the target object and the laser radar may be obtained according to a receiving time of receiving an echo by the detector of the detection channel <b>1</b> and an emission time of a detection beam based on a time-of-flight (TOF) ranging method (distance=time of flight*speed of light/2).</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Step S<b>607</b>: Calculate a distance between a target object and laser radar according to the second electrical signal.

That is, the value relationship between the preset distance value and the distance between the target object and the laser radar calculated according to step S<b>607</b> is determined. When the calculated distance is less than or equal to the preset distance, it indicates that currently a short-range target object is detected and a spot drift has occurred. The process turns to step S<b>609</b> to generate point cloud data according to the second electrical signal of the detector of the detection channel <b>2</b>. Otherwise, when the calculated distance is greater than the preset distance, it indicates that currently a short-range target object is detected. In this case, the echo received by the detector of the detection channel <b>2</b> and the generated second electrical signal are not caused by a spot drift generated because the detection channel <b>1</b> detects a short-range target object, but may be caused by external ambient light or the like. Therefore, the process turns to step S<b>610</b> to determine that there is no effective point cloud, that is, no object is detected in the current detection. The preset distance is optionally five meters. The function of step S<b>608</b> is equivalent to secondary verification. That is, in a case that the detector of the detection channel <b>1</b> receives no echo signal that is strong enough and the detector of the detection channel <b>2</b> receives an echo signal that is strong enough, it is verified whether the current target object is a short-range target object (for example, at a distance within five meters from the laser radar). In the case of a short-range target object, the second electrical signal (and a distance value obtained based on the second electrical signal) is used in place of the first electrical signal (and a distance value obtained based on the first electrical signal) to generate the point cloud data of the laser radar.

However, the distance between the target object and the laser radar obtained through processing and calculation according to the electrical signal is greater than the preset distance value, for example, greater than a preset distance of five meters. Because the electrical signal is used for short ranging, in this case, it may be chosen to skip using or discard the electrical signal, so that the electrical signal is not used for generating the point cloud data.

When the first electrical signal converted from the echo received by the detection channel <b>1</b> is greater than or equal to the first preset threshold, the processor calculates the distance between the target object and the laser radar according to the first electrical signal.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">For example, the distance between the target object and the laser radar may be obtained according to a receiving time of receiving an echo by the detector of the detection channel <b>1</b> and an emission time of a detection beam based on a time-of-flight (TOF) ranging method (distance=time of flight*speed of light/2). The process then turns to step S<b>708</b>.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Step S<b>707</b>: Calculate a distance between a target object and laser radar according to the second electrical signal. When the second electrical signal converted from the echo received by the detection channel <b>2</b> is greater than or equal to the second preset threshold, the processor calculates the distance between the target object and the laser radar according to the second electrical signal. For example, the time-of-flight TOF ranging method in the foregoing step S<b>706</b> may be used for distance calculation. The process then turns to step S<b>709</b>.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Step S<b>708</b>: Determine whether the distance is less than or equal to a preset distance value. That is, the value relationship between the preset distance value and the distance between the target object and the laser radar calculated according to step S<b>706</b> is determined. When the calculated distance is less than or equal to the preset distance, it indicates that currently a short-range target object is detected. In this case, although the spot has deviated, the spot still covers a part of the detector of the detection channel <b>1</b>, and the first electrical signal is still greater than or equal to the first preset threshold. In this case, the process turns to step S<b>710</b>. When the calculated distance is greater than the preset distance, it indicates that currently a short-range target object is detected. In this case, the echo received by the detector of the detection channel <b>1</b> and the generated first electrical signal are directly outputted. Therefore, the process turns to step S<b>711</b> to generate the point cloud data. The current detection is completed. The preset distance is optionally five meters.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Step S<b>709</b>: Determine whether the distance is less than or equal to a preset distance value. That is, the value relationship between the preset distance value and the distance between the target object and the laser radar calculated according to step S<b>707</b> is determined. When the calculated distance is less than or equal to the preset distance, it indicates that currently a short-range target object is detected, and the process turns to step S<b>710</b>. Otherwise, when the calculated distance is greater than the preset distance, it indicates that currently a short-range target object is detected. In this case, the echo received by the detector of the detection channel <b>2</b> and the generated second electrical signal are not caused by a spot drift generated because the detection channel <b>1</b> detects a short-range target object, but may be caused by external ambient light or the like. Therefore, the process turns to step S<b>712</b> to determine that there is no effective point cloud, that is, no object is detected in the current detection. The preset distance is optionally five meters.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Step S<b>710</b>: Compare the first electrical signal and the second electrical signal, and select a stronger electrical signal. The function of step S<b>710</b> is equivalent to secondary verification. That is, the distance calculated by using the first electrical signal in step S<b>708</b> and the distance calculated by using the second electrical signal in step S<b>709</b> are both less than the preset distance value, the strength of the first electrical signal and the second electrical signal is compared again to select a stronger electrical signal for output, and a weaker electrical signal is discarded.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">Step S<b>711</b>: Generate point cloud data. The point cloud data of the laser radar is generated according to the distance data obtained in step S<b>708</b>, or the point cloud data of the laser radar is generated according to the distance obtained from the stronger electrical signal calculated in step S<b>710</b>.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Step S<b>712</b>: Determine that there is no effective point cloud. When the detection channel <b>2</b> receives no echo that is strong enough, that is, the second electrical signal is less than the second preset threshold, no effective point cloud is generated. Alternatively, the detection channel <b>2</b> receives an echo that is strong enough, and the second electrical signal is greater than or equal to the second preset threshold. However, the distance between the target object and the laser radar obtained through processing and calculation according to the electrical signal is greater than the preset distance value, for example, greater than a preset distance of five meters. Because the electrical signal is used for short ranging, in this case, it may be chosen to skip using or discard the electrical signal, so that the electrical signal is not used for generating the point cloud data. When no effective point cloud is generated, it indicates that no object is detected in the current detection.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In the foregoing steps, S<b>704</b> to S<b>712</b> may be performed by the processor of the laser radar. In steps S<b>702</b> and S<b>703</b>, the step of reading an electrical signal may be performed by the processor of the laser radar.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">In the foregoing embodiments, for example, the distance obtained in step S<b>710</b> is used during the determination and selection of a stronger electrical signal to generate the point cloud data of the laser radar, and the distance data obtained in step S<b>708</b> is used beyond the preset distance to generate the point cloud data of the laser radar. In the entire detection range, the two parts of point cloud data may be spliced.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">The present invention is found by the inventor based on the following discovery: when the laser radar detects a short-range target object, a spot reflected back to a detector deviates and diffuses, and as a result energy received by a detector in a current channel is low, and a detector in a channel beside the current channel receives a lot of energy. Based on the foregoing discovery, for the ranging problem of laser radar, the present invention provides a mode of using a single-channel laser to emit a laser beam and multi-channel detectors for reception, so that the capability and accuracy of detecting a short-range target object of the laser radar can be improved on the premise that the remote detection capability of the laser radar is not affected.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">It should be finally noted that the foregoing descriptions are merely preferred embodiments of the present invention, but are not intended to limit the present invention.
