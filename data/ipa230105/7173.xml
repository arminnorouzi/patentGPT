description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0002" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an image pickup signal processing apparatus, an image pickup signal processing method, a storage medium, and the like that can receive a change request to change video settings.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventionally, some monitoring cameras and the like can record video images on a recording media such as an SD card on the camera side. Additionally, in the Open Network Video Interface Forum (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;ONVIF&#x201d;), which is a common standard for connecting a monitoring camera and the like to a client apparatus for video image reception, setting values and commands related to the video recording function are standardized.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Furthermore, in the ONVIF standard, the definition of a Profile that includes a set value group related to image pickup such as a VideoEncoderConfiguration that indicates a video encoding method is provided as settings related to video recording. A RecordingConfiguration that indicates the video image recording settings and a RecordingJob that is a video recording management job including settings for a recording state and the like, are also defined.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The RecordingJob is created based on the Profile and the RecordingConfiguration, the recording state is set to Active, and thereby video recording can be started (ONVIF Specification (http://www.onvif.org/specs/DocMap.html))</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Additionally, in the ONVIF standard, the functions of searching and reproducing recorded video images are also standardized and it is possible to search for and reproduce videos images that were recorded using a user's desired recording setting by specifying the RecordingConfiguration.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, in general, the encoding method that can be used for the RecordingConfiguration is uniquely determined. In this case, the user needs to create a RecordingJob based on a Profile including the encoding method settings that can be used for the RecordingConfiguration and then start recording.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, since the Profile is a set value group that is used in video distribution in addition to video recording, it is possible to change the encoding method halfway. When the encoding method of the Profile that is being used in video recording is changed, an inconsistency occurs between the settings of the RecordingConfiguration and the Profile that is included in the Job, resulting in a drawback in which recording cannot be continued.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In contrast, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2014-179879 discloses a configuration in which when a job is recording video images and a change related to a video setting is received, the change cannot be received and an error is returned.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is possible to return an error without receiving a setting change in relation to setting changes that cause inconsistencies, as is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2014-179879. However, if an error is returned when the inconsistency occurs, the video settings cannot be changed at all during recording, and it contrarily becomes difficult for the user to use.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">An object of the present invention is to provide an image pickup signal processing apparatus that can record video data by using another recording job even if the recording of the video data by the recording job cannot be performed due to a change in video settings in a recording job.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">One aspect of the present invention includes an image pickup signal processing apparatus comprising: at least one processor or circuit configured to function as: a video processing unit configured to process an image pickup signal acquired from an image pickup unit based on a predetermined video setting to generate video data; a recording unit configured to record the video data based on a predetermined video recording setting; a control unit configured to perform recording of the video data by a first recording job that corresponds to the video setting and the video recording setting; and a receiving unit configured to receive a change request for the video setting, wherein the control unit is configured to perform the recording of the video data by using a second recording job that corresponds to the video setting that has been changed based on the change request, which is different from the first recording job, based on the change request received by the receiving unit.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a configurational diagram of an image pickup system according to the first embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a functional block diagram showing a configuration of a network camera <b>1000</b> of the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a functional block diagram showing a configurational example of a client apparatus <b>2000</b> of the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a sequence diagram showing a video recording and video setting changing method according the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a creation method for a recording job in step S<b>1002</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flowchart showing the video recording state changing processing in step S<b>1005</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram for explaining the flow of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a flowchart showing the video recording state changing processing according to the second embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a diagram for explaining the flow of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a flowchart showing a part of the video recording state changing processing according to the third embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a flowchart showing the processing following the processing in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B</figref> are diagrams for explaining a first example of an existing second recording job and its profile.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A and <b>13</b>B</figref> are diagrams for explaining a second example of an existing second recording job and its profile.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B</figref> are diagrams for explaining a third example of an existing second recording job and its profile.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Hereinafter, with reference to the accompanying drawings, favorable modes of the present invention will be described using Embodiments.
