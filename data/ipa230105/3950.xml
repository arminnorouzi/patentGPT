While WiFi has been incredibly useful and popular in recent years, it is expected that the need for more bandwidth will soon lead to replacing WiFi or complementing WiFi with alternative wireless technologies.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Light Fidelity (LiFi), which uses light within certain wavelength ranges for local area wireless communications, represents one alternative wireless technology that may replace or complement WiFi. LiFi systems rely on visible, infrared, and/or near ultraviolet spectrum waves. By modulating a light source, e.g., a light emitting diode, a LiFi transmitter transmits high speed signals detectable by a photodetector. The photodetector converts the detected light to electrical current, which is further processed by the receiver to interpret the detected light.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The visible light spectrum is &#x2dc;10,000 times larger than the radio frequency spectrum. LiFi is therefore expected to increase the bandwidth achievable by WiFi alone by a factor of 100. Further, LiFi tends to be more suitable in high density and/or high interference environments, e.g., airplanes, office buildings, hospitals, power plants, etc. Thus, considerable focus has recently been given to improving LiFi technology and/or adapting LiFi technology for specific applications and/or devices.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The solution presented herein uses waveguides with multiple entrances to efficiently collect light used for light communications and propagate that collected light to a sensor.

However, the devices typically preferable for such communications are small, and have limited space available for the detectors/receivers used for such communications. Further, the space available in these devices continues to decrease due to the continual reduction in size of these devices and/or the continual addition of new features and/or hardware into these devices. For example, wearable devices (e.g., glasses, watches, etc.) are designed to have a minimal size to improve their wearability (e.g., make them lighter, more comfortable, etc.). The limited physical size of many devices, especially when combined with all the functionality intended to be included in such devices, places limitations on the location and/or size and/or number of light sensors that may be included in a light communication device.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Conventional light communication solutions require a sensor for every light capturing/entrance location of a device. For example, a device that implements light communications may include three openings in a housing of the device, where such openings are intended to, or could be used to, receive external light associated with light communications. In a conventional solution, such a device necessarily includes three sensors, one sensor disposed beneath each of the three openings, to capture the light entering each opening. Because many devices have limited space available for such sensors, such conventional solutions severely limit the number of sensors available for light communications, and thus limit the amount of light that can be collected for light communications and/or the effectiveness of light communications. Further, conventional solutions generally have challenging mechanical requirements regarding the location of the sensor and/or alignment of a sensor with the corresponding opening in order to enable the sensor to capture as much of the light entering the opening as possible. These mechanical limitations may severely limit the location options for the openings.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The solution presented herein solves many problems associated with conventional solutions by using waveguides to channel light from two or more openings to a sensor. In so doing, the solution presented herein reduces the number of sensors used for light communications, enables each sensor to capture more light associated with the light communications, and/or enables flexibility regarding the sensor size, the sensor location in the device, and/or the alignment of the sensor with any particular opening. In particular, the solution presented herein enables any number of openings to be placed anywhere on the device, while also enabling one or more sensors to be placed at any suitable location within the device, which improves the signal quality and reduces the mechanical constraints associated with LiFi.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows one exemplary light detection system <b>100</b> for light communications according to embodiments of the solution presented herein. The light detection system <b>100</b> comprises a waveguide <b>110</b> and a light sensor <b>130</b>. The waveguide <b>110</b> comprises a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) structure <b>112</b> through which light propagates, a diffusive element <b>114</b>, and two waveguide entrances <b>120</b>. Light captured at each waveguide entrance <b>120</b> propagates through the waveguide <b>110</b> within the TIR structure <b>112</b>, including when it encounters another waveguide entrance <b>120</b>, until it encounters the diffusive element <b>114</b>. The diffusive element <b>114</b> disrupts the propagation of the light to enable detection of the light by sensor <b>130</b>. The following uses generic reference numbers to generally refer to different elements, and adds a letter designation to refer to a specific one of multiple ones of the same elements. It will be appreciated that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> only shows two waveguide entrances <b>120</b> for illustrative purposes; additional waveguide entrances <b>120</b> may be included, as discussed further below.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The propagation of the light through the TIR structure <b>112</b> is at least partially controlled by the index of refraction n<sub>1 </sub>of the TIR structure <b>112</b> relative to the surrounding index/indices of refraction. When material(s) surrounding the TIR structure <b>112</b> has/have a lower refractive index than the TIR structure <b>112</b>, the TIR structure <b>112</b> functions as a TIR layer, which enables the light entering the TIR structure <b>112</b> at a TIR angle to propagate along the TIR structure <b>112</b> with total internal reflection, and thus with minimal-to-no loss. Thus, the TIR structure <b>112</b> has a first index of refraction n<sub>1</sub>, where indices of refraction, e.g., n<sub>2 </sub>and/or n<sub>3</sub>, surrounding/adjacent to the TIR structure <b>112</b> is/are less than the first index of refraction n<sub>1 </sub>such that light input to the waveguide <b>110</b> propagates along the waveguide <b>110</b> within the TIR structure <b>112</b>. While in some embodiments the indices of refraction surrounding the TIR structure <b>112</b> are all the same, the solution presented herein does not require the index/indices of refraction surrounding the TIR structure <b>112</b> to be equal. Instead the solution presented herein only requires that the index of refraction n<sub>1 </sub>of the TIR structure <b>112</b> be greater than each index of refraction of the surrounding material so that light input into the TIR structure <b>112</b> propagates along the TIR structure <b>112</b> with total internal reflection.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The desired index of refraction relationship between the TIR structure <b>112</b> and the surrounding structure(s)/material(s) may be achieved in any number of ways. For example, when the TIR structure <b>112</b> is a cylindrical tube having a first index of refraction n<sub>1</sub>, having a second index of refraction n<sub>2 </sub>surrounding the tube less than the first index of refraction (n<sub>2</sub>&#x3c;n<sub>1</sub>) causes the desired total internal reflection in the TIR structure <b>112</b>. In another example, when the TIR structure <b>112</b> is a right rectangular prism having the first index of refraction n<sub>1</sub>, having a second index of refraction n<sub>2 </sub>on one side of the TIR structure <b>112</b> that is less than the first index of refraction (n<sub>2</sub>&#x3c;n<sub>1</sub>), and a third index of refraction n<sub>3 </sub>on an opposing side of the TIR structure <b>112</b> that is also less than the first index of refraction (n<sub>3</sub>&#x3c;n<sub>1</sub>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, causes total internal reflection in the TIR structure <b>112</b>. In another example, waveguide <b>110</b> may be realized using a set of coatings or layers, where each layer/coating represents a different part of the waveguide <b>110</b>. In this example, one layer may represent a TIR layer (i.e., the TIR structure <b>112</b>), while one or more layers surrounding the TIR layer has a lower index of refraction than that of the TIR layer, and thus represents a &#x201c;reflective&#x201d; layer. Such a reflective layer may also serve as a protective layer that protects the TIR structure <b>112</b>, e.g., from scratches, debris, and/or other foreign objects. Alternatively, a protective layer separate from the reflective layer may be applied between the TIR structure <b>112</b> and the reflective layer, where the protective layer has the same or lower index of refraction as the reflective layer. The protective layer may also be used to add print (e.g., text, images, etc.) that when visible to a user of the device <b>200</b> identify any desired information related to or about the device <b>200</b>, e.g., brand name, model name/number, team affiliations, school affiliations, etc.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Diffusive element <b>114</b> is disposed along an internal edge of the TIR structure <b>112</b> at a predetermined location of the waveguide <b>110</b> to disrupt the propagation of the light along the TIR structure <b>112</b> for detection by the light sensor <b>130</b>. The diffusive element <b>114</b> comprises any material or structure that disrupts the propagation of the light within the TIR structure <b>112</b>. In some embodiments, the diffusive element <b>114</b> may direct the disrupted light to the sensor <b>130</b>. In other embodiments, the diffusive element <b>114</b> may scatter the light such that at least some of the originally propagating light is captured by the sensor <b>130</b>. In one exemplary embodiment, the diffusive element <b>114</b> comprises white or colored paint applied to the inner edge of the TIR structure <b>112</b> above the sensor <b>130</b>. In another exemplary embodiment, the diffusive element <b>114</b> is constructed by altering the material at the location of diffusive element <b>114</b> so that this location of the TIR structure <b>112</b> is no longer flat and/or smooth. For example, machined dots may be placed at the location of the diffusive area <b>114</b> or the location of the diffusive area <b>114</b> may be etched or roughened.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The light sensor <b>130</b> is disposed adjacent to an internal edge of the TIR structure <b>112</b> opposite the location of the diffusive element <b>114</b> and generally spaced from the diffusive element by a thickness t of the TIR structure <b>112</b> so that the light sensor <b>130</b> detects the disrupted light. Light sensor <b>130</b> comprises any light sensor configured to detect the light disrupted by the diffusive element, e.g., a Photo Sensitive Receptor (PSR).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Each waveguide entrance <b>120</b> comprises an opening in the housing of a device <b>200</b> so as to collect light <b>140</b>, e.g., associated with light communications, and input the collected light to the TIR structure <b>112</b> of the waveguide <b>110</b>. Further, each waveguide entrance <b>120</b> is laterally offset from the location of the diffusive element <b>114</b>/sensor <b>130</b>, where light <b>140</b> collected at one entrance propagates along the waveguide <b>110</b> to the sensor <b>130</b>. For example, waveguide entrance <b>120</b><i>a</i>, which is laterally offset along the waveguide <b>110</b> from the location of the diffusive element <b>114</b>, collects the proximate light <b>140</b><i>a</i>, while waveguide entrance <b>120</b><i>b</i>, which is laterally offset along the waveguide <b>110</b> between waveguide entrance <b>120</b><i>a </i>and the diffusive element <b>114</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, collects and inputs the proximate light <b>140</b><i>b</i>. The light <b>140</b><i>a </i>collected at waveguide entrance <b>120</b><i>a </i>propagates as light <b>116</b><i>a </i>within the TIR structure <b>112</b>, while the light <b>140</b><i>b </i>collected at waveguide entrance <b>120</b><i>b </i>propagates as light <b>116</b><i>b </i>within the TIR structure <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to the solution presented herein, each waveguide entrance <b>120</b> in one exemplary embodiment, or at least all but the waveguide entrance farthest from the diffusive element <b>114</b> along the TIR waveguide <b>110</b> (e.g., an initial waveguide entrance <b>120</b><i>a </i>at one end of the TIR waveguide <b>110</b>), is configured to maintain the TIR of light already propagating within the TIR structure <b>112</b>, in addition to collecting and directing external light <b>140</b> into the TIR structure <b>112</b>.

To continue the propagation of the light already within the TIR structure <b>112</b>, e.g., along path <b>116</b><i>a</i>, the surface of the light guide structure <b>122</b> abutting the TIR structure <b>112</b> is configured to maintain the total internal reflection of the light already propagating within the TIR structure <b>112</b>. In so doing, the solution presented herein enables the sensor <b>130</b> to detect light from multiple paths of light <b>116</b><i>a</i>, <b>116</b><i>b </i>collected at multiple waveguide entrances <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Various techniques may be used to configure the light guide structure <b>122</b> to collect and input the light <b>140</b> into the TIR structure <b>112</b>, while also maintaining the propagation of light already in the TIR waveguide <b>110</b> within the TIR structure <b>112</b>. For example, the surface of the light guide structure <b>122</b> abutting the TIR structure <b>112</b> may be polished to align with the TIR structure <b>112</b> to prevent the already propagating light from experiencing any irregular reflections, where an index of refraction of this surface, i.e., the side of the light guide structure <b>122</b> abutting the TIR structure <b>112</b>, is less than the index of refraction of the TIR structure <b>112</b>. In other exemplary embodiments, the surface of the light guide structure <b>122</b> abuts the TIR structure <b>112</b> via a coating having an index of refraction less than that of the TIR structure <b>112</b>. In either case, this may mean the index of refraction of the surface of the light guide structure <b>122</b> abutting the TIR structure <b>112</b> is equal to the index of refraction of the surrounding TIR waveguide, e.g., equal to n<sub>2 </sub>or equal to n<sub>3</sub>.

While not expressly shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, n<sub>G1 </sub>may be the same as the index of refraction of the light collection element <b>124</b> (if present) or the same as the surrounding material or air.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, the waveguide entrances <b>120</b> may include a collection element <b>124</b>, e.g., a lens or lens system (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), where the collection element <b>124</b> is configured to increase the amount of external light <b>140</b> that is input into the waveguide <b>110</b>. For example, in some embodiments, collection element <b>124</b> collimates the collected light <b>140</b> to increase the amount of collected light that enters the TIR structure <b>112</b> at the TIR angle. Thus, collection element <b>124</b> enables more light to be captured for light communications, even light that enters the waveguide <b>110</b> at an angle. When the waveguide entrance <b>120</b> includes a collection element <b>124</b>, generally the collection element <b>124</b> will have a wide Field of View (FoV) to increase the amount of collected light. Exemplary collection elements <b>124</b> include, but are not limited to a Fresnel lens <b>124</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), a plano-convex lens <b>124</b><i>c </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), etc. It will be appreciated that the use of any collection element <b>124</b> in one or more waveguide entrances <b>120</b> is optional. In some exemplary embodiments, the light guide structure <b>122</b> and the corresponding lens <b>124</b> collectively form a dual layer Fresnel lens, where the lens <b>124</b> is a first (top) layer of the dual layer Fresnel lens that collects the light <b>140</b> and light guide structure <b>122</b> is a second (bottom) layer of the dual layer Fresnel lens that directs the light into the TIR structure <b>112</b> at the TIR angle. In this example, a first (top) side of the light guide structure <b>112</b> is adjacent to the lens <b>124</b> and receives the collected light, while a second (bottom) side of the light guide structure <b>122</b> abuts the TIR structure <b>112</b> and directs the collected light into the TIR structure <b>112</b> at a TIR angle while also maintaining the TIR of any light already propagating within the TIR structure <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The waveguide entrance <b>120</b> farthest along the waveguide <b>110</b> from the sensor <b>130</b>, referred to herein as the initial waveguide entrance <b>120</b><i>a</i>, may be configured to maintain TIR of light already propagating within the TIR structure <b>112</b>, but such is not required. In some embodiments, the initial waveguide entrance <b>120</b><i>a </i>may employ a different type of guiding structure than discussed above to facilitate the propagation of the collected light into the TIR structure <b>112</b> without the requirement to maintain the propagation of any already propagating light (for the sole reason that no light has been collected prior to this initial waveguide entrance <b>120</b><i>a</i>).
