The container <b>10</b> includes a compressible portion <b>110</b> and a container base <b>120</b>. The compressible portion <b>110</b> is connected to the container base <b>120</b>. The height of the compressible portion <b>110</b> is adjustable according to the need of a user. The container base <b>120</b> may be made by a different material that is not compressible or not substantially compressible. The compressible portion <b>110</b> includes a bellow body <b>111</b>, and the bellow body <b>111</b> includes at least two convolutions <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>. Each convolution has a first living hinge <b>114</b> (such as a crest of the convolution) and a sidewall <b>115</b>. A second living hinge <b>116</b> (such as a root of two convolutions) is positioned between the two convolutions <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>. The second living hinge <b>116</b> is defined at the intersection of the convolutions <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>. The container <b>10</b> may have multiple convolutions, such as seven, or less or more, convolutions. Exemplarily, the top and the bottom of the compressible portion <b>110</b> each has a half of a convolution, and there are six convolutions between the top and bottom half convolutions. Further, the compressible portion <b>110</b> and the container base <b>120</b> can be made of silicone. The container base <b>120</b> can also be made of polypropylene or other material that has a rigidity higher than silicone.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The bellow body <b>111</b> further includes at least one moveable bump structure <b>210</b>. The bump structure <b>210</b> is positioned between the two convolutions <b>112</b>, <b>113</b> to space two first living hinges <b>114</b> apart. In this embodiment, the container <b>10</b> includes seven moveable bump structures <b>210</b> as an example. The bump structure <b>210</b> is movable between an outer position (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) and an inner position (when a user has pushed the bump structure inwards, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>G</figref>) relative to a container interior <b>11</b>. The bellow body <b>111</b> may include multiple duplicated layers. For example, the bellow body <b>111</b> may have multiple bump structures <b>210</b>, which are positioned between two convolutions of the bellow body <b>111</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> as an example, there are seven bump structures in the compressible portion <b>110</b>. It should be noted that the bump structure <b>210</b> is not necessarily a rounded structure. It can be a raised structure with any shape, such as, for example, a rectangular bump, a triangle bump, or a tent-shaped bump. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> are illustrative cross-sectional views of the bump structure <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Additionally, the bump structures <b>210</b> are provided at two opposite sides of the compressible portion <b>110</b>. In other implementations, the bump structures <b>210</b> can be provided on one side, two adjacent sides, three sides, or even all sides of the compressible portion <b>110</b>. The length or size of the bump structures <b>210</b> at the different sides of the compressible portion <b>110</b> can be different. For example, the bump structures <b>210</b> on a shorter side of the compressible portion <b>110</b> may be shorter than bump structures <b>210</b> on a longer side of the compressible portion <b>110</b>, or vice versa. Further, the bump structures <b>210</b> can be provided between every convolution (as shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) or every two, three, or more convolutions. The bump structures <b>210</b> can distribute unevenly within one side of the compressible portion <b>110</b>, and the bump structures <b>210</b> can have different distributions among different sides of the compressible portion <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Specifically, when the bump structure <b>210</b> is the an outer position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the bump structure <b>210</b> provides support to the adjacent convolutions and helps the container <b>10</b> to maintain the height of the compressible portion <b>110</b>. When a user wants to compress the compressible portion <b>110</b> to reduce the overall height of the container <b>10</b>, the user can push a certain amount of bump structures <b>210</b> inwards toward the container interior <b>11</b>. Once a bump structure <b>210</b> is pressed inwards, the adjacent convolutions can be folded or compressed more easily. For example, a user can push all the seven bump structures inwards and to fully compress the compressible portion <b>110</b>. Likewise, a user can choose to push only two, three, or five bump structures <b>210</b> inwards to reduce the height of the compressible portion <b>110</b> by a smaller amount. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>F and <b>1</b>G</figref> show the front views of the container <b>10</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>G</figref> some bump structures <b>210</b> are indented and some are not. It should be noted that, in this embodiment, the bump structure <b>210</b> can be situated in two stable positions, the inner position or the outer position, based on the rigidity of the material of the bump structures <b>210</b>, such as silicone.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Further, when the bump structure <b>210</b> is pushed inwards toward the container interior <b>11</b>, the side wall (which may be connected to two adjacent first living hinges <b>114</b>) of the movable bump structure <b>210</b> can be coplanar or roughly coplanar with the sidewalls <b>115</b> of the convolutions <b>112</b> and <b>113</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>G</figref>. On the other hand, the surface of the movable bump structure <b>210</b> can have an offset with the surface of the sidewalls <b>115</b> of the convolutions <b>112</b> and <b>113</b> when the movable bump structure <b>210</b> is indented.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Likewise, a user can push the indented bump structures <b>210</b> outwards to use the bump structures <b>210</b> to maintain the rigidity of the compressible portion <b>110</b>.

Exemplarily, the lid <b>320</b> can rotate for approximately 270 degrees, and the lid <b>320</b> can be made of polypropylene. The lid base <b>310</b> further includes a protrusion <b>319</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref>), and the protrusion <b>319</b> is used to engage with the lid <b>320</b> to secure the lid <b>320</b> in a closed status.

The through holes <b>316</b> may be distributed around the periphery of the lid base <b>310</b>. The connecting parts <b>317</b> are formed by a molding process, such that the gasket <b>117</b> and the second skirt <b>118</b> are formed together with the same material, such as silicone. The lid base <b>310</b> is thereby affixed with the gasket <b>117</b> and the second skirt <b>118</b> with the connection of the first skirt <b>314</b> with the gasket <b>117</b> and the second skirt <b>118</b>. The lid base <b>310</b> is thereby affixed with the compressible portion <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">For manufacturing, the container <b>10</b> can, for example, be made by an insert molding process. Specifically, the lid base <b>310</b> can be prepared first by a molding process, such as an injection molding. The lid base <b>310</b> can be made of polypropylene. Then, the body of the container <b>10</b>, such as the container base <b>120</b> and the compressible portion <b>110</b>, can be affixed together with the lid base <b>310</b> by insert molding. The container base <b>120</b> and the compressible portion <b>110</b> therefore can be formed in the same molding process. The lid base <b>310</b> has a wall <b>318</b>, and the wall <b>318</b> surrounds the first skirt <b>314</b>, the gasket <b>117</b>, and the second skirt <b>118</b>. That is, the geometry of the lid base <b>310</b> is larger than the compressible portion <b>110</b> and the container base <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A to <b>3</b>F</figref>, the container <b>10</b> includes at least one valve or vent <b>400</b>, such as a one-way valve or vent. When the container <b>10</b> is compressed, the valve <b>400</b> can discharge the air in the container <b>10</b> in reaction to the force is exerted on the container <b>10</b>. Otherwise, the valve <b>400</b> remains closed when there is no sufficient air pressure from the container interior <b>11</b> to open the value, such that the air outside the container <b>10</b> does not easily enter the container <b>10</b>. As an example, the food stored therein can thereby be preserved better.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Exemplarily, the valve or vent <b>400</b> can be configured as part of the compressible portion <b>110</b>. For example, the valve <b>400</b> can be situated underneath the second skirt <b>118</b> of the compressible portion <b>110</b>. The valve <b>400</b> can be situated next to the inner surface of the wall <b>318</b> of the lid base <b>310</b>. The valve <b>400</b> may include a rib <b>424</b> and a pair of leaflets <b>420</b>. The pair of leaflets <b>420</b> extend from the rib oppositely, and a thickness of each of the leaflets <b>420</b> gradually reduces along with the leaflet <b>420</b> in a direction extending away from the rib <b>424</b>. Specifically, the end of the leaflet <b>420</b> attached to the rib <b>424</b> has the largest thickness, and the end of the leaflet <b>420</b> opposite to the rib <b>424</b> has the smallest thickness. The leaflet <b>420</b> can be in a shape of a triangular prism or a trapezoidal prism. This design facilitates the leaflet <b>420</b> to deform to allow the air to pass the valve <b>400</b> and discharge. The valve <b>400</b> and the leaflet <b>420</b> can be made of silicone to provide proper flexibility. The valve <b>400</b> and the leaflet <b>420</b> can be formed during the same molding process as the compressible portion <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Further, the lid base <b>310</b> may define at least one channel <b>410</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>). The channel includes a first branch <b>412</b> and a second branch <b>414</b>, where the first branch <b>412</b> and the second branch <b>414</b> are substantially perpendicular to each other. The first branch <b>412</b> defines an opening <b>416</b> of the channel <b>410</b> to the container interior <b>11</b>, and the second branch <b>414</b> stacks with the pair of leaflets <b>420</b> of the valve <b>400</b>. Exemplarily, the container <b>10</b> has two channels <b>410</b>, which form two openings <b>416</b>. The channels <b>410</b> can be in a T shape. When the air in the container interior <b>11</b> flows into the opening <b>416</b>, the air flows along the first branch <b>412</b>. Then the air is diverted into two paths when the air reaches the end of the first branch <b>412</b>. The air then enters the second branch <b>414</b>. The second branch <b>414</b> overlaps with the leaflets <b>420</b>, such that when the pressure in the container exceeds a certain threshold, the air in the container <b>10</b> will push the leaflets <b>420</b> to deform and will be discharged as the valve <b>400</b> is opened. Otherwise, the leaflets <b>420</b> remain their original position when there is no sufficient air pressure from the container interior <b>11</b> to deform the leaflets <b>420</b>, such that the air outside the container <b>10</b> does not easily enter the container <b>10</b>. As an example, the food stored therein can thereby be preserved better.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one embodiment, the first branch <b>412</b> aligns with the rib <b>424</b>, and the second branch <b>414</b> aligns with the leaflet <b>420</b>. Further, the leaflet <b>420</b> may extend outwards over the end of the second branch <b>414</b> to ensure that the second branch <b>414</b> is fully covered by the leaflet <b>420</b>. That is, the length of the second branch <b>414</b> is smaller than the total length of the two leaflets <b>420</b> and the rib <b>424</b> along the longitudinal axis of the second branch <b>414</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one embodiment, a ratio (H1/H2) of a height of the compressible portion <b>110</b> (H1) to a height of the container base <b>120</b> (H2), when the compressible portion <b>110</b> is fully expanded, is less than 2.0.
