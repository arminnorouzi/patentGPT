For example, laparoscopic procedures can involve creating a number of small incisions in the patient (e.g., in the abdomen) and introducing one or more surgical tools (e.g., end effectors and an endoscope) through the incisions into the patient. Bronchoscopy can involve passing a bronchoscope through a patient's nose and/or mouth, down the patient's throat, and into the patient's lungs. Surgical procedures may then be performed using the introduced surgical tools and with visualization aid provided by the endoscope, for example.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0048">MIS may provide certain benefits, such as reduced patient scarring, less patient pain, shorter patient recovery periods, and/or lower medical treatment costs associated with patient recovery. Recent technological developments allow robotic systems to perform more MIS procedures. The robotic systems typically include one or more robotic arms for manipulating surgical tools based on commands from a remote operator (e.g. surgeon/clinician). A robotic arm may, for example, support at its distal end various surgical devices such as surgical end effectors, imaging devices, and cannulas for providing access to the patient's body cavity and organs.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0049">Existing robotically-assisted surgical systems typically consist of a surgeon console and a patient-side cart with one or more interactive robotic arms controlled from the console. For example, one robotic arm can support a camera and the other robotic arm(s) can support robotic tools such as scalpels, scissors, graspers, and staplers, for example. Various exemplary robotic tools are further described herein.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0050">A robotic surgical system disclosed herein can be a software-controlled, electro-mechanical system designed for clinicians to perform MIS procedures. The robotic surgical system can be used with an endoscope, compatible endoscopic instruments, and accessories. The system may be used by trained clinicians (e.g. physicians/surgeons) in an operating room environment to assist in the accurate control of compatible endoscopic instruments during robotically-assisted urologic, gynecologic, gastrological, and other laparoscopic surgical procedures. The compatible endoscopic instruments and accessories for use with the surgical system are intended for endoscopic manipulation of tissue including stapling, grasping, cutting, blunt and sharp dissection, approximation, ligation, electrocautery, and suturing, for example.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0051">An exemplary robotic system <b>2100</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, which depicts a cart-based robotically-enabled system arranged for a diagnostic and/or therapeutic bronchoscopy procedure. During a bronchoscopy, the system <b>2100</b> may include a cart <b>2110</b> having one or more robotic arms <b>2112</b> to deliver a surgical device, such as a steerable endoscope <b>2113</b>, which may be a procedure-specific bronchoscope for bronchoscopy, to a natural orifice access point (i.e., the mouth of the patient positioned on a table in the present example) to deliver diagnostic and/or therapeutic tools. As shown, the cart <b>2110</b> may be positioned proximate to the patient's upper torso in order to provide access to the access point. Similarly, the robotic arms <b>2112</b> may be actuated to position the bronchoscope relative to the access point. The arrangement in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may also be utilized when performing a gastro-intestinal (GI) procedure with a gastroscope, a specialized endoscope for GI procedures.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0052">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, once the cart <b>2110</b> is properly positioned, the robotic arms <b>2112</b> may insert the steerable endoscope <b>2113</b> into the patient robotically, manually, or a combination thereof. The endoscope <b>2113</b> may be directed down the patient's trachea and lungs after insertion using precise commands from the robotic system until reaching the target destination or operative site. For example, the endoscope <b>2113</b> may be directed to deliver a biopsy needle to a target, such as, for example, a lesion or nodule within the lungs of a patient. The needle may be deployed down a working channel that runs the length of the endoscope to obtain a tissue sample to be analyzed by a pathologist. Depending on the pathology results, additional tools may be deployed down the working channel of the endoscope for additional biopsies. After identifying a nodule to be malignant, the endoscope <b>2113</b> may endoscopically deliver tools to resect the potentially cancerous tissue. In some instances, diagnostic and therapeutic treatments can be delivered in separate procedures. In those circumstances, the endoscope <b>2113</b> may also be used to deliver a fiducial to &#x201c;mark&#x201d; the location of the target nodule as well. In other instances, diagnostic and therapeutic treatments may be delivered during the same procedure.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0053">The system <b>2100</b> may also include a movable tower <b>2130</b>, which may be connected via support cables to the cart <b>2110</b> to provide support for controls, electronics, fluidics, optics, sensors, and/or power to the cart <b>2110</b>. Placing such functionality in the tower <b>2130</b> allows for a smaller form factor cart <b>2110</b> that may be more easily adjusted and/or re-positioned by an operating clinician (e.g. surgeon) and his/her staff. Additionally, the division of functionality between the cart/table and the tower <b>2130</b> reduces operating room clutter and facilitates improving clinical workflow. While the cart <b>2110</b> may be positioned close to the patient, the tower <b>2130</b> may be stowed in a remote location to stay out of the way during a procedure.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0054">In support of the robotic systems described above, the tower <b>2130</b> may include component(s) of a computer-based control system that stores computer program instructions, for example, within a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium such as a persistent magnetic storage drive, solid state drive, etc. The execution of those instructions, whether the execution occurs in the tower <b>2130</b> or the cart <b>2110</b>, may control the entire system or sub-system(s) thereof. For example, when executed by a processor of the computer system, the instructions may cause the components of the robotics system to actuate the relevant carriages and arm mounts, actuate the robotics arms, and control the robotic surgical tools. For example, in response to receiving the control signal, the motors in the joints of the robotics arms may position the arms into a certain posture.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0055">The tower <b>2130</b> may also include a pump, flow meter, valve control, and/or fluid access in order to provide controlled irrigation and aspiration capabilities to the system that may be deployed through the endoscope <b>2113</b>. These components may also be controlled using the computer system of tower <b>2130</b>. In some aspects, irrigation and aspiration capabilities may be delivered directly to the endoscope <b>2113</b> through separate cable(s).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0056">The tower <b>2130</b> may include a voltage and surge protector designed to provide filtered and protected electrical power to the cart <b>2110</b>, thereby avoiding placement of a power transformer and other auxiliary power components in the cart <b>2110</b>, resulting in a smaller, more moveable cart <b>2110</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0057">The tower <b>2130</b> may also include support equipment for the sensors deployed throughout the robotic system <b>2100</b>. For example, the tower <b>2130</b> may include opto-electronics equipment for detecting, receiving, and processing data received from the optical sensors or cameras throughout the robotic system <b>2100</b>. In combination with the control system, such opto-electronics equipment may be used to generate real-time images for display in any number of consoles deployed throughout the system, including in the tower <b>2130</b>. Similarly, the tower <b>2130</b> may also include an electronic subsystem for receiving and processing signals received from deployed electromagnetic (EM) sensors. The tower <b>2130</b> may also be used to house and position an EM field generator for detection by EM sensors in or on the robotic surgical tool. The tower <b>2130</b> can also house an electrosurgical generator for supplying RF current to a robotic surgical tool, such as monopolar scissors, for example.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0058">The tower <b>2130</b> may also include a console <b>2132</b> in addition to other consoles available in the rest of the system, e.g., a console mounted on top of the cart <b>2110</b>. The console <b>2132</b> may include a user interface and a display screen, such as a touchscreen, for the clinician. Consoles in the system <b>2100</b> are generally designed to provide both robotic controls as well as pre-operative and real-time information of the procedure, such as navigational and localization information of the endoscope <b>2113</b>. When the console <b>2132</b> is not the only console available to the clinician, it may be used by a second clinician, such as a nurse, for example, to monitor the health or vitals of the patient and the operation of system, as well as provide procedure-specific data, such as navigational and localization information. In other aspects, the console <b>2132</b> is housed in a body that is separate from the tower <b>2130</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0059">The tower <b>2130</b> may be coupled to the cart <b>2110</b> and endoscope <b>2113</b> through one or more cables or connections. In some aspects, the support functionality from the tower <b>2130</b> may be provided through a single cable to the cart <b>2110</b>, simplifying and de-cluttering the operating room. In other aspects, specific functionality may be coupled in separate cabling and connections. For example, while power may be provided through a single power cable to the cart, the support for controls, optics, fluidics, and/or navigation may be provided through one or more separate cables.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts the cart <b>2110</b> from the cart-based robotically-enabled system <b>2100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The cart <b>2110</b> generally includes an elongated support structure <b>2114</b> (often referred to as a &#x201c;column&#x201d;), a cart base <b>2115</b>, and a console <b>2116</b> at the top of the elongated support structure <b>2114</b>. The elongated support structure <b>2114</b> may include one or more carriages, such as a carriage <b>2117</b> (alternatively &#x201c;arm support&#x201d;) for supporting the deployment of one or more robotic arms <b>2112</b> (three shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The carriage <b>2117</b> may include individually configurable arm mounts that rotate along a perpendicular axis to adjust the base of the robotic arms <b>2112</b> for better positioning relative to the patient. The carriage <b>2117</b> also includes a carriage interface <b>2119</b> that allows the carriage <b>2117</b> to vertically translate along the elongated support structure <b>2114</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0061">The carriage interface <b>2119</b> is connected to the elongated support structure <b>2114</b> through slots, such as slot <b>2120</b>, that are positioned on opposite sides of the elongated support structure <b>2114</b> to guide the vertical translation of the carriage <b>2117</b>. The slot <b>2120</b> contains a vertical translation interface to position and hold the carriage at various vertical heights relative to the cart base <b>2115</b>. Vertical translation of the carriage <b>2117</b> allows the cart <b>2110</b> to adjust the reach of the robotic arms <b>2112</b> to meet a variety of table heights, patient sizes, and physician preferences. Similarly, the individually configurable arm mounts on the carriage <b>2117</b> allow the robotic arm base <b>2121</b> of robotic arms <b>2112</b> to be angled in a variety of configurations.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0062">The elongated support structure <b>2114</b> may include internal mechanisms, such as gears and motors, that are designed to use a vertically aligned lead screw to translate the carriage <b>2117</b> in a mechanized fashion in response to control signals generated in response to user inputs, e.g., inputs from the console <b>2116</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0063">The robotic arms <b>2112</b> may generally include robotic arm bases <b>2121</b> and tool drivers <b>2122</b>, separated by a series of linkages <b>2123</b> that are connected by a series of joints <b>2124</b>, each joint including an independent actuator, each actuator including an independently controllable motor. Each independently controllable joint represents an independent degree of freedom available to the robotic arm. Each of the arms <b>2112</b> have seven joints, and thus provide seven degrees of freedom. A multitude of joints result in a multitude of degrees of freedom, allowing for &#x201c;redundant&#x201d; degrees of freedom. Redundant degrees of freedom allow the robotic arms <b>2112</b> to position their respective tool drivers <b>2122</b> at a specific position, orientation, and trajectory in space using different linkage positions and joint angles. This allows for the system to position and direct a robotic surgical tool from a desired point in space while allowing the clinician to move the arm joints into a clinically advantageous position away from the patient to create greater access while avoiding arm collisions.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0064">The cart base <b>2115</b> balances the weight of the elongated support structure <b>2114</b>, carriage <b>2117</b>, and arms <b>2112</b> over the floor. Accordingly, the cart base <b>2115</b> houses heavier components, such as electronics, motors, power supply, as well as components that either enable movement and/or immobilize the cart. For example, the cart base <b>2115</b> includes rollable wheel-shaped casters <b>2125</b> that allow for the cart <b>2110</b> to easily move around the room prior to a procedure. After reaching the appropriate position, the casters <b>2125</b> may be immobilized using wheel locks to hold the cart <b>2110</b> in place during the procedure.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0065">Positioned at a vertical end of elongated support structure <b>2114</b>, the console <b>2116</b> allows for both a user interface for receiving user input and a display screen (or a dual-purpose device such as, for example, a touchscreen <b>2126</b>) to provide the clinician with both pre-operative and intra-operative data. Potential pre-operative data on the touchscreen <b>2126</b> may include pre-operative plans, navigation and mapping data derived from pre-operative computerized tomography (CT) scans, and/or notes from pre-operative patient interviews. Intra-operative data on display may include optical information provided from the tool, sensor and coordinate information from sensors, as well as vital patient statistics, such as respiration, heart rate, and/or pulse. The console <b>2116</b> may be positioned and tilted to allow a clinician to access the console from the side of the elongated support structure <b>2114</b> opposite carriage <b>2117</b>. From this position, the clinician may view the console <b>2116</b>, robotic arms <b>2112</b>, and patient while operating the console <b>2116</b> from behind the cart <b>2110</b>. As shown, the console <b>2116</b> also includes a handle <b>2127</b> to assist with maneuvering and stabilizing cart <b>2110</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0066">The distal end of the system's robotic arms include the tool driver <b>2122</b> (alternatively referred to as &#x201c;instrument drive mechanism&#x201d; or &#x201c;instrument device manipulator&#x201d; (IDM)) that incorporate electro-mechanical means for actuating the robotic tool. A removable or detachable robotic tool can be releasably mounted to the tool driver <b>2122</b>. The robotic tool can be devoid of any electro-mechanical components, such as motors. This dichotomy may be driven by the need to sterilize robotic surgical tools used in medical procedures, and the inability to adequately sterilize expensive capital equipment due to their intricate mechanical assemblies and sensitive electronics. Accordingly, the robotic surgical tools may be designed to be detached, removed, and interchanged from the instrument driver (and thus the system) for individual sterilization or disposal by the clinician or the clinician's staff. In contrast, the instrument drivers need not be changed or sterilized, and may be draped for protection.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> illustrate an example tool driver paired with a robotic surgical tool. The tool drivers are positioned at the distal end <b>2222</b> of a robotic arm <b>2212</b>, which can be similar in many aspects to the robotic arms <b>2112</b>. Positioned at the distal end <b>2222</b> of the robotic arm <b>2212</b>, the tool drivers comprises one or more drive units arranged with parallel axes to provide controlled torque to a robotic surgical tool via drive shafts. Each drive unit includes an individual drive shaft for interacting with the instrument, a gear head for converting the motor shaft rotation to a desired torque, a motor for generating the drive torque, an encoder to measure the speed of the motor shaft and provide feedback to the control circuitry, and control circuitry for receiving control signals and actuating the drive unit. Each drive unit being independently controlled and motorized, the tool driver may provide multiple (four as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>) independent drive outputs to the robotic surgical tool. In operation, the control circuitry can receive a control signal, transmit a motor signal to the motor, compare the resulting motor speed as measured by the encoder with the desired speed, and modulate the motor signal to generate the desired torque, for example.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0068">For procedures that require a sterile environment, the robotic system may incorporate a drive interface, such as a sterile adapter connected to a sterile drape, that sits between the tool driver and the robotic surgical tool. The chief purpose of the sterile adapter is to transfer angular motion from the drive shafts of the tool driver to the drive inputs of the instrument while maintaining physical separation, and thus sterility, between the drive shafts and drive inputs. Accordingly, an example sterile adapter may comprise of a series of rotational inputs and outputs intended to be mated with the drive shafts of the tool driver and drive inputs on the instrument. Connected to the sterile adapter, the sterile drape, comprised of a thin, flexible material such as transparent or translucent plastic, is designed to cover the capital equipment, such as the tool driver, the robotic arm, and the cart (in a cart-based system) or table (in a table-based system). Use of the drape would allow the capital equipment to be positioned proximate to the patient while still being located in an area not requiring sterilization (i.e., non-sterile field). On the other side of the sterile drape, the robotic surgical tool may interface with the patient in an area requiring sterilization (i.e., sterile field).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0069">Robotic surgical platforms like the robotic surgical system <b>2100</b> are further described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2021/0059777, titled ARTICULATING INCLUDING ANTAGONISTIC CONTROLS FOR ARTICULATION AND CALIBRATION, published Mar. 4, 2021.

The tool driver <b>2275</b> can be coupled to a distal end <b>2222</b> of the robotic arm <b>2212</b>. Like other surgical tools designed for use with a robotic system, the robotic surgical tool <b>2270</b> includes an elongated shaft <b>2271</b> (or elongate body) and a housing (or base) <b>2272</b>. The housing <b>2272</b>, can also be referred to as an &#x201c;instrument handle&#x201d; due to its intended design for manual interaction by the clinician when attaching or coupling the surgical tool <b>2270</b> to the tool driver <b>2275</b> on the robotic arm <b>2212</b>. The housing <b>2272</b> includes rotatable drive inputs <b>2273</b>, e.g., receptacles, pulleys or spools, that are designed to be mated with drive outputs <b>2274</b> that extend through a drive interface on tool driver <b>2275</b> at the distal end <b>2222</b> of the robotic arm <b>2212</b>. When physically connected, latched, and/or coupled, the mated drive inputs <b>2273</b> of housing <b>2272</b> may share axes of rotation with the drive outputs <b>2274</b> in the tool driver <b>2275</b> to allow the transfer of torque from drive outputs <b>2274</b> to drive inputs <b>2273</b>. In some instances, the drive outputs <b>2274</b> may include splines that are designed to mate with receptacles on the drive inputs <b>2273</b>. The drive outputs <b>2274</b> (and drive inputs <b>2273</b> when drivingly coupled thereto) are configured to rotate about axes parallel with a central axis <b>2276</b> defined through the tool driver <b>2275</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0071">The elongated shaft <b>2271</b> is designed to be delivered through either an anatomical opening or lumen, e.g., as in endoscopy, or a minimally invasive incision, e.g., as in laparoscopy. The elongated shaft <b>2271</b> may be either flexible (e.g., having properties similar to an endoscope) or rigid (e.g., having properties similar to a laparoscope) or contain a customized combination of both flexible and rigid portions. In an unflexed configuration, the elongated shaft <b>2271</b> extends along a longitudinal axis <b>2277</b>, which is transverse to the central axis <b>2276</b> of the tool driver <b>2275</b>. When designed for laparoscopy, the distal end of a rigid elongated shaft may be connected to an end effector extending from a jointed wrist formed from a clevis with at least one degree of freedom and a surgical tool or robotic surgical tool, such as, for example, a grasper, scissors, a stapler, or other surgical device. The end effector can be actuated based on force from the tendons as the drive inputs <b>2273</b> rotate in response to torque received from the drive outputs <b>2274</b> of the tool driver <b>2275</b>. Various highly articulatable robotic surgical tools are further described herein. When designed for endoscopy, the distal end of a flexible elongated shaft may include a steerable or controllable bending section that may be articulated and bent based on torque received from the drive outputs <b>2274</b> of the tool driver <b>2275</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0072">Torque from the tool driver <b>2275</b> is transmitted down the elongated shaft <b>2271</b> using tendons along the shaft <b>2271</b>. These individual tendons, such as pull wires, may be individually anchored to individual drive inputs <b>2273</b> within the housing <b>2272</b>. From the housing <b>2272</b>, the tendons are directed down one or more pull lumens along the elongated shaft <b>2271</b> and anchored at the distal portion of the elongated shaft <b>2271</b> or in the wrist at the distal portion of the elongated shaft <b>2271</b>. During a surgical procedure, such as a laparoscopic, endoscopic or hybrid procedure, these tendons may be coupled to a distally mounted end effector, such as a grasper or scissors, for example. Under such an arrangement, torque exerted on drive inputs <b>2273</b> would transfer tension to the tendon, thereby causing the end effector to actuate in some way. In some instances, during a surgical procedure, the tendon may cause a joint to rotate about an axis, thereby causing the end effector to move in one direction or another. Alternatively, the tendon may be connected to one or more jaws of a grasper at distal end of the elongated shaft <b>2271</b>, where tension from the tendon cause the grasper to close.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0073">In endoscopy, the tendons may be coupled to a bending or articulating section positioned along the elongated shaft <b>2271</b> (e.g., at the distal end) via adhesive, a control ring, or other mechanical fixation. When fixedly attached to the distal end of a bending section, torque exerted on drive inputs <b>2273</b> would be transmitted down the tendons, causing the softer, bending section (sometimes referred to as the articulable section or region) to bend or articulate. Along the non-bending sections, it may be advantageous to spiral or helix the individual pull lumens that direct the individual tendons along (or inside) the walls of the endoscope shaft to balance the radial forces that result from tension in the pull wires. The angle of the spiraling and/or spacing there between may be altered or engineered for specific purposes, wherein tighter spiraling exhibits lesser shaft compression under load forces, while lower amounts of spiraling results in greater shaft compression under load forces, but also exhibits limits bending. On the other end of the spectrum, the pull lumens may be directed parallel to the longitudinal axis of the elongated shaft <b>2271</b> to allow for controlled articulation in the desired bending or articulable sections.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0074">In endoscopy, the elongated shaft <b>2271</b> houses a number of components to assist with the robotic procedure. The shaft may include a working channel for deploying surgical tools (or robotic surgical tools), irrigation, and/or aspiration to the operative region at the distal end of the shaft <b>2271</b>. The shaft <b>2271</b> may also accommodate wires and/or optical fibers to transfer signals to/from an optical assembly at the distal tip, which may include an optical camera. The shaft <b>2271</b> may also accommodate optical fibers to carry light from proximally-located light sources, such as light emitting diodes, to the distal end of the shaft. In various instances, an RF electrode can extend through the elongated shaft <b>2271</b> and can be configured to deliver RF energy to a distal end effector of the robotic surgical tool <b>2270</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0075">At the distal end of the robotic surgical tool <b>2270</b>, the distal tip may also comprise the opening of a working channel for delivering tools for diagnostic and/or therapy, irrigation, and aspiration to an operative site. The distal tip may also include a port for a camera, such as a fiberscope or a digital camera, to capture images of an internal anatomical space. Relatedly, the distal tip may also include ports for light sources for illuminating the anatomical space when using the camera.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0076">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the drive shaft axes, and thus the drive input axes, are parallel to the central axis <b>2276</b> of the tool driver <b>2275</b> and orthogonal to the longitudinal axis <b>2277</b> of the elongated shaft. This arrangement, however, can complicate roll capabilities for the elongated shaft <b>2271</b> in certain instances. Rolling the elongated shaft <b>2271</b> along its longitudinal axis <b>2277</b> while keeping the drive inputs <b>2273</b> static may result in undesirable tangling of the tendons as they extend off the drive inputs <b>2273</b> and enter pull lumens within the elongated shaft <b>2271</b>. The resulting entanglement of such tendons may disrupt any control algorithms intended to predict movement of the flexible elongated shaft during an endoscopic procedure.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates another tool driver <b>2285</b> and a paired robotic surgical tool <b>2280</b> where the axes of the drive units are parallel to an axis defined by an elongated shaft <b>2281</b> of the surgical tool <b>2280</b>. As shown, a circular tool driver <b>2285</b> comprises four drive units with their drive outputs <b>2284</b> aligned in parallel at the end of the robotic arm <b>2212</b>. The drive units, and their respective drive outputs <b>2284</b>, are housed in a rotational assembly <b>2278</b> of the tool driver <b>2285</b> that is driven by one of the drive units within the rotational assembly <b>2278</b>. In response to torque provided by the rotational drive unit, the rotational assembly <b>2278</b> rotates along a circular bearing that connects the rotational assembly <b>2278</b> to a non-rotational portion <b>2279</b> of the tool driver <b>2285</b>. Power and controls signals may be communicated from the non-rotational portion <b>2279</b> of the tool driver <b>2285</b> to the rotational assembly <b>2278</b> through electrical contacts, which can be maintained through rotation by a brushed slip ring connection. In other aspects of the present disclosure, the rotational assembly <b>2278</b> may be responsive to a separate drive unit that is integrated into the non-rotational portion <b>2279</b>, and thus not in parallel to the other drive units. The rotational assembly <b>2278</b> allows the tool driver <b>2285</b> to rotate the drive units, and their respective drive outputs <b>2284</b>, as a single unit around a tool driver axis <b>2286</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0078">Similar to the robotic surgical tool <b>2270</b>, the robotic surgical tool <b>2280</b> includes an elongated shaft portion <b>2281</b> and a housing <b>2282</b> (shown as transparent in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> for illustrative purposes) including a plurality of drive inputs <b>2283</b> (such as receptacles, pulleys, and spools) that are configured to receive the drive outputs <b>2284</b> in the tool driver <b>2285</b>. Shaft <b>2281</b> extends from the center of the housing <b>2282</b> along a longitudinal axis <b>2287</b> substantially parallel to the axes of the drive inputs <b>2283</b>, rather than orthogonal thereto as in the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0079">When coupled to the rotational assembly <b>2278</b> of the tool driver <b>2285</b>, the robotic surgical tool <b>2280</b>, comprising the housing <b>2282</b> and shaft <b>2281</b>, rotates in combination with the rotational assembly <b>2278</b> about a central axis <b>2286</b> defined through the tool driver <b>2285</b>. Since the shaft <b>2281</b> is positioned at the center of the housing <b>2282</b>, the shaft <b>2281</b> is coaxial with tool driver's central axis <b>2286</b> when attached.

Moreover, as the rotational assembly <b>2278</b> rotates with the shaft <b>2281</b>, any tendons connected to the drive inputs <b>2283</b> in the housing <b>2282</b> are not tangled during rotation. Accordingly, the parallelism of the axes of the drive outputs <b>2284</b>, drive inputs <b>2283</b>, and shaft <b>2281</b> allows for the shaft rotation without tangling any control tendons.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0080">In other instances, the tool drives may include a different configuration of actuated drives.

Tools can include tool-based insertion architectures that reduce the reliance on robotic arms for insertion. In other words, insertion of a surgical tool (e.g., towards a surgical site) can be facilitated by the design and architecture of the surgical tool. For example, in some instances, wherein a tool comprises an elongated shaft and a handle, the architecture of the tool enables the elongated shaft to translate longitudinally relative to the handle along an axis of insertion. Various advantages of tool-based insertion architectures are further described in U.S. Pat.

In such instances, the surgical tool <b>2400</b> can be moved along the insertion axis without reliance&#x2014;or with less reliance&#x2014;on movement of a robotic arm. The surgical tool <b>2400</b> includes an elongated shaft <b>2402</b>, an end effector <b>2412</b> connected to the shaft <b>2402</b>, and a handle <b>2420</b>, which may also be referred to as an instrument housing or base, coupled to the shaft <b>2402</b>.

The attachment interface <b>2422</b> is capable of attaching to the tool driver <b>2300</b> via a front-mount, back-mount and/or top mount. When physically connected, latched, and/or coupled together, the mated mechanical inputs <b>2424</b> of the instrument handle <b>2420</b> may share axes of rotation with the torque couplers <b>2314</b> of the tool driver <b>2300</b>, thereby allowing the transfer of torque from the motors in the tool driver <b>2300</b> to the instrument handle <b>2420</b>. In some instances, the torque couplers <b>2314</b> may comprise splines that are designed to mate with receptacles on the mechanical inputs. Cables <b>2430</b> that actuate the end effector <b>2412</b> engage the receptacles, pulleys, or spools of the handle <b>2420</b>, such that the transfer of torque from the tool driver <b>2300</b> to the instrument handle <b>2420</b> results in actuation of the end effector <b>2412</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0092">The surgical tool <b>2400</b> can include a first actuation mechanism that controls actuation of the end effector <b>2412</b>.

Additionally or alternatively, ball spline rotary shafts that travel down a length of a tool can also be used to transmit forces in a mechanically-remote way. Various actuation mechanisms are further described in U.S. Pat.

The surgical stapler can integrally include or be adapted to receive one or more staple cartridges (e.g. a replaceable staple cartridge) therein. A staple cartridge can include multiple longitudinal rows of staple cavities and a longitudinal knife slot, in certain instances. Staples are contained within the staple cavities and are configured to be sequentially fired during a firing stroke (e.g. a proximal-to-distal firing stroke) of a firing member (e.g. an E-beam or I-beam) through the staple cartridge. In various instances, a rotary drive shaft can transmit the firing forces to the firing member. For example, rotation of the rotary drive shaft in the end effector can move the firing member during the firing stroke to engage a sled, staple drivers, and/or staple drivers and to drive the staples into tissue.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0095">In certain instances, a replaceable staple cartridge can be removed from a surgical stapler and replaced with a new or fresh staple cartridge before initiating a subsequent stapling motion. For example, the end effector <b>2412</b> can be structured and dimensioned to receive a removable staple cartridge therein. Removal and installation of a replaceable staple cartridge is often completed at the surgical site by a clinician, such as surgeon and/or nurse assisting in the surgical procedure. In various instances, it can require a large amount of force applied in a particular direction to remove the staple cartridge from the cartridge jaw. For example, a clinician may knock or push a bottom surface of the cartridge jaw against a surface (e.g. a table or hand) in the operating room to release the replaceable staple cartridge installed therein. The force can disengage engagement features between the replaceable staple cartridge and the cartridge jaw, which can allow the replaceable staple cartridge to pivot out of the cartridge jaw.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> is a schematic of a surgical stapling assembly <b>2600</b> including a staple cartridge <b>2620</b> and a cartridge jaw <b>2610</b>. The staple cartridge <b>2620</b> can include multiple rows of deployable fasteners (e.g. staples), which can be sequentially lifted from within the cartridge body and driven into tissue to form a seal, for example. The force to install the staple cartridge <b>2620</b> may be applied in a direction <b>2650</b>. The staple cartridge <b>2620</b> is installed by first placing a proximal end <b>2622</b> of the staple cartridge <b>2620</b> into a proximal end <b>2612</b> of an elongate channel defined in the cartridge jaw <b>2610</b>. The force may be applied to the distal end <b>2624</b> of the staple cartridge <b>2620</b> in the direction <b>2650</b> to pivot the distal end <b>2624</b> of the staple cartridge <b>2620</b> counterclockwise and downward into the distal end <b>2614</b> of the cartridge jaw <b>2610</b>. The staple cartridge <b>2620</b> is fully seated or installed in the cartridge jaw <b>2610</b> when pan bumps <b>2630</b> along each lateral side of the staple cartridge <b>2620</b> snap into recesses in the cartridge jaw <b>2610</b>.

The removal force is applied to the distal end <b>2624</b> while the cartridge jaw <b>2610</b> is held stationary. The removal force can move the distal end <b>2624</b> of the staple cartridge <b>2620</b> upwards in the direction <b>2660</b> and may then pivot the distal end <b>2624</b> clockwise and upwards vertically away from the distal end <b>2614</b> of the cartridge jaw <b>2610</b>. As the distal end <b>2624</b> moves away from the cartridge jaw <b>2610</b>, the pan bumps <b>2630</b> may snap out of the recesses in the cartridge jaw <b>2610</b> allowing the staple cartridge <b>2620</b> to be removed from the cartridge jaw <b>2610</b>. Once the staple cartridge <b>2620</b> is removed, a new staple cartridge may be installed into the cartridge jaw <b>2610</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0098">In some instances, it can be difficult to apply the requisite amount of force at the appropriate angle to remove the staple cartridge from the cartridge jaw. For example, a robotic tool may have too much slack in the joints and/or mechanisms thereof to apply the requisite force. More specifically, when the robotic tool is unattached from the surgical robot and/or when the joints and mechanisms thereof are otherwise unlocked, the robotic tool can be too floppy to sufficiently knock against a surface to release a replaceable staple cartridge therein. As a result, without locking the joints of the stapling device, the joints may be able to move freely, which can hinder a user's ability to apply the necessary force in the correct way to remove the replaceable staple cartridge.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0099">In certain instances, the removal force can be applied at roughly a ninety-degree angle to the cartridge jaw (i.e. perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the replaceable staple cartridge and/or cartridge jaw and through a tissue-facing or tissue-supporting surface thereof). For example, a significant removal force may be required to snap certain cartridge detent features, such as pan bumps on the lateral sides thereof, for example, over the cartridge jaw retention features, such as channel recesses in the lateral sides thereof, for example. Moreover, the cartridge jaw tends to be a small component making it hard to hold the cartridge jaw stationary when applying the necessary force to remove the replaceable staple cartridge. In certain instances, locking the joints of the robotic tool can hold the cartridge jaw stationary; however, to lock the joints, the surgical tool may be required to be installed on a robotic arm, which can be cumbersome for the clinician in certain instances. Additionally, even when attached to a robotic arm, free movement of the joints and mechanisms in the robotic tool may be preferred in certain instances to ensure drive motions are not transferred to the robotic tool during the installation/uninstallation of the staple cartridge.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0100">In certain instances, a staple cartridge can be uninstalled longitudinally, rather than pivoting out of engagement with the cartridge jaw. When uninstalled longitudinally, the staple cartridge can be removed along a longitudinal axis of the staple cartridge and/or cartridge jaw. For example, a distal retaining feature on the cartridge jaw can be removed to open the cartridge jaw, which can provide a clearance or pathway for the staple cartridge to slide in/out of the cartridge jaw. In such instances, a reduced amount of force may be required to release the staple cartridge from the cartridge jaw. Longitudinal removal of the staple cartridge can be utilized in robotic surgical tools such that the staple cartridge can be removed from the robotic surgical tool even when the robotically-controlled joints and mechanisms are unlocked or slack. Such a staple cartridge can also be removed from a non-robotic surgical tool, such as the end effector of a handheld surgical stapler, for example. In such instances, replaceable staple cartridges for handheld stapling instruments and robotic surgical tools can be identical and fungible. For example, a replaceable staple cartridge for a handheld stapling instrument can be interchangeable or swappable with a replaceable staple cartridge for a robotic surgical tool.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0101">In one aspect of the present disclosure, a cartridge jaw can have a movable retaining feature in the distal portion thereof. In an open or unlocked position, the movable retaining feature can allow a staple cartridge to slide longitudinally into a seated position in the cartridge jaw and to slide longitudinally out of the seated position from the cartridge jaw. The movable retaining features can lock into place when the staple cartridge is fully seated in the cartridge jaw to prevent premature removal of the staple cartridge. For example, the movable retaining feature can be a distal portion of the cartridge jaw that is releasably locked to a proximal portion of the cartridge jaw.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> is a schematic of a surgical stapling assembly <b>2700</b> having a cartridge jaw design that allows a staple cartridge <b>2720</b> to be installed into a cartridge jaw <b>2710</b> along a longitudinal axis A<sub>2</sub>. The staple cartridge <b>2720</b> may be substantially similar to the staple cartridge <b>2620</b>. A first step of installing the staple cartridge <b>2720</b> into the cartridge jaw <b>2710</b> involves opening or releasing a distal portion <b>2770</b> of the cartridge jaw <b>2710</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, the distal portion <b>2770</b> is detached from the cartridge jaw <b>2710</b>.

The staple cartridge <b>2720</b> may be inserted longitudinally into an elongate channel in the cartridge jaw <b>2710</b>. As the staple cartridge <b>2720</b> slides into the elongate channel, a bottom exterior surface of the staple cartridge <b>2720</b> rests against a bottom interior surface of the elongate channel.

The moveable distal portion of the cartridge jaw may be used to open the channel cutout, which can allow the staple cartridge to slide into or out of position on the proximal piece of the channel. In some instances, the staple cartridge overcomes a friction fit to slide into position on the proximal piece of the channel. Reattaching the distal portion of the channel, upon installation of the staple cartridge, can allow the staple cartridge to be locked in place longitudinally within the cartridge jaw. Various mechanisms can be used to lock the distal retaining feature(s) (e.g. distal channel portion(s)) to the cartridge jaw, including friction or snap-fit features and/or springs, for example.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0105">In such instances, the force to install and uninstall a replaceable staple cartridge may be reduced in certain instances. Additionally or alternatively, the replaceable staple cartridge can be installed or uninstalled without needing to stiffen any joints, e.g. an articulation joint, of a surgical tool. The cartridge jaw design could be used in a robotic stapling tool or in a handheld stapling instrument and, in both instances, may reduce the requisite force for installing and/or uninstalling the replaceable staple cartridge.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>14</b></figref> depict a cartridge jaw <b>2800</b> that is configured to slidably receive a staple cartridge <b>2820</b> therein longitudinally along a longitudinal axis LA<sub>1 </sub>defined by the cartridge jaw <b>2800</b>.
