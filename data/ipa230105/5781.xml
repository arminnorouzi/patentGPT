First, a semiconductor wafer is pasted to an adhesive sheet for dicing, and in this state, the semiconductor wafer is singulated into semiconductor chips (dicing step). Thereafter, a pickup step, a pressure bonding step, a die bonding step, and the like are performed. Patent Literature 1 discloses a dicing/die-bonding film having both a function of fixing a semiconductor wafer in a dicing step and a function of bonding a semiconductor chip to a substrate in a die bonding step. In the dicing step, the semiconductor wafer and the die-bonding film (film-like adhesive) are singulated to obtain adhesive piece-attached chips.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0003">Conventionally, dicing of a semiconductor wafer and a bonding adhesive layer has been performed by physical cutting using a blade or the like. In recent years, a decrease in thickness of a wafer has been developed in accordance with higher integration of a semiconductor package. Due to this, defects such as chip cracking during the dicing step are likely to occur. In the dicing step using a wafer having a thickness of 50 &#x3bc;m or less as a target, from the viewpoint of maintaining a high yield, new processing methods alternative to conventional physical cutting methods have been developed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0004">As one of the new processing methods, a method has been known in which a predetermined cutting line is formed on an object to be processed by laser and the object to be processed is then split along the predetermined cutting line (see Patent Literatures 2 and 3). The process of singulating a wafer by this method is referred to as stealth dicing. In Patent Literatures 4 and 5, the mechanical characteristics or the thermal characteristics of a dicing film (adhesive layer) to be applied to stealth dicing have been studied.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0005">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2008-218571</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0006">Patent Literature 2: Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2002-192370</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0007">Patent Literature 3: Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2003-338467</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0008">Patent Literature 4: Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2015-211080</li>    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0009">Patent Literature 5: Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2016-115775</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0010">Regarding the dicing film to be applied to stealth dicing, the applicability of the dicing film to stealth dicing can be estimated to some extent by evaluating the mechanical characteristics or the thermal characteristics thereof (see Patent Literatures 4 and 5). On the other hand, according to the studies of the present inventors, regarding a die-bonding film (film-like adhesive), a variation in measurement values regarding the mechanical characteristics or the thermal characteristics thereof is large, and thus it is difficult to evaluate the applicability of the die-bonding film to stealth dicing. Furthermore, the direction of improvement of the film-like adhesive cannot also be guided. For example, even if the breaking strength of the film-like adhesive is measured by a tensile test, a breaking point varies due to strain or the like at the time of attachment of a sample, and thus the measurement value is not stable. Furthermore, when a thickness increasing process is performed by laminating a plurality of film-like adhesives to prepare a sample, it takes a lot of trouble with this preparation, and the quality of the sample affects the measurement value. Thus, the ease of splitting of the film-like adhesive cannot be accurately evaluated.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0011">The present disclosure provides a method by which the ease of splitting of a film-like adhesive under low-temperature conditions in which cooling expansion is performed can be evaluated with ease and excellent reproducibility.

The break test is classified as the transverse rupture strength test and includes a step of pushing the center portion of the sample until the sample is broken in a state where both ends of the sample are fixed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a sample S is provided to a break test in a state where the sample is fixed by being sandwiched between a pair of jigs <b>12</b> and <b>12</b>. The pair of jigs <b>12</b> and <b>12</b> is formed from, for example, thick paper having a sufficient strength and each has a rectangular opening <b>12</b><i>a </i>at the center.

The length (Ls in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) of the sample S is, for example, 5 to 50 mm and may be 10 to 30 mm or 6 to 9 mm.

When this relative speed is too fast, there is a tendency that data of breaking process cannot be sufficiently acquired, and when the relative speed is too slow, there is a tendency that stress is alleviated and thus breaking is not enough. The pushing distance of the jig <b>15</b> is, for example, 1 to 50 mm and may be 5 to 30 mm. When the pushing distance is too short, there is a tendency that breaking is not enough. Regarding the film-like adhesive as an evaluation target, it is preferable that a plurality of samples are prepared, the break test is performed plural times, and then the stability of test results is checked.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a graph showing an example of results of a break test.

The breaking factor in is a parameter regarding the stretching property of the film-like adhesive under low-temperature conditions. When the breaking factor in exceeds 70, the ease of splitting is insufficient due to excessive stretching property of the film-like adhesive. Note that, when the breaking factor in is 15 or more, the propagation of stress becomes satisfactory. The breaking resistance R is, as described above, more than 0 N/mm<sup>2 </sup>and 40 N/mm<sup>2 </sup>or less, preferably more than 0 N/mm<sup>2 </sup>and 35 N/mm<sup>2 </sup>or less, and more preferably 1 to 30 N/mm<sup>2</sup>. When the breaking resistance R exceeds 40 N/mm<sup>2</sup>, the ease of splitting is insufficient due to excessive strength of the film-like adhesive. Note that, when the breaking resistance R is 20 N/mm<sup>2 </sup>or more, further superior ease of splitting is achieved by satisfactory stress propagation in low-temperature expansion. By selecting a film-like adhesive having a breaking factor in and a breaking resistance R in the above ranges as the film-like adhesive, stealth dicing can be satisfactorily performed.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0061">Hereinafter, the film-like adhesive will be described. As an example of the film-like adhesive, an adhesive containing an epoxy resin, an epoxy resin curing agent, and a (meth)acrylic copolymer having an epoxy group will be described. The film-like adhesive containing these components is excellent in adhesiveness between a chip and a substrate and between a chip and a chip. Furthermore, electrode embeddability, wire embeddability, and the like can also be imparted to this film-like adhesive, and adhesiveness at a low temperature in the die bonding step can also be imparted thereto.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0062">Examples of the epoxy resin include a bisphenol A type epoxy resin, a bisphenol F type epoxy resin, a bisphenol S type epoxy resin, a phenol novolak type epoxy resin, a cresol novolak type epoxy resin, a bisphenol A novolak type epoxy resin, a bisphenol F novolak type epoxy resin, a dicyclopentadiene skeleton-containing epoxy resin, a stilbene type epoxy resin, a triazine skeleton-containing epoxy resin, a fluorene skeleton-containing epoxy resin, a triphenol phenol methane type epoxy resin, a biphenyl type epoxy resin, a xylylene type epoxy resin, a biphenyl aralkyl type epoxy resin, a naphthalene type epoxy resin, and a diglycidyl ether compound of a polyfunctional phenol or a polycyclic aromatic compound such as anthracene. These may be used singly or in combination of two or more kinds thereof.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0063">The epoxy resin curing agent may be, for example, a phenolic resin. The phenolic resin can be used without particular limitation as long as it has a phenolic hydroxyl group in the molecule. Examples of the phenolic resin include novolak type phenolic resins obtained by condensation or co-condensation of phenols such as phenol, cresol, resorcin, catechol, bisphenol A, bisphenol F, phenylphenol, and aminophenol and/or naphthols such as &#x3b1;-naphthol, &#x3b2;-naphthol, and dihydroxynaphthalene with a compound having an aldehyde group such as formaldehyde in the presence of an acidic catalyst; and phenol aralkyl resins and naphthol aralkyl resins synthesized from phenols such as allylated bisphenol A, allylated bisphenol F, allylated naphthalene diol, phenol novolak, and phenol and/or naphthols with dimethoxyparaxylene or bis(methoxymethyl)biphenyl. These may be used singly or in combination of two or more kinds thereof.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0064">The (meth)acrylic copolymer having an epoxy group may be a copolymer in which the amount of glycidyl (meth)acrylate as a raw material is adjusted to be 0.5 to 6% by mass with respect to the obtained copolymer. When this amount is 0.5% by mass or more, there is a tendency that a high adhesion force is easily obtained, and when this amount is 6% by mass or less, there is a tendency that gelation can be suppressed. The remaining part of glycidyl (meth)acrylate may be alkyl (meth)acrylate having an alkyl group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms such as methyl (meth)acrylate, and a mixture of styrene, acrylonitrile, and the like. The alkyl (meth)acrylate may contain ethyl (meth)acrylate and/or butyl (meth)acrylate. The mixing ratio of each component can be adjusted in consideration of Tg (glass transition temperature) of the (meth)acrylic copolymer having an epoxy group thus obtained. When Tg is &#x2212;10&#xb0; C. or higher, the tackiness of the adhesive film in the B-stage state tends to be satisfactory, and handling property tends to be excellent. The upper limit value of Tg of the (meth)acrylic copolymer having an epoxy group may be, for example, 30&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0065">The weight average molecular weight of the (meth)acrylic copolymer having an epoxy group may be 100000 or more, 300000 to 3000000, or 500000 to 2000000. When the weight average molecular weight is 3000000 or less, there is a tendency that a decrease in fillability between a semiconductor chip and a support substrate can be suppressed. The weight average molecular weight is a value in terms of polystyrene using a calibration curve of standard polystyrene by gel permeation chromatography (GPC).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0066">The curing accelerator may further contain, as necessary, curing accelerators such as tertiary amine, imidazoles, and quaternary ammonium salts.

Examples of the inorganic filler include aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, calcium silicate, magnesium silicate, calcium oxide, magnesium oxide, aluminum oxide, aluminum nitride, aluminum borate whisker, boron nitride, crystalline silica, and amorphous silica. These may be used singly or in combination of two or more kinds thereof.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0068">The above-described components are dissolved or dispersed in a solvent to prepare a varnish, and the varnish is applied onto the support and heated so as to remove the solvent. Thereby, the film-like adhesive can be formed. As the support, plastic films such as polytetrafluoroethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene, polypropylene, polymethylpentene, and polyimide can be used, and these supports can also be used after the surfaces thereof are release-treated.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0069">The solvent is not particularly limited, and in consideration of volatility or the like at the time of film formation, it is preferable to use solvents having a relatively low boiling point such as methanol, ethanol, 2-methoxyethanol, 2-butoxyethanol, methyl ethyl ketone, acetone, methyl isobutyl ketone, 2-ethoxyethanol, toluene, and xylene. Furthermore, for improving coating film properties, solvents having a relatively high boiling point such as dimethylacetamide, dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, and cyclohexanone can also be added.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0070">In the production of a varnish containing an inorganic filler, in consideration of the dispersibility of the inorganic filler, it is preferable to use a raikai mixer, a triple roll, a ball mill, a bead mill, or the like and these can also be used in combination. Furthermore, by mixing an inorganic filler and a low-molecular-weight material in advance and then blending a high-molecular-weight material therewith, the mixing time can also be shortened. Furthermore, after preparing a varnish, air bubbles in the varnish can also be removed by vacuum deaeration or the like.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0071">As the method of applying the varnish to the support, known methods can be used, and examples thereof include a knife coating method, a roll coating method, a spray coating method, a gravure coating method, a bar coating method, and a curtain coating method. Note that, the bonding adhesive layer <b>5</b> formed on the support may be attached to the adhesive layer <b>2</b> by hot roll lamination, and the bonding adhesive layer <b>5</b> may be formed on the surface of the adhesive layer <b>2</b> by printing.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0072">The thickness of the film-like adhesive (the bonding adhesive layer <b>5</b>) is not particularly limited, and is preferably 3 to 150 &#x3bc;m, more preferably 4 to 140 &#x3bc;m, and further preferably 5 to 135 &#x3bc;m. When the thickness of the film-like adhesive (the thickness of the sample S) is 3 &#x3bc;m or less, the breaking strength P is too small, and thus there is a tendency that the stability of data is insufficient. When the thickness thereof exceeds 150 &#x3bc;m, the installation of the sample S is difficult, and thus there is a tendency that the stability of data is insufficient. From the viewpoint of the stability and the handling property of data, the thickness of the film-like adhesive is particularly preferably about 3 to 135 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0073">According to the studies of the present inventors, the breaking work W (N&#xb7;mm) can be adjusted, for example, by increasing or decreasing the content of the (meth)acrylic copolymer.
