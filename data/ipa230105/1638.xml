More particularly, the present specification is directed to additive manufacturing apparatuses incorporating at least one solid state optical deflector and methods of using the same.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Additive manufacturing (AM) or additive printing processes generally involve the buildup of one or more materials to make a net or near net shape (NNS) object, in contrast to subtractive manufacturing methods. Though &#x201c;additive manufacturing&#x201d; is an industry standard term (ASTM F2792), AM encompasses various manufacturing and prototyping techniques known under a variety of names, including freeform fabrication, 3D printing, rapid prototyping/tooling, etc. AM techniques are capable of fabricating complex components from a wide variety of materials. Generally, a freestanding object can be fabricated from a computer aided design (CAD) model. A particular type of AM process uses electromagnetic radiation such as a laser beam, to melt or sinter a powdered material, creating a solid three-dimensional object.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, existing laser beam powder bed fusion (&#x201c;LPBF&#x201d;) AM apparatuses may manufacture objects in a layer-by-layer pattern by exposing layers of powder disposed on a build platform to a laser beam in predetermined patterns. The laser beam may selectively melt the layers of powder to cause the powder to melt and fuse in accordance with a layer structure for the object. Existing LPBF apparatus may rely on mechanical scanning devices (e.g., galvanometric scanners) to direct the laser beam on the layers of powder in the desired patterns. The speed at which such mechanical scanning devices may scan the laser beam is limited in speed by the inertia of the optical elements (e.g., mirrors) contained therein. Low scanning speeds may result in vaporization in the powder from large amounts of flux (or track energy) being incident on the powder and reduced process efficiency. Moreover static optical elements that may be used for beam shaping, such as diffractive optical elements, phase plates, aspherical lenses, and the like, are inflexible in terms of the beam-shape geometries that they can create. As such, conventional optical systems have limited capacity for manipulating laser beams in additive manufacturing apparatuses.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one embodiment, an additive manufacturing apparatus comprises a laser beam source emitting a laser beam, a build platform, a powder source depositing a layer of powder onto the build platform, and a scanning assembly disposed along an optical path between the laser beam source and the build platform. The scanning assembly comprises at least one solid state optical deflector that modifies at least one of a size or an impingement location of the laser beam on the layer of powder at a scanning position of the laser beam.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another embodiment, an additive manufacturing apparatus comprises a laser beam source emitting a laser beam, a build platform, a powder source depositing a layer of powder onto the build platform, a solid state optical deflector that modulates a propagation direction of the laser beam at an angular velocity, and an optical assembly that conditions the laser beam prior to the laser beam being incident on the layer of powder.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another embodiments, a method of additively manufacturing an object comprises depositing a layer of powder on a build platform, generating a laser beam with a laser beam source, and scanning the laser beam in a predetermined scanning pattern over the build platform to melt the layer of powder in a manner that corresponds the predetermined scanning pattern.

The at least one solid state optical deflector may be used to modulate a propagation direction of an laser beam used to fuse build material (e.g., powder) on a build platform of an additive manufacturing apparatus. In embodiments, the at least one solid state optical deflector may modulate the propagation direction of the laser beam on a time scale (e.g., at at least 10 times faster than currently used galvanometric scanners) that is less than an interaction time required for the laser beam to melt or fuse the build material, such that the at least one solid state optical deflector can be used to form arbitrary quasi-static energy distributions at various locations on the build platform. The at least one solid state optical deflector beneficially enables energy distributions provided to the build material to be tailored based on location on the build platform and within the object being built, adding a level of flexibility not yet obtainable using existing scanning assemblies.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The solid state deflectors of the scanning assemblies described herein beneficially facilitate the integration of relatively high average power laser sources typically not used in existing additive manufacturing apparatuses. For example, in embodiments, the additive manufacturing apparatuses described herein may comprise a master oscillator power amplifier (&#x201c;MOPA&#x201d;) laser source or a master oscillator fiber amplifier (&#x201c;MOFA&#x201d;) laser source generating a pulsed laser beam having an average laser power greater than or equal to 100 W (e.g., 200 W, 300 W, 400 W, 1 kW, etc.), a pulse width in the nanosecond, picosecond, or femtosecond range (e.g., a pulse duration ranging from 1 femtosecond to less than or equal to 100 miliseconds) and a pulse repetition rate ranging from 1 kHz to greater than 1 MHz. The limited scanning velocity obtainable via existing scanning assemblies (e.g., galvanometric scanners) renders such sources incompatible with many additive manufacturing processes, as significant pulse-to-pulse overlap along the scanning direction may lead to material evaporation. By incorporating at least one solid state optical deflector, however, the scanning assemblies described herein enable manipulation of the laser beam at a sufficient rate to avoid such material evaporation, allowing efficiency benefits associated with higher-power laser sources to be realized. In embodiments, the solid state optical deflectors may be manipulated to adjust an amount of pulse-to-pulse overlap in a pulsed laser beam source, thereby allowing build process parallelization.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The ultrafast laser beam manipulation facilitated by the solid state optical deflectors described herein may also be used to correct beam shape irregularities inherent in existing build processes. For example, in embodiments, an laser beam used by the additive manufacturing apparatus to fuse the build material is focused to a minimum spot size at the build platform when the laser beam is traveling along a central axis of the scanning assembly. When the laser beam is traveling along the central axis, the minimum spot size may have a particular shape (e.g., circular). If the scanning assembly is manipulated such that the laser beam diverges from the central axis of the scanning assembly, the beam shape and spot size may vary. The energy distribution provided by the laser beam to the build material may vary as a function of beam propagation direction. The at least one solid state optical deflector described herein may be used to counteract such beam shape variation by manipulating the propagation direction of the laser beam in a predetermined pattern dependent on the propagation direction of the laser beam. Such predetermined directionally-dependent patterns may be tailored such that a consistent energy distribution is provided to the build material, irrespective of the propagation direction of the laser beam, thereby facilitating a more uniform fusing of the build material and better build quality.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As used herein, the term &#x201c;solid state optical deflector&#x201d; is used to refer to an optical reflector that relies on a transient refractive index induced by a controllable external source (e.g., electro-magnetic fields, propagating sound waves, ultrasonic waves) to alter a propagation direction of light rays propagating therethrough.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As used herein, the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; means that amounts, sizes, formulations, parameters, and other quantities and characteristics are not and need not be exact, but may be approximate and/or larger or smaller, as desired, reflecting tolerances, conversion factors, rounding off, measurement error and the like, and other factors known to those of skill in the art. When the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; (or &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; or &#x201c;approximately&#x201d;) is used in describing a value or an end-point of a range, the specific value or end-point referred to is comprised. Whether or not a numerical value or end-point of a range in the specification recites &#x201c;about,&#x201d; two embodiments are described: one modified by &#x201c;about,&#x201d; and one not modified by &#x201c;about.&#x201d; It will be further understood that the endpoints of each of the ranges are significant both in relation to the other endpoint, and independently of the other endpoint. For example, the approximating language may refer to being within a 1, 2, 4, 10, 15, or 20 percent margin in either individual values, range(s) of values and/or endpoints defining range(s) of values.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Directional terms as used herein&#x2014;for example up, down, right, left, front, back, top, bottom&#x2014;are made only with reference to the figures as drawn and are not intended to imply absolute orientation.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Unless otherwise expressly stated, it is in no way intended that any method set forth herein be construed as requiring that its steps be performed in a specific order, nor that with any apparatus specific orientations be required. Accordingly, where a method claim does not actually recite an order to be followed by its steps, or that any apparatus claim does not actually recite an order or orientation to individual components, or it is not otherwise specifically stated in the claims or description that the steps are to be limited to a specific order, or that a specific order or orientation to components of an apparatus is not recited, it is in no way intended that an order or orientation be inferred, in any respect.

In the depicted example, powder from a powder reservoir <b>156</b> is distributed in layers over a build platform <b>144</b> by a recoater <b>146</b>, and excess powder is deposited into an excess powder reservoir <b>158</b> disposed on an opposite side of the build platform <b>144</b> from the powder reservoir <b>156</b>. Once the layer of powder is deposited on the build platform <b>144</b>, the laser beam <b>170</b> may be directed in a predetermined pattern over the build platform <b>144</b>. The energy density of the laser beam <b>170</b> may be sufficient to melt or sinter the powder to form a melt pool that solidifies in a pattern corresponding to a cross-sectional shape of the object <b>153</b>. The movement pattern of the laser beam <b>170</b> may be controlled by a scanning assembly <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In embodiments, the scanning assembly <b>160</b> includes a beam conditioning system <b>152</b> and at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b>. The beam conditioning system <b>152</b> may include one or more optical elements (e.g., an optical assembly) that condition the laser beam <b>170</b> (e.g. focus the laser beam <b>170</b>, expand the laser beam <b>170</b>, collimate the laser beam <b>170</b>, serve as a switching unit for the laser beam <b>170</b>) prior to the laser beam <b>170</b> being incident on the build platform <b>144</b>. The scanning assembly <b>160</b> further includes at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> that modulates an impingement location of the laser beam <b>170</b> on the build platform <b>144</b>. The at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> at least partially determines a pattern in which the laser beam <b>170</b> melts or sinters the particulate material disposed on the build platform <b>144</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In embodiments, the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> may be capable of modulating a propagation direction of the laser beam <b>170</b> at maximal angular velocities greater than (e.g., at least 2 times greater, at least 5 times greater, at least 10 times greater, etc.) the capabilities of current scanners (e.g., galvanometric scanners, polygon scanners, micro-electromechanical scanners, and the like). In embodiments, the maximum achievable angular velocity with which the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> modulates the propagation direction of the laser beam <b>170</b> is based on the configuration of the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b>. In embodiments, the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> comprises an electro-optical deflector constructed of an optically transparent material utilizing the Pockels Effect, and may have a maximum angular velocity of greater than or equal to 2E3 rad/s and less than or equal to 20E3 rad/s. In embodiments, the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> comprises an electro-optical deflector constructed of an optically transparent material utilizing the Kerr effect, and may have a maximum angular velocity of less than or equal to 40E3 rad/s. In embodiments, the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> comprises an acousto-optical deflector, and has a maximum angular velocity of greater than or equal to 5E3 rad/s and less than or equal to 250E3 rad/s. It should be appreciated that the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> (or any of the other solid state optical deflectors described herein) may be operated to modulate the laser beam <b>170</b> at any rate that is less than or equal to the achievable maximum angular velocities described herein.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The range of angular velocities provided by the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> enhances flexibility of the scanning assembly <b>160</b> in terms of the distribution of energy provided to the particulate material on the build platform <b>144</b>. For example, in embodiments, the laser beam <b>170</b> may be manipulated by the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> prior to melting the particulate material. For example, the solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> may modulate the propagation direction of the laser beam <b>170</b> at a relatively high angular rate such that the laser beam <b>170</b> does not interact with the particulate material for an interval long enough to actually melt the particulate material, but instead pre-heats the particulate material. Such pre-heating provided by the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> may beneficially control thermal gradients within the particulate material to avoid stress accumulation and potential defects. Similar heat treatments to the particulate material via the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> are also possible after melting of the particulate material. For example, after the particulate material in a particular area is melted during scanning of the laser beam <b>170</b> at a lesser angular velocity, the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> may re-scan the area at a greater angular velocity to provide post-melting heat treatments that may control the viscosity of melted material to provide control over the grain structure of the solidified material.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In embodiments, the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> modulates the propagation direction of the laser beam <b>170</b> during melting of the particulate material so as to modify a size of the melt pool formed therein per scanning interval. For example, as described herein, the solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> may manipulate the propagation direction of the laser beam <b>170</b> in various sub-patterns as the laser beam <b>170</b> is being scanned along a primary scanning direction to tailor the size and/or shape of the melt pool based on the portion of the object <b>153</b> being fused. As such, the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> may be used to adjust both the timing and distribution of energy provided to the particulate material in order to provide customized melt pools and/or heat treatments that improve build quality.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In embodiments, the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> comprises an acousto-optical deflector or an electro-optical deflector. Electro-optical deflectors may rely on a change in refractive index of an optically transparent material in response to application of an electric voltage to the optically transparent material. The electrical voltage may perturb the position, orientation, or shape of the atomic-molecular structure of the optically transparent material to modify the refractive index and induce a phase delay across the cross-section of the laser beam <b>170</b> when the laser beam propagates through the optically transparent material. In embodiments, an optically transparent material having a refractive index that varies linearly with voltage (e.g., utilizing the Pockels effect), such as LiNbO<sub>3</sub>, LiTaO<sub>3</sub>, and KTiOPO<sub>4 </sub>is used. In embodiments, an optically transparent material where the Kerr effect predominately varies the refractive index quadratically with field strength, such as KTN and/or KTa<sub>1-x</sub>Nb<sub>x</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, is used. The particular optically transparent material that may be used in the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> may vary depending on desired performance characteristics. For example, Pockels effect-based electro-optical deflectors may have higher modulation frequency capabilities (in the MHz range) but relatively low maximal deflection angles as compared to Kerr-effect based deflectors. As such, where a greater deflection capability is desired, a Kerr effect-based electro-optical deflector may be used.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In embodiments, the optically transparent material is temperature-controlled to a temperature where the electro-optical effect is increased in magnitude. The optically transparent material may take various shapes (e.g., prism-shaped, parallelepiped-shaped, etc.) depending on the implementation. In embodiments, an electrode pair is disposed on the optically transparent material to supply the electric field for varying the refractive index of the optically transparent material. The electrode pair may extend on faces of the optically transparent material that are arranged in a direction extending parallel to the propagation direction of the laser beam <b>170</b>. The electrode pair may be coupled to a power source that applies a voltage differential across the electrode pair. In embodiments, the electrode pair applies an electric field in a direction extending perpendicular to the propagation direction of the laser beam <b>170</b> and the amount that the laser beam <b>170</b> is deflected varies with the magnitude of the voltage supplied by the power source and dimensions of the optically transparent material. In embodiments, a plurality of elements of optically transparent material are arranged in series to enhance the maximum deflection angle capabilities of the electro-optical deflectors.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In embodiments, the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> comprises an acousto-optical deflector. The acousto-optical deflector may comprise an optically transparent material having a density that is modified by sound waves or ultrasonic waves that are propagated through the optically transparent material. In embodiments, the optically transparent material is constructed of TeO<sub>2</sub>, PbMoO<sub>4</sub>, or any other suitable material. For example, the sound waves may periodically alter the refractive index of the optically transparent material, and the periodic variations in refractive index may act like an optical grating moving at the speed of sound in the optically transparent material. The optical grating diffracts the laser beam <b>170</b> depending on the frequency of the acoustic signal propagating through the optically transparent material. In embodiments, the acousto-optical deflector includes a sound source emitting the acoustic signal that propagates perpendicular to the propagation direction of the laser beam <b>170</b> and an acoustical absorber that absorbs the sound waves after propagation through the transparent optical material. The transducer may have an acoustic bandwidth (e.g., of frequencies less than or equal to 500 MHz) to provide a tunable amount of deflection of the laser beam <b>170</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In embodiments, the laser beam source <b>150</b> is a pulsed laser beam source or a continuous wave (&#x201c;CW&#x201d;) laser beam source (e.g., a modulated CW laser beam source). The components of the scanning assembly <b>160</b> and/or the beam conditioning system <b>152</b> may be determined at least in part by the type of laser beam (e.g., pulsed or continuous wave) emitted by the laser beam source <b>150</b>. For example, in embodiments, the optically transparent material of the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> may have a relatively low CW laser damage threshold (e.g., less than 500 MW/m<sup>2</sup>, or even less than 1 MW/m<sup>2</sup>). Given this, if the laser beam source <b>150</b> is a CW laser beam source (e.g., a single mode fiber laser) that comprises a sufficiently high energy density to damage the optical transparent material of the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b>, the beam conditioning system <b>152</b> may include an optical switching element or the like where intervals of the laser beam <b>170</b> are directed away from the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b>. In such embodiments, the optical switching element may convert the laser beam <b>170</b> to a pulsed laser beam that is incident on the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b>. Intervals between the pulses incident on the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> may vary depending on the implementation. In embodiments, the pulse repetition rate of the laser beam <b>170</b> (e.g., determined based on the source itself, an external optical switching element, or any combination thereof) may be determined based at least in part on a desired pulse-to-pulse overlap of the laser beam <b>170</b> during scanning across the build platform <b>144</b>. In embodiments, successive pulses of the laser beam <b>170</b> may overlap one another to effectively alter a size of a formed melt pool. In embodiments, successive pulses of the laser beam <b>170</b> do not overlap one another such that there are gaps or spaces between positions of incidence of the successive pulses on the build platform <b>144</b>. Various aspects of the laser beam <b>170</b> (e.g., pulse interval, repetition rate, etc.) may be adjusted depending on the energy distribution desired to be distributed to the build platform <b>144</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In embodiments, the laser beam source <b>150</b> comprises a pulsed beam laser source (e.g., a MOPA or a MOFA laser beam source). Such laser beam sources may have an average power output of greater than 100 W (e.g., greater than or equal to 200 W, greater than or equal to 500 W, 1 kW, 5 kW), with nanosecond pulse widths (e.g., less than 200 ns) and a pulse repetition rate of up to 20 MHz. The use of such laser sources as the laser beam source <b>150</b> with existing, galvanometric or piezoelectric scanners is problematic, especially at high pulse repetition rates in the MHz range, where heat accumulation is especially prevalent because the relatively low rate angular velocity provided by such scanners provides insufficient lateral displacement between pulses, leading to heat accumulation in areas of significant pulse-to-pulse overlap. Such heat accumulation may lead to vaporization of the powder layers on the build platform <b>144</b> and overall process inefficiencies. By increasing the angular velocity displacement potential of the scanning assembly <b>160</b>, the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> beneficially prevents such heat accumulation between pulses and facilitates higher-power laser sources (e.g., even laser sources in the kW average power range) being used in the additive manufacturing apparatus <b>140</b>. Such higher-power sources may increase overall processing efficiencies and reduce overall build times.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> may also improve performance in embodiments where the laser beam source <b>150</b> is CW laser source (e.g., a single mode fiber laser commonly employed in LBPF processes, an internally modulated CW laser source, or the like). Such lasers typically output laser beams having a Gaussian energy distribution, with the energy density being relatively high near a radial center of the laser beam and exponentially dropping as a function of distance from the radial center. A Gaussian distribution may provide excessive energy near the radial center of the laser beam, causing evaporation of the powder. Such evaporation may result in vapor pressure that ejects powder from the center of the melt pool and places the ejected powder towards the periphery of the laser spot at the powder. Such re-deposited powder may interfere with subsequent scan lines in the forming of the object <b>153</b> and result in overall processing deficiencies. The at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> overcomes such deficiencies by allowing manipulation of the laser beam <b>170</b> at small time scales that are less than the amount of time required to form a melt pool. In embodiments, the laser beam <b>170</b> may be manipulated to form various sub-patterns as the laser beam <b>170</b> is moved in a primary scanning pattern to provide energy density distributions (e.g., flat-top, m-shaped, etc.) that allow for uniform energy coupling throughout each sub-pattern. That is, by relatively fast angular movement of the laser beam <b>170</b> in directions other than the primary scanning direction, energy density distributions that are well-suited for the particular build task may be used.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In embodiments, the relatively high rate of deflection of the laser beam <b>170</b> provided by the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> may also be used to alleviate distortion effects associated with scanning systems typically used in LBPF apparatuses, irrespective of the type of laser source used. For example, existing LBPF apparatuses may commonly use the previously-mentioned single mode fiber lasers in conjunction with a non-telecentric scanning systems. Such scanning systems may increasingly distort the shape of the energy-density distribution as the angle &#x3b8;<sub>1 </sub>from a central axis <b>172</b> of the scanning assembly <b>160</b> increases. That is, in conventional LBPF apparatuses, the energy density distribution of the laser beam <b>170</b> when being scanned at a peripheral region of the build platform <b>144</b> may significantly differ in shape than when being scanned at a central region of the build platform <b>144</b>, leading to melt pattern inconsistencies and a degradation in build quality. The at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> may be used to scan the laser beam <b>170</b> in sub-patterns that counteract such distortion associated with traditional scanning systems such that the energy density distribution of the laser beam <b>170</b> is consistent irrespective of the angle &#x3b8;<sub>1 </sub>from the central axis <b>172</b></p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In embodiments, the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> modulates the positioning of the laser beam <b>170</b> on the build platform <b>144</b> at a rate that is faster than a transient aspect of the laser beam (e.g., a spot size of the laser beam <b>170</b> at the build platform <b>144</b> multiplied by a pulse interval or a rate of movement of the laser beam <b>170</b> caused by an additional scanning element of the scanning assembly <b>160</b> or relative movement between the laser beam source <b>150</b> and the build platform <b>144</b>). For example, in embodiments, an additional scanning element of the scanning assembly <b>160</b> (not depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) may move the laser beam <b>170</b> over the build platform <b>144</b> at a maximal angular velocity that is a fraction of that of the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> (e.g., less than or equal to one half, less than or equal to one fifth, less than or equal to one tenth) in a primary scanning direction. While the laser beam <b>170</b> is being scanned in the primary scanning direction by the additional scanning element, the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> may manipulate the precise position of incidence of the laser beam <b>170</b> at an angular velocity that is a multiple of the scan rate in the primary scanning direction. In embodiments, the least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> may fine-tune the positioning of the laser beam <b>170</b> using a deflection speed that is at least 10 times greater as compared to the additional scanning element in the primary scanning direction. The at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> thus provides an additional degree of freedom for tuning various aspects (e.g., beam shape, energy density distribution) of the laser beam <b>170</b> while the laser beam <b>170</b> is being scanned in the primary scanning direction.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in embodiments, the beam conditioning system <b>152</b> conditions (e.g., collimates, condenses, focuses) the laser beam <b>170</b> to deliver a required energy density to a build surface <b>148</b> such that the build material is modified in a desired manner. In embodiments, the beam conditioning system <b>152</b> modifies a cross-section of the laser beam <b>170</b> such that the laser beam <b>170</b> is not clipped by a limited aperture of the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b>. For example, in embodiments, the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> may have an aperture that is less than that of typically used scanners, and, depending on the beam size output from the laser beam source <b>150</b>, the laser beam <b>170</b> may be contracted by the beam conditioning system <b>152</b> to avoid signal clipping. In embodiments, the beam conditioning system <b>152</b> comprises a telescope for condensing the beam size of the laser beam <b>170</b> based on the aperture of the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b>. In embodiments, the beam conditioning system <b>152</b> comprises a focusing lens for providing a desired beam spot size at the build platform <b>144</b>. While the beam conditioning system <b>152</b> is depicted as being upstream of the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b>, it should be appreciated that the beam conditioning system <b>152</b> (or any additional optical components of the additive manufacturing apparatus <b>140</b> such as a focusing lens) may be placed anywhere between the laser beam source <b>150</b> and the object <b>153</b> consistent with the present disclosure. For example, in embodiments, a focusing lens (e.g., f-theta lens) is disposed between the scanning assembly <b>160</b> and the build platform <b>144</b> to focus the laser beam <b>170</b> onto the layer of powder.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In operation, as each layer of the object <b>153</b> is formed, the relative distance between a build platform <b>144</b> and the scanning assembly <b>160</b> may be changed (e.g., the build platform <b>144</b> may be lowered) and an additional layer of the object <b>153</b> is formed (e.g., via a recoater <b>146</b> forming an additional layer of powder at the build surface <b>148</b> in a recoater direction <b>164</b>, with any excess powder being pushed to the excess powder reservoir <b>158</b>). For example, after the build platform <b>144</b> is lowered, another layer of build material may be spread over the build platform <b>144</b> and the object <b>153</b>. The additional layer of build material may modified by moving the laser beam <b>170</b> in another pattern via the scanning assembly <b>160</b> to form the additional layer of the object <b>153</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The laser beam <b>170</b> may be controlled by a computer system including a processor and a memory (not depicted). The computer system may determine a scanning pattern for each layer and control the laser beam <b>170</b> (e.g., via the scanning assembly <b>160</b>) to irradiate the build material according to the scanning pattern. After fabrication of the object <b>153</b> is complete, various post-processing procedures may be applied to the object <b>153</b>. Post-processing procedures include removal of excess powder by, for example, blowing or vacuuming. Other post processing procedures include a stress relief heat treat process.

For example, where the laser beam source <b>150</b> is a continuous-wave laser (e.g., rather than a pulsed laser) the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> may be used to scan the laser beam <b>170</b> in sub-patterns as the laser beam <b>170</b> is moved along a primary scanning pattern (e.g., via an additional scanning element) to expand melt pools formed along the primary scanning direction and/or particularize energy density distribution shapes for the portion of the object <b>153</b> being formed. When the laser beam source <b>150</b> is a pulsed laser beam or a modulated CW laser beam, the at least one solid state optical deflector <b>162</b> may be used to spatially separate individual pulses (or adjust an amount of overlap between pulses) in order to avoid material evaporation and enhance process efficiencies.

In embodiments, the laser beam source <b>202</b> comprises an average power output of greater than 100 W (e.g., greater than or equal to 200 W, greater than or equal to 500 W, 1 kW, 5 kW.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The relatively high output pulse energies and repetition rate associated with the laser beam source <b>202</b> renders the layer of powder material disposed on the build platform <b>144</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) susceptible to evaporation if there is significant overlap between successive pulses of the pulsed laser beam <b>203</b> therein.

In embodiments, each beam spot in the plurality of beam spots <b>209</b> represents a position of incidence of a separate pulse of the pulsed laser beam <b>203</b> on the build platform <b>144</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The plurality of beam spots <b>209</b> are generally arranged in an array extending in a primary scanning direction <b>208</b> and a secondary scanning direction <b>210</b>. In embodiments, the primary scanning direction <b>208</b> is the direction at which the pulsed laser beam <b>203</b> is moved over the build platform <b>144</b> due to mechanical motion in the primary scanning element <b>206</b>. The primary scanning element <b>206</b> may move the pulsed laser beam <b>203</b> in the primary scanning direction <b>208</b> at a primary scanning rate determined by a control signal provided to the primary scanning element <b>206</b>. In embodiments, the primary scanning rate is less than or equal to 100 rad/s. The solid state optical deflector <b>204</b> may deflect the pulsed laser beam <b>203</b> in the secondary scanning direction <b>210</b> as the pulsed laser beam is being scanned in the primary scanning direction <b>208</b> via the primary scanning element <b>206</b>. In the depicted example, the secondary scanning direction <b>210</b> is perpendicular to the primary scanning direction <b>208</b>, though this need not be the case. The solid state optical deflector <b>204</b> may modulate the propagation direction of the pulsed laser beam <b>203</b> at a secondary scan rate that is at least 10 times higher than the primary scan rate. The secondary scan rate may be greater than the spot size of the pulsed laser beam <b>203</b> at the build platform times the pulse frequency of the laser beam source <b>202</b> such that successive ones of the plurality of beam spots <b>209</b> (e.g., associated with successive pulses) are separated from one another and do not overlap.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">For example, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, a first beam spot <b>214</b> associated with a first pulse of the pulsed laser beam <b>203</b> is offset from a second beam spot <b>216</b> associated with a second pulse of the pulsed laser beam <b>203</b> in the secondary scanning direction <b>210</b>. Such pulse-to-pulse separation avoids head accumulation associated with higher-power pulsed laser beam sources and thereby prevents evaporation of the powder. In embodiments, beam spots associated with successive pulses of the pulsed laser beam <b>203</b> may overlap one another if the pulse intensity for a single pulse lies under the threshold intensity for evaporation of the powder (e.g., dependent on the particular material being used for the powder). In embodiments, a control signal (e.g., a voltage, a sound frequency) provided to the solid state optical deflector <b>204</b> is altered at a rate that is greater than the primary scan rate such that groupings of separate beam spots are incident on the layer of powder that extend along the secondary scanning direction <b>210</b>. In embodiments, the control signal provided to the solid state optical deflector <b>204</b> is periodic and returns to an initial value such that an additional beam spot <b>218</b> is incident on the build platform <b>144</b> and aligned with the first beam spot <b>214</b> in the primary scanning direction <b>208</b> and also separated from the first beam spot <b>214</b>. That is, by periodically modulating the impingement location of the pulsed laser beam <b>203</b> using the solid state optical deflector <b>204</b>, the plurality of beam spots <b>209</b> are completely separated from one another in a controllable manner to deposit energy from the pulsed laser beam <b>203</b> in a desired pattern without inducing powder evaporation. Such an approach allows the process of solidifying layers of the object <b>153</b> to be parallelized to achieve overall processing efficiencies.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In embodiments, beam spots associated with separate pulses of the pulsed laser beam <b>203</b> may overlap one another (e.g., the magnitude of deflection provided by the solid state optical deflector <b>204</b> between successive pulses may be reduced as compared to the example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) to produce larger individual melt pools per scanning interval. Such larger individual melt-pools may be well-suited for less fine areas of the object <b>153</b>. Thus, the solid state optical deflector <b>204</b>, by providing a way to fine-tune the impingement location of successive pulses of the pulsed laser beam <b>203</b>, may facilitate building efficiencies by process parallelization or permitting melting pool enlargement.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Benefits of the solid state optical deflector <b>204</b> may also be realized when a continuous wave laser is used.

In embodiments, the particular configuration of the laser beam source <b>302</b> may depend on the configuration of the solid state optical deflector <b>204</b>. For example certain electro-optical deflectors (e.g., constructed of KTN) may have lower damage thresholds than other types of solid state optical deflectors, and require the continuous wave laser beam <b>303</b> to have a lower intensity.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, a plurality of one-dimensional scanning patterns <b>304</b> in the plane of the build platform <b>144</b> provided by the scanning assembly <b>300</b> is shown.

The relatively small time scale over which each one-dimensional scanning pattern is formed as compared to the primary scan rate of the primary scanning element <b>206</b> permits flexibility in terms of the geometry of the melt pool formed during each scanning interval.

The plurality of two-dimensional patterns <b>410</b> are formed in the plane of the build platform <b>144</b> (e.g., within a layer of powder disposed thereon). In embodiments, the plurality of two-dimensional patterns <b>410</b> may be formed when the solid state optical deflector <b>404</b> facilitates re-direction of the continuous wave laser beam <b>303</b> in a first direction that is perpendicular to the primary scanning direction <b>208</b> (e.g., the secondary scanning direction <b>210</b>) and a second direction that is parallel to the primary scanning direction <b>208</b>.

By simultaneously modulating the propagation direction of the continuous wave laser beam <b>303</b> in both of such directions in varying amounts, various two-dimensional patterns (e.g., sub-patterns) may be formed in the layer of powder.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">A first two-dimensional pattern <b>414</b> of the plurality of two-dimensional patterns <b>410</b> is a substantially square-shaped pattern where a first beam spot <b>409</b> of the continuous wave laser beam <b>303</b> is directed in segments extending along the primary and secondary scanning directions <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> (and opposites thereof) by the solid state optical deflector <b>404</b>.

In the absence of modulation via the optical switching unit <b>606</b>, the collimated laser beam <b>605</b> may be incident on the build platform <b>144</b> with a modulation frequency (e.g., pulse repetition rate) corresponding to the first frequency f<sub>1</sub>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The solid state optical deflector <b>608</b> may function in a similar manner to the solid state optical deflector <b>204</b> described herein with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>.
