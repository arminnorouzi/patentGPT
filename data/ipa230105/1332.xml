A removable insert is arranged in a main channel between the inside of the filter element and the fuel outlet. The insert comprises a mushroom valve which is closed when the engine is at standstill. The insert comprises a bypass channel towards the pump which allows fuel to bypass the main mushroom valve in the main channel. When the engine is running, fuel is flowing from the fuel inlet through the filter element, through the insert and through the mushroom valve towards the fuel outlet. When the engine is at standstill and the pump is activated, fuel can bypass the main mushroom valve in the main channel. Fuel is then sucked from the fuel inlet through the filter element through a first mushroom valve into the pump and evacuated through a second mushroom valve from the pump to the fuel outlet while the main mushroom valve in the main channel is closed.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is an object of the invention to provide a more efficient filter system comprising a pump, in particular a hand pump.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another object of the invention is to provide a filter housing head module for such a filter system.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The first object is achieved by a filter system for filtering a fluid, in particular for filtering fuel, comprising a filter housing having a filter housing head module and a housing cover, the filter housing being configured to accommodate a filter element having a raw side and a clean side, and having a fluid inlet in fluid connection to the raw side and a fluid outlet in fluid connection with the clean side, the filter housing head module comprising a tube section being configured as a main channel connecting the clean side of the filter element to the fluid outlet when the housing cover is attached to the filter housing head module, the tube section projecting into the clean side of the filter element and comprising a ball valve seat for closing or opening the main channel, the filter housing head module comprising a pump chamber of a pump, in particular a hand pump, configured as a bypass channel for bypassing the ball valve seat.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another object is achieved by a filter housing head module for a filter system, the filter housing head module comprising a tube section being configured as a main channel connecting a clean side of a filter element to a fluid outlet when a housing cover is attached to the filter housing head module, the tube section projecting into the clean side of the filter element and comprising a ball valve seat for closing or opening the main channel, the filter housing head module comprising a pump chamber of a pump configured as a bypass channel for bypassing the ball valve seat.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Favorable embodiments and advantages of the invention are apparent from the further claims, the description, and the drawings.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a first aspect of the invention, a filter system for filtering a fluid is proposed, in particular for filtering fuel. The filter system comprises a filter housing having a filter housing head module and a housing cover, the filter housing being configured to accommodate a filter element having a raw side and a clean side. The filter system further has a fluid inlet in fluid connection with the raw side and a fluid outlet in fluid connection with the clean side. The filter housing head module comprises a tube section being configured as a main channel connecting the clean side of the filter element to the fluid outlet when the housing cover is attached to the filter housing head module. The tube section projects into the clean side of the filter element and comprises a ball valve seat of a ball valve for closing or opening the main channel. The filter housing head module comprises a pump chamber of a pump, in particular a hand pump, configured as a bypass channel for bypassing the ball valve seat.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The pump is arranged completely at the clean side of the filter element. The hand pump function may be achieved by two valves integrated in the pump chamber which are not in contact with the main flow of the fluid in the main channel. The main flow of the fluid can pass through the main channel bypassing the pump chamber.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Favorably, the ball valve may act additionally as a check valve when the housing cover is removed from the filter housing head module, e.g., for exchanging the filter element.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A high volume per stroke of the pump, in particular hand pump, can be achieved. As the pump is arranged at the clean side, contamination with dirt particles which could lead to malfunction can be avoided. A low differential pressure due to bypassing the pump in normal operation due to the ball valve design can be achieved. In contrast to the prior art, a restriction of the cross section of the main channel caused by a valve seat can be avoided.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The pump can be accessed from the front side of the filter system or from the top of the filter system. Less installation space is needed compared to piston pumps.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">During normal operation, the fluid flow lifts a ball of the ball valve, which is placed inside the main channel, and streams to the outlet of the filter system. When the pump is activated, the fluid flow streams through two valves inside the pump chamber. The ball in the main channel closes the main channel and allows for a fluid bypass through the pump housing.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Favorably, the closure ball of the ball valve may be made out of polyoxymethylene (POM) so that no elastomer is needed for the valve closure body so that the ball valve is robust and a lifetime part. As the ball valve can also act as a check valve, the ball valve may also substitute a separate check valve.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The filter system is particularly useful for fuel prefilters, such as diesel prefilters for trucks and heavy duty. All components of the pump can be placed on the clean side of the filter system. This leads to a good protection of the pump components against particles. Especially the sealing components are very sensitive to particles because these particles may cause a leakage. When the sealing is not working properly, the pump cannot build up pressure and consequently does not work. The clean side pump ensures a proper function over the complete lifetime of the filter system.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The invention allows for low differential pressure due to the ball valve and because there is no flow in the pump valves in the normal operation flow, a cost efficient solution with a low number of machining processes, a fail-safe design with no particles in the pump, function integration of a venting screw in the main channel, i.e., venting function and closing function of the channel, as well as function integration of the pump mushroom valves and the ball valve acting like a check valve.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to a favorable embodiment of the filter system, the pump chamber may be connected to the main channel by a first valve upstream of the ball valve seat and a second valve downstream of the ball valve seat. In particular, the valves may be configured as mushroom valves.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Low machining costs result from the low number of machining treatments as mushroom valve seats need no machining. Favorably, mushroom valves can be made from same parts, as only the assembly direction of the closure elastomer part is different.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to a favorable embodiment of the filter system, the valves, in particular mushroom valves, may be integrated in the pump chamber. During normal operation of the filter system, fluid flow can bypass the pump, thus reducing the differential pressure of the system. The lower the differential pressure, the longer the service intervals, thus saving costs for servicing the filter system.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to a favorable embodiment of the filter system, the tube section may comprise a sealing area at a free end of the tube section for sealing between the raw side and the clean side of the filter element. The ball valve seat may be arranged at an end of the tube section opposing the free end of the tube section. When the filter element is to be mounted in the housing of the filter system, the end cap of the filter element may simply be slipped over the sealing area of the tube section.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to a favorable embodiment of the filter system, the ball valve seat may be arranged between the main channel and a venting valve. Favorably, the venting valve may be arranged in axial direction essentially above the ball valve seat. This allows for a compact arrangement of the filter housing head module and the filter system. By using a ball valve, the ball can be completely removed from the fluid flow during normal operating conditions of the filter system.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to a favorable embodiment of the filter system, the venting valve is arranged in an axial projection of the main channel. Favorably, the venting valve may be arranged in axial direction essentially above the tube section. This allows for a compact arrangement of the filter housing head module and the filter system.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to a favorable embodiment of the filter system, the venting valve may provide an end stop for the ball of the ball valve seat. When the ball is lifted from the valve seat during normal operation conditions with fluid flowing through the filter element, the ball can be stopped in a defined position.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to a favorable embodiment of the filter system, the housing cover may comprise a water separator unit. Favorably, water can be separated from the fluid, in particular from diesel, and removed from the housing and the filter system.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to another aspect of the invention, a filter housing head module for a filter system is proposed, the filter housing head module comprising a tube section being configured as a main channel connecting a clean side of a filter element to a fluid outlet when a housing cover is attached to the filter housing head module. The tube section projects into the clean side of the filter element and comprises a ball valve seat of a ball valve for closing or opening the main channel, the filter housing head module comprising a pump chamber of a pump configured as a bypass channel for bypassing the ball valve seat.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Favorably, the tube section, valve seat, and pump chamber can be integrally made from one piece of material. An attachment for attaching the filter housing head module to a body, such as a vehicle, may be integrally comprised by the filter housing head module, too.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A filter housing head module for a filter system with a low differential pressure during normal operation conditions as well as long-time stability of the valve in the main channel can be provided.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The filter housing head module is suitable particularly for a filter system in a re-fuel line of a vehicle, in particular for prefilter systems with hand pumps for trucks, heavy duty, ships, construction machinery, agriculture machinery, etc. as well as high volumes of series production.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to a favorable embodiment of the filter housing head module, the pump chamber may be connected to the main channel by a first valve upstream of the ball valve seat and a second valve downstream of the ball valve seat.
