INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a flat-shaped composite material for manufacturing a package, comprising: a polymer outer layer, a polymer inner layer, a fibrous carrier layer, which is arranged between the polymer outer layer and the polymer inner layer, wherein the flat-shaped composite material has a plurality of fold lines, which are arranged and designed such that a closed package can be manufactured by folding the flat-shaped composite material along the fold lines and connecting seam surfaces of the flat-shaped composite material, a sleeve surface, wherein the sleeve surface comprises a front surface, a first side surface, a second side surface, a first rear surface and a second rear surface, base surfaces, wherein the base surfaces comprise triangular base surfaces and quadrangular base surfaces, and gable surfaces, wherein the gable surfaces comprise triangular gable surfaces and quadrangular gable surfaces, wherein the base surfaces and the gable surfaces are arranged on opposite sides of the sleeve surface.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention further relates to a package sleeve made of a composite material for manufacturing a package, comprising: a sleeve surface, wherein the sleeve surface comprises a front surface, a first side surface, a second side surface, a first rear surface and a second rear surface, base surfaces, wherein the base surfaces comprise triangular base surfaces and quadrangular base surfaces, gable surfaces, wherein the gable surfaces comprise triangular gable surfaces and quadrangular gable surfaces, two secondary fold lines, which run parallel to one another through the sleeve surface, and a longitudinal seam, which connects two edge regions of the composite material to form a circumferential package sleeve, which is open both in the region of the base surfaces and in the region of the gable surfaces, wherein the base surfaces and the gable surfaces are arranged on opposite sides of the sleeve surface, and wherein the package sleeve is folded along both secondary fold lines.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention lastly relates to a package made of a composite material, wherein the package is manufactured from a flat-shaped composite material as described herein, or wherein the package is manufactured from a package sleeve as described herein, and wherein the package is sealed in the region of the base surfaces and in the region of the gable surfaces. In particular, it can be provided that the package is manufactured from a flat-shaped composite material as described herein or that the package is manufactured from a package sleeve according to as described herein, and wherein the package is sealed in the region of the base surfaces and in the region of the gable surfaces.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Packaging (in filled condition: packages) can be manufactured in different ways and from an extremely wide range of materials. A widely used possibility for their manufacture consists of manufacturing a blank from a flat-shaped composite material by cutting from which, through folding and further steps, first a package sleeve and finally a package is created. Alternatively, it is also possible to manufacture a package directly from the composite material, i.e. without the intermediate step of the package sleeve. This type of manufacture has the advantage, among others, that the composite material and package sleeves are very flat and can thus be stacked, saving space. In this way, the composite material and the package sleeves can be manufactured in a different location than the folding and filling of the package. Composite materials are frequently used as material, for example a flat-shaped composite consisting of a plurality of thin layers of paper, cardboard, plastic and/or metal, in particular aluminium. Such packages are widely used in the foodstuffs industry in particular.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A first manufacturing step frequently consists of manufacturing a blank from a flat-shaped composite material by cutting and from the blank producing a circumferential package sleeve through folding and welding or adhering a seam. The folding usually takes place along stamped fold lines. The location of the fold lines thereby often corresponds to the location of the edges of the package which is to be manufactured from the package sleeve. This has the advantage that the flat-shaped composite material or the blank produced therefrom and the package sleeve are exclusively folded at points at which the finished package is folded in any case. A method for manufacturing a package from a package sleeve is for example known from WO 2015/003852 A9 (in particular, FIG. 1A to FIG. 1E). The package described therein has a rectangular cross-sectional profile and is generally cuboid.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, one disadvantage of folding the package sleeves along the later package edges is that only packages with angular cross-sectional surfaces can be manufactured. Moreover, only packages whose cross-sectional surface is identical in the vertical direction of the package can be manufactured. In contrast, alternative designs, for example rounded portions or free forms instead of the edges, are not possible.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to enable a more variable shaping, package sleeves have already been proposed whose folding edges do not correspond to the package edges of the package manufactured from the package sleeve. This is achieved in that the package sleeve is folded along so-called &#x201c;secondary fold lines&#x201d;, which are folded back again during the manufacture of the package and thus do not form any edges of the package. This makes it possible to manufacture packages whose sleeve surface has no edges or in any case no straight edges. Such package sleeves and packages manufactured therefrom are for example known from DE 10 2016 003 824 A1 (in particular FIG. 2A to FIG. 3G&#x2032;).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Although the use of &#x201c;secondary fold lines&#x201d; enables a slightly greater flexibility in the design of the shape of the sleeve surface of a package, secondary fold lines do not contribute to increasing the rigidity of the package, but can even reduce the rigidity of the package by folding and folding back the secondary fold line.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Against this background, the object underlying the invention is to design and further develop the flat-shaped composite material described at the outset and explained in more detail above in such manner that the manufacture of packages, in particular liquid-tight packages, with even more complex geometries, is made possible without impairing the rigidity of the package.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">This object is achieved in the case of a flat-shaped composite material as described herein in that the sleeve surface has at least one stress-relief surface, which is arranged between the front surface and one of the two side surfaces.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The flat-shaped composite material according to the invention is used to manufacture a package. The flat-shaped composite material can be cut to a defined size, wherein the size can be sufficient to manufacture a plurality of packages or is only sufficient to manufacture a single package. A composite material cut to a defined size, in particular to the size of an individual package, is therefore also referred to as a &#x201c;blank&#x201d;. The flat-shaped composite material has a plurality of overlapping and interconnected layers and thus forms a flat-shaped composite. The flat-shaped composite material comprises a polymer outer layer, a polymer inner layer and a fibrous support layer, which is arranged between the polymer outer layer and the polymer inner layer. The polymer inner layer and polymer outer layer give the composite material liquid-tight properties as they are manufactured from plastic. The fibrous support layer (preferably: paper or cardboard), on the other hand, primarily serves to give the composite material improved mechanical properties, in particular improved rigidity. Optionally, a barrier layer can also be provided, which is also arranged between the polymer outer layer and the polymer inner layer (preferably between the fibrous support layer and the polymer inner layer). The barrier layer can for example be manufactured from aluminium and is intended to prevent light and/or oxygen from passing through. The flat-shaped composite material has a sleeve surface which comprises a front surface, a first side surface, a second side surface, a first rear surface and a second rear surface. The flat-shaped composite material also has base surfaces which comprise triangular base surfaces and quadrangular base surfaces. The flat-shaped composite material also has gable surfaces which comprise triangular gable surfaces and quadrangular gable surfaces. Preferably, the base surfaces and the gable surfaces each have two or three quadrangular surfaces and six triangular surfaces. The quadrangular surfaces serve the purpose of folding the base and the gable of the package. The triangular surfaces serve to fold the excess composite material into projecting &#x201c;ears&#x201d; which are then laid against the package. The base surfaces and the gable surfaces are arranged on opposite sides of the sleeve surface. Preferably, the gable surfaces are, in a standing package, arranged above the sleeve surface and the base surfaces are arranged beneath the sleeve surface. The flat-shaped composite material also has a plurality of fold lines, which are arranged and designed such that a closed package can be manufactured by folding the flat-shaped composite material along the fold lines and by connecting seam surfaces of the flat-shaped composite material. The fold lines (in particular before folding also called: &#x201c;crease lines&#x201d;) should therefore facilitate the folding of the flat-shaped composite material; they can be produced by material weakenings. Since the packages to be manufactured from the composite material are to be liquid-tight, material weakenings do not use perforations, but rather (usually linear) material displacements, which are embossed into the composite material with pressing tools.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the invention, it is provided that the sleeve surface has at least one stress-relief surface, which is arranged between the front surface and one of the two side surfaces. The stress-relief surface serves to create a smoothest possible transition between the front surface and the side surface. Preferably, the stress-relief surface extends over the entire height of the sleeve surface, i.e. from the base surfaces to the gable surfaces and therefore separates the front surface from the two side surfaces. The technical effect of the stress-relief surfaces is that the composite material needs to be folded or kinked less than a 90&#xb0; edge of a cuboid package, since the transition from the front surface to the two side surfaces takes place through two less strongly kinked (&#x201c;blunter&#x201d;) edges. This leads to less stresses on the composite material and in particular to a lower risk of cracked or broken fibres in the fibrous support layer (paper or cardboard layer) of the composite material.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, the sleeve surface has two stress-relief surfaces, which are arranged between the front surface and each one of the two side surfaces. The stress-relief surfaces also ensure that a gap or free space between adjacent packages is created between packages arranged next to one another, in contrast to cuboid packages, in the region of the stress-relief surfaces, through which air can circulate. This has the advantage of reducing the risk of mould forming as a result of moisture. A further advantage of stress-relief surfaces can be seen in that the surfaces adjoining the stress-relief surfaces can be designed to be narrower and thus more stable, whereby an increased grip rigidity can be achieved when pouring out the filled package.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a further design of the flat-shaped composite material, it is provided that at least one stress-relief surface in the region of the base surfaces adjoins a quadrangular base surface and adjoins a triangular gable surface in the region of the gable surfaces. The triangular surfaces in the base and gable region are typically assigned to the side surfaces of a flat-shaped composite material and therefore adjoin the side surfaces of the package manufactured therefrom. The quadrangular surfaces in the base and gable region, on the other hand, are typically assigned to the front surface and the rear surface of a flat-shaped composite material and therefore adjoin the front side and the rear side of the package manufactured therefrom. By adjoining the stress-relief surface in the base region to a different surface than in the gable region, it is achieved that the stress-relief surface in its lower region is to be assigned to the front side of the package, while it is to be assigned to the side of the package in its upper region. The stress-relief surface therefore &#x201c;wraps&#x201d; around an (imaginary) vertical edge of the package. This design of the stress-relief surfaces has the advantage that the previously described technical effects (reduced stress on the composite material, improved air circulation) occur not only on one side of the package, but on two sides of the package. Alternatively or additionally, it can be provided that at least one stress-relief surface in the region of the base surfaces adjoins a triangular base surface and adjoins a quadrangular gable surface in the region of the gable surfaces. Preferably, the surfaces adjoining one another do not only touch each other in one point, but also adjoin each other in a linear manner, i.e. along a segment.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a further configuration of the flat-shaped composite material, it is provided that a first sleeve fold line, which is preferably curved at least in sections, is provided between at least one stress-relief surface and the adjoining front surface. By providing a fold line between the stress-relief surface and the front surface, a folding edge with a defined course is achieved, which facilitates the manufacture of the package. The folding edge also improves the structural properties of the package, in particular the rigidity, compared to an edge-free curved shape. The curved course of the sleeve fold line also makes it easier to create convex or concave surfaces, creating air gaps between adjacent packages which improve air circulation. It may be provided that a first sleeve fold line, which is preferably curved at least in sections, is provided in each case between both stress-relief surfaces and the adjoining front surface. It can also be provided that the first sleeve fold line runs continuously curved.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to a further design of the flat-shaped composite material, it is provided that a second sleeve fold line, which is preferably curved at least in sections, is provided between at least one stress-relief surface and the adjoining side surface. As has already been explained in connection with the first sleeve fold line, a folding edge with a defined course is also achieved by the second sleeve fold line, which facilitates the manufacture of the package. The folding edge also improves the structural properties of the package, in particular the rigidity, compared to an edge-free curved shape. The curved course of the sleeve fold line also makes it easier to create convex or concave surfaces, creating air gaps between adjacent packages which improve air circulation. It may be provided that a second sleeve fold line, which is preferably curved at least in sections, is provided in each case between both stress-relief surfaces and the adjoining side surfaces. It can also be provided that the second sleeve fold line runs continuously curved.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the case of a further configuration of the flat-shaped composite material, it is provided that a third sleeve fold line, which is preferably curved at least in sections, is provided between at least one side surface and the adjoining rear surface. As has already been explained in connection with the first and second sleeve fold line, a folding edge with a defined course is also achieved by the third sleeve fold line, which facilitates the manufacture of the package. The folding edge also improves the structural properties of the package, in particular the rigidity, compared to an edge-free curved shape. The curved course of the sleeve fold line also makes it easier to create convex or concave surfaces, creating air gaps between adjacent packages which improve air circulation. It may be provided that a third sleeve fold line, which is preferably curved at least in sections, is provided in each case between both side surfaces and the adjoining rear surfaces. It can also be provided that the third sleeve fold line runs continuously curved.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A further configuration of the flat-shaped composite material is characterised by two secondary fold lines, which run parallel to one another through the sleeve surface. Secondary fold lines are understood as fold lines which, in contrast to conventional fold lines, do not later form edges of the package, but are arranged between the edges of the package, for example in the side surfaces. Secondary fold lines are used to generate a package sleeve from the composite material, which is preferably folded flat along two secondary fold lines in order to be stacked and transported in the most space-saving manner possible.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to a further configuration of the flat-shaped composite material, at least one quadrangular gable surface with two small gable surface angles, which are smaller than 90&#xb0;, with two large gable surface angles, which are greater than 90&#xb0;, and with an angle sum, which is greater than 360&#xb0;, are provided. Angles that are not equal to 90&#xb0; result in a gable surface whose shape deviates from a rectangular or square shape. A quadrangular gable surface with two small (&#x3c;90&#xb0;) and two large (&#x3e;90&#xb0;) gable surface angles can for example be achieved by means of a trapezoid, a parallelogram or by a rhombus. An angle sum deviating from 360&#xb0; can for example be achieved by one or a plurality of sides of the quadrangular gable surface not running straight, but curved (as for example in the case of an arched quadrilateral or arched polygon). An angle sum greater than 360&#xb0; can be achieved by at least one side of the quadrangular gable surface being curved outwards. The base surface angles, on the other hand, are preferably 90&#xb0;, so that a rectangular, in particular square base shape results. The design of the gable surface according to the invention has a plurality of advantages. In addition to a more visually appealing shape, the technical effect is achieved such that the packages to be manufactured from the flat-shaped composite material can be gripped more easily with one hand, since an edge of the gable surface (preferably the front edge) is shorter than the other edges (in particular the rear edge), so that the package is narrower on the front side. The design according to the invention also leads to the technical effect that the contact surface between packages arranged next to one another (e.g. during transport or on the sales shelf) is smaller than in the case of cuboid packages, whose side surfaces almost completely touch. In other words, there is a gap or free space between packages arranged next to each other through which air can circulate. This has the advantage of reducing the risk of mould forming as a result of moisture. By the angle sum being greater than 360&#xb0;, it is also achieved that there is more space for a dispensing element. Preferably, the quadrangular gable surface has an angle sum of at least 370&#xb0;, in particular of at least 380&#xb0;, preferably of at least 390&#xb0;. Angle sums in the range between 390&#xb0; and 410&#xb0; have proven to be advantageous.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to a further development of the flat-shaped composite material, it is provided that at least one of the quadrangular gable surfaces is approximately trapezoidal. By designing the gable surface of the composite material to be approximately trapezoidal, the gable of the package manufactured therefrom also becomes trapezoidal. The trapezoidal shape has the advantage that one of the two parallel sides or edges (preferably the front edge of the gable) is shorter than the opposite side or edge (preferably the rear edge of the gable), in contrast to a rhombus in which the opposite sides are the same length. This makes it easy to grip larger-volume packages from the front with one hand. A trapezoid is generally understood as a quadrilateral in which two sides are parallel to each other. Here, trapezoid quadrilaterals should also be understood as quadrilaterals with curved sides, provided that when the four corners are connected by (fictitious) straight lines, two of these straight lines are parallel to one another.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to one configuration of the flat-shaped composite material, it is provided that the quadrangular gable surface has a front edge which adjoins the front surface and which is curved. Preferably, the front edge of the gable surface is curved, when viewed from the gable surface, in the direction of the front surface. In this way, the gable surface can be enlarged, which for example facilitates the attachment of dispensing elements with a larger diameter. A curved front edge of the gable also influences the shape of the front surface of the composite material and thus also the shape of the front side of a package manufactured from the composite material. In particular, a front edge curved in the direction of the front surface can achieve an outwardly-arched (convex) front side (&#x201c;front panel&#x201d;) of the package. In addition to an appealing appearance, this also has the previously described technical advantage of improved air circulation between adjacently arranged packages, which reduces the risk of mould formation.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to a further design of the flat-shaped composite material, it is provided that the fibrous support layer of the composite material has a main fibre direction, which runs approximately at right angles to a longitudinal edge of the composite material running from the base surfaces to the gable surfaces. Paper and cardboard are materials made from pulp fibres. While the fibres are evenly distributed in all directions in traditional (manual) paper production, a targeted alignment of the fibres can be achieved in mechanical paper production. Since the paper has different mechanical properties in the direction of the fibres than transverse to the fibre direction (anisotropy), the orientation of the fibres can be used to obtain the optimal material properties for the respective application. The main fibre direction should be approximately at right angles to the two longitudinal edges of the composite material. Since the longitudinal edges run from the base region to the gable region (i.e. in the case of the package in the vertical direction), this means that the main fibre direction in the case of the package runs in the circumferential direction of the package, i.e. around the sleeve surface. This has the advantage that the cardboard fibres are broken in the case of creases in the longitudinal edges of the package (which run transverse to the fibre direction). During subsequent folding and forming, this leads to a package with sharply pronounced package edges and thus to improved package stability. In particular, in the case of a compression stress on the packages (e.g. in the case of multi-layer stacking on a pallet), there is a significant increase in stability compared to packages with fibres aligned in the longitudinal direction, since the packages only buckle at higher compression stresses.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The object described at the outset is also achieved through a package sleeve made of a composite material for manufacturing a package. The package sleeve comprises a sleeve surface, wherein the sleeve surface comprises a front surface, a first side surface, a second side surface, a first rear surface and a second rear surface, base surfaces, wherein the base surfaces comprise triangular base surfaces and quadrangular base surfaces, gable surfaces, wherein the gable surfaces comprise triangular gable surfaces and quadrangular gable surfaces, two secondary fold lines, which run parallel to one another through the sleeve surface, and a longitudinal seam, which connects two edge regions of the composite material to form a circumferential package sleeve, which is open both in the region of the base surfaces and in the region of the gable surfaces, wherein the base surfaces and the gable surfaces are arranged on opposite sides of the sleeve surface, and wherein the package sleeve is folded along both secondary fold lines. With regard to those properties of the package sleeve which are already present in the flat-shaped composite material, reference is made to the corresponding explanations. The package sleeve has a longitudinal seam which connects two edge regions of the composite material to form a circumferential package sleeve. The longitudinal seam allows a continuous package sleeve, closed in a circumferential direction, to be manufactured from a flat, in most cases rectangular, blank of the composite material. The longitudinal seam can for example be produced through adhesion and/or welding. Because of the longitudinal seam, such package sleeves are also referred to as longitudinally sealed package sleeves. The package sleeve is folded along both secondary fold lines, resulting in a front side and a rear side as well as an inner side and an outer side.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to the invention, the package sleeve is characterised in that the sleeve surface has at least one stress-relief surface, which is arranged between the front surface and one of the two side surfaces. By providing at least one stress-relief surface, a transition between the front surface and the side surface that is as smooth as possible is achieved, as a result of which the composite material needs to be folded or kinked less strongly, since the transition from the front surface to the two side surfaces takes place through two less strongly kinked (&#x201c;blunter&#x201d;) edges. This leads to less stresses on the composite material and in particular to a lower risk of cracked or broken fibres in the paper or cardboard layer of the composite material. The further properties and advantages have already been explained herein and can be transferred from the flat-shaped composite material to the package sleeve in a corresponding manner.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to one configuration of the package sleeve, it is provided that the package sleeve is manufactured from a flat-shaped composite material as described herein. Since the package sleeve is manufactured from one of the flat-shaped composite materials described above, many properties and advantages of the flat-shaped composite material also apply to the package sleeve, such that reference is made to the corresponding embodiments.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to a further design of the package sleeve, it is provided that the composite material has at least one layer of paper or cardboard which is covered on the edge of the longitudinal seam running within the package sleeve. The layer made of paper or cardboard is preferably the support layer. The covering of the paper layer or cardboard layer has the purpose of preventing any contact between the contents of the package and this layer. This serves on the one hand to prevent liquid from leaking out through the non-liquid-tight paper layer or cardboard layer and on the other hand to protect the contents of the package against contamination through the paper layer or cardboard layer (for example pulp fibres).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Regarding this configuration, it is further proposed that the layer of paper or cardboard is covered by a sealing strip and/or by turning over the composite material in the region of the longitudinal seam. One possibility for achieving said covering involves the attachment of a separate sealing strip. The sealing strip can for example be made from the same material as the innermost layer of the composite material and can be adhered or welded to this layer. Another possibility for covering involves turning or folding over the composite material in the region of the longitudinal seam. In this way, not all layers, but only the innermost layer of the composite material now appears on the edge of the longitudinal seam running within the package sleeve. However, the innermost layer must in any case be made from a material which is suitable for contact with the contents of the package.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In a further design of the package sleeve, the composite material is stripped in the region of the longitudinal seam. A &#x201c;stripped&#x201d; composite material is understood to mean a composite material which has fewer layers in the stripped region than in the other regions. Particularly in the region where a plurality of material layers overlap, stripping brings the advantage of a less pronounced increase in thickness. The use of stripped composite material is therefore particularly advantageous if the composite material is turned or folded over, for example in the region of the longitudinal seam.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The object described at the outset is also achieved by a package made of a composite material, wherein the package is manufactured from a flat-shaped composite material as described herein, or wherein the package is manufactured from a package sleeve as described herein, and wherein the package is sealed in the region of the base surfaces and in the region of the gable surfaces. The package is characterised in that the sleeve surface has at least one stress-relief surface, which is arranged between the front surface and one of the two side surfaces. By providing at least one stress-relief surface, a transition between the front surface and the side surface that is as smooth as possible is achieved, whereby the composite material is stressed to a lesser extent. The other associated properties and advantages have already been explained and can be transferred from the composite material and the package sleeve to the package in a corresponding manner. The package can be manufactured either directly from a flat-shaped composite material or it can be manufactured from a package sleeve which has previously been manufactured from a flat-shaped composite material.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to one configuration of the package, it is provided that at least one stress-relief surface in the region of the base surfaces adjoins a quadrangular base surface and adjoins a triangular gable surface in the region of the gable surfaces. The associated properties and advantages (reduced stress on the composite material, improved air circulation) have already been explained and can be transferred from the flat-shaped composite material and the package sleeve to the package in a corresponding manner.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to a further design of the package, it is provided that a first sleeve fold line, which is preferably curved at least in sections, is provided between at least one stress-relief surface and the adjoining front surface. The associated properties and advantages (simplified manufacture, increased rigidity, improved air circulation) have already been explained and can be transferred from the flat-shaped composite material and the package sleeve to the package in a corresponding manner.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to a further design of the package, it is provided that a second sleeve fold line, which is preferably curved at least in sections, is provided between at least one stress-relief surface and the adjoining side surface. The associated properties and advantages (simplified manufacture, increased rigidity, improved air circulation) have also already been explained and can be transferred from the flat-shaped composite material and the package sleeve to the package in a corresponding manner.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to a further design of the package, it is provided that a third sleeve fold line, which is preferably curved at least in sections, is provided between at least one side surface and the adjoining rear surface. The associated properties and advantages (simplified manufacture, increased rigidity, improved air circulation) have also already been explained and can be transferred from the flat-shaped composite material and the package sleeve to the package in a corresponding manner.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to a further configuration of the package, it is provided that the package has a fin seam in the region of the gable which is turned over in the direction of the front surface.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">This design enables, for example, a better drainage of moisture from the gable surface in the case of an oblique gable sloping forwards, since no &#x201c;pocket&#x201d; open at the top forms in which moisture could collect. This design also allows more space to be achieved for a dispenser sealed from the inside.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to a further design of the package, it is provided that the package has a gable which is approximately trapezoidal. The trapezoidal shape of the gable has the advantage that one of the two parallel sides or edges (preferably the front edge of the gable) is shorter than the opposite side or edge (preferably the rear edge of the gable), unlike a rhombus in which the opposite sides are the same length. This makes it easy to grip larger-volume packages from the front with one hand.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A further configuration of the package provides that the package has an oblique gable. In particular, it can be provided that the gable of the package falls forwards, i.e. is lower in the region of the front side of the package than in the region of the rear side of the package. Due to the oblique course of the gable, it can be achieved that a dispensing element arranged in the region of the gable impairs the stacking of packages less than in packages with a flat gable. This is due to the fact that the dispensing element does not necessarily form the highest point of the package in packages with an oblique gable, unlike packages with a flat gable. In addition, better drainage of moisture from the gable surface can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to a further design of the package, it is lastly provided that the package is convex in the region of the front surface and/or is concave in the region of the rear surfaces. In particular, it can be provided that the package is convex in the region of the front surface in the upper region, in particular in the upper half, and/or is concave in the region of the rear surfaces in the upper region, in particular in the upper half. Through the combination of convex front side and concave rear side, the packages can be arranged in front of or behind one another in a space-saving manner despite their visually complex design.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The invention will be explained in more detail below with reference to a drawing which simply represents a preferred exemplary embodiment, in which:</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>: shows a flat-shaped composite material known from the prior art for folding a package sleeve in a top view,</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>: shows a package sleeve known from the prior art, formed from the flat-shaped composite material shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, in a front view,</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>: shows a rear view of the package sleeve from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>,</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>: shows the package sleeve from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> in its unfolded state,</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref>: shows the package sleeve from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref> with sealed base,</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F</figref>: a package, which is formed from the package sleeve shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, after welding,</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>G</figref>: shows the package from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F</figref> with ears applied,</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>: shows a flat-shaped composite material according to the invention for folding a package sleeve in a top view,</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>: shows a first region of the flat-shaped composite material from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> in enlarged view,</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> shows a second region of the flat-shaped composite material from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> in enlarged view,</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>: shows a package sleeve according to the invention, which is formed from the flat-shaped composite material shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, in a front view,</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>: shows the package sleeve from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> in a rear view,</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>: shows a package according to the invention, which is formed from the package sleeve shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in perspective view,</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>: shows the package from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> in a front view,</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>: shows the package from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> in a rear view, and</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>: shows the package from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> in a side view.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows a flat-shaped composite material <b>1</b> known from the prior art, from which a package sleeve can be formed, in a top view. The flat-shaped composite material <b>1</b> can comprise a plurality of layers of different materials, for example paper, cardboard, plastic or metal, in particular aluminium. The composite material <b>1</b> has a plurality of fold lines <b>2</b> which are intended to facilitate the folding of the composite material <b>1</b> and divide the composite material <b>1</b> into a plurality of surfaces. The composite material <b>1</b> can be divided into a sleeve surface <b>3</b>, a sealing surface <b>4</b>, base surfaces <b>5</b> and gable surfaces <b>6</b>. A package sleeve can be formed from the composite material <b>1</b> by the composite material <b>1</b> being folded in such manner that the sealing surface <b>4</b> is connected, in particular welded, to the opposite edge region of the sleeve surface <b>3</b>. With the exception of the sealing surface <b>4</b>, the sleeve surface <b>3</b> extends over the entire width of the composite material <b>1</b>. The composite material <b>1</b> has two secondary fold lines <b>7</b> in the region of the sleeve surface <b>3</b>. The two secondary fold lines <b>7</b> are straight and run parallel to one another. Moreover, the secondary fold lines <b>7</b> run through a contact point SB of three adjacent triangular surfaces <b>8</b> of the base surface <b>5</b> and through a contact point SG of three adjacent triangular surfaces <b>8</b> of the gable surfaces <b>6</b>. The sleeve surface <b>3</b> is divided by the secondary fold lines <b>7</b> into an inner partial region <b>3</b>A and two outer partial regions <b>3</b>B.

The package sleeve <b>9</b> has been created from the composite material <b>1</b> in two steps: First, the composite material <b>1</b> is folded along the two secondary fold lines <b>7</b>.

The first region of the composite material <b>1</b>&#x2032; represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> relates to the region of the gable surfaces <b>6</b>, in particular the region of the gable surface angles &#x3b1;<sub>G1</sub>, &#x3b1;<sub>G2</sub>. As already previously described, the corners of the quadrangular gable surfaces <b>6</b>&#x2033; are not at right angles, but rather slightly smaller (&#x3b1;<sub>G1</sub>&#x3c;90&#xb0;) or slightly larger (&#x3b1;<sub>G1</sub>&#x3e;90&#xb0;) than 90&#xb0;. For the rear (assigned to the rear side of the package) gable surface angles &#x3b1;<sub>G1</sub>, the deviation from a right angle is due to the fact that one of the two fold lines adjoining the angle &#x3b1;<sub>G1 </sub>does not run at right angles to the edge of the composite material <b>1</b>&#x2032;, but is inclined by an angle &#x2295;<b>1</b> with respect to a vertical S<sub>1 </sub>(&#x3b1;<sub>G1</sub>90&#xb0;&#x2212;&#x3b2;<sub>1</sub>). For the front (assigned to the front side of the package) gable surface angles &#x3b1;<sub>G2</sub>, the deviation from a right angle has two reasons: firstly, one of the two fold lines adjoining the angle &#x3b1;<sub>G2 </sub>does not run at right angles to the edge of the composite material <b>1</b>&#x2032;, but inclined by an angle &#x3b2;<sub>2 </sub>with respect to a vertical S<sub>2</sub>. Secondly, the front edge V also adjoining the angle &#x3b1;<sub>G2 </sub>does not run straight, but curved in the direction of the front surface <b>14</b>, wherein the front edge V (or a tangent, which touches the front edge V in the region of the corner or the angle &#x3b1;<sub>G2</sub>) is inclined by an angle &#x3b3; with respect to a horizontal W (which runs parallel to the upper edge of the composite material <b>1</b>&#x2032;) (&#x3b1;<sub>G2</sub>=90&#xb0;+&#x3b2;<sub>2</sub>+&#x3b3;). The angle &#x3b2; corresponds to the angle &#x3b2;<sub>2</sub>; both angles are preferably in the range between 2&#xb0; and 6&#xb0;. The two rear gable surface angles &#x3b1;<sub>G1 </sub>can therefore, for example, have an angle of approx. 86&#xb0;. The angle &#x3b3; is preferably in the range between 15&#xb0; and 25&#xb0;. The two front gable surface angles &#x3b1;<sub>G2 </sub>can therefore, for example, have an angle of approximately 113&#xb0;. From the described design, in particular from the curved front edge V, it follows that the angular sum of the quadrangular gable surface <b>6</b>&#x2033; is greater than 360&#xb0; (2*&#x3b1;<sub>G1</sub>+2*&#x3b1;<sub>G2</sub>&#x3e;360&#xb0;).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> shows a second region of the flat-shaped composite material <b>1</b>&#x2032; from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> in enlarged view.

The second region of the composite material <b>1</b>&#x2032; represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> relates to the region of the third sleeve fold line <b>18</b>&#x2032;&#x2033;, which separates the side surfaces <b>16</b>A, <b>16</b>B from the rear surfaces <b>15</b>A, <b>15</b>B.

The second section II adjoins the first section I and runs curved (in the direction of the rear surfaces <b>15</b>A, <b>15</b>B). As a result of the curvature, there is a maximum distance d<sub>II </sub>between the third sleeve fold line <b>18</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; and a vertical S, which can lie in the range between 0.5 mm and 2.5 mm. The third section III adjoins the second section II and runs curved (in the direction of the side surfaces <b>16</b>A, <b>16</b>B). As a result of the curvature, there is a maximum distance d<sub>III </sub>between the third sleeve fold line <b>18</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; and the vertical S, which can lie in the range between 0.5 mm and 2.5 mm. The second section II and the third section III therefore have opposite curvatures or curvature directions. The fourth section IV adjoins the third section III and the gable surfaces <b>6</b> and runs straight. The third sleeve fold line <b>18</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; therefore runs straight in sections (in the section I adjoining the base surfaces <b>5</b> and in the section IV adjoining the gable surfaces <b>6</b>) and curved in sections (in the two &#x201c;centre&#x201d; sections II, III).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> shows a package sleeve <b>9</b>&#x2032; according to the invention, which is formed from the flat-shaped composite material <b>1</b>&#x2032; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, in a front view.
