FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a deterioration estimation device, a deterioration estimation system, a deterioration estimation method, and a computer program for estimating the deterioration of a lead-acid battery or a lead-acid battery module.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Lead-acid batteries are used in various applications besides in-vehicle applications and applications for industry. For example, a secondary battery (energy storage device) such as an in-vehicle lead-acid battery is mounted on a moving body such as a vehicle. Here, the vehicle includes an automobile, a motorcycle, a forklift, or a golf car, for example. The secondary battery is used as a power supply source that supplies electricity to a starter motor at the time of starting an engine and a power supply source that supplies electricity to various electrical components such as lights.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Lead-acid batteries for industry are used as a power supply source to an emergency power supply or an uninterruptible power supply (UPS). In power storage systems and the like used for leveling power obtained by sunlight, wind power or the like, a large number of lead-acid batteries are connected in parallel and in series thus constructing a large-scale power storage system. To distinguish the lead-acid batteries for industry from in-vehicle lead-acid batteries, the lead-acid batteries for industry are sometimes referred to as stationary lead-acid batteries.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It has been known that the deterioration of a lead-acid battery progresses due to various factors. To prevent stopping of the supply of electricity caused by the occurrence of a state where a lead-acid battery unexpectedly loses its function, it is necessary to appropriately determine the rate of deterioration of the lead-acid battery, and to appropriately determine whether or not it is necessary to exchange the lead-acid battery.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an electric power storage system or the like, there may arise a difference in the progress of deterioration between lead-acid batteries due to a temperature of a place where the lead-acid batteries are installed, irregularities in performance among the respective lead-acid batteries or the like. Therefore, each time the lead-acid batteries deteriorate, it is necessary to exchange some lead-acid batteries and hence, the maintenance of the lead-acid batteries has been cumbersome.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Conventionally, the determination of deterioration of a lead-acid battery has been performed mainly by using an internal resistance (a direct current or an alternating current) at the time of full charging. When the deterioration of the lead-acid battery occurs due to corrosion of a positive electrode current collector, a deterioration state can be diagnosed by using this method.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a power supply control method described in Patent Document 1, an internal resistance of a lead-acid battery during charging and an internal resistance of the lead-acid battery during discharging are estimated, a first degree of deterioration of the lead-acid battery during charging is obtained from an initial value of an internal resistance during charging and an estimated internal resistance during charging, and a second degree of deterioration of the lead-acid battery during discharging is obtained from an initial value of the internal resistance during discharging, and an estimated internal resistance during discharging. A deterioration state of the lead-acid battery is determined based on the first degree of determination and the second degree of deterioration, and when the first degree of deterioration and the second degree of deterioration exceed a threshold, the lead-acid battery is exchanged</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0008">Patent Document 1: JP-A-2019-109237</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In applications such as a power storage system where the number of times of charging and discharging is large, the deterioration of a positive electrode material called softening of a positive electrode progresses. In this deterioration mode, an internal resistance at the time of full charging hardly increases. Accordingly, it is difficult to diagnose a deterioration state of the lead-acid battery based on the internal resistance at the time of full charging.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to a power supply control method described in Patent Document 1, it is possible to determine the deterioration with time such as depletion of electrolyte and corrosion of a positive electrode grid. However, it is not possible to estimate the rate of deterioration based on the above-described softening of the positive electrode. When the softening of the positive electrode progresses, a deterioration state of the lead-acid battery cannot be correctly estimated by a conventional diagnosis based on an internal resistance in a fully charged state. Accordingly, there is a concern that some lead-acid batteries that exceed a service limit are used in a connected state.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a deterioration estimation device, a deterioration estimation system, a deterioration estimation method, and a computer program for estimating the deterioration of a lead-acid battery or a lead-acid battery module caused by softening of a positive electrode.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to an

terminates due to softening of a positive electrode as in the case of a power storage system or the like, the rate of deterioration can be favorably estimated based on an internal resistance or conductance when deep discharging is performed, and have completed the present invention (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">It is considered that when the softening of the positive electrode progresses, the bonding between active material particles that form a positive electrode material becomes weak and hence, the resistance of the positive electrode material increases. However, in a fully charged state, that is, when almost all active material is made of conductive PbO<sub>2</sub>, an increase amount of the internal resistance is not large. Accordingly, a ratio of the internal resistance generated by the softening of the positive electrode with respect to the internal resistance of the entire battery is extremely small. At the end of the life of the battery, the internal resistance of the entire battery is determined based on a corrosion state of a positive electrode current collector, the depletion of an electrolyte or the like. However, in a case where the softening of the positive electrode progresses although the corrosion of the current collector is slight, for example, the remaining life of the battery cannot be accurately determined. When the battery is deeply discharged, insulating PbSO<sub>4 </sub>is further generated at a position where the bonding between the active material particles in the positive electrode is weakened due to softening. Accordingly, the resistance of the positive electrode material remarkably increases. That is, in a deep discharge state, the internal resistance of the battery increases corresponding to the rate of progress of softening of the positive electrode. The increase in resistance caused by corrosion of the current collector or the like affects the internal resistance of the battery regardless of a discharge state.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">According to the above-described configuration, it is possible to obtain information on a deterioration state of the lead-acid battery based on the internal resistance when deep discharge is performed in consideration of many deterioration modes such as the softening of the positive electrode, the corrosion of the current collector, and the depletion of electrolyte. Accordingly, it is possible to favorably estimate the rate of deterioration.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">It is preferable that the predetermined SOC (the estimated SOC) fall within a range of 0% to 40%. When the ratio of SOC exceeds 40%, an amount of increase of internal resistance caused by softening of the positive electrode is small. Accordingly, the deterioration cannot be accurately detected. It is more preferable that SOC be 40%, and it is further more preferable that SOC be 30%.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">The estimated SOC is derived as follows.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">With respect to a battery having an actual capacity Q0 [Ah], an estimated SOCT1 obtained after an electric quantity Q1 [Ah] is discharged from SOC<sub>T0 </sub>at a certain point of time T0 is calculated by the following equation.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>SOC<sub>T1</sub>=SOC<sub>T0</sub><i>&#x2212;Q</i>1/<i>Q</i>0[%]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0050" num="0047">The estimated SOC<sub>T2 </sub>after an electric quantity Q2 [Ah] is charged from the SOC<sub>T1 </sub>is calculated by the following equation.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>SOC<sub>T2</sub>=SOC<sub>T1</sub><i>+Q</i>2/<i>Q</i>0[%]=SOC<sub>T0</sub><i>&#x2212;Q</i>1/<i>Q</i>0+<i>Q</i>2/<i>Q</i>0[%]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0052" num="0048">The deterioration estimation device may be a battery control device that controls charging and discharging of a lead-acid battery included in a power storage system or the like.

Accordingly, each time the lead-acid batteries deteriorate, it is necessary to exchange some lead-acid batteries and hence, the maintenance of the lead-acid batteries has been cumbersome. When the softening of the positive electrode progresses, a deterioration state of the lead-acid battery cannot be correctly estimated by a conventional diagnosis that is made based on an internal resistance of the lead-acid battery in a fully charged state. Accordingly, there is a concern that some lead-acid batteries that exceed a service limit are used in a connected state.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0084">According to the configuration described above, based on the rate of deterioration that is estimated using an internal resistance in a deep discharged state, a control is performed so as to lower a load of the lead-acid battery that deteriorates quickly and to increase a load of the lead-acid battery that deteriorates slowly. Accordingly, it is possible to maintain a uniform deterioration rate among the lead-acid batteries in the entire power storage system. It is also possible to reduce the number of times that the lead-acid battery is exchanged. Further, it is also possible to reduce a risk that some lead-acid batteries are used beyond the limit. Also in the case of the lead-acid battery module, a load is similarly adjusted.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0085">The deterioration estimation system according to the embodiment includes: the above-described deterioration estimation device; and a terminal that transmits a current, a voltage, the internal resistance or the conductance to the deterioration estimation device, wherein the deterioration estimation device transmits a rate of deterioration estimated by the first estimation unit to the terminal.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0086">With such a configuration, the deterioration estimation device can estimate the rate of deterioration based on the current, the voltage, the internal resistance or the conductance that the terminal transmits, and can notify a user of the lead-acid battery of the result of the estimation.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0087">In the above-described deterioration estimation system, the deterioration estimation device may include a charge control unit that performs refresh charging of other lead-acid batteries or other lead-acid battery modules using power when the power is discharged by the discharge control unit.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0088">Lead-acid batteries used for power leveling are often operated in a partially charged state so as to be able to store surplus power. When the lead-acid battery is continuously used in a partially charged state, lead sulfate becomes coarse, and this causes the deterioration of the lead-acid battery called sulfation. When the sulfation occurs, charging and discharging of the lead-acid battery becomes difficult. Therefore, when the lead-acid battery is used in a partially charged state, charging (refresh charging) is often performed every several days to several weeks until the lead-acid battery is fully charged. The refresh charging often requires power from the outside. Accordingly, the refresh charging is not desirable in terms of cost and convenience.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0089">According to the configuration described above, some lead-acid batteries or some lead-acid battery modules are discharged to estimate the rates of deterioration of the lead-acid batteries or the lead-acid battery module, and refresh charging of other lead-acid batteries or other lead-acid battery modules is performed using the power outputted at the time of performing the above-described discharging of some lead-acid batteries or some lead-acid battery modules. It is possible to perform refresh charging without requiring power from the outside. A power cost necessary for the refresh charging can be reduced. Further, even in a case where the power storage system is independent of a power system, it is possible to perform both maintenances, that is, the estimation of a deterioration state and refresh charging simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0090">In the deterioration estimation method according to this embodiment, an internal resistance or conductance in a case where the lead-acid battery or the lead-acid battery module that includes the plurality of lead-acid batteries is discharged until the lead-acid battery or the lead-acid battery module reaches a predetermined SOC is derived.
