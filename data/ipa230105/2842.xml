Especially, with respect to safety structural parts of automobile, it has irreplaceable advantages in some parts with high strength and complex shape. The materials used for thermoformed components are divided into those with coating and those without coating. The main purpose of the coating is to prevent the oxidation of the steel plate surface during the hot stamping process. The formed components can be directly coated and welded for use. At present, the materials without coating must be subject to surface shot peening after thermoforming to remove the oxide layer generated on the surface, otherwise it will affect the subsequent coating and welding of parts. The surface of materials hot-dipped with aluminum coating cannot be phosphated normally after thermoforming. The adhesion of paint film after electrophoresis depends entirely on the surface morphology of the coating. During the use of existing materials, there will be the problem that the coating adhesion can not meet the use.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, the Chinese patent document with the publication number of CN104651590A and the publication date of May 27, 2015, entitled &#x201c;process for manufacturing stamped products, and stamped products prepared from the same&#x201d; discloses a thermoforming material coated with aluminum or aluminum alloy and its manufacturing method. The method specifically controls the thickness and five-layer structure of the coating to ensure the welding performance of thermoformed component.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For another example, the Chinese patent document with the publication number of CN108588612A and the publication date of Sep. 28, 2018, entitled &#x201c;hot-stamping forming component, pre-coating steel-plating plate for hot-stamping forming, and hot-stamping forming process&#x201d; discloses a hot-stamping formed component. In the technical solution disclosed in the patent document, the thickness of the coating is reduced and the protective effect of the coating is also reduced. Therefore, the fluctuation of the thermoforming process is easy to affect the surface performance of the component, thus affecting the subsequent service performance.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For another example, the Chinese patent document with the publication number of CN101583486 and the publication date of Nov. 18, 2009, entitled &#x201c;coated steel strip, methods of making the same, methods of using the same, stamping blanks prepared from the same, stamped products prepared from the same, and articles comprising such stamped products&#x201d; discloses a hot stamped product of coated steel strip and a method. The technical solution disclosed in the patent document includes heating, transferring and cooling, but does not involve the hot stamping process, which will lead to the unstable quality of stamped products, such as shrinkage and cracking. The furnace atmosphere during the heating process is not controlled, which leads to the change of furnace atmosphere during the heating, especially the large change of oxygen content, which makes the appearance color of products easy to change. In the actual production, it is found that the appearance color of stamped products obtained from the same incoming materials under the same process is quite different.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An object of the present disclosure is to provide a thermoformed component having excellent coating adhesion. The thermoformed component has good paintability, good coating adhesion and good corrosion resistance, and is very suitable for automotive parts, such as front and rear doors, left and right anti-collision rods/beams, front and rear bumpers, A-pillar reinforcing plates, B-pillar reinforcing plates, floor middle channels, etc.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To achieve the above object, the present disclosure provides a thermoformed component having excellent coating adhesion, comprising a substrate layer and an aluminum coating coated on at least one surface of the substrate layer, wherein the average roughness Ra of a surface of the thermoformed component is between 1.0 &#x3bc;m and 3.0 &#x3bc;m, the peak-to-valley height Rt is between 8 &#x3bc;m and 30 &#x3bc;m, and the roughness peak count Rpc is greater than or equal to 50.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the technical solution of the present disclosure, the aluminum coating comprises aluminum phase and aluminum silicon phase. In the heating process, the aluminum in the aluminum coating diffuses to the substrate layer, and the iron in the substrate layer diffuses to the aluminum coating to form Al<sub>2</sub>Fe<sub>2</sub>Si phase. The formation of new phase leads to a significant increase in surface roughness. With the further diffusion of iron and aluminum, Fe<sub>2</sub>Al<sub>5 </sub>phase is formed, and the surface roughness is basically maintained. Finally, FeAl alloy is completely formed in the aluminum coating, while the surface roughness decreases slightly.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The surface of thermoformed components after heat treatment mainly consists of Fe<sub>2</sub>Al<sub>5 </sub>and FeAl alloy.
