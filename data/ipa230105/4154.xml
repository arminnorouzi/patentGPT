according to one embodiment of the present invention with reference to the drawings. The embodiment described below shows one specific example of the present disclosure. Numerical values, shapes, materials, constituent elements, the arrangement and positions of the constituent elements, and other information described in the following embodiment are mere examples, and do not intend to limit the present disclosure. Among the constituent elements of the embodiment described below, those that are not recited in any independent claim, which represents the broadest concept of the present disclosure, are described as optional constituent elements. In the embodiment and the variations, the contents may be combined in any way.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Embodiment</heading><heading id="h-0014" level="1">Information Presentation System</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">First, an information presentation system according to an embodiment will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows one example of the information presentation system according to the present embodiment.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The information presentation system according to the present embodiment includes information presentation device <b>10</b> and self-propelled vacuum cleaner <b>20</b>. Information presentation device and self-propelled vacuum cleaner <b>20</b> are capable of communication with each other</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Self-Propelled Vacuum Cleaner <b>20</b></heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Self-propelled vacuum cleaner <b>20</b> is a cleaning robot that includes various kinds of sensors (not shown), a travelling controller (not shown), and a cleaning executor (not shown) and that is capable of cleaning floors of rooms in a building such as a home while autonomously travelling on the floors of the rooms. In other words, self-propelled vacuum cleaner <b>20</b> is a cleaning robot that is caused to run autonomously in a specific area by the travelling controller and is caused to vacuum dust in that area by the cleaning executor, using the sensors of various kinds.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the present embodiment, self-propelled vacuum cleaner <b>20</b> cleans, for example, each of a plurality of rooms, i.e., each region of a specific area consisting of a plurality of regions, while travelling autonomously. Self-propelled vacuum cleaner <b>20</b> also generates a map of the specific area each time during cleaning.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Self-propelled vacuum cleaner <b>20</b> further includes map storage <b>201</b> and path storage <b>202</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, which will be described later. While autonomously travelling in the specific area, self-propelled vacuum cleaner <b>20</b> maps each region around travelled locations with sensors such as a camera to generate the map of the specific area and stores map information indicating the generated map in map storage <b>201</b>. While autonomously travelling in the specific area, self-propelled vacuum cleaner <b>20</b> also stores travelling path information in path storage <b>202</b> with sensors such as an acceleration sensor and/or a speed sensor, the travelling path information indicating a relocation path that shows travelled positions (coordinate points) of self-propelled vacuum cleaner <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The travelling path information as used herein includes a cleaning path and a relocation path. The cleaning path shows positions cleaned by self-propelled vacuum cleaner <b>20</b> in each of the regions included in the specific area. The relocation path shows a route of self-propelled vacuum cleaner <b>20</b> that has travelled from one region to another region different from the one region, the route being included in the specific area. Note that self-propelled vacuum cleaner <b>20</b> travelling on the relocation path may simply travel in each region without doing cleaning, or may travel in each region while doing cleaning. In light of the efficiency of cleaning, self-propelled vacuum cleaner <b>20</b> basically runs with no overlaps in cleaning paths.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Note that the sensor of various kinds are not limited to the camera, the acceleration sensor, and the speed sensor described above, and may be any one or more of sensors including an obstacle sensor, a range sensor, an anti-collision sensor, an angular velocity sensor, and a floor sensor. That is, the sensors of various kinds may be sensors of any kind as long as they help self-propelled vacuum cleaner <b>20</b> generate a map and acquire a travelling path while travelling autonomously in the specific area, the travelling path showing the travelled positions of self-propelled vacuum cleaner <b>20</b>. The obstacle sensor is a sensor that detects obstacles existing in front of self-propelled vacuum cleaner <b>20</b>. The range sensor is a sensor that detects the distance between self-propelled vacuum cleaner <b>20</b> and an object such as an obstacle that exists around self-propelled vacuum cleaner <b>20</b>. The anti-collision sensor is a sensor that detects contact of a bumper mounted around self-propelled vacuum cleaner <b>20</b> with an obstacle. The floor sensor is a sensor that detects whether a floor to be cleaned exists, and is mounted at a plurality of positions on the bottom surface of self-propelled vacuum cleaner <b>20</b>. The acceleration sensor is a sensor that detects acceleration when self-propelled vacuum cleaner <b>20</b> runs. The angular velocity sensor is a sensor that detects an angular velocity when self-propelled vacuum cleaner <b>20</b> turns around.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Hereinafter, how self-propelled vacuum cleaner <b>20</b> that is travelling autonomously draws its relocation path showing travelled positions while generating the map of the specific area will be described with reference to drawings.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>C</figref> are explanatory diagrams illustrating the map information and the travelling path information generated during travelling by self-propelled vacuum cleaner <b>20</b> according to the present embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>C</figref> illustrate a room consisting of two regions <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> as one example of a range (specific area) to he cleaned by self-propelled vacuum cleaner <b>20</b>. For the sake of convenience of description, the travelling path of self-propelled vacuum cleaner <b>20</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>C</figref> is distinguished into the relocation path and the cleaning path, which are categories of internal processing of self-propelled vacuum cleaner <b>20</b>. Note that self-propelled vacuum cleaner <b>20</b> adds to its travelling path information indicating the categories of internal processing, i.e., whether the relocation path or the cleaning path. Self-propelled vacuum cleaner <b>20</b> is, in principle, designed to run with no overlaps in cleaning paths.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">First, in order to start cleaning of the room, self-propelled vacuum cleaner <b>20</b> positioned at charging base <b>30</b> moves from charging base <b>30</b> and then starts cleaning as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>.
