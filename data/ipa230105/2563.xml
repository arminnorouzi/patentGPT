Further aspects relate to a composition obtained by this process and the use of the obtained composition.</p><heading id="h-0001" level="1">STATE OF THE ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is known in the art to use gels such as hydrogels based on polysaccharides and water as dermatological fillers. Hydrogels are networks of polymer chains that are hydrophilic. The hydrophilic polymer chains are held together by crosslinks. Such gels are generally prepared by methods comprising the chemical crosslinking of the respective polysaccharides in an aqueous medium. Suitable polysaccharides are e.g. based on hyaluronic.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Hyaluronic acid is a polymer natural to the body, which since some time is employed in medicine in different fields such as in orthopedics and in ophthalmology. Nowadays, hyaluronic acid is increasingly used in aesthetic medicine and in plastic surgery. The broad application of hyaluronic acid is particularly due to its very high binding capability of water. In aqueous medium, even at low concentration of hyaluronic acid, viscoelastic gels are formed, which are biologically degradable, and which have advantageous properties.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the production of hyaluronic acid hydrogels, the precursors are first mixed in a mixing vessel and are then usually bottled in glass bottles for crosslinking of the hydrogel. For the process of crosslinking, the bottles are placed into a climate chamber so that the process may be carried out at constant temperature.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Processes for preparing hydrogels, in particular hydrogels based on hyaluronic acid, are known in the art. WO2013/185934 A1 discloses a method of preparing a composition comprising a crosslinked first polymer and optionally a second polymer, which may be crosslinked-or non-crosslinked. The polymers are selected from a polysaccharide and the method comprises crosslinking of a mixture comprising at least the first polymer and water, terminating the crosslinking, optionally blending with the second polymer and subjecting the obtained product to dialysis.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 8,052,990 B2 discloses a process for the production of a biocompatible crosslinked polydensified monophasic gel, comprising a crosslinking reaction of a predetermined quantity of at least one biocompatible polymer in solution by the addition of a quantity of crosslinking agent in a first volume of a reaction mixture and adding a supplemental quantity of polymer of a molecular weight higher than 500 000 Da in solution with dilution of the reaction mixture so as to decrease an overall concentration of the polymer in a second volume of the reaction mixture, continuing the crosslinking in the second volume and stopping the crosslinking reaction a drastic reduction of pH and temperature.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to increase throughput in the production of the hydrogels, it would be advantageous to carry out the step of crosslinking within the mixing vessel. For temperature control, the mixing vessel may be used to heat the contained product during crosslinking.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Vessels for mixing and tempering of products are known in the art. Such vessels comprise an agitator for mixing of the contained product and further comprise means for heating or cooling of the product.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A machine for mixing and homogenizing of products is known from DE 102 02 084 A1. The machine has a mixing vessel which is heated or cooled by means of a double wall. A homogenizer is arranged at the lowest point of the vessel together with an additional chopper which also mixes the contents of the vessel.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">DE 198 48 780 C1 discloses a homogenization and tempering container for homogenizing and tempering of a liquid. The container comprises a heat exchanger arranged at a distance from the container walls which is surrounded by at least one partition wall dividing the container into concentric annular chambers. A recirculation pump is used for recirculating a partial volume of the liquid charge of the container from an outlet of the container to an inlet of the container. The concentric annular chambers are divided in in such a way that a flow path of the recirculated partial liquid runs in countercurrent direction through the heat exchanger and the annular chambers. The circulated liquid is both tempered and homogenized.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, when the crosslinking of a hydrogel is performed within a mixing vessel, it has been observed that undesired solid particles form during the step of crosslinking, especially during the crosslinking of hyaluronic acid. This problem becomes worse when the size of the mixing vessel is increased, making it difficult to scale up the crosslinking process from a laboratory to a production scale.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is an object of the present invention to provide a process which may be carried out in a container assembly for mixing and tempering of a fluid which overcomes the limitations of the known processes for the production of crosslinked hydrogels and in particular allows for crosslinking of hydrogels at a large scale.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A process for producing a composition comprising a crosslinked hydrogel is proposed. The process comprises providing a container body, wherein the container body has a body inner wall and a body outer wall, wherein the body inner wall is configured to be tempered, filling of a fluid comprising at least a mixture of a polymer and water into the container body, and agitating the fluid. For crosslinking of the fluid, a container insert is provided, the container insert having an insert outer wall which is configured to be tempered and a container assembly is formed by inserting the container insert into the container body so that the insert outer wall of the container insert and the body inner wall of the container body are separated by a gap of constant width and define a volume for receiving the fluid. Crosslinking of the fluid is then performed while tempering the insert outer wall and the body inner wall to form a crosslinked hydrogel.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The product obtained by the proposed process is a hydrogel. The term &#x201c;gel&#x201d; as used herein encompasses a product, which has both viscous and elastic properties. Thus, the term encompasses a viscoelastic product. In popular science, a gel sometimes is characterized as a jelly-like material. The viscoselastic properties of a gel may be determined by determining the loss modulus and the storage modulus of the gel. The ratio between the loss module G&#x2033; and the storage module G&#x2032; may be expressed by the loss factor tan &#x3b4;=G&#x2033;/G&#x2032;. The viscosity of the product may be expressed in terms of &#x3b7;*(complex viscosity). Suitable methods for determining tan &#x3b4; and &#x3b7;*are known in the art.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The used polymer is preferably a hyaluronic acid and/or a sodium salt thereof. Hyaluronic acid is a non-crosslinked polymer of disaccharides. It can have up to 25,000 disaccharide units in length. The molecular weight of hyaluronic acid may range from 5,000 to 20,000,000 Da.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The term &#x201c;crosslinking&#x201d; as used herein encompasses the linking of at least two different polymer chains of the polymer, in particular of hyaluronic acid, by means of a chemical bond or chemical bonds. As a consequence, molecular weight of the polymer is increased, and thus viscosity and/or elasticity of the hydrogel.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, crosslinking is performed via a crosslinker which is included in the fluid or added to the fluid prior to the step of crosslinking. Suitable crosslinkers for crosslinking polymers such as hyaluronic acids are known in the art.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferably, a crosslinker based on an epoxide-structure is used.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Preferably, a diglycidyether is used for the crosslinking.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A suitable diglycidyether is 1,4-butanediol diglycidylether (BDDE). This compound is commercially available.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Preferably, the crosslinker is used in a quantity of from 5 to 15% (volume crosslinker/weight of the polymer), such as 6 to 14% (v/w), or 7 to 12% (v/w).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The water of the mixture may be provided in the form of pipe water, distilled water, deionised water or water for pharmaceutical use, such as purified water, highly purified water or WFI (water for injection).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Preferably, the mixture additionally comprises a buffer solution, such as, for example a phosphate buffer solution.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Preferably, such a phosphate buffer solution is made from sodium chloride, dibasic anhydrous sodium phosphate, monobasic sodium phosphate dihydrate and water.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Alternatively, the buffer is an alkaline buffer.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Preferably, the pH of the buffer is from 6.8 to 7.6, or from 7.0 to 7.4, or from 7.1 to 7.3.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Preferably, the pH of the final composition prepared according to the described process is adjusted to a range of from 6.5 to 7.5 such as 6.7 to 7.2, or 6.8 to 7.1 or 6.8 to 6.9. Such pH may support the compatibility of the composition with skin tissue. For the adjustment of said pH it is preferred to use one of the described buffers.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Preferably, the cross-linking is performed at alkaline conditions. The temperature in the crosslinking reaction is controlled by means of tempering of the body outer wall and the insert inner wall.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">During the crosslinking, the fluid may not be agitated. Any heat transport within the fluid occurs by heat conduction as the hydrogel does not allow convection. Thus, any addition or removal of heat must occur through the surfaces of the fluid and is limited by heat conduction within the fluid. The further away a certain part of the volume of the fluid is form a tempered surface, the more time is required to reach a predetermined temperature set point and the more time is required to achieve a stable and homogeneous temperature distribution within the entire volume of the fluid.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In usual mixing containers with a tempered wall, the average distance of the liquid to a tempered wall increases when the size of the container is increased. Accordingly, with increasing size of the container the homogeneity of the temperature distribution is reduced. If crosslinking is performed with such a mixing vessel and thus for a fluid having a non-homogenous temperature distribution, it has been observed that the crosslinking reaction is not proceeding uniformly and undesired solid particles form during the step of crosslinking, especially during the crosslinking of hyaluronic acid. This problem becomes worse when the size of the mixing vessel is increased, making it difficult to scale up the crosslinking process from a laboratory to a production scale.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The proposed process makes use of a container assembly comprising a container body having a tempered body inner wall and a container insert having a tempered insert outer wall. The body inner wall and the insert outer wall form a gap of uniform width which defines a volume for receiving the fluid during the step of crosslinking. This gap has a constant width which may even be maintained constant when the overall container size and volume is scaled up. This allows for constant and homogeneous process conditions independent of the scale of the used apparatus.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The insert outer wall and the body inner wall are arranged parallel with respect to each other and the distance between the body inner wall and the insert outer wall defines the width of the gap. By the term &#x201c;constant width&#x201d; of the gap it is understood that for every point of the surface of the insert outer wall the shortest distance to the body inner wall is constant within usual manufacturing tolerances. In particular, a tolerance is preferably less than +/&#x2212;10%, more preferably less than 5% and most preferred less than 1% of the width of the gap.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Preferably, the width of the gap is in the range of from 5 mm to 100 mm, preferably from 10 mm to 80 mm and especially preferred from 20 mm to 50 mm.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Preferably, the width of the gap is chosen independently from the volume and shape of the container body so that the same width may be used for laboratory and production scale.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Preferably, the container assembly further comprises a scrapper having a cross section equivalent to the cross section of the volume defined by the insert outer wall and the body inner wall, and wherein after inserting of the container insert and before tempering the scrapper is moved along the insert outer wall and the body inner wall in order to wipe off any residual fluid.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The scrapper preferably has a shape corresponding to the shape of the gap and preferably serves as a seal to protect the fluid received in the liquid. The scrapper may, for example, be made from an elastomeric, plastic or metal material or a combination of those. In case a metal is used, the metal is preferably stainless steel.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Preferably, after scrapping, the scrapper is moved such that it rests on the fluid surface and thus covers the fluid.
