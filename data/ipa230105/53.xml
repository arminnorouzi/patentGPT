The striations <b>273</b> are spaced apart by a slight gap that allow the thinner striations <b>273</b> to flex or slightly bend when the handle <b>212</b> is pulled rearward, as discussed in greater detail herein. The striations <b>273</b> operate collectively as a plurality of squeegees or mini-squeegees that flex to collect pet hair <b>100</b> from surface <b>13</b>. The number of spaced apart striations <b>273</b> extending across each lug <b>264</b> may vary depending on the size of the lug <b>264</b>.

The rear surface <b>275</b> is more vertical or more closely to parallel to the imaginary vertical axis of the lug, whereas the front surface <b>277</b> is more inclined or more angled relative to the imaginary vertical axis of the lug. In one particular embodiment, the angle of inclination of the striations <b>273</b> is equal to that of the front surface <b>277</b> relative to a vertical axis. For example, if the striations are angled at 60 degrees relative to an imaginary horizontal axis that is coplanar with bottom surface <b>271</b> and 30 degrees relative to an imaginary vertical axis, then the front surface <b>277</b> would also be angled at 60 degrees relative to an imaginary horizontal axis and 30 degrees relative to an imaginary vertical axis.

The pointed end <b>225</b> may be considered to be another engagement member, or the sixth engagement member <b>216</b>F. The pointed end <b>225</b> is configured to be a sixth engagement member inasmuch as the pointed end <b>225</b> is utilized to perform a sixth mode of operation (i.e., a sixth operational engagement position) to remove pet hair <b>100</b> from a surface <b>13</b>. Namely, the pointed tip <b>231</b> of end <b>225</b> can be inserted into a crack or crease in the surface <b>13</b> to assist in the removal of pet hair <b>100</b> from surface <b>13</b> at the crack or crease by dragging the pointed tip <b>231</b> along the length of the crease or crack in the surface <b>13</b>. The pointed end <b>225</b> includes an outer surface <b>233</b> that may define a generally conical configuration. As such, the outer surface <b>233</b> may be smoothly or convexly curved extending circumferentially around axis X. In one exemplary embodiment, the outer surface <b>233</b> is interrupted by one or more grooves <b>235</b> extending circumferentially around the axis X in the outer surface <b>233</b>. Grooves <b>235</b> may be spaced apart from each other and have a depth extending inwardly towards the axis X from the outer surface <b>233</b>. The grooves may be semicircular in cross section as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> such that they form a concavely curved channel. One embodiment may provide a single groove that helically or spirally winds around the outer surface <b>233</b> of the pointed end <b>225</b> and another alternative embodiment has a plurality of distinct and independent grooves <b>235</b> each their own circumferential extension around the axis X formed in and spaced apart from each other in the pointed end <b>225</b>. When the grooves <b>235</b> are a plurality of independent grooves, the number of grooves <b>235</b> may be in a range from about four grooves to about seven grooves. In one particular embodiment, there may be five grooves. With respect to the range of numbers of grooves <b>235</b>, it has been determined that there may be criticality in the claimed range.

Thus, when formed as a polymer, rubber, or rubber-derived material, the pointed end <b>225</b> may have certain flexible or flexure capabilities. Namely, the edges of the concave surface defining the channel for the grooves <b>235</b> have slightly flex or bend in response to the movement of the handle <b>212</b> by dragging pointed tip <b>231</b> along a crease, crevice or the like in surface <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Having thus described the structure of the apparatus <b>210</b>, and its associated components, primary reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>F</figref> to depict exemplary implementations and operations of the apparatus <b>210</b> for removing pet hair <b>100</b> from fabrics and/or surfaces <b>13</b>. It should be noted that one of the benefits of the apparatus <b>210</b> of the present disclosure is that the apparatus <b>210</b> may utilize a plurality of engaging members <b>216</b> via a plurality of engagement positions to remove pet hair <b>100</b> from a variety of fabrics and/or surfaces <b>13</b>. In this implementation, the apparatus <b>210</b> will be described as being operable to remove pet hair <b>100</b> from a fabric surface <b>13</b>.

More particularly, an operator may manipulate the apparatus <b>210</b> via gripping portion <b>220</b> of the handle member <b>212</b>. Once the operator engages the first squeegee <b>258</b>, the plurality of lug members <b>264</b>, and the serrated surface <b>266</b> with the fabric surface <b>13</b>, the operator moves the apparatus <b>210</b> in a direction generally indicated at arrow A such that one or more of the bottom surface of the first squeegee <b>258</b>, the lug members <b>264</b>, and the serrated surface <b>266</b> contacts and loosens and/or removes the pet hair <b>100</b> from the fabric surface <b>13</b>.

Namely, the striations <b>273</b> flex from their normal/resting or first angled position to a second angled position. The rearward movement causes the striations <b>273</b> to flex in a manner that they approach more parallel to the imaginary vertical axis extending through the lug <b>264</b>. Stated otherwise, the second angle or the second angled position is more close to parallel relative to the imaginary vertical axis. The flexure of the striations <b>273</b> causes the striations to act as mini-squeegees or tertiary squeegees to gather pet hair <b>100</b> from surface <b>13</b> working collectively to gather pet hair <b>100</b> in the gaps defined between the striations <b>273</b>. The flexure of striations <b>273</b> may also be accomplished by applying downward pressure to the striations <b>273</b>. The flexure of the striations <b>273</b> may also be considered its own independent operational engagement position (i.e., a seventh operational engagement position) that may be independent from the first operational engagement position).</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">With primary reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>B</figref>, one exemplary operational engagement position of the apparatus <b>10</b> is shown.

It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if a device in the figures is inverted, elements described as &#x201c;under&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements or features would then be oriented &#x201c;over&#x201d; the other elements or features. Thus, the exemplary term &#x201c;under&#x201d; can encompass both an orientation of over and under. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly. Similarly, the terms &#x201c;upwardly&#x201d;, &#x201c;downwardly&#x201d;, &#x201c;vertical&#x201d;, &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d;, &#x201c;lateral&#x201d;, &#x201c;transverse&#x201d;, &#x201c;longitudinal&#x201d;, and the like are used herein for the purpose of explanation only unless specifically indicated otherwise.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Although the terms &#x201c;first&#x201d; and &#x201c;second&#x201d; may be used herein to describe various features/elements, these features/elements should not be limited by these terms, unless the context indicates otherwise.
