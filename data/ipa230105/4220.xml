The disclosure of the embodiments is nothing but one example, and the invention is not limited by the descriptions of the embodiments. Modifications that could easily be conceived by a user with ordinary skill in the art are included in the scope of the disclosure. To clarify the descriptions, the drawings may show, for example, the size and shape of each component more schematically than those in the actual aspect. Elements corresponding to each other in the drawings are denoted by the same reference numeral and their detailed descriptions may be omitted.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In general, according to one embodiment, an eye movement detecting device includes a first electrode on a right of a right eye, a second electrode on a left of a left eye, a third electrode on a left of the right eye, a fourth electrode on a right of the left eye and a fifth electrode, which are contactable with a head. A line connecting the first electrode and the third electrode passes through the right eye. A line connecting the second electrode and the fourth electrode passes through the left eye on at least one of a front view, a plan view or a side view. A distance between the fifth electrode and the first electrode is equal to a distance between the fifth electrode and the second electrode. A distance between the fifth electrode and the third electrode is equal to a distance between the fifth electrode and the fourth electrode. The eye movement detecting device further includes a first detector which detects a first eye potential based at least in part on a difference between the signal from the first electrode and the signal from the second electrode with a signal from the fifth electrode as a reference; a second detector which detects a second eye potential based at least in part on a difference between the signal from the first electrode and the signal from the third electrode with the signal from the fifth electrode as a reference; a third detector which detects a third eye potential based at least in part on a difference between the signal from the second electrode and the signal from the fourth electrode with the signal from the fifth electrode as a reference; and a fourth detector which detects a horizontal movement of the right eye and a horizontal movement of the left eye based at least in part on the first eye potential, the second eye potential and the third eye potential.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The basic information of eyes will be described. The diameter of an adult eye is about 25 mm. The diameter of an eye of a baby immediately after birth is about 17 mm and increases as the baby grows. The interpupillary distance of adult males is about 65 mm. Most commercial stereo cameras are therefore manufactured with a distance between lenses of 65 mm. The interpupillary distance of adult females is several millimeters shorter than that of adult males. The eye potential is several tens of millivolts. The eyes have a positive potential on the cornea side and a negative potential on the retina side. Measuring these potentials on the skin surface, a potential difference (referred to as an eye potential) of several hundreds of microvolts appears.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The rotational movement range of eyes (of general adults) is 50&#xb0; or less in the left direction and 50&#xb0; or less in the right direction in the right-and-left movement (also called a horizontal movement), and it is 50&#xb0; or less in the down direction and 30&#xb0; or less in the up direction in the up-and-down movement (also called a vertical movement). The angle range in the up direction of the up-and-down movement, in which a user can move his or her eyes at his or her will, is narrow. The reason is as follows. When the eyes are closed, the vertical-direction eye movement range is shifted in the upward direction due to the &#x201c;Bell's phenomenon&#x201d; in which the eyes move upward.

There is a large variety of eye movement detecting devices. This embodiment is directed to an eyewear-type wearable device with the eye movement detecting device. Eyewear includes goggles and glasses (sunglasses are equivalent to glasses) and, in this embodiment, a glass-type wearable device will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a front view of the example of a glass-type wearable device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a rear top view of the example of the glass-type wearable device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a right front view of a user who is wearing the glass-type wearable device.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The eye movement includes a vertical movement in which an eye rotates in the up/down direction about a horizontal axis and a horizontal movement in which an eye rotates in the right/left direction about a vertical axis. The vertical movement includes a blink, an eye closing, a wink and the like. The horizontal movement is largely divided into (i) a slow eye movement in which the right eye and the left eye move unconsciously in the same direction, (ii) a line-of-sight movement in which the right eye and the left eye move consciously in the same direction, and (iii) a convergence/divergence movement in which the right eye and the left eye move in opposite directions. The convergence means that the line of sight of the right eye and the line of sight of the left eye intersect and the divergence means that the line of sight of the right eye and the line of sight of the left eye spread. The eye movement is detected based at least in part on variation in the eye potential. The eye potential can be detected by a difference in a voltage between paired electrodes between which an eye is interposed. The eye can be interposed between the paired electrodes in any of the horizontal, vertical, back-and-forth and oblique directions. If the eye potential is detected by the paired electrodes arranged to sandwich an eye vertically, it is possible to detect a blink, an eye closing, a wink and the like. If the eye potential is detected by the paired electrodes arranged to sandwich an eye vertically and horizontally, it is possible to detect a blink, an eye closing, a wink, a slow eye movement and a line-of-sight movement. If the eye potential is detected by the paired electrodes arranged to sandwich an eye in a back-and-forth direction and horizontally, it is possible to detect a slow eye movement, a line-of-sight movement and a convergence/divergence movement.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">[Placement of Electrodes]</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The glasses include a right frame <b>12</b>, a left frame <b>14</b> and a bridge <b>16</b> connecting the frames <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> together.

The connecting point of the resistors R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> is connected to a midpoint voltage terminal and the neutral electrode <b>46</b> is connected to the connecting point of the resistors R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b>.

In this case, the intersection of the lines of sight varies from a near point to a distant point and thus the convergence angle decreases. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the horizontal axis represents a distance at which the intersection of the lines of sight moves in the depth direction from a point 10 cm ahead, and the first plot represents EOG amplitude when the intersection of the lines moves from the point 10 cm ahead to a point 20 cm ahead. Note that 10 cm is the shortest distance at which the user can gaze stably. The minimum detected voltage of the EOG signal is 50 &#x3bc;V. In other words, if the EOG signal varies 50 &#x3bc;V or more, the eye movement detector <b>75</b> can detect variation in the EOG signal and based thereon, detect variation in the intersection of the line of sight, or variation in the convergence angle. If a level of the EOG signal does not vary 50 &#x3bc;V or more, the eye movement detector <b>75</b> cannot detect variation in the EOG signal. Note that the minimum detectable voltage of the EOG signal is 50 &#x3bc;V in this embodiment though it becomes lower by using an average value obtained by integrating the measured values. The amplitude of the EOG signal depends upon the contact resistance of the electrodes. If a material whose contact resistance is low is used for the electrodes, the amplitude of the EOG signal increases, as does the minimum detectable voltage of the EOG signal.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">For example, when the convergence angle decreases as a user who is looking at a marker 30 cm ahead of his or her nose looks at a farther marker, if the EOG amplitude increases 50 &#x3bc;V, the eye movement detector <b>75</b> detects variation in EOG amplitude. The EOG amplitude obtained by adding 50 &#x3bc;V to the EOG amplitude caused when the user looks at a marker 30 cm ahead, corresponds to a marker 40 cm ahead. In other words, when the convergence angle decreases as a user who is looking at a marker 30 cm ahead of his or her nose looks at a marker 40 cm ahead of his or her nose looks, the eye movement detector <b>75</b> can detect variation in EOG amplitude. If variation in EOG amplitude corresponding to a decrease in convergence angle corresponding to variation of 10 cm can be detected, it can be said that the detection resolution is considerably high. It is seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> that when the convergence angle decreases as a user who is looking at a marker 50 cm ahead of his or her nose looks at a marker 65 cm or more ahead of his or her nose looks, variation in EOG amplitude can be detected. When the convergence angle decreases as a user who is looking at a marker 70 cm ahead of his or her nose looks at a marker 140 cm or more ahead of his or her nose looks, variation in EOG amplitude can be detected.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">As described above, according to the first embodiment, there is provided a glass-type wearable device including right and left temple electrodes, right and left nose pad electrodes and a neutral electrode placed to be influenced equally by the motion of the right eye ER and the left eye EL. A convergence angle is detected by detecting the horizontal movement of each of the right eye ER and the left eye EL independently. Since the neutral potential of the neutral electrode is considered a midpoint potential of the analog-to-digital converters that sample the EOG signals generated from the electrodes, the EOG signals are not influenced by noise. Therefore, an eye potential is accurately detected and thus an eye movement is accurately detected. According to the first embodiment, furthermore, the horizontal movement of both the right eye ER and the left eye EL (horizontal movement of the lines of sight) can be detected, as can be the vertical movement of both the right eye ER and the left eye EL.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Since the eye potential detector according to the first embodiment makes it possible to detect convergence that is a user's conscious eye movement, an application example to perform control corresponding to a user's intention can be achieved by performing control corresponding to a result of the detection. For example, in eyewear capable of AR display, the on/off operation of AR display corresponding to the detection of convergence angle and the adjustment of a display position (distance) of an AR image can be controlled in hands-free mode.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Furthermore, for an operation, variation in convergence angle peculiar to the operation may be required. If a convergence angle variation pattern is compared with a reference pattern, it is possible to check a skill level of a user of the wearable device and determine whether he or she performs the operation accurately.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">An application example of convergence angle detection results will be described. The eye potential detector is incorporated into a glass-type wearable device capable of AR display to control AR display based at least in part on the convergence angle detection result. For example, the detection of convergence angle variation can be applied as a function select switch. For example, when the user sees a distant place as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, AR display is turned off. When the user changes his or her lines of sight to see a near place (convergence state) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the on/off state of display can be controlled to display an AR image. Since the display position of the AR image is set at a short distance, the eyes are in convergence state while the user is looking at the AR image and thus the AR display continues. If the user changes his or her lines of sight to see the distant place, the AR display is turned off. Accordingly, the AR display can be controlled as intended by the user.

If an eye closing of for example, 0.5 seconds or longer is detected, a page of the vital data window can be switched. For example, a page can be switched to the following page when the line of sight moves to the right and switched to the preceding page when the line of sight moves to the left. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>B</figref> shows an example in which a page of the window is switched.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>B</figref>, when, for example, the user changes his line of sight to look at the affected area (real world) under surgery (a point about 40 cm more distant), the eye movement detector <b>75</b> detects that the convergence angle decreases (the distance to the intersection of the lines of sight of both the eyes increases) and causes the display controller <b>112</b> to stop the AR display. Therefore, for example, the user observes only the affected area under surgery as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>C</figref> through the right frame <b>12</b> and the left frame <b>14</b> of the glasses.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">When, for example, the user wishes to refer to vital data in the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>C</figref>, he or she changes his or her lines of sight to look at his or her nearby point (about 30 cm distant from the user). The eye movement detector <b>75</b> detects that the convergence angle increases (the distance to the intersection of the lines of sight of both the eyes decreases) and causes the display controller <b>112</b> to make AR display, with the result that a vital data window as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>A</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>B</figref> is displayed.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The determination that the convergence angle increases or decreases is based at least in part on the relationship between the EOG amplitude and the movement distance of the intersection of the lines of sight as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>. It can be determined that the convergence angle has increased or decreased when an EOG voltage decreases or increases by a certain value.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">As described above, the user can turn on or off AR display for surgery support in hands-free mode during the surgery. This brings about a significant advantage because the user's hands are busy during the surgery.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">As another example of the AR display, a support image can be displayed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>A</figref>. The support image may include an image of an example of the past surgery for a patient who is in similar condition and an image of other surgery for the patient. The image may include a still image and a moving image. An image of surgery is captured by a camera (not shown), and the captured image is uploaded to the server <b>88</b> and stored in the surgery support database <b>130</b>. As still another example of the AR display, support information can be displayed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>B</figref>. The support information includes various items of text data regarding surgery that is being performed.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The display position (distance) of the support information is set close to the user, like that of the vital data window. However, the display position of the support image can be set at a distance of about 40 cm from the user, like that of the affected area under surgery (real world). The user does not see the vital data window or the support information simultaneously with the affected area under surgery. But it is assumed that the user sees the support image simultaneously with the affected area under surgery to compare them. If the affected area and the support image differ in display position when they are compared, the user needs to adjust focus by moving his or her eyes in the horizontal direction and thus could get eyestrain. For this reason, unlike in the foregoing description, the support image may be displayed when the eyes are in a state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> and turned off when convergence is detected as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. If the display position of the support image is subtly shifted from the affected area under surgery (real world) when they are compared, a convergence angle detected by the eye movement detector <b>75</b> is subtly changed. If the display controller <b>112</b> adjusts the display position (convergence angle between the right and left images) of the support image to decrease the convergence angle variation detected by the eye movement detector <b>75</b>, the possibility of causing eyestrain can be lowered further.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The switching from the vital data window to the support image and support information can be performed by the user based at least in part on an eye movement in another direction detected by the eye movement detector <b>75</b>, like the switching of pages of the vital data window.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In the foregoing example, the on/off switching of AR display is performed by the convergence angle variation of the user; however, the detected convergence angle can be used for other control and the on/off switching can be based at least in part on another eye movement. For example, when eye closing is detected more than once, the AR display can be switched between on and off states. The detected convergence angle can be used to control the display position of the AR image. In other words, the distance between the right image and the left image of the AR image (which is also referred to as a convergence angle of the AR image) is adjusted based at least in part on the distance to the intersection of the line of sight of the right eye ER and the line of sight of the left eye EL at the start of the display of the AR image. The convergence angle of the AR image is adjusted by the display controller <b>112</b>. Thus, the user need not move his or her eyes in the horizontal direction to gaze at the AR display, which causes no eyestrain.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Another application example of the convergence angle variation and the control of AR display will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref>. This example is directed to a pickup operation in a warehouse. During the pickup operation, a user wears the wearable device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The configuration of the processing unit <b>30</b> is not shown because it is the same as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>. The configuration of the controller <b>120</b> is not shown because it differs only in that a pickup list is used in place of the vital data, support image and support information. As in the first embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the mobile terminal <b>84</b> such as a smartphone can be used in place of the controller <b>120</b>. The mobile terminal <b>84</b> may acquire position information. The configuration of the server <b>88</b> is not shown because it differs only in that map information about the positions of shelves in the warehouse, a list of goods on the shelves, and a list of goods to be picked up are used in place of the surgery support data. The pickup list for each user is downloaded to the controller <b>120</b> from the server <b>88</b>.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In this application example, too, AR display is first turned off, and the displays <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> of the right and left frames <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> display nothing and are therefore transparent. The user thus gazes at the inside of the warehouse, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref>, through the right frame <b>12</b> and the left frame <b>14</b>. When the mobile terminal <b>84</b> as the controller <b>120</b> can acquire position information, air tags can be displayed on goods on each shelf based at least in part on the map information in the server <b>88</b> and the acquired position information. The user then sees several meters or several tens of meters ahead.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">When the user moves his or her right eye ER and left eye EL horizontally in opposite directions to cause convergence or &#x201c;crossed eye&#x201d; as the user who is looking at a distance point looks at a near point, the eye movement detector <b>75</b> detects the convergence.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In accordance with the detection of the convergence, the processing unit <b>30</b> requests for the controller <b>120</b> a pickup list indicating goods to be picked up by the user and causes the display controller <b>112</b> to start AR display. An example of the pickup list is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref>. The display position of the pickup list is set close to the user. When the user moves his or her right eye ER and left eye EL to change from a state in which he or she looks at the pickup list to a state in which he or she looks at the warehouse that is distant, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the eye movement detector <b>75</b> does not detect the convergence. Thus, it causes the display controller <b>112</b> to stop the display of the pickup list.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Like during the surgery, during the pickup operation, the user's hands are busy. Thus, a significant advantage in which the AR display can be switched between on and off states in hands-free mode is brought about.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref>, the air tag is displayed at all times; however, it can be displayed only when a user looks at a distant target object and turned off when the user looks at a nearby target object in another example. Assume that a user goes out to perform elevator maintenance in a building. While the user is looking for the target building on his or her way, he or she is looking at a distant target object; thus, an air tag indicative of the name of the building, the distance, the purpose of the maintenance, etc., is displayed on the target building. When the user looks at his or her nearby point to read a map or the like, the air tag may be turned off. When the user arrives in front of the elevator in the target building and looks at a portion to be inspected, an air tag is displayed on the portion. When the user looks at his or her nearby point, an AR image of an operation manual, etc., is displayed in place of the air tag. This example can be applied to a tourist guide. For example, while a tourist is seeing a scene in a tourist spot, an air tag concerning the spot can be displayed and when he or she looks at his or her nearby point, the air tag can be turned off and a detailed tourist guide can be displayed instead.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">As another example of making AR display by sensing convergence, it is considered that the eye potential detector is incorporated into AR glasses for sports watching. Images of situations of a game are picked up at various angles and stored in a server as replay images. The AR glasses are connected to the server via a network. Spectators always watch the game and see the distant target object. At that time, the AR display is turned off. When the spectators in bleacher seats of a baseball stadium wish to see an enlarged image of close play on the home plate, they move their eyes to become cross-eye to start AR display. In the AR display, various replay images are downloaded from the server and displayed. The spectators can thus enjoy the replay images instantaneously by their eyes' motion.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In the foregoing descriptions, AR display is started when convergence is detected, and it is stopped when no convergence is detected. The opposite is true and in other words, AR display can be made when no convergence is detected, and it can be stopped when convergence is detected.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Third Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0113" num="0112">As another application example of the convergence detection, there is confirmation of an operation procedure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> is a block diagram showing an example of an electrical configuration of an operation confirmation system including a glass-type wearable device. Though AR display is not essential to the operation confirmation, it can be used to transmit a confirmation result to a user immediately. The processing unit <b>30</b> of the third embodiment is the same as that of the second embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>. Instead of the controller <b>120</b>, a mobile terminal <b>84</b> such as a smartphone can be used as in the first embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The controller <b>120</b> includes a line-of-sight movement determination unit <b>148</b> and a line-of-sight movement pattern memory <b>142</b>. The line-of-sight movement determination unit <b>148</b> determines the direction of line-of-sight movement (rightward movement, leftward movement, intersection of the lines of sight (convergence)) from variation pattern of eye movement detected by the eye movement detector <b>75</b>, and stores a line-of-sight movement pattern in the line-of-sight movement pattern memory <b>142</b>. Data of the line-of-sight movement pattern memory <b>142</b> is uploaded to the server <b>88</b> via the network <b>86</b>.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">The server <b>88</b> includes a line-of-sight movement standard pattern memory <b>144</b> and an operation procedure determination unit <b>146</b>. The operation includes an operation in which line-of-sight movement peculiar to the operation is required. For example, in the railroad industry, the station staff is required to confirm a distant target object and a nearby target object in prescribed order by pointing his or her finger after a train has departed. In visual inspection of structures such as a bridge and a tunnel, too, an inspector is required to move his or her lines of sight in a prescribed pattern because portions to be viewed are predetermined. The standard pattern memory <b>144</b> stores a standard pattern of movement of lines of sight peculiar to such an operation. The operation procedure determination unit <b>146</b> compares the user's lines-of-sight movement pattern uploaded from the controller <b>120</b> with the standard pattern in the standard pattern memory <b>144</b> to determine whether the user performs his or her operation accurately. The standard pattern may be stored in a database (not shown) for each user. In accordance with the variation in results of the determination as time passes, improvement of the user's skill can be estimated. Alternatively, when the operation procedure determination unit <b>146</b> determines that the user does not perform the operation accurately, it may notify the display controller <b>112</b> of the processing unit <b>30</b> of that effect via the controller <b>120</b> and display a warning message on the displays <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">As another example of the line-of-sight movement standard pattern, there is a car driving pattern. In driver education for driver license renewal, a superior driver's confirmation of safety conditions may be introduced on video. The drivers in the driver education may not only watch the video but also follow the superior driver's confirmation. The line-of-sight movement pattern is detected when the drivers follow the superior driver's confirmation. The detected line-of-sight movement pattern of the driver is compared with that of the superior driver to determine the drivers' skill in confirming safety conditions. In the transportation industry, too, if a beginner driver learns the same line-of-sight movement pattern as that of an expert driver, car accidents can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">The foregoing descriptions are not limited to glasses but can be applied to goggles. For example, an electrode can be provided on the front of the goggles in place of the node pads, and an electrode can also be provided on the belt of the goggles in place of the temples.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">[Calibration]</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">In the electrooculography, no specific angle is obtained as the convergence angle, but only the motion direction of the eyes that is brought into a convergence state is obtained. In the foregoing embodiments, therefore, convergence is detected and in the application examples, control is performed based at least in part on two states in which convergence is detected or not, irrespective of the convergence angle. However, when there are plural target objects at different known distances, the target objects are seen and an eye potential is regularly measured for the different known distances. As a result, an eye potential for the different known distances can be obtained and three or more convergence states can be recognized. For example, AR display is turned off when a user looks at a distant target object, a first AR image is displayed when the user looks at a middle-distance target object, and a second AR image is displayed when the user looks at a nearby target object.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">Note that since the contact resistance of the electrodes varies (lowers with time), the absolute value of the eye potential relative to the distance varies with time and the absolute value of the distance cannot be assured for a long time. For example, the contact resistance is high immediately after the start of use of the electrodes. Thus, the amplitude of the EOG signal is small and the resistance lowers with time, and the amplitude of the EOG signal increases. If, however, the eye potential relative to the distance is regularly calibrated, the variation of the eye potential with time can be estimated and the absolute value of the eye potential relative to the distance can be assured. For example, in an operation with a fixed focal length, such as surgery and desk work and a business operation that assures that a target object with a known distance is seen at a point in time in the operation process, the eye potential can regularly be calibrated in the known state of the distance.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">Though the potential of the human body may vary, this variation can be compensated by regular calibration.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Summary of Embodiments</heading><p id="p-0121" num="0120">According to the foregoing embodiments, since the horizontal movement of the right eye ER and that of the left eye EL can be detected independently, convergence that is an intersection of the line of sight of the right eye ER and the line of sight of the left eye EL can be detected. The convergence is caused not unconsciously but by user's conscious eye movement. Hands-free control can thus be performed according to a user's intention by performing control in accordance with the detection of the convergence. For example, in a glass-type wearable device that makes AR display, the AR display can be started when the user becomes &#x201c;crossed eye&#x201d; state and it can be finished when the user looks at a distant target object.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">The AR display includes monocular display and binocular display. The foregoing embodiments can also be applied to the monocular display; however, the binocular display brings about the advantage of detecting convergence of the AR image (an interval between the right eye ER and the left eye EL). In displaying an AR image in three dimensions for binocular display, an interval between the right image and the left image (which is also referred to as a convergence angle) is optionally set. If the convergence angle of the lines of sight of the right eye ER and the left eye EL of a user who is seeing the real world and the convergence angle of the AR image differ from each other, the convergence angle of the lines of sight of the right eye ER and the left eye EL has to be adjusted when the real world and the AR image are compared, which causes eyestrain. If, however, the convergence angle of the AR image is set to coincide with that of the lines of sight of the right eye ER and the left eye EL, the user need not move his or her right eye ER and left eye EL to adjust the convergence angle, which causes no eyestrain.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Variation in motion of a user's eyes is detected during his or her operation, and an elapsed-time pattern of the variation is obtained and compared with the standard pattern. Accordingly, the contents of the operation can objectively be confirmed. For example, in an operation such as maintenance and inspection, when it is necessary to confirm a distant target object and a nearby target object, it is possible to confirm whether the operation is performed according to the procedures by detecting convergence during the operation. A result of the confirmation can be notified to the user as an alarm. The embodiments can also be applied to finger-pointing confirmation after a train has departed, as well as the maintenance and inspection.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">The comparison with the standard pattern can be used for skill in operation procedures with convergence as well the confirmation of the contents of the operation. For example, in driver education for driver license renewal, a superior driver's confirmation of safety conditions may be introduced on video. The drivers in the driver education not only watch the video but also follow the superior driver's confirmation. The line-of-sight movement pattern is detected when the drivers follow the superior driver's confirmation. The detected line-of-sight movement pattern of the driver is compared with that of the superior driver to determine the drivers' skill in confirming safety conditions. Thus, the drivers in the driver education understand an ideal convergence variation in detail.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Note that the horizontal movement of eyes is not limited to the motions (convergence) of the right eye ER and the left eye EL in opposite directions but includes the rightward movement of the line of sight and the leftward movement of the line of sight in which the right eye ER and the left eye EL move in the same direction. These movements can be combined with the detection of convergence to perform hands-free control. Nystagmus can be detected based at least in part on the rightward movement of the line of sight and the leftward movement of the line of sight, which are caused together with the convergence when a user feels sleepy. The alarm can thus be given to the user who feels sleepy. Hands-free control can be performed by detecting the eye movement in the vertical direction as well as in the horizontal direction and combining the eye horizontal and vertical movements.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">The present invention is not limited to the foregoing embodiments themselves. When the invention is reduced to practice, its structural elements can be modified and embodied without departing from the spirit of the invention. Furthermore, a variety of inventions can be made by appropriate combinations of the structural elements of the embodiments. For example, some of the structural elements of the embodiments can be omitted.
