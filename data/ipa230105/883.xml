It is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus and contains four structural proteins, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N (nucleocapsid) proteins. The N protein contains the RNA genomic information. The S, E, and M proteins together create the viral envelope.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Similar to other viruses, SARS-CoV-2 causes infections by going through a viral replication cycle. The replication cycle begins with fusion of the virus with a host cell wherein the S protein is responsible for the initial attachment of the virus to the host cell. After entering into the host cell, the virus releases nucleic acid and forces the cell to replicate the viral genome. Transcription and translation subsequently occurs for protein synthesis and assembly of viral components. The newly formed virus is released from the host cell to the extracellular space. The viral load can cause pathogenesis after increasing to a certain point. The common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough and shortness of breath.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">COVID-19 appears to have a lower fatality/mortality rate than other coronavirus diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). However, COVID-19 appears to have a higher fatality/mortality rate than the seasonal flu. For example, particular studies have determined that the fatality/mortality rate associated with COVID-19 was higher than 2 percent. In any event, COVID-19 became a global pandemic in 2020 and could have severe impacts on global health and the economy.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, a method that can inhibit the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and relieve the symptoms of COVID-19 is desired for treating C OVID-19.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The following aspects and embodiments thereof described and illustrated below are meant to be exemplary and illustrative, not limiting in scope.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect, the invention features a method of treating COVID-19 disease, or for ameliorating COVID-19 symptoms in a subject.

When people with active pulmonary tuberculosis cough, sneeze, speak, sing, or spit, they expel infectious aerosol droplets of about 0.5 to 5.0 &#x3bc;m in diameter. A single sneeze can release up to 40,000 droplets. Each of these droplets may transmit the disease, since the infectious dose of tuberculosis is very small (the inhalation of fewer than 10 bacteria may cause an infection).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">People with prolonged, frequent, or close contact with individuals having tuberculosis are at particularly high risk of becoming infected, with an estimated 22% infection rate. A person with active, but untreated, tuberculosis may infect 10-15 (or more) other people per year. Transmission is only expected to occur from individuals with active tuberculosis&#x2014;those with latent infection are not thought to be contagious. The probability of transmission from one person to another depends upon several factors, including the number of infectious droplets expelled by the carrier, the effectiveness of ventilation the duration of exposure, the virulence of the M. tuberculosis strain, the level of immunity in the uninfected person, and others. The cascade of person-to-person spread can be circumvented by segregating those with active (&#x201c;overt&#x201d;) infection and providing them anti-tuberculosis drug regimens. After about two weeks of effective treatment, subjects with nonresistant active infections generally do not remain contagious to others. If someone does become infected, it typically takes three to four weeks before the newly infected person becomes infectious enough to transmit the disease to others.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Thus, administration of an anti-tuberculosis agent to a subject having infection or symptoms due to SARS-CoV-2, such as a pharmaceutical used for the treatment of tuberculosis, is contemplated to prevent or inhibit COVID-19 transmission between subjects. The anti-tuberculosis agent can be rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and ethionamide. The anti-tuberculosis agent can be in any form as approved by a government regulation agency, such as the US FDA. The form can be tablets or capsules. The recommended dose for the exemplary anti-tuberculosis agents can be found in their respective labels. In some embodiments, the anti-tuberculosis comprises rifampicin and/or isoniazid.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The effective amount of rifampicin and isoniazid can be the same as the dosage approved by the US FDA. Adults and older children-600 mg of rifampin and 300 mg of isoniazid once a day orally; in one embodiment, a dose maximum of about 300 mg rifampin and 150 mg isoniazid once daily is contemplated.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0000">Agent for Treating Fever or Systemic Autoimmune Disease with Multisystem Involvement</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065">The anti-fever agent can be any anti-fever agent that can treat fever. Chloroquine and dihydroartemisinin (also known as artenimol), hydroxycholorquine, and quinine, pramaquine, quinidine, artemether, artemisinin, artemotil, and artesunate are examples of anti-fever agents contemplated for treatment of fever in subjects with COVID-19.
