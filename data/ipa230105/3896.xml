relates to a method for checking the integrity of GNSS correction data, a method for providing integrity data, a method for providing GNSS correction data, a computer program, and a machine-readable storage medium. The invention is particularly applicable in connection with autonomous driving. In addition, the invention can also be used in other safety-related applications in the field of satellite positioning.</p><heading id="h-0001" level="1">PRIOR ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) navigation typically uses GNSS correction data to account for detectable errors in a GNSS signal during localization. The detectable errors can be runtime errors in the GNSS signal, for example. Such a runtime error can be detected, for example, by receiving a GNSS signal with a reference station, the geodetic position of which is precisely known. A correction can then be determined from a comparison of the position calculated by means of the received GNSS signal and the precisely known position. An example of this is so-called DGPS (Differential GPS). GNSS correction data can account for atmospheric effects, environmental effects, clock errors and/or satellite path errors as an alternative or in addition to runtime errors.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The GNSS correction data is usually provided by specialized correction data providers (also known as GNSS correction services). These usually differ in the type of the correction used and in whether or not they also provide the integrity information associated with the GNSS correction data provided. Appropriate information about the integrity of the correction data used or, as appropriate, to be used is, however, particularly important for safety-relevant applications (i.e. applications that require a specific safety level of the data). For example, GNSS positioning of at least partially autonomous vehicles is one area of application where a specific (high) safety level is required.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, known GNSS correction services that provide the associated integrity information are commercial PPP-RTK (Precise Point Positioning Real-Time Kinematic) services, in which integrity testing in particular forms part of the proprietary algorithms. This integrity information can be used, for example, to achieve a safety level (in particular according to IS026262 and/or IEC61508). Appropriate integrity information is important because inconsistent or inaccurate correction data in the position calculation can lead to positioning errors if not detected in time.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Known GNSS correction services that do not provide associated integrity information include services that use PPP (Precise Point Positioning) or PPP-RTK technology, and free or non-commercial services, as well as commercial services. In addition to the names PPP and PPP-RTK, SSR (1 to 4) and other proprietary service provider names to describe the technology are also common. The position correction systems currently available on the market (including those used for data generation, transmission and processing) which do not provide associated integrity information, often do not currently meet the requirements for use in safety-relevant applications such as autonomous driving. Extending the applicability of corresponding correction data to include safety-relevant applications would increase the range of available correction data for safety-relevant applications.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A method according to claim <b>1</b> for checking the integrity of GNSS correction data is proposed here, comprising at least the following steps:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0000">a) receiving GNSS correction data which are provided without associated integrity information,<br/>b) receiving reference data which allow for a conclusion to be drawn as to the integrity of the GNSS correction data received in step a),<br/>c) checking the integrity of the GNSS correction data received in step a) by means of the reference data received in step b).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">In particular, the method is used to verify the integrity of GNSS correction data that were originally provided by the correction data provider which provides (these) GNSS correction data without any associated integrity information or integrity data. The integrity of these (originally unverified) GNSS correction data thus determined can be provided to a GNSS receiver that receives these GNSS correction data. However, it is also conceivable that the integrity checking is carried out at the receiver end. The integrity determined externally or at the receiver end can be used, for example, to achieve a (pre-)defined safety level (e.g. ASIL, SIL), by either using or not using the verified correction data.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">The integrity of the GNSS correction data usually describes the accuracy, quality, and/or consistency of these GNSS correction data. During the integrity check, the GNSS correction data are thus verified in particular with regard to accuracy, quality, plausibility, and/or consistency.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0009">Step a) involves receiving GNSS correction data which are provided without any associated integrity information. In other words, this applies in particular to GNSS correction data provided by the correction data provider providing (these) GNSS correction data without any associated integrity information or data. In particular, these GNSS correction data do not include any (additional) data describing the accuracy, quality, plausibility and/or consistency of the actual correction data. This means that these GNSS correction data (as such) do not allow in particular any conclusion to be drawn as to whether they represent a (pre-)defined safety level or quality level (e.g. SIL, ASIL) or not. The GNSS correction data are received in step a), in particular from a (mobile) GNSS receiver (itself) or from a higher-level evaluation system such as a data center. The GNSS correction data (correction data of the service to be checked) are preferably received in step a) via IP (Internet Protocol, e.g. TCP/IP or UDP), L-band, or other signal paths.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">In step b), reference data are received which allow a conclusion to be drawn as to the integrity of the GNSS correction data received in step a). The reference data may be, for example, orbit data, GNSS correction data provided with associated integrity information, and/or GNSS correction data provided by a correction data provider that differs from the correction data provider providing the GNSS correction data received in step a). In step b), the reference data are received in particular from a (mobile) GNSS receiver (itself) or from a higher-level evaluation system, such as a data center. For example, the reference data can be provided by a GNSS reference base station.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0011">In step c) the integrity of the GNSS correction data received in step a) is checked with the reference data received in step b). In particular, in step c) the accuracy, quality, plausibility and/or consistency of the GNSS correction data received in step a) are determined using the reference data received in step b). To check the integrity of the correction data, it is preferable to compare the quality of the corrections for satellite orbit and/or satellite clock, in particular within previously defined thresholds. Typically, target values for the integrity checking are (pre-)determined. For example, if the (pre-)determined target values are met, the integrity check is set to &#x201c;positive&#x201d;. Alternatively or in addition, a quality indicator can be calculated which reflects the deviation of the received correction data from the reference data.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0012">The check according to step c) can be carried out, for example, by a (mobile) GNSS receiver (itself) or by a higher-level evaluation system, such as a data center. Furthermore, on the basis of the checking procedure, in particular depending on the result of the checking procedure, integrity information about the GNSS correction data received in step a) can be generated and, if necessary, provided. The integrity information may comprise or describe the calculated quality indicator. The integrity information and/or the quality indicator can be assigned as integrity data to the corresponding GNSS correction data and/or provided (together with or separately from the corresponding GNSS correction data, as appropriate) as integrity data to the GNSS correction data. The integrity information and/or the quality indicator can, for example, allow a conclusion to be drawn as to whether the GNSS correction data meet a (pre-) determined quality level.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0013">The result of the integrity check (of the data for one or more services) can be provided (if necessary, uniformly) via IP and, if necessary, also via other signal paths such as geostationary satellites (L-band) or digital radio (e.g. Sirius XM, DAB). Furthermore, an integrity message can also be generated with results for one or more, preferably all, monitored services. For example, the integrity of GNSS correction data from different providers can be checked using the method. In this context, for example, in step a), GNSS correction data that are provided without associated integrity information can be received from a plurality of (different) services.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0014">According to an advantageous embodiment, it is proposed that the GNSS correction data received in step a) are provided by (at least) one correction data provider that does not perform an integrity check and/or does not provide integrity information for the GNSS correction data.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0015">For example, the correction provider that does not perform an integrity check and/or does not provide integrity information for the GNSS correction data may be a PPP service and/or a PPP-RTK service. In particular, the correction data provider that does not perform an integrity check and/or does not provide integrity information for the GNSS correction data is a non-commercial correction data provider.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016">According to a further advantageous embodiment it is proposed that the reference data received in step b) comprise orbit data and/or satellite clock data, and/or (where available) regional and/or global corrections for ionosphere and/or troposphere. For example, the orbit data (for checking) can be the predicted portion of the Ultra Rapid Orbits of the IGS (International GNSS Service).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0017">According to another advantageous embodiment, it is proposed that the reference data received in step b) comprise GNSS correction data which are provided with associated integrity information.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0018">The associated integrity information preferably allows a conclusion to be drawn as to whether the GNSS correction data meet a (pre-)determined quality level (e.g. SIL, ASIL) or not. The correction data provider that provides the GNSS correction data with associated integrity information is usually a commercial correction data provider.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0019">According to another advantageous embodiment, it is proposed that the reference data received in step b) comprise GNSS correction data provided by a (different) correction data provider that is different from the correction data provider that provides the GNSS correction data received in step a).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0020">The other correction data provider may be a correction provider that does not perform an integrity check and/or does not provide integrity information for the GNSS correction data. Even the (pure) GNSS correction data of another correction data provider can in this context (in particular after a comparison) enable a conclusion to be drawn as to the integrity of the correction data received in step a).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0021">By using two services without integrity checking (one of which serves as a reference product), an ASIL-A according to IS026262 or an SIL1 according to IEC61508 can already be achieved in an advantageous way. By including a service with an integrity check (e.g. with ASIL rating) as a reference product, an ASIL-B or higher can be achieved in an advantageous way (in certain constellations).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0022">According to a further advantageous embodiment, it is proposed that the check in step c) comprises comparing, validating, and/or merging the GNSS correction data received in step a) with the reference data received in step b).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0023">In particular, if in step b) GNSS correction data are received from another correction data provider as reference data, in step c) a comparison and/or validation of the GNSS correction data received in step a) with the reference data received in step b) can be performed. In particular, if GNSS correction data provided with associated integrity information are received in step b), in step c) the GNSS correction data received in step a) can be compared, validated and/or merged with the reference data received in step b).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0024">According to a further aspect a method is proposed for providing integrity data for GNSS correction data which are provided without any associated integrity information, in which a method for integrity checking described here is carried out to determine the integrity data. In particular, the integrity data thus determined can be assigned to the corresponding GNSS correction data that were (originally) provided without associated integrity information. For example, the integrity data can be transmitted to a (mobile) GNSS receiver. In particular, the integrity data allow conclusions to be drawn as to whether the GNSS correction data to which they are assigned meet a (pre-)determined quality level (e.g. ASIL, SIL).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0025">According to a further aspect a method is proposed for providing GNSS correction data to a (mobile) GNSS receiver, in which a method described here for integrity checking and/or a method described here for providing integrity data is carried out. In particular, the GNSS correction data that were (originally) provided without associated integrity information can be provided together with the identified integrity data assigned to them. This can be carried out, for example, in a data stream in which the GNSS correction data and the associated integrity data are merged, for example, into data pairs. However, it is also possible that the GNSS correction data and the associated integrity data are transmitted to the GNSS receiver via separate paths. The GNSS receiver can be arranged in or on a (motor) vehicle, which is preferably configured for at least partially automated or autonomous driving operation.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0026">According to a further aspect, a computer program for carrying out a method presented here is also proposed. In other words, this relates in particular to a computer program (product), comprising commands which during the execution of the program by a computer, cause it to execute a method described here.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0027">According to a further aspect, a machine-readable data medium is also proposed, on which the computer program is stored. Typically, the machine-readable storage medium is a computer-readable data carrier.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0028">The details, features and advantageous embodiments discussed in connection with the method for integrity testing of GNSS correction data can accordingly also occur in the method presented here for providing integrity data, the method for providing GNSS correction data, the computer program and/or the storage medium, and vice versa. In this respect reference is made to the comments made there for further characterization of the features in their full extent.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0031" num="0029">The solution presented here as well as its technical background will be explained in more detail below on the basis of the figures.
