invention relates to a device for processing material according to the preamble of claim <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Single-shaft shredders are often applied when processing materials to be shredded, especially those made of thermoplastics. Such single-shaft shredders find application in numerous fields, especially for shredding plastics material to be preshredded for recycling purposes. Such material usually appears in the form of films or extrusion start-up pads, bottles and other containers, mostly in a soiled state.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are single-shaft shredders which in one working step heat the shredded particles, partly through the cut, and transport them further into a conical transition which is formed as a single-screw. These particles are further compressed in the mostly conical part and partially further heated. A part of these thermoplastic particles soften in the process. An extruder then follows on the same axis, further compressing and heating these particles and converting them to a liquid state. Such devices are known, for example, from AT 407 971 B. However, above a certain size, such a design leads to very large and long systems that can no longer be operated well.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, to enable scaling to higher throughputs or sizes, it is necessary to move away from a single drive. It is possible to directly couple a separate extruder, primarily with its own drive, to the shredding unit, also primarily with its own drive.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the way the pretreated material is fed into the extruder is always a very critical point. Unfavourable feeding often leads to insufficient and unstable filling levels in the extrusion screw, which in turn prevents efficient or sufficient quality extrusion.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Basically, every tamping process or filling process into an extruder is critical. In many cases, a change in direction of the material and a partial closing of the intake opening by the screw flight of the extruder must also be taken into account. These are two major influencing factors.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some devices, mixing and shredding tools rotating in a vessel succeed in creating a charging pressure, provided the material is in particulate, fluid form. This also has the advantage that excess material that cannot be taken up by the extruder is returned to the container. However, this is much more difficult with a tamping screw.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is thus object of the present invention to create a device which, on the one hand, has a reasonable size at higher throughputs and can be operated well, and at the same time ensures advantageous filling of the extruder and efficient or high-quality extrusion.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">This object is solved in such a device by the characterising features of claim <b>1</b>. According to the invention, it is thus provided<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0010">that the central longitudinal axis of the screw is oriented at an angle to the central longitudinal axis of the extruder screw, in particular at an angle of 80&#xb0; to 100&#xb0;, preferably 90&#xb0;,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0011">and the longitudinal axis of the screw is offset with respect to the longitudinal axis of the extruder screw by the offset (v) in the direction of the direction of rotation of the extruder screw at or in the region of the discharge opening or the intake opening.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0011" num="0012">Due to the coupling of the screw being at an angle, in particular a conveying, transport or agglomerating screw, to the extruder, wherein the material is conveyed laterally into the extruder, on the one hand it is ensured that the dimensions of the device are compact even at higher throughput rates and that the system remains readily operable.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0013">In addition, due to the special offset of the longitudinal axis of the screw with respect to the longitudinal axis of the extruder screw, a better and more stable filling of the extruder is ensured. The change in direction of the material caused by the arrangement at an angle in particular results in even more special requirements here.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0014">On the one hand, the special offset creates a certain amount of space for the material to be deflected in the extruder intake. So if there is a slight overfeeding here, that can already be cushioned to some degree by this.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0015">On the other hand, the special geometry in the coupling region must be taken into account: Thus, the &#x201c;corkscrew&#x201d; from the screw rotates against or in the direction of the extruder device, i.e. against the active flank of the extruder screw. A screw always has a higher density on the active flank than on the passive flank, especially when the material has not yet melted and the screw is partially filled. This more compressed material, which also partially sticks together, retains the screw shape after leaving the conveying screw and is thus pressed against the active flank of the extruder screw. In addition to more stable filling, this also causes some further compression.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0016">The longitudinal axis of the screw and the longitudinal axis of the extruder screw are just not at the same height in the process. They are oriented at an angle, advantageously substantially perpendicularly, to one another and define an x-axis and a y-axis. The offset occurs in the z-axis, thus in a direction normal to the longitudinal axis of the screw and to the longitudinal axis of the extruder screw. The direction of the offset is essential in this process. The offset namely occurs in the direction in which the extruder screw rotates in the region of or directly in front of the discharge opening. In case the extruder screw rotates counterclockwise, thus for example, as viewed from behind or from the drive of the extruder, the offset occurs downwards when the screw enters the extruder laterally from the left and thus feeding occurs from the left, also as viewed from behind or from the drive. As long as the offset of the longitudinal axis of the screw in the z-axis occurs in the intended direction, it is therefore irrelevant whether the offset of the screw&#x2014;depending on the direction of rotation of the extruder screw and/or the feed side into the extruder&#x2014;occurs slightly upwards or downwards compared to the extruder screw.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0017">According to a particularly advantageous embodiment, the longitudinal axis of the screw is arranged below the longitudinal axis of the extruder, i.e. with the device in the operating state, the screw is somewhat closer to the bottom than the extruder screw. The feeding of the extruder thus occurs into the region of the extruder screw that is somewhat closer to the bottom.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0018">The screw preferably always opens out into the lateral region of the extruder, even if it is an extruder having multiple screws, in particular a twin-screw extruder. In this case, the screw advantageously opens out approximately into the plane spanned by the longitudinal axes of the extruder screws.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0019">According to a preferred embodiment, it is provided that the offset is in the range of 0&#x3c;v&#x3c;R, wherein R is the radius of the extruder screw. In this way, a particularly advantageous feeding of the extruder is possible.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0020">According to another preferred embodiment, it is provided that the intake opening of the extruder has, in the direction of the offset, a bottom surface which is inclined at an angle &#x3b1; with respect to the longitudinal axis and opening outwards, wherein the angle &#x3b1; is in the range of 0&#xb0;&#x3c;&#x3b1;&#x3c;20&#xb0;. The bottom surface is thus sloped such that a kind of wide access ramp for the material fed to the extruder is created which then rises and steadily reduces the region of the feed as the material gets closer to the extruder screw.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0021">It is further advantageous if the, in particular cylindrical, shredding housing has a larger inner diameter than the, in particular cylindrical, housing of the screw. This makes it easy to achieve precompression of the material. For design reasons, too, it is usually desirable to design the screw housing with a smaller diameter than the housing of the shredder in order to achieve a large holding volume for the latter and, on the other hand, to keep the effort for the screw smaller.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0022">In this context, it is particularly advantageous when the housing is cylindrical or has a conical shape.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0023">A favourable embodiment of the invention results when the housing of the screw is coaxially or equiaxially connected to the discharge opening of the housing of the rotor body, wherein one front side of the housing of the screw forms the intake opening for the material to be conveyed or plasticised by the screw, which then exits, in particular in the partially plasticised state, at the other front side of this housing. This has the advantage that the heat occurring in the shredder, which is due to the cutting processes and friction, is immediately carried on without loss through the processed material into the plasticising region, where it is made effective for plasticising the material.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0024">According to a most preferable embodiment, it is provided that the shredding housing, which is larger in diameter, and the housing of the screw, which is smaller in diameter, thus the shredding unit and the screw, are connected to one another by a conical transition portion. It is particularly advantageous when a conical screw is arranged in the conical transition portion for conveying and, above all, also for compressing the material. Due to the compression in the conical transition, a heating occurs in this region. Furthermore, partial agglomeration of the material can occur. This initially produces preheated and precompressed material in the conical transition to the tamping screw. This simplifies the change of direction and keeps the filling level of the extruder screw high. The compression of the material already occurs upstream of the screw&#x2014;in contrast to plant combinations in which, downstream of a single-shaft shredder, tamping screws without a special precompression device convey the largely uncompressed material into the extruder, or in which the screw only carries out compression immediately before entering the extruder. The compression of the material and the supply into the extruder are therefore also separated locally. This results in sufficient and stable filling levels in the extrusion screw, thus ensuring particularly efficient and high-quality extrusion.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0025">According to a further preferred embodiment, it is accordingly provided that the material leaves the conical part preferably into a cylindrical or conical single-screw, which subsequently conveys the material into the extruder. During this, the material is further heated or tempered and fed into the side of the extruder screw.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0026">The screw can advantageously be designed as a non-compressing conveying screw or a screw which at least partially compresses, plasticizes and/or agglomerates the material, in particular a plasticiser screw.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0027">A structurally advantageous solution for the drive results when the screw forms a support for the rotor body with an extension of its core projecting into the front end of the rotor body facing it. In this case, the screw flights abutting the inner wall of the housing of the screw form the bearing for the other end of the rotor body. There is therefore no need for a different type of bearing for the discharge end of the rotor body.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0028">In this context, it is particularly advantageous when the rotor body is coupled to the screw, and optionally also to the conical screw, in a rotationally locked manner and is driven by a common drive.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0028" num="0029">In the drawings, the object of the invention is shown schematically and by way of example by means of embodiment examples:</p><p id="p-0029" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example embodiment of the device according to the invention in perspective overall view.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the device according to the invention in a sectional view from above.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a section of the device according to the invention in a sectional view from the side.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the same section in a sectional view from above.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0033" num="0034">In the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the device according to the invention is shown in its entirety.
