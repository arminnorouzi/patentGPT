These systems may be capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing the available system resources (e.g., time, frequency, and power). Examples of such multiple-access systems include fourth generation (4G) systems such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems, LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) systems, or LTE-A Pro systems, and fifth generation (5G) systems which may be referred to as New Radio (NR) systems. These systems may employ technologies such as code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), or discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DFT-S-OFDM).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A wireless multiple-access communications system may include a number of base stations or network access nodes, each simultaneously supporting communication for multiple communication devices, which may be otherwise known as user equipment (UE). Some wireless communications systems may support UEs operating in a discontinuous reception (DRX) mode. UEs in a DRX mode may transition between a sleep state for power conservation and an active state for data transmission and reception (during an ON-duration) according to a DRX configuration.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The described techniques relate to improved methods, systems, devices, and apparatuses that support discontinuous reception (DRX) techniques with non-uniform cycle durations. In accordance with various aspects, techniques are provided for configuring DRX cycles within a DRX time period at a user equipment (UE) such that different DRX cycles have non-uniform cycle durations within the DRX time period. Such non-uniform cycle durations may provide DRX ON-durations that are aligned with a periodicity of downlink traffic to the UE. In some cases, the DRX time period may correspond to an anchor cycle that spans a set of DRX cycles, and a subset of the set of DRX cycles may have a different cycle duration than other DRX cycles of the set of DRX cycles. In some cases, an ON-duration offset value may be indicated for one or more DRX cycles within the DRX time period (e.g., via downlink control information or a medium access control (MAC) control element (CE)). In other cases, multiple DRX configurations may be configured, including an outer cycle having a cycle duration that corresponds to the DRX time period, and an inner cycle in which a set of inner DRX cycles are within one outer cycle duration, and where different inner cycles may have different cycle durations. In further cases, DRX cycles may be configured to have a cycle duration that corresponds to a rational number that is selected to correspond to the periodicity of the downlink traffic to the UE.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A method of wireless communication at a UE is described.

For example, certain types of extended reality (XR) applications may have traffic that has a regular or periodic pattern. XR applications may include, for example, cloud gaming applications, virtual reality (VR) split rendering applications, augmented reality (AR) split computation applications, and the like. Further, a UE in some cases may be configured with a discontinuous reception (DRX) configuration in which the UE transitions to a power-saving sleep state between ON-durations in which the UE monitors for communications from the base station. In some cases, the regular or periodic pattern may have a periodicity that does not correspond with an integer value of possible starting locations of DRX ON-durations. Various aspects of the present disclosure provide techniques for non-uniform DRX cycle durations within a certain DRX time period that may accommodate such a periodicity of traffic to the UE.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some cases, such non-uniform cycle durations may provide DRX ON-durations that are aligned with a periodicity of UE traffic. In some cases, multiple DRX configurations may be configured, including an outer cycle configuration having a cycle duration that corresponds to the DRX time period, and an inner cycle configuration in which a set of inner DRX cycles are within one outer cycle duration, and where different inner cycles may have different cycle durations. In some cases, an ON-duration offset value may be indicated for one or more DRX cycles within the DRX time period (e.g., via downlink control information (DCI) or a medium access control (MAC) control element (CE)). In some cases, the DRX time period may correspond to an anchor cycle that spans a set of DRX cycles, and a subset of the set of DRX cycles may have a different cycle duration than other DRX cycles of the set of DRX cycles within the DRX time period. In further cases, DRX cycles may be configured to have a cycle duration that corresponds to a rational number that is selected to correspond to the periodicity of the downlink traffic to the UE.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Such techniques may allow for relatively efficient communications between the UE and base station while providing relatively low power consumption at the UE. By aligning DRX ON-durations with expected periods of downlink traffic bursts from the base station, latency in communications may be reduced relative to instances where an initial downlink traffic burst is transmitted when the UE is in a sleep mode, which may necessitate one or more retransmissions of the traffic burst. Further, the UE may transition to the sleep mode between periodic traffic bursts, which may reduce power consumption relative to cases where the UE may not enter a sleep mode or where the UE may monitor for transmissions in an ON-duration that is not aligned with a traffic burst.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Aspects of the disclosure are initially described in the context of wireless communications systems. Additional aspects of the disclosure are described with respect to traffic patterns and DRX cycles. Aspects of the disclosure are further illustrated by and described with reference to apparatus diagrams, system diagrams, and flowcharts that relate to DRX techniques with non-uniform cycle durations.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example of a wireless communications system <b>100</b> that supports discontinuous reception techniques with non-uniform cycle durations in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure.

A UE <b>115</b> may also be a personal electronic device such as a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a tablet computer, a laptop computer, or a personal computer.

In some examples half-duplex communications may be performed at a reduced peak rate. Other power conservation techniques for UEs <b>115</b> include entering a power saving &#x201c;deep sleep&#x201d; mode when not engaging in active communications, or operating over a limited bandwidth (e.g., according to narrowband communications). In some cases, UEs <b>115</b> may be designed to support critical functions (e.g., mission critical functions), and a wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be configured to provide ultra-reliable communications for these functions.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some cases, a UE <b>115</b> may also be able to communicate directly with other UEs <b>115</b> (e.g., using a peer-to-peer (P2P) or device-to-device (D2D) protocol). One or more of a group of UEs <b>115</b> utilizing D2D communications may be within the geographic coverage area <b>110</b> of a base station <b>105</b>. Other UEs <b>115</b> in such a group may be outside the geographic coverage area <b>110</b> of a base station <b>105</b>, or be otherwise unable to receive transmissions from a base station <b>105</b>. In some cases, groups of UEs <b>115</b> communicating via D2D communications may utilize a one-to-many (1:M) system in which each UE <b>115</b> transmits to every other UE <b>115</b> in the group. In some cases, a base station <b>105</b> facilitates the scheduling of resources for D2D communications. In other cases, D2D communications are carried out between UEs <b>115</b> without the involvement of a base station <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Base stations <b>105</b> may communicate with the core network <b>130</b> and with one another. For example, base stations <b>105</b> may interface with the core network <b>130</b> through backhaul links <b>132</b> (e.g., via an S1, N2, N3, or other interface). Base stations <b>105</b> may communicate with one another over backhaul links <b>134</b> (e.g., via an X2, Xn, or other interface) either directly (e.g., directly between base stations <b>105</b>) or indirectly (e.g., via core network <b>130</b>).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The core network <b>130</b> may provide user authentication, access authorization, tracking, Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity, and other access, routing, or mobility functions. The core network <b>130</b> may be an evolved packet core (EPC), which may include at least one mobility management entity (MME), at least one serving gateway (S-GW), and at least one Packet Data Network (PDN) gateway (P-GW). The MME may manage non-access stratum (e.g., control plane) functions such as mobility, authentication, and bearer management for UEs <b>115</b> served by base stations <b>105</b> associated with the EPC. User IP packets may be transferred through the S-GW, which itself may be connected to the P-GW. The P-GW may provide IP address allocation as well as other functions. The P-GW may be connected to the network operators IP services. The operators IP services may include access to the Internet, Intranet(s), an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), or a Packet-Switched (PS) Streaming Service.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">At least some of the network devices, such as a base station <b>105</b>, may include subcomponents such as an access network entity, which may be an example of an access node controller (ANC). Each access network entity may communicate with UEs <b>115</b> through a number of other access network transmission entities, which may be referred to as a radio head, a smart radio head, or a transmission/reception point (TRP). In some configurations, various functions of each access network entity or base station <b>105</b> may be distributed across various network devices (e.g., radio heads and access network controllers) or consolidated into a single network device (e.g., a base station <b>105</b>).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Wireless communications system <b>100</b> may operate using one or more frequency bands, typically in the range of 300 megahertz (MHz) to 300 gigahertz (GHz). Generally, the region from 300 MHz to 3 GHz is known as the ultra-high frequency (UHF) region or decimeter band, since the wavelengths range from approximately one decimeter to one meter in length. UHF waves may be blocked or redirected by buildings and environmental features. However, the waves may penetrate structures sufficiently for a macro cell to provide service to UEs <b>115</b> located indoors. Transmission of UHF waves may be associated with smaller antennas and shorter range (e.g., less than 100 km) compared to transmission using the smaller frequencies and longer waves of the high frequency (HF) or very high frequency (VHF) portion of the spectrum below 300 MHz.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Wireless communications system <b>100</b> may also operate in a super high frequency (SHF) region using frequency bands from 3 GHz to 30 GHz, also known as the centimeter band. The SHF region includes bands such as the 5 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) bands, which may be used opportunistically by devices that may be capable of tolerating interference from other users.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Wireless communications system <b>100</b> may also operate in an extremely high frequency (EHF) region of the spectrum (e.g., from 30 GHz to 300 GHz), also known as the millimeter band. In some examples, wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support millimeter wave (mmW) communications between UEs <b>115</b> and base stations <b>105</b>, and EHF antennas of the respective devices may be even smaller and more closely spaced than UHF antennas. In some cases, this may facilitate use of antenna arrays within a UE <b>115</b>. However, the propagation of EHF transmissions may be subject to even greater atmospheric attenuation and shorter range than SHF or UHF transmissions. Techniques disclosed herein may be employed across transmissions that use one or more different frequency regions, and designated use of bands across these frequency regions may differ by country or regulating body.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some cases, wireless communications system <b>100</b> may utilize both licensed and unlicensed radio frequency spectrum bands. For example, wireless communications system <b>100</b> may employ License Assisted Access (LAA), LTE-Unlicensed (LTE-U) radio access technology, or NR technology in an unlicensed band such as the 5 GHz ISM band. When operating in unlicensed radio frequency spectrum bands, wireless devices such as base stations <b>105</b> and UEs <b>115</b> may employ listen-before-talk (LBT) procedures to ensure a frequency channel is clear before transmitting data. In some cases, operations in unlicensed bands may be based on a carrier aggregation configuration in conjunction with component carriers operating in a licensed band (e.g., LAA). Operations in unlicensed spectrum may include downlink transmissions, uplink transmissions, peer-to-peer transmissions, or a combination of these. Duplexing in unlicensed spectrum may be based on frequency division duplexing (FDD), time division duplexing (TDD), or a combination of both.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some examples, base station <b>105</b> or UE <b>115</b> may be equipped with multiple antennas, which may be used to employ techniques such as transmit diversity, receive diversity, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications, or beamforming. For example, wireless communications system <b>100</b> may use a transmission scheme between a transmitting device (e.g., a base station <b>105</b>) and a receiving device (e.g., a UE <b>115</b>), where the transmitting device is equipped with multiple antennas and the receiving device is equipped with one or more antennas. MIMO communications may employ multipath signal propagation to increase the spectral efficiency by transmitting or receiving multiple signals via different spatial layers, which may be referred to as spatial multiplexing. The multiple signals may, for example, be transmitted by the transmitting device via different antennas or different combinations of antennas. Likewise, the multiple signals may be received by the receiving device via different antennas or different combinations of antennas. Each of the multiple signals may be referred to as a separate spatial stream, and may carry bits associated with the same data stream (e.g., the same codeword) or different data streams. Different spatial layers may be associated with different antenna ports used for channel measurement and reporting. MIMO techniques include single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO) where multiple spatial layers are transmitted to the same receiving device, and multiple-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) where multiple spatial layers are transmitted to multiple devices.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Beamforming, which may also be referred to as spatial filtering, directional transmission, or directional reception, is a signal processing technique that may be used at a transmitting device or a receiving device (e.g., a base station <b>105</b> or a UE <b>115</b>) to shape or steer an antenna beam (e.g., a transmit beam or receive beam) along a spatial path between the transmitting device and the receiving device. Beamforming may be achieved by combining the signals communicated via antenna elements of an antenna array such that signals propagating at particular orientations with respect to an antenna array experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. The adjustment of signals communicated via the antenna elements may include a transmitting device or a receiving device applying certain amplitude and phase offsets to signals carried via each of the antenna elements associated with the device. The adjustments associated with each of the antenna elements may be defined by a beamforming weight set associated with a particular orientation (e.g., with respect to the antenna array of the transmitting device or receiving device, or with respect to some other orientation).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some cases, the antennas of a base station <b>105</b> or UE <b>115</b> may be located within one or more antenna arrays, which may support MIMO operations, or transmit or receive beamforming. For example, one or more base station antennas or antenna arrays may be co-located at an antenna assembly, such as an antenna tower. In some cases, antennas or antenna arrays associated with a base station <b>105</b> may be located in diverse geographic locations. A base station <b>105</b> may have an antenna array with a number of rows and columns of antenna ports that the base station <b>105</b> may use to support beamforming of communications with a UE <b>115</b>. Likewise, a UE <b>115</b> may have one or more antenna arrays that may support various MIMO or beamforming operations.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some cases, wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be a packet-based network that operate according to a layered protocol stack. In the user plane, communications at the bearer or Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) layer may be IP-based. A Radio Link Control (RLC) layer may perform packet segmentation and reassembly to communicate over logical channels. A Medium Access Control (MAC) layer may perform priority handling and multiplexing of logical channels into transport channels. The MAC layer may also use hybrid automatic repeat request (HARD) to provide retransmission at the MAC layer to improve link efficiency. In the control plane, the Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol layer may provide establishment, configuration, and maintenance of an RRC connection between a UE <b>115</b> and a base station <b>105</b> or core network <b>130</b> supporting radio bearers for user plane data. At the Physical layer, transport channels may be mapped to physical channels.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Time intervals in LTE or NR may be expressed in multiples of a basic time unit, which may, for example, refer to a sampling period of T<sub>s</sub>= 1/30,720,000 seconds. Time intervals of a communications resource may be organized according to radio frames each having a duration of 10 milliseconds (ms), where the frame period may be expressed as T<sub>f</sub>=307,200 T<sub>s</sub>. The radio frames may be identified by a system frame number (SFN) ranging from 0 to 1023. Each frame may include 10 subframes numbered from 0 to 9, and each subframe may have a duration of 1 ms. A subframe may be further divided into 2 slots each having a duration of 0.5 ms, and each slot may contain 6 or 7 modulation symbol periods (e.g., depending on the length of the cyclic prefix prepended to each symbol period). Excluding the cyclic prefix, each symbol period may contain 2048 sampling periods. In some cases, a subframe may be the smallest scheduling unit of the wireless communications system <b>100</b>, and may be referred to as a transmission time interval (TTI). In other cases, a smallest scheduling unit of the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be shorter than a subframe or may be dynamically selected (e.g., in bursts of shortened TTIs (sTTIs) or in selected component carriers using sTTIs).</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some wireless communications systems, a slot may further be divided into multiple mini-slots containing one or more symbols. In some instances, a symbol of a mini-slot or a mini-slot may be the smallest unit of scheduling. Each symbol may vary in duration depending on the subcarrier spacing or frequency band of operation, for example. Further, some wireless communications systems may implement slot aggregation in which multiple slots or mini-slots are aggregated together and used for communication between a UE <b>115</b> and a base station <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In a system employing MCM techniques, a resource element may consist of one symbol period (e.g., a duration of one modulation symbol) and one subcarrier, where the symbol period and subcarrier spacing are inversely related. The number of bits carried by each resource element may depend on the modulation scheme (e.g., the order of the modulation scheme). Thus, the more resource elements that a UE <b>115</b> receives and the higher the order of the modulation scheme, the higher the data rate may be for the UE <b>115</b>. In MIMO systems, a wireless communications resource may refer to a combination of a radio frequency spectrum resource, a time resource, and a spatial resource (e.g., spatial layers), and the use of multiple spatial layers may further increase the data rate for communications with a UE <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In some cases, one or more UEs <b>115</b> may be configured with DRX cycles within a DRX time period, such that different DRX cycles have non-uniform cycle durations within the DRX time period. Such non-uniform cycle durations may provide DRX ON-durations that are aligned with a periodicity of downlink traffic from a base station <b>105</b> to the UE <b>115</b>. In some cases, the DRX time period may correspond to an anchor cycle that spans a set of DRX cycles, and a subset of the set of DRX cycles may have a different cycle duration than other DRX cycles of the set of DRX cycles. In some cases, an ON-duration offset value may be indicated for one or more DRX cycles within the DRX time period (e.g., via DCI or a MAC-CE). In other cases, multiple DRX configurations may be configured, including an outer cycle configuration having a cycle duration that corresponds to the DRX time period, and an inner cycle configuration in which a set of inner DRX cycles are within one outer cycle duration, and where different inner cycles may have different cycle durations. In further cases, DRX cycles may be configured to have a cycle duration that corresponds to a rational number that is selected to correspond to the periodicity of the downlink traffic to the UE <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example of a wireless communications system <b>200</b> that supports discontinuous reception techniques with non-uniform cycle durations in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure.

In some examples, UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may support DRX operation for improved power efficiency. For example, a UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may operate according to a DRX configuration in which the UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>monitors for communications during periodic ON-durations, and transitions to a low power sleep mode between the periodic ON-durations. The time period between the start of each ON-duration may be referred to as a cycle duration. Further, in some cases, DRX cycles may have an identified starting location (e.g., at the start of an identified slot within a subframe), and a configurable ON-duration (e.g., 2 slots) that starts at an offset (e.g., 4 slots) relative to the identified starting location.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">For example, the base station <b>105</b>-<i>a </i>and UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may establish one or more downlink channels <b>205</b> and one or more uplink channels <b>210</b>. In this example, the UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may be running an application (e.g., an XR application) in which periodic traffic <b>215</b> may be transmitted to the UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>from the base station <b>105</b>-<i>a</i>. The UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may also transmit uplink traffic <b>220</b>, which in some cases may also have periodic transmissions. In order to reduce power consumption, the UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may operate according to a DRX configuration in which the UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>can transition to the low power sleep mode between bursts of periodic traffic <b>215</b>. In accordance with various aspects of the present disclosure, the DRX configuration may have non-uniform cycle durations, such that the DRX ON-durations are aligned with expected timing of the periodic traffic <b>215</b>.

In some examples, downlink traffic pattern <b>300</b> may be implemented in aspects of wireless communications system <b>100</b> or <b>200</b>. In this example, downlink traffic burst arrivals <b>305</b> may include a number of downlink traffic bursts <b>310</b> that are transmitted according to a periodic pattern. Further, in this example, a first conventional DRX configuration <b>315</b> and a second conventional DRX configuration <b>320</b> are illustrated.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The downlink traffic bursts <b>310</b> may include, for example, XR downlink traffic that has a periodic pattern that corresponds to a frame rate of transmitted data (e.g., H.264/H.265 encoded video). Such downlink traffic may be quasi-periodic with burst a every frame at one frame-per-second (1/fps), or two possibly staggered &#x201c;eye-buffers&#x201d; per frame at 1/(2*fps). An update rate is may be, for example, 120 Hz or 60 Hz, thus resulting in a downlink traffic burst arrival periodicity of 8.333 ms or 16.667 ms, respectively. However, conventional DRX configuration may have one millisecond as the finest granularity for a DRX cycle, and the start of the ON duration may be aligned to millisecond time boundaries.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a 120 Hz update rate is illustrated for burst arrivals <b>305</b>, thus resulting in an 8.333 ms periodicity for the downlink traffic bursts <b>310</b>. In the event that the first conventional DRX configuration <b>315</b> is selected and an initial DRX cycle has an ON-duration that is aligned with the first downlink traffic burst <b>310</b>-<i>a</i>, the second downlink traffic burst <b>310</b>-<i>b </i>and the third downlink traffic burst <b>310</b>-<i>a </i>will each also be within the subsequent two ON-durations. However, the fourth downlink burst <b>310</b>-<i>d </i>would miss the fourth ON-duration, as it would occur 0.333 seconds after the end of the fourth ON-duration. If the second conventional DRX configuration <b>320</b> were to be selected instead, the result would be that the first downlink traffic burst <b>310</b>-<i>a </i>would be aligned with an ON-duration, but subsequent downlink traffic bursts <b>310</b>-<i>b</i>, <b>310</b>-<i>c</i>, and <b>310</b>-<i>d </i>would each miss the ON-duration.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Further if the DRX configuration were to be modified to have a finest granularity corresponding to a slot or symbol, such misalignments would continue to occur due to the burst arrivals <b>305</b> having a periodicity that is not a multiple of a slot or symbol duration. For example, as the traffic burst interval (120 Hz or 60 Hz) expressed in milliseconds has a factor of 3 in the denominator which cannot divide into the numerator (i.e., 1000/120=X/3, where X is an integer such as 25 for a 120 Hz update rate or 50 for 60 Hz update rate). More generally, if DRX cycle granularity can be defined in slots, the expression would be</p><p id="p-0090" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>(num of slots in a second)/(source update rate in Hz)=<i>Y/</i>3.&#x2003;&#x2003;(Equation 1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0091" num="0089">Additionally, misalignments between the downlink traffic bursts <b>310</b> and ON-durations may add additional latency to communications, where the additional latency is cyclic. For example, in a first missed ON-duration of an 8 ms DRX configuration, the downlink traffic burst may be retransmitted at a next ON-duration, which occurs 7 ms later than the missed ON-duration. Subsequent downlink traffic bursts will have a lower latency, which reduces by 0.333 ms each cycle, until the downlink traffic bursts are again aligned with ON-durations in 21 cycles, with such alignment lasting for three cycles. Thus, the alignment and misalignment of downlink traffic bursts in such an example would be cyclic with a period of 24 cycles, and an average latency of about 3 ms. In some cases, to reduce the latency, the DRX cycle duration may be reduced, which also has a corresponding increase in power consumption due to the extra ON-durations. Thus, non-uniform cycle durations in accordance with techniques discussed herein may allow for such misalignments to be reduced or eliminated, which may reduce latency for communications and reduce power consumption at UEs.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an example of an anchor cycle with a leap DRX cycle <b>400</b> that supports discontinuous reception techniques with non-uniform cycle durations in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure.

In this example, again, downlink traffic burst arrivals <b>405</b> may include a number of downlink traffic bursts <b>410</b> that are transmitted according to a periodic pattern.

In this example, the anchor cycle <b>420</b> spans three DRX cycles, and the third DRX cycle is a leap cycle <b>425</b> that has a longer cycle duration than the initial two DRX cycles. In some cases, the anchor cycle <b>420</b>, which may be an example of a discontinuous reception period, may span more or fewer DRX cycles, and may include one or more leap cycles <b>425</b>. The anchor cycle <b>420</b> may be used as a basis for determining timing for radio resource management (RRM) functions. In some cases, the leap cycle <b>425</b> may include one or more additional slots than other DRX cycles of the anchor cycle <b>420</b>. In some cases, the position of the leap cycle(s) <b>425</b> can be varied within the anchor cycle <b>420</b>. While the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a burst arrivals <b>405</b> associated with periodic traffic having a 120 Hz update rate, and thus anchor cycle <b>420</b> includes three DRX cycles with durations of 8 ms, 8 ms, and 9 ms, other configurations may be used for different periodicities or patterns of downlink traffic. For example, for periodic traffic with a 60 Hz update rate, an anchor cycle with three DRX cycles of 16 ms, 17 ms, 17 ms may be configured, or the three DRX cycles may have durations of 16 ms, 16 ms, 18 ms, respectively. The order of the leap cycle(s) <b>425</b> among the DRX cycles within the anchor cycle <b>420</b> may also be configured. For example, for 120 Hz update rate, DRX cycles with duration of (8 ms, 8 ms, 9 ms), (8 ms, 9 ms, 8 ms), or (9 ms, 8 ms, 8 ms) can be configured. Support for such varied options in the ordering may help with offsetting multiple users in time for their respective ON durations, in order to better distribute utilization of resources over time.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0092">In some cases, a base station may configure a UE with such a DRX configuration via radio resource control (RRC) signaling. For example, a base station may identify that periodic traffic is being transmitted to the UE (e.g., based on XR application traffic having a certain update rate, or based on historical downlink burst transmissions to the UE), and that the periodic traffic does not align with slot or subframe boundaries. The base station may determine the anchor cycle duration (e.g., based on a number of periods of the downlink traffic bursts <b>410</b> that correspond to millisecond time boundaries, such as three 8.333 ms periods that provide a 25 ms anchor cycle duration), a number of DRX cycles within the anchor cycle <b>420</b>, and which of the DRX cycles are to have different cycle durations. In some cases, the RRC signaling may indicate the anchor cycle duration in milliseconds, the number of DRX cycles in the anchor cycle, and the cycle duration of each DRX cycle (e.g., 8, 8, 9). In some cases, the UE may signal to the base station that the UE has a capability to perform DRX procedures with non-uniform DRX cycles, and the base station may enable the capability when providing the DRX configuration. In other cases, non-uniform DRX cycles may be configured using other techniques, such as by adjusting a starting offset of an ON-duration of a DRX cycle, as discussed in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an example of a DRX configuration with dynamic offset adjustment <b>500</b> that supports discontinuous reception techniques with non-uniform cycle durations in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure.

For example, different types of traffic (e.g., XR traffic) and different periodicities (e.g., based on a 120 Hz or 60 Hz update rate) DRX starting offsets may be defined according to a pattern such as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> (e.g., every 4th DRX cycle has a 1 ms starting offset added). In some cases, the DRX starting offset may be dynamically indicated (e.g. based on MAC-CE or DCI) in a prior downlink transmission.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0096">In further cases, non-uniform DRX cycle durations may be configured through separate outer and inner DRX configurations. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an example of DRX outer and inner cycles <b>600</b> that supports discontinuous reception techniques with non-uniform cycle durations in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure. In some examples, DRX outer and inner cycles <b>600</b> may implement aspects of wireless communications system <b>100</b> or <b>200</b>. In this example, again, downlink traffic burst arrivals <b>605</b> may include a number of downlink traffic bursts <b>610</b> that are transmitted according to a periodic pattern. Further, in this example, a DRX configuration <b>615</b> with non-uniform cycle durations is illustrated.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0097">The downlink traffic bursts <b>610</b> may include, for example, XR downlink traffic that has a periodic pattern with a downlink traffic bursts <b>610</b> every 8.333 ms. In this example, non-uniform DRX cycle durations may be configured by providing an outer cycle <b>620</b> configuration and an inner cycle <b>625</b> configuration. The outer cycle <b>620</b>, which may be an example of a discontinuous reception cycle that has a period equal to a discontinuous reception period, may span more or fewer DRX cycles than illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The outer cycle <b>620</b> configuration may be used as a basis for determining timing for RRM functions (e.g., reference signal transmissions and measurements that provide information on channel conditions between the UE and base station).</p><p id="p-0100" num="0098">The inner cycle <b>625</b> configuration may provide configurations for a set of DRX cycles within each outer cycle <b>620</b>. In this example, a first inner cycle <b>625</b>-<i>a </i>may be configured with a first cycle duration (e.g., 8 ms), a second inner cycle <b>625</b>-<i>b </i>may be configured with the first cycle duration, and a third inner cycle <b>625</b>-<i>c </i>may be configured with a second cycle duration (e.g., 9 ms). In some cases, the position of the longer inner cycle <b>625</b> can be varied within the outer cycle <b>620</b>. While the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a burst arrivals <b>605</b> associated with periodic traffic having a 120 Hz update rate, and thus outer cycle <b>620</b> includes three inner DRX cycles <b>625</b> with durations of 8 ms, 8 ms, and 9 ms, other configurations may be used for different periodicities or patterns of downlink traffic. For example, for periodic traffic with a 60 Hz update rate, an outer cycle <b>620</b> with three inner DRX cycles <b>625</b> of 16 ms, 17 ms, 17 ms may be configured, or the three DRX cycles may have durations of 16 ms, 16 ms, 18 ms, respectively. In some examples, the configuration of the inner DRX cycles <b>625</b> may be communicated or identified by one or more additional ON-durations included within an outer cycle <b>620</b>.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0099">In some cases, a base station may configure a UE with such DRX configurations via radio resource control (RRC) signaling. For example, a base station may identify that periodic traffic is being transmitted to the UE (e.g., based on XR application traffic having a certain update rate, or based on historical downlink burst transmissions to the UE), and that the periodic traffic does not align with slot or subframe boundaries. The base station may determine the outer cycle <b>620</b> configuration (e.g., based on a number of periods of the downlink traffic bursts <b>610</b> that correspond to millisecond time boundaries, such as three 8.333 ms periods that provide a 25 ms outer cycle <b>620</b> duration), a number of inner DRX cycles <b>625</b> within the outer cycle <b>620</b>, and which of the inner DRX cycles <b>625</b> are to have different cycle durations. In some cases, the RRC signaling may configure the outer cycle <b>620</b> as a separate DRX configuration, and configure the inner cycles <b>625</b> as a separate DRX configuration, where RRM is performed based on the outer cycle <b>620</b> configuration. In some cases, the start of an initial inner cycle <b>625</b>-<i>a </i>is aligned to the start of the outer cycle <b>620</b>, and the end of the last inner cycle <b>625</b>-<i>c </i>is aligned to the end of the outer cycle <b>620</b>. The ON-duration, inactivity timer, and other DRX parameter configuration for the inner cycles <b>625</b> may be the same as that of the outer cycle <b>620</b>. In some cases, the UE may signal to the base station that the UE has a capability to perform DRX procedures with non-uniform DRX cycles, and the base station may enable the capability when providing the DRX configuration.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0100">In other cases, DRX cycle durations may be configured based on a rational number that is used to determine the DRX cycle durations. In such cases, instead of supporting only integer millisecond DRX cycle durations, a DRX configuration may support non-integer millisecond DRX cycle durations as a rational number. For example, the DRX cycle duration may be determined as p/q milliseconds, where p may be the period of multiple downlink bursts that provide an integer millisecond duration (e.g., for a 120 Hz update rate of XR traffic, 25 ms), and q may be the inverse a decimal portion of the downlink burst period (e.g., 1/0.333=3, for a 120 Hz update rate of XR traffic). Based on the rational number cycle duration, DRX cycles may start in a middle of a slot. Based on the starting point of the DRX cycle, the associated ON-duration may be quantized, in some cases, to start at a slot/mini-slot boundary of the current active bandwidth part. In some cases, the starting point of the ON-duration may be set to the nearest boundary, to a next boundary in time, or to a previous boundary in time. In other cases, the start of the ON duration may be quantized to a symbol boundary of the current active bandwidth part, such as to a nearest symbol boundary, a next symbol boundary, or a previous symbol boundary. In such cases, the ON-duration may be defined in terms of a number of symbols. In further cases, the ON-duration starting location may not be quantized to a time boundary, and an absolute time is used to determine the start of the ON-duration.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0101">In such configurations, downlink control channel monitoring occasion start and end times may be compared to ON-duration timing, and if the monitoring occasion falls entirely within an ON-duration, the control channel monitoring occasion will be monitored. Further, in some cases a DRX inactivity timer may be applied based on the ON-durations. The DRX activity timer may have a granularity of milliseconds or fractional-slots. In some cases, the DRX activity timer may be applied based on absolute time relative to the ON-duration. In other cases, the DRX activity timer may be first based on an absolute time relative to the ON-duration, and then a quantization applies (e.g., to align with a slot, mini-slot, or symbol). Further, in such rational number-based cycle duration configurations, various other operations (e.g., RRM), may be anchored to certain DRX cycles, such as every p-th cycle.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates an example of a process flow <b>700</b> that supports discontinuous reception techniques with non-uniform cycle durations in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure.

In other cases, the base station <b>105</b>-<i>b </i>may identify that periodic traffic is transmitted to the UE <b>115</b>-<i>b </i>over a period of time, and based on this historical information may determine the periodicity of communications.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0106">At <b>715</b>, the base station <b>105</b>-<i>b </i>may determine a DRX configuration for the UE <b>115</b>-<i>b</i>.

In some cases, the DRX configuration may have non-uniform cycle durations. in such cases, the base station may configure a discontinuous reception period (e.g., an anchor cycle, outer cycle, number of DRX cycles prior to an ON-duration offset adjustment, or number of DRX cycles). Within the discontinuous reception period, one or more DRX cycles may have a first cycle duration, and one or more other DRX cycles may have a second cycle duration, which may provide that the ON-durations are aligned with the downlink traffic bursts.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0107">At <b>720</b>, the base station <b>105</b>-<i>b </i>may transmit DRX configuration information to the UE <b>115</b>-<i>b</i>.
