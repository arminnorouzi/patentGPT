Such minimally invasive techniques may be performed through natural orifices in a patient anatomy or through one or more surgical incisions. Through these natural orifices or incisions physician may insert minimally invasive medical instruments (including surgical, diagnostic, therapeutic, or biopsy instruments) to reach a target tissue location. One such minimally invasive technique is to use a flexible and/or steerable elongate device, such as a flexible catheter, that can be inserted into anatomic passageways and navigated toward a region of interest within the patient anatomy. Flexible instruments may be inserted through the catheter to perform procedures at the target location. To prevent injury, certain types of tissues such as blood vessels, pulmonary pleura, and cardiac tissue should be avoided being punctured when deploying the flexible instruments. Supplemental sensing systems may be used to conduct more accurate procedures.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The embodiments of the invention are best summarized by the claims that follow the description.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Consistent with some embodiments, a system for performing a minimally invasive procedure may include a flexible catheter with a lumen extending therethrough, an elongate instrument sized for passage through the lumen, and an optical coherence tomographic sensor coupled to the elongate instrument.

In some embodiments, teleoperated medical system <b>100</b> may be suitable for use in, for example, medical, surgical, diagnostic, therapeutic, or biopsy procedures. In some examples, teleoperated, medical system may operate in a non-teleoperational manner under non-teleoperator control. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, medical system <b>100</b> generally includes a manipulator assembly <b>102</b> for operating a medical instrument <b>104</b> in performing various procedures on a patient P. Manipulator assembly <b>102</b> is mounted to or near an operating table T. A master assembly <b>106</b> allows an operator O (e.g., a surgeon, a clinician, or a physician as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) to view the interventional site and to control manipulator assembly <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Master assembly <b>106</b> may be located at an operator's console which is usually located in the same room as operating table T, such as at the side of a surgical table on which patient P is located. However, it should be understood that operator O can be located in a different room or a completely different building from patient P. Master assembly <b>106</b> generally includes one or more control devices for controlling manipulator assembly <b>102</b>. The control devices may include any number of a variety of input devices, such as joysticks, trackballs, data gloves, trigger-guns, hand-operated controllers, voice recognition devices, body motion or presence sensors, and/or the like. To provide operator O a strong sense of directly controlling instruments <b>104</b> the control devices may be provided with the same degrees of freedom as the associated medical instrument <b>104</b>. In this manner, the control devices provide operator O with telepresence or the perception that the control devices are integral with medical instruments <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, the control devices may have more or fewer degrees of freedom than the associated medical instrument <b>104</b> and still provide operator O with telepresence. In some embodiments, the control devices may optionally be manual input devices which move with six degrees of freedom, and which may also include an actuatable handle for actuating instruments (for example, for closing grasping jaws, applying an electrical potential to an electrode, delivering a medicinal treatment, and/or the like).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Manipulator assembly <b>102</b> supports medical instrument <b>104</b> and may include a kinematic structure of one or more non-servo controlled links (e.g., one or more links that may be manually positioned and locked in place, generally referred to as a set-up structure), a teleoperated kinematic structure, and/or a teleoperational manipulator. Manipulator assembly <b>102</b> may optionally include a plurality of actuators or motors that drive inputs on medical instrument <b>104</b> in response to commands from the control system (e.g., a control system <b>112</b>). The actuators may optionally include drive systems that when coupled to medical instrument <b>104</b> may advance medical instrument <b>104</b> into a naturally or surgically created anatomic orifice. Other drive systems may move the distal end of medical instrument <b>104</b> in multiple degrees of freedom, which may include three degrees of linear motion (e.g., linear motion along the X, Y, Z Cartesian axes) and in three degrees of rotational motion (e.g., rotation about the X, Y, Z Cartesian axes). Additionally, the actuators can be used to actuate an articulable end effector of medical instrument <b>104</b> for grasping tissue in the jaws of a biopsy device and/or the like. Actuator position sensors such as resolvers, encoders, potentiometers, and other mechanisms may provide sensor data to medical system <b>100</b> describing the rotation and orientation of the motor shafts. This position sensor data may be used to determine motion of the objects manipulated by the actuators.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Teleoperated medical system <b>100</b> may include a sensor system <b>108</b> with one or more sub-systems for receiving information about the instruments of manipulator assembly <b>102</b>. Such sub-systems may include a position/location sensor system (e.g., an electromagnetic (EM) sensor system); a shape sensor system for determining the position, orientation, speed, velocity, pose, and/or shape of a distal end and/or of one or more segments along a flexible body that may make up medical instrument <b>104</b>; and/or a visualization system for capturing images from the distal end of medical instrument <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Teleoperated medical system <b>100</b> also includes a display system <b>110</b> for displaying an image or representation of the surgical site and medical instrument <b>104</b> generated by sub-systems of sensor system <b>108</b>. Display system <b>110</b> and master assembly <b>106</b> may be oriented so operator O can control medical instrument <b>104</b> and master assembly <b>106</b> with the perception of telepresence.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, medical instrument <b>104</b> may have a visualization system (discussed in more detail below), which may include a viewing scope assembly that records a concurrent or real-time image of a surgical site and provides the image to the operator O through one or more displays of medical system <b>100</b>, such as one or more displays of display system <b>110</b>. The concurrent image may be, for example, a two or three dimensional image captured by an endoscope positioned within the surgical site. In some embodiments, the visualization system includes endoscopic components that may be integrally or removably coupled to medical instrument <b>104</b>. However in some embodiments, a separate endoscope, attached to a separate manipulator assembly may be used with medical instrument <b>104</b> to image the surgical site. The visualization system may be implemented as hardware, firmware, software or a combination thereof which interact with or are otherwise executed by one or more computer processors, which may include the processors of a control system <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Display system <b>110</b> may also display an image of the surgical site and medical instruments captured by the visualization system. In some examples, teleoperated medical system <b>100</b> may configure medical instrument <b>104</b> and controls of master assembly <b>106</b> such that the relative positions of the medical instruments are similar to the relative positions of the eyes and hands of operator O. In this manner operator O can manipulate medical instrument <b>104</b> and the hand control as if viewing the workspace in substantially true presence. By true presence, it is meant that the presentation of an image is a true perspective image simulating the viewpoint of an operator that is physically manipulating medical instrument <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some examples, display system <b>110</b> may present images of a surgical site recorded pre-operatively or intra-operatively using image data from imaging technology such as, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluoroscopy, thermography, ultrasound, optical coherence tomography (OCT), thermal imaging, impedance imaging, laser imaging, nanotube X-ray imaging, and/or the like. The pre-operative or intra-operative image data may be presented as two-dimensional, three-dimensional, or four-dimensional (including e.g., time based or velocity based information) images and/or as images from models created from the pre-operative or intra-operative image data sets.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, often for purposes of imaged guided surgical procedures, display system <b>110</b> may display a virtual navigational image in which the actual location of medical instrument <b>104</b> is registered (i.e., dynamically referenced) with the preoperative or concurrent images/model. This may be done to present the operator O with a virtual image of the internal surgical site from a viewpoint of medical instrument <b>104</b>. In some examples, the viewpoint may be from a tip of medical instrument <b>104</b>. An image of the tip of medical instrument <b>104</b> and/or other graphical or alphanumeric indicators may be superimposed on the virtual image to assist operator O controlling medical instrument <b>104</b>. In some examples, medical instrument <b>104</b> may not be visible in the virtual image.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, display system <b>110</b> may display a virtual navigational image in which the actual location of medical instrument <b>104</b> is registered with preoperative or concurrent images to present the operator O with a virtual image of medical instrument <b>104</b> within the surgical site from an external viewpoint. An image of a portion of medical instrument <b>104</b> or other graphical or alphanumeric indicators may be superimposed on the virtual image to assist operator O in the control of medical instrument <b>104</b>. As described herein, visual representations of data points may be rendered to display system <b>110</b>. For example, measured data points, moved data points, registered data points, and other data points described herein may be displayed on display system <b>110</b> in a visual representation.

The target tissue may be located near sensitive tissue structures that, if inadvertently pierced, may result in a failed procedure, patient injury, or patient death. For example with a medical procedure in lung tissue, virtual navigation may be used to access target tissue in remote airways, near the boundaries of lung tissue. These passageways may be close to sensitive tissue such as visceral and parietal pleura, fissure tissue, cardiac tissue such as the aorta, vasculature including the great vessel or other blood vessels, and musculature such as the diaphragm. These types of tissue may not be visible on a navigation display, real time image, or the location of the tissue structures in the preoperatively obtained images of the navigation display may be inaccurate. This creates the risk that a deployed medical instrument may pierce the sensitive tissue. For example, if a biopsy needle pierces through the pulmonary pleura, a pneumothorax may result. Although this example generally describes the use of a medical instrument for use in the airway passageways of lung tissue, it is understood that the same systems and techniques may be applied with other types of anatomic tissue.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Real-time imaging using ultrasound, CT, and/or fluoroscopic technology may be of limited use in assisting with robotic or non-robotic medical procedures. For example, ultrasound may provide low quality images through the parenchyma due to the presence of air in the passageways of lung tissue. CT equipment may not be available in interventional pulmonology environments and may be limited in providing real-time images. Fluoroscopy equipment may be limited in the type of tissue that can be imaged or is visible in images. Both CT and fluoroscopy emit levels of radiation that may be unacceptable for extended periods of time.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">OCT imaging uses reflected light energy to create three dimensional images of local tissue structures. An OCT imaging component embedded in a medical instrument may be used to generate real-time images that alone or as supplementation to other navigation images may provide more accurate tissue location information and allow the medical instrument to avoid sensitive tissue structures. An OCT imaging component or sensor may include one or more optical fiber or other tracking sensors and optical components such as lenses, couplers, and mirrors for gathering real-time OCT images and providing them to the robotic control system for analysis and display.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a medical instrument system <b>400</b> (e.g., system <b>200</b>) deployed within an anatomic passageway <b>402</b>.

For example, the needle may be automatically driven by the robotic system to the predefined maximum insertion depth or an alert may be provided to the controller of a manually driven needle when the predefined maximum insertion depth is reached. In a hybrid teleoperational/manual or robotic/manual system, the operator may be alerted to stop manual or teleoperational advancement of the needle when the predefined maximum insertion depth is reached.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">A removable stylet with integrated OCT imaging components, may be suitable in small needle constructions because removal of the stylet and the attached OCT imaging component from the needle may allow for a minimized outer diameter of the needle and maximized inner diameter of the needle lumen. The removable stylet may be used to position multiple biopsy instruments during a single procedure, allowing the cost of the OCT enabled stylet (which may also include shape sensor or EM sensor components) to be amortized over multiple biopsy instruments.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In alternative embodiments, the OCT imaging component may be fixed within the instrument <b>406</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, a side-imaging OCT instrument <b>600</b> (e.g., instrument <b>406</b> or stylet <b>411</b>) may include an outer wall <b>602</b> housing an optical assembly <b>604</b> which may include one or more optical fibers, lenses, filters, mirrors, or other optical components for directing a light beam <b>608</b> through a side aperture <b>610</b> in the outer wall. A light beam <b>612</b> emerging from the side aperture <b>610</b> may be used to perform the OCT imaging. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, a forward-facing OCT instrument <b>650</b> (e.g., instrument <b>406</b> or stylet <b>411</b>) may include an outer wall <b>652</b> housing an optical assembly <b>654</b> which may include one or more optical fibers, lenses, filters, mirrors, or other optical components for directing a light beam <b>658</b> through a distal aperture <b>660</b>. The light beam <b>658</b> emerging from the distal aperture <b>660</b> may be used to perform the OCT imaging.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In various embodiments, OCT imaging data from the instrument or stylet may be used to generate an OCT image for display to the physician for use in guiding the catheter <b>404</b> to a parking location near the target tissue <b>408</b> or for use in guiding the instrument <b>406</b> from the parked catheter <b>404</b> toward target tissue. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a method <b>500</b> for using OCT imaging data to profile tissue and transmit an information signal a component of a navigation system for display or navigational control. The method <b>500</b> is illustrated as a set of operations or processes <b>502</b>-<b>510</b>. Not all of the illustrated processes <b>502</b>-<b>510</b> may be performed in all embodiments of method <b>500</b>. Additionally, one or more processes that are not expressly illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> may be included before, after, in between, or as part of the processes <b>502</b>-<b>506</b>. In some embodiments, one or more of the processes <b>502</b>-<b>510</b> are optional and may be omitted. All or only parts of the processes <b>502</b>-<b>510</b> described herein may be performed with robotic control including both teleoperated control and automatic control, or may be performed with manual control.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">At a process <b>502</b>, the instrument <b>406</b> is advanced toward a target tissue <b>408</b>. The advancement may be fully automated, teleoperationally controlled, or manually controlled. For example, the instrument <b>406</b> may advance along a route established by the navigation system. At a process <b>504</b>, OCT imaging data is received from an OCT sensor (e.g. OCT imaging component <b>412</b> which may be either on the instrument or a stylet). In one example, the OCT image data is received after the catheter <b>404</b> and instrument <b>406</b> have been navigated to a park location within the anatomic passageway <b>402</b> near the target tissue <b>408</b>. The OCT imaging data may be used to visualize tissue beyond the wall of the anatomic passageway <b>402</b> in the vicinity of the park location. Optionally, the OCT image data may be used to generate a real-time image for display to the physician on a display screen (e.g., display <b>110</b>).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">At a process <b>506</b>, the OCT imaging data is processed by the control system of the teleoperational system (e.g. the control system <b>112</b>) to profile the type of tissue in the OCT image data. The control system <b>112</b> may analyze the characteristics of the tissue in the OCT image data and match the characteristics with stored profiles of different types of tissue such as pleura tissue, cardiac tissue, vascular tissue, muscle tissue, bone tissue, and tumor tissue. Some types of profiled tissue may be characterized as sensitive tissue to be avoided by medical instruments.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">At a process <b>508</b>, the navigation system uses the profile of the imaged tissue to assist the physician with subsequent steps in the medical procedure using the instrument <b>406</b>. One or more output information signals may be generated by the control system <b>112</b> based on the profile of the imaged tissue. The output information signal may, for example, provide information about the profiled tissue, the location of the profiled tissue, and/or the position of the profiled tissue relative to other tissues. The output signal may be sent to the navigation system, the display system, the drive system, an/or other components of the teleoperational or robotic system.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">At a process <b>510</b>, if the imaged tissue includes tissue profiled as sensitive tissue <b>410</b>, a distance D between the imaging component <b>412</b> and the sensitive tissue <b>410</b> may be calculated. The location of the imaging component <b>412</b> may be kinematically known relative to the instrument <b>406</b>. Distance D may be displayed to the physician to help the physician avoid moving the instrument <b>406</b> into contact with the tissue <b>410</b>. The control system <b>112</b> may compare the distance D to a predefined safety distance and issue an auditory or visual alert when the distance D becomes smaller than the predefined safety distance, indicating that the instrument <b>406</b> has advanced too close to the sensitive tissue. In various embodiments, the navigation system of the robotic system may issue commands to suspend advancement of the robotic assembly and instrument drive systems to prevent the instrument <b>406</b> from advancing closer to the sensitive tissue than the predefined safety distance. Alternatively, suspending advancement may include sending the alert to warn an operator of a manually driven or teleoperationally driven instrument to suspend further advancement of the instrument. In various embodiments, the navigation system of the robotic system may issue commands to the robotic assembly and instrument drive systems to cause the instrument <b>406</b> to retract if it meets or exceeds the predefined safety distance, or issue an alert or notification to the user to manually or teleoperationally retract the assembly a predefined or recommended safe distance.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In various embodiments, the navigation system of the robotic system may issue commands to the robotic assembly and instrument drive systems to slow the velocity of the advancing instrument <b>406</b> as it approaches the predefined safety distance. For example, the navigation system may provide information indicating that the needle is approaching sensitive tissue such as the pleura, and the receipt of that information may trigger the OCT imaging system to begin imaging or begin analyzing images to identify the sensitive tissue in the OCT image data. This additional OCT data about the location of the sensitive tissue may be used to update registration with the anatomic model. Similarly, if analysis of the OCT image data indicates that sensitive tissue is not where it was predicted to be by the navigation system, that updated information may be used to update the registration.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Alternatively, the profile of the imaged tissue may be used to confirm the accuracy of the medical procedure. For example, if the instrument is a biopsy instrument, the profile of the OCT imaged tissue may provide feedback confirming that the target tissue has been sampled or alerting the physician that the target tissue was missed. Based on this feedback, the navigation system may provide guidance to the physician to move the catheter or instrument to access the target tissue by another approach or trajectory. Using the tissue profile information, the navigation system may suggest multiple biopsy locations in the target tissue. In another alternative, the accuracy of an ablation procedure may be confirmed by analysis of OCT image data that shows the tissue shows indications of ablation.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Although the OCT image data may be useful when the catheter is parked, as described, in alternative examples, the OCT image data may be used to improve navigation while the catheter <b>404</b> and instrument <b>406</b> are advancing within the passageway <b>402</b> toward the park location. For example, OCT image data may provide real-time images of lesions within the anatomic passages for avoidance or for performing a medical procedure.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">One or more elements in embodiments of the invention (e.g., the processing of signals received from the input controls and/or control of the flexible catheter) may be implemented in software to execute on a processor of a computer system, such as control system <b>112</b>.
