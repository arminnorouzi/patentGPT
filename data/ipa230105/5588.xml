A typical medication infusion device includes a fluid pump mechanism and an associated drive system that actuates a plunger or piston of a fluid reservoir to deliver fluid medication from the reservoir to the body of a patient via a fluid delivery conduit between the reservoir and the body of a patient. Use of infusion pump therapy has been increasing, especially for delivering insulin to diabetic patients. Configuring fluid infusion devices for operation often requires certain physical or mechanical tasks, such as, for example, filling a reservoir, rotating or replacing an infusion set or a glucose sensor, changing batteries, and/or the like. However, some users may find these procedures to be complex or burdensome (e.g., too many steps, too hard to remember, etc.), which can degrade the user experience or frustrate realization of the full benefits of infusion therapy.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Techniques disclosed herein relate generally to providing guidance for configuring a medical device to a user in response to detected gestures of the user.

In certain embodiments, the medication delivery system <b>102</b> responds to the patient's behavior as indicated by the output of a gesture-based physical behavior detection system <b>104</b> and/or the output of at least one ancillary sensor, detector, or measurement system <b>106</b> (hereinafter referred to as ancillary system(s) <b>106</b>). Certain embodiments of the system <b>100</b> include, without limitation: the medication delivery system <b>102</b> (or device) that regulates delivery of medication to a patient user; at least one gesture-based physical behavior detection system <b>104</b> that monitors user behavior and/or status to obtain gesture data that indicates user activity events or behavior; at least one ancillary system <b>106</b>; at least one user device <b>108</b> that includes or cooperates with a suitably written and configured patient care application <b>110</b>; an analyte sensor <b>112</b> to measure a physiological characteristic of the user, such that sensor data obtained from the analyte sensor <b>112</b> can be used to control, regulate, or otherwise influence the operation of the medication delivery system <b>102</b>; and at least one patient history and outcomes database <b>114</b>.

In this regard, a medical device configuration procedure generally involves a sequence or combination of one or more physical or mechanical tasks for installing, setting up, programming, operating or otherwise configuring the medical device for subsequent operation, such as, for example, changing, rotating or replacing an infusion set associated with the medical delivery system <b>102</b>; changing, replacing or refilling a reservoir of the medical delivery system <b>102</b>; priming a reservoir of the medical delivery system <b>102</b>; replacing an insulin cartridge of an infusion device, injection device, or other medical device of the medical delivery system <b>102</b>; refilling an insulin cartridge of an infusion device, injection device, or other medical device of the medical delivery system <b>102</b>; shaking or agitating an infusion device, injection device, or other medical device of the medical delivery system <b>102</b> to mix the contents of an insulin cartridge or fluid reservoir; charging, changing or replacing batteries of an infusion device, injection device, smart insulin pen cap, or other medical device of the medical delivery system <b>102</b>; injecting or otherwise delivering insulin or another fluid or medicament using an injection device or other medical device of the medical delivery system <b>102</b>; replacing needle of an infusion device, injection device, or other medical device of the medical delivery system <b>102</b>; cleaning an infusion device, injection device, or other medical device of the medical delivery system <b>102</b>; changing, rotating or replacing the analyte sensor <b>112</b>; charging, changing or replacing batteries of the analyte sensor <b>112</b>; taking glucose reference measurements via the analyte sensor <b>112</b> or another ancillary system <b>106</b> (e.g., a blood glucose fingerstick reference measurement via a blood glucose meter); turning off, disabling or otherwise addressing alarms, alerts or other user notifications generated by an infusion device, injection device, or other medical device of the medical delivery system <b>102</b>; and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Due to the number of potential different configuration procedures required to support proper operation of the system as well as the potential complexities of the configuration procedures, the exact tasks (and sequence thereof) can be difficult to remember or follow for some individuals. Accordingly, the gesture-based detection system <b>104</b> is configured to detect when a patient or other user is performing one or more procedural gestures with respect to a device or component <b>102</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>112</b> of the system <b>100</b> and thereby detect where the patient or user is within a particular medical device configuration procedure with respect to that particular device or component <b>102</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>112</b>. Based on the determination of the current state of the user within the identified configuration, the patient care application <b>110</b> may be utilized to provide appropriate guidance or training materials to support completion of the defined sequence of physical or mechanical tasks for the configuration procedure accurately and expeditiously. For example, one or more graphical user interface (GUI) displays may be provided by the patient care application <b>110</b> on the user device <b>108</b> to provide step-by-step guidance for completing the configuration procedure from the current state within the configuration procedure. Additionally, or alternatively, the patient care application <b>110</b> may provide auditory output of the step-by-step guidance to one or more speakers of user device <b>108</b>. In some examples, one or more GUIs may be displayed on a display of the gesture-based physical behavior detection system <b>104</b> (e.g., on a display of a smart watch).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">For example, when the detected gesture data identified by the gesture-based physical detection system <b>104</b> indicates the patient is attempting to replace or change the analyte sensor <b>112</b>, the patient care application <b>110</b> may automatically generate GUI displays or other user notifications to provide step-by-step guidance for replacing the analyte sensor <b>112</b>. As another example, when the detected gesture data identified by the gesture-based physical detection system <b>104</b> indicates the patient is attempting to rotate, replace or change an infusion set associated with the medical delivery system <b>102</b>, the patient care application <b>110</b> may automatically generate GUI displays or other user notifications to provide step-by-step guidance for rotating or replacing the infusion set. It should be appreciated that the subject matter is not limited to any particular type or manner of providing guidance for completing a configuration procedure, nor is the subject matter limited to any particular type of configuration procedure. In this regard, various embodiments may incorporate or otherwise support chatbot functionality or other features in connection with the guidance information to allow a patient or other user to obtain answers to frequently asked questions, interface with training materials, or otherwise receive support that improves the user experience.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, at least some of the components of the system <b>100</b> are communicatively coupled with one another to support data communication, signaling, and/or transmission of control commands as needed, via at least one communications network <b>120</b>.

The system <b>400</b> is suitable for use with the system <b>100</b> shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In certain embodiments, the system <b>400</b> is deployed as a wearable electronic device in the form factor of a bracelet or wristband that is worn around the wrist or arm of a user's dominant hand. The system <b>400</b> may optionally be implemented using a modular design, wherein individual modules include one or more subsets of the disclosed components and overall functionality. The user may choose to add specific modules based on personal preferences and requirements.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The system <b>400</b> includes a battery <b>402</b> and a power management unit (PMU) <b>404</b> to deliver power at the proper supply voltage levels to all electronic circuits and components. The PMU <b>404</b> may also include battery-recharging circuitry. The PMU <b>404</b> may also include hardware, such as switches, that allows power to specific electronics circuits and components to be cut off when not in use. <b>100631</b> When there is no movement-based or gesture-based behavior event in progress, most circuitry and components in the system <b>400</b> are switched off to conserve power. Only circuitry and components that are required to detect or help predict the start of a behavior event of interest may remain enabled. For example, if no motion is being detected, all sensor circuits but an accelerometer <b>406</b> may be switched off and the accelerometer <b>406</b> may be put in a low-power wake-on-motion mode or in another lower power mode that consumes less power and uses less processing resources than its high performance active mode. A controller <b>408</b> of the system <b>400</b> may also be placed into a low-power mode to conserve power. When motion or a certain motion pattern is detected, the accelerometer <b>406</b> and/or the controller <b>408</b> may switch into a higher power mode and additional sensors such as, for example, a gyroscope <b>410</b> and/or a proximity sensor <b>412</b> may also be enabled. When a potential start of a movement-based or gesture-based event is detected, memory variables for storing event-specific parameters, such as gesture types, gesture duration, etc. can be initialized.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In another example, upon detection of user motion, the accelerometer <b>406</b> switches into a higher power mode, but other sensors remain switched off until the data from the accelerometer <b>406</b> indicates that the start of a behavior event has likely occurred. At that point in time, additional sensors such as the gyroscope <b>410</b> and the proximity sensor <b>412</b> may be enabled.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In another example, when there is no behavior event in progress, both the accelerometer <b>406</b> and gyroscope <b>410</b> are enabled but at least one of either the accelerometer <b>406</b> or the gyroscope <b>410</b> is placed in a lower power mode compared to their regular power mode. For example, the sampling rate may be reduced to conserve power. Similarly, the circuitry required to transfer data from the system <b>400</b> to a destination device may be placed in a lower power mode. For example, radio circuitry <b>414</b> could be disabled. Similarly, the circuitry required to transfer data from the system <b>400</b> may be placed in a lower power mode. For example, the radio circuitry <b>414</b> could be disabled until a possible or likely start of a behavior event has been determined. Alternatively, it may remain enabled but in a low power state to maintain the connection between the system <b>400</b> and one or more other components of the system <b>100</b>, but without transferring user status data, sensor data, or the like.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In yet another example, all motion-detection related circuitry may be switched off if, based on certain metadata, it is determined that the occurrence of a particular behavior event, such as a food intake event, is unlikely. This may be desirable to further conserve power. Metadata used to make this determination may, among other things, include one or more of the following: time of the day, location, ambient light levels, proximity sensing, and detection that the system <b>400</b> has been removed from the wrist or hand, detection that the system <b>400</b> is being charged, or the like. Metadata may be generated and collected by the system <b>400</b>.

Power up and/or activation of additional sensors and circuitry may occur at the same time as the detection of the behavior event of interest or some time thereafter. Specific sensors and circuitry may be turned on only at specific times during a detected event, and may be switched off otherwise to conserve power. It is also possible that the camera <b>418</b> only gets powered up or activated upon explicit user intervention such as, for example, pushing and holding a button <b>420</b>. Releasing the button <b>420</b> may turn off the camera <b>418</b> to conserve power.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">When the camera <b>418</b> is powered up, a projecting light source <b>422</b> may also be enabled to provide visual feedback to the user about the area that is within view of the camera or to otherwise illuminate the field of view. Alternatively, the projecting light source <b>422</b> may only be activated sometime after the camera <b>418</b> has been activated. In certain cases, additional conditions may need to be met before the projecting light source <b>422</b> is activated. Such conditions may include: the determination that the projecting light source <b>422</b> is likely aiming in the direction of the object of interest; the determination that the system <b>400</b> is not moving excessively; or the like. In some embodiments, one or more light emitting diodes (LEDs) <b>426</b> may be used as the projecting light source <b>422</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">I Images may be tagged with additional information or metadata such as: camera focal information; proximity information from the proximity sensor <b>412</b>; ambient light levels information from an ambient light sensor <b>424</b>; timestamp information; etc. Such additional information or metadata may be used during the processing and analysis of the user status data.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The projecting light source <b>422</b> may also be used to communicate other information. As an example, an ancillary device may use inputs from one or more proximity sensors <b>412</b>, process those inputs to determine if the camera <b>418</b> is within the proper distance range from the object of interest, and use one or more light sources to communicate that the camera is within the proper distance range, that the user needs to increase the distance between camera and the object of interest, or that the user needs to reduce the distance between the camera and the object of interest.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The projecting light source <b>422</b> may also be used in combination with the ambient light sensor <b>424</b> to communicate to the user if the ambient light is insufficient or too strong for an adequate quality image capture. The projecting light source <b>422</b> may also be used to communicate information including, but not limited to, a low battery situation or a functional defect.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The projecting light source <b>422</b> may also be used to communicate dietary coaching information. As an example, the projecting light source <b>422</b> might, among other things, indicate if not enough or too much time has expired since a previous food intake event, or may communicate to the user how he/she is doing against specific dietary goals.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Signaling mechanisms to convey specific messages using one or more projecting light sources <b>422</b> may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: specific light intensities or light intensity patterns; specific light colors or light color patterns; specific spatial or temporal light patterns.

The system <b>400</b> obtains user status data from one or more of its sensors, detectors, and sources, wherein the user status data indicates a stressful activity of the user. The user status data can be analyzed and processed by the system <b>400</b> (and/or by one or more other components of the system <b>100</b>) to determine whether the user's current behavior is consistent with normally expected behavior or activity. In certain embodiments, the system <b>400</b> and/or an ancillary system <b>106</b> or device determines the user's activity and related behavior primarily based on the output of user-worn motion sensors, movement sensors, one or more inertial sensors (e.g., one or more accelerometers and/or one or more gyroscopes), one or more GPS sensors, one or more magnetometers, one or more force or physical pressure sensors, or the like, which are suitably configured, positioned, and arranged to measure physical movement or motion of the user's limbs, digits, joints, facial features, head, and/or other body parts.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some embodiments, the system <b>400</b> includes at least one haptic interface <b>440</b> that is suitably configured and operated to provide haptic feedback as an output.

To this end, sensor data may be sent in raw format. Alternatively, a source of sensor data may perform some processing (e.g., filtering, compression, or formatting) on raw sensor data before sending the processed sensor data to the gesture recognizer unit. The gesture recognizer unit analyzes the incoming sensor data and converts the incoming sensor data into a stream of corresponding gestures, which may be predetermined or otherwise classified or categorized. The gesture recognizer unit may use one or more ancillary inputs (such as the output from one or more ancillary systems <b>106</b>) to aid in the gesture determination process. Nonlimiting examples of an ancillary input include: time of day; the probability of a specific gesture occurring based on statistical analysis of historical gesture data for that user; geographical location; heart rate; other physiological sensor inputs.

For example, as described in United States Patent Publication Number 2020/0289373, the gesture recognition unit <b>904</b> may utilize machine learning or other artificial techniques to map different subsets of sensor data within a stream of received sensor data to different gesture features, which, in turn, are then analyzed to classify or otherwise resolve the different subsets of the sensor data and corresponding gesture features into a particular combination or sequence of gestures performed by the patient. In one or more embodiments, the gesture recognition unit <b>904</b> fuses or otherwise combines concurrent or otherwise temporally-associated accelerometer data and gyroscope data to obtain an orientation vector, with the concurrent or temporally-associated combinations of accelerometer data, gyroscope data, and fused orientation vectors being input to a feature generator, which, in turn, generates a corresponding stream of gesture features, which, in turn are input to the gesture recognition model which classifies or otherwise resolves the stream of gesture features into corresponding gestures. In exemplary embodiments, the gesture recognition unit <b>904</b> also associates or otherwise assigns a confidence metric to each gesture based on the gesture features. In this regard, for a given stream of sensor data received by the gesture recognition unit <b>904</b>, the gesture recognition unit <b>904</b> outputs a corresponding stream of gestures and associated confidence levels.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In some embodiments, the gesture recognition unit <b>904</b> receives one or more ancillary inputs <b>905</b> which may influence the gesture detection or the confidence or probability assigned to detected gestures. For example, the ancillary input <b>905</b> may include operational contextual data, such as, the current time of day, the current day of the week, the current month of the year, the current location of the patient, and/or the like, along with other patient-specific data such as historical gesture data associated with the patient, a patient profile associated with the patient or other patient-specific personalization that may be utilized by the gesture recognition unit <b>904</b> to influence manner in which particular gesture features are mapped to a gesture for the particular patient. In this regard, statistical analysis of the historical gesture data and potentially other patient-specific data may be utilized to determine or otherwise assign probabilities of a specific gesture occurring based on the current operational context. It should be noted that there are any number of different types of ancillary input data (e.g., from at least one ancillary system <b>106</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) that may be correlative to the occurrence or non-occurrence of a particular gesture, and the subject matter described herein is not limited to any particular type or combination of ancillary inputs <b>905</b> that may be utilized by the gesture recognition unit <b>904</b>. <b>10086</b>j In one or more embodiments, the executable code or programming instructions corresponding to the gesture recognition unit <b>904</b> is stored or otherwise maintained in a data storage element or memory, including any sort of random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), flash memory, registers, hard disks, removable disks, magnetic or optical mass storage, or any other short or long term storage media or other non-transitory computer-readable medium, which is capable of storing programming instructions for execution by a processor or other processing system. For example, in one or more exemplary embodiments, the computer-executable programming instructions corresponding to the gesture recognition unit <b>904</b> are stored in a data storage element (e.g., memory <b>416</b>) of a wearable electronic device including the sensor unit(s) <b>902</b>, and, when read and executed by a processing system (e.g., controller <b>408</b>) of the wearable electronic device, the instructions cause the wearable electronic device to generate the gesture recognition unit <b>904</b> at the wearable electronic device. In this regard, in some embodiments, the wearable electronic device may transmit or otherwise provide signals or data indicating a stream of detected gestures and associated confidence levels to another device for further processing and/or analysis. That said, in other embodiments, the gesture recognition unit <b>904</b> may be implemented at or on a patient's mobile phone or other portable electronic device (e.g., user device <b>108</b>) that receives sensor data signals from the sensor unit(s) <b>902</b> via a wireless network, or be implemented at or on a cloud computing system or remote server that receives the sensor data signals from the sensor unit(s) <b>902</b> via the Internet, a cellular network, or the like.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the event detection unit <b>906</b> generally represents a software application or component of the patient management system <b>900</b> that receives the detected gestures and confidence levels from the from the gesture recognition unit <b>904</b> and analyzes the received gesture data to detect or otherwise identify events or activities performed by the patient based on the received gesture data. For example, as described in United States Patent Publication Number 2020/0289373, the event detection unit <b>906</b> may utilize machine learning or other artificial techniques to map a stream of detected gestures and associated confidence levels into a particular event or activity being performed by the patient based on the type of gestures detected, the sequence of detected gestures, the temporal relationship between gestures and/or the confidence metrics assigned to the detected gestures. In this manner, the event detection unit <b>906</b> may map lower-level gestures into a higher-level physical behavior while filtering or otherwise deemphasizing false positives or spurious gestures. Thus, for a given stream of detected gestures received by the event detection unit <b>906</b>, the event detection unit <b>906</b> outputs an indication of a detected event or activity by the patient and an associated confidence or probability metric for the event. For example, for a sequence of detected food intake gestures may be mapped or otherwise recognized as a food intake event having a particular start time, pace, duration, and/or the like with an assigned level of confidence or probability influenced by the confidence associated with the detected food intake gestures and potentially other factors.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In a similar manner as described above for the gesture recognition unit <b>904</b>, the event detection unit <b>906</b> may receive ancillary input <b>907</b> which may influence the event detection or the confidence or probability assigned to detected events.

In this regard, if the patient habitually engages in meals at or around a certain time of day, food intake gestures occurring at that time of day consistent with the patient's historical behavior may be more likely to be mapped to a meal event or other food intake event, or the detected meal event or food intake event may be assigned a higher probability or confidence value based on the correlation and consistency with the patient's historical behavior. Again, it should be noted that there are any number of different types of ancillary input data that may be correlative to the occurrence or non-occurrence of a particular event, and the subject matter described herein is not limited to any particular type or combination of ancillary inputs <b>907</b> that may be utilized by the event detection unit <b>906</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In one or more embodiments, the executable code or programming instructions corresponding to the event detection unit <b>906</b> is stored or otherwise maintained in a data storage element or memory, including any sort of short or long term storage media or other non-transitory computer-readable medium, which is capable of storing programming instructions for execution by a processor or other processing system. For example, in one or more exemplary embodiments, the computer-executable programming instructions corresponding to the event detection unit <b>906</b> are stored in a data storage element (e.g., memory <b>416</b>) of a wearable electronic device including the sensor unit(s) <b>902</b>, and, when read and executed by a processing system (e.g., controller <b>408</b>) of the wearable electronic device, the instructions cause the wearable electronic device to generate the event detection unit <b>906</b> at the wearable electronic device.

In some embodiments, the patient management unit <b>908</b> is configurable to support one or more autonomous operating modes for an infusion device, a smart pen, or other fluid delivery device, where the patient management unit <b>908</b> calculates or otherwise determines dosage commands for operating an actuation arrangement to deliver fluid to the patient. For example, in a closed-loop operating mode, the patient management unit <b>908</b> may determine a dosage command based at least in part on a current glucose measurement value for the patient in a manner that is influenced by an event detected by the event detection unit <b>906</b>. In some embodiments, the patient management unit <b>908</b> is configurable to generate or otherwise provide user notifications or alerts via a user interface element based at least in part on a detected event. In this regard, the patient management unit <b>908</b> may utilize patient-specific settings, preferences, or other notification criteria to automatically generate user notifications in a manner that is influenced by the detected event and potentially other factors (e.g., the patient's current or recent sensor glucose measurement values).

For example, the event detection unit <b>906</b> and the patient management unit <b>908</b> may be implemented by the patient care application <b>110</b> at the user device <b>108</b> receiving the detected gesture data stream signals output by the gesture detection system <b>104</b> from the gesture detection system <b>104</b> via a wireless network.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> depicts an exemplary procedural gesture guidance process <b>1000</b> suitable for implementation by a patient management system (e.g., patient management system <b>900</b>) to provide guidance with respect to medical device configuration procedures involving one or more physical or mechanical tasks for installing, setting up, programming, operating or otherwise configuring the medical device for operation in a manner that is influenced by a detected gesture data stream substantially in real-time. In this regard, a configuration procedure may be defined by a sequence of physical or mechanical tasks that a patient or other user may need to perform as part of the configuration procedure relating to medical device operation, such as, for example, changing, rotating or replacing sensors or infusion sets, changing, replacing or refilling reservoirs, charging, changing or replacing batteries, taking blood glucose fingerstick reference measurements, delivering or injecting insulin (e.g., using an injection pen), and/or the like. Because the exact tasks (and sequence thereof) can be difficult to remember or follow for some individuals, the procedural gesture guidance process <b>1000</b> is capable of detecting where an individual is within a medical device configuration procedure and provide appropriate guidance or training materials to support completion of the procedure accurately and expeditiously. For example, one or more graphical user interface (GUI) displays may be provided on a patient's mobile device (e.g., by a patient care application <b>110</b> at a user device <b>108</b>) to provide step-by-step guidance for completing the configuration procedure.

In this regard, when the patient's gesture data indicates the patient is attempting to change a sensor, infusion set, pump reservoir, or the like, a patient care application <b>110</b> or patient management unit <b>908</b> may automatically generate GUI displays or other user notifications that facilitate the patient efficiently and expeditiously completing the relevant medical device configuration procedure while avoiding mistakes.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The various tasks performed in connection with the procedural gesture guidance process <b>1000</b> may be performed by hardware, firmware, software executed by processing circuitry, or any combination thereof. For illustrative purposes, the following description refers to elements mentioned above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>9</b></figref>. It should be appreciated that the procedural gesture guidance process <b>1000</b> may include any number of additional or alternative tasks, the tasks need not be performed in the illustrated order and/or the tasks may be performed concurrently, and/or the procedural gesture guidance process <b>1000</b> may be incorporated into a more comprehensive procedure or process having additional functionality not described in detail herein. Moreover, one or more of the tasks shown and described in the context of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> could be omitted from a practical embodiment of the procedural gesture guidance process <b>1000</b> as long as the intended overall functionality remains intact.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The procedural gesture guidance process <b>1000</b> initializes or otherwise begins by identifying, recognizing, or otherwise detecting gestures with respect to a patient's medical device (task <b>1002</b>). For example, as described above, the gesture recognition unit <b>904</b> may be trained to classify, resolve, or otherwise map different subsets of sensor data within a stream of sensor data received from the sensor unit <b>902</b> to a particular gesture (or combination or sequence thereof) using machine learning. In this regard, based on the sensor data stream from the sensor unit <b>902</b>, the gesture recognition unit <b>904</b> may detect a user performing a particular type of gesture with respect to a sensor, infusion set, infusion device, reservoir, or other medical device or component for configuring, setting up, installing, replacing, or otherwise performing a procedure with respect to that medical device or component. The gesture recognition unit <b>904</b> transmits, outputs, or otherwise provides indicia of the detected procedural medical device gestures to the event detection unit <b>906</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In exemplary embodiments, the procedural gesture guidance process <b>1000</b> records, stores or otherwise maintains indicia of the detected procedural medical device gestures in association with timestamps or other temporal information associated with the underlying subsets of sensor data corresponding to the procedural gestures (task <b>1004</b>). In this regard, the start time, the end time, the duration, and other temporal characteristics or attributes associated with a particular gesture with respect to a medical device may be stored or otherwise maintained by the event detection unit <b>906</b>, the patient management unit <b>908</b> and/or another element of a patient management system <b>900</b> (e.g., in memory <b>204</b>).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In some embodiments, the temporal information associated with detected procedural medical device gestures may be transmitted or otherwise uploaded to a database <b>114</b> for a population-level retrospective analysis by a remote server or other cloud computing system (e.g., data processing system <b>116</b>). In this regard, temporal information associated with procedural medical device gestures across different patients or users may be utilized to calculate or otherwise determine one or more metrics for scoring or otherwise characterizing procedural medical device gestures. For example, the temporal data associated with procedural gestures may be analyzed to determine the average or estimated amount of time required to perform a particular procedural medical device gesture and score or rate the relative difficulty of the procedural gesture based on the average time required.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The recorded procedural medical device gesture data may also be utilized to identify the rate or frequency at which a particular gesture is required to be repeated or performed erroneously, which may also be utilized to score or rate the relative difficulty of the procedural gesture, independently or in concert with the amount of time required for the gesture. In this regard, qualitative or quantitative difficulty or complexity scores may be assigned to different procedural gestures, which, in turn, may be utilized to influence the guidance provided for those gestures, as described in greater detail below.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">It should be noted that the different procedural gestures may also be scored for difficulty or complexity on a patient-specific basis, for example, based on the patient's procedural gesture data relative to the population procedural gesture data. For example, if a particular patient typically completes a particular task in less time than the average amount of time for that task across the entire population of patients or users, the qualitative or quantitative difficulty or complexity scores assigned to that gesture or task for that patient may be less than what would be assigned for other patients or users that require an above average amount of time.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The procedural gesture guidance process <b>1000</b> identifies or otherwise determines the configuration procedure the patient or other user is attempting to perform with respect to the medical device and the current state of the patient or user within that medical device procedure based on the detected gestures (tasks <b>1006</b>, <b>1008</b>). In a similar manner as described above, the event detection unit <b>906</b> may be trained to classify, resolve, or otherwise map a combination or sequence of gestures with respect to one or more medical devices within the detected gesture data stream provided by the gesture recognition unit <b>904</b> to a particular configuration procedure being performed with respect to a patient's medical device. For example, machine learning or other artificial techniques may be utilized to develop one or more models capable of mapping a sequence of detected procedural medical device gestures into a particular medical device configuration procedure being performed by the patient based on the type of procedural medical device gestures detected, the sequence of detected procedural gestures, the temporal relationship between procedural gestures and/or the confidence metrics assigned to the detected procedural gestures. In this manner, the event detection unit <b>906</b> may map lower-level procedural medical device gestures into a higher-level medical device configuration procedure being performed.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">For example, each defined physical or mechanical task that a patient or other user may need to perform as part of a defined sequence for a configuration procedure relating to medical device operation may entail one or more distinct gestures with respect to the medical device that correspond to that particular physical or mechanical task within the defined configuration procedure sequence of tasks. Thus, when a stream of detected gestures received by the event detection unit <b>906</b> matches or otherwise corresponds to a combination or sequence of procedural gestures that correspond to the defined sequence of tasks of a particular medical device configuration procedure, the event detection unit <b>906</b> transmits, outputs or otherwise provides an indication of a detected medical device configuration procedure being performed by the patient. Additionally, based on the most recently detected medical gesture with respect to the combination or sequence of gestures associated with the detected medical device procedure, the event detection unit <b>906</b> may also transmit, output or otherwise provide an indicia of the current state within the medical device configuration procedure in concert with identification of the medical device procedure being performed. In this regard, based on the preceding combination or sequence of procedural gestures detected by the gesture recognition unit <b>904</b>, the event detection unit <b>906</b> may identify the tasks of the configuration procedure sequence that have already been performed by the patient and identify the next sequential task following the most recently completed task in the sequence as the current task awaiting performance by the patient.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Based on the current state within the detected medical device configuration procedure being performed, the procedural gesture guidance process <b>1000</b> determines or otherwise identifies guidance pertaining to the detected medical device configuration procedure for presentation and generates or otherwise provides a user notification including the determined guidance (tasks <b>1010</b>, <b>1012</b>). In this manner, in response to the event detection unit <b>906</b> detecting a medical device configuration procedure being performed by a patient and identifying the current patient state within that configuration procedure, the patient management unit <b>908</b> may automatically generate a GUI display at the patient's user device <b>108</b> (e.g., via patient care application <b>110</b>) that includes guidance specific to the current patient state within the medical device configuration procedure substantially in real-time without requiring any interaction by the patient with respect to the user device <b>108</b> and/or patient care application <b>110</b>. For example, the guidance may include text, verbal, graphics, images, videos, or any sort of audiovisual content that facilitates completion of the medical device configuration procedure (e.g., by providing indication of the next mechanical or physical task to be performed in the medical device configuration procedure sequence) or enhances execution of the medical device configuration procedure (e.g., by providing indication of optional tasks for advanced features or functionality). In this regard, in various embodiments, the guidance may be personalized based on the patient's gesture data or other historical data associated with the patient. For example, based on the temporal characteristics associated with the patient's procedural medical device gestures or the temporal relationships between successive procedural gestures within the medical device configuration procedure, the patient management unit <b>908</b> may calculate or otherwise determine values for one or more experiential metrics that rate, score, or otherwise assess the patient's relative level of skill with respect to the medical device configuration procedure (or a particular task thereof) and provide guidance influenced by the patient's score or skill level. Additionally, or alternatively, based on the patient's historical data, the patient management unit <b>908</b> may rate, score, or otherwise assess the patient's relative level of experience with respect to use of the medical device and provide guidance influenced by the patient's experience level.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In one or more embodiments, the guidance content is influenced by any qualitative or quantitative difficulty or complexity scores assigned to the current patient state within the medical device configuration procedure. For example, if the next mechanical or physical task to be performed in the medical device configuration procedure sequence has a relatively higher rate or frequency of error or repetition and/or a relatively higher average amount of time required associated therewith, the guidance may include a video (or a hypertext link to a video) that includes a more detailed illustration or explanation for how to perform the task, while an image or textual explanation may be provided for a task with a relatively lower rate or frequency of error or repetition and/or a relatively lower average amount of time required associated therewith.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In one or more exemplary embodiments, the tasks <b>1008</b>, <b>1010</b>, and <b>1012</b> may repeat throughout the duration of time the medical device configuration procedure is being performed to dynamically update the guidance substantially in real-time to reflect the current state within the configuration procedure as the patient or user advances through the medical device configuration procedure. For example, when the detected gesture data stream output by the gesture recognition unit <b>904</b> indicates the patient has performed a physical or mechanical task corresponding to the previously displayed guidance at the patient care application <b>110</b> on the user device <b>108</b>, the event detection unit <b>906</b> dynamically updates the indication of the current patient state within the medical device configuration procedure and the patient management unit <b>908</b> dynamically updates the GUI display presented by the patient care application <b>110</b> on the user device <b>108</b> substantially in real-time to reflect completion of that task and include guidance pertaining to the next physical or mechanical task to be performed by the patient within the medical device configuration procedure. Thus, the patient or other user can receive step-by-step guidance or feedback via the patient care application <b>110</b> on the user device <b>108</b> while performing a maintenance, setup, installation, or other configuration procedure with respect to a medical device (e.g., a medication delivery system <b>102</b>, an analyte sensor <b>112</b>, an ancillary system <b>106</b>, or the like) without requiring the patient to divert his or her hands from the medical device to interact with the user device <b>108</b> to update the guidance.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">For example, in response to output from the sensor unit <b>902</b> indicative of gestures being performed with respect to a patient's medical device, the gesture recognition unit <b>904</b> and the event detection unit <b>906</b> may be cooperatively configured to detect the particular configuration procedure that the patient is performing (or attempting to perform) with respect to the medical device, and based on the particular combination and sequence of detected gestures that the patient has already performed with respect to the patient's medical device, determine the patient's current state within the defined sequence of tasks for the configuration procedure. The patient's current state within the defined sequence of tasks for the configuration procedure may be utilized by the patient management unit <b>908</b> to identify or otherwise determine current task or step of the configuration procedure that the patient's is currently attempting to perform following any tasks already completed by the patient, and then determine and present guidance content for performing the current task. In this regard, the amount or other characteristics of the guidance content may be influenced by the value for one or more difficulty metrics associated with the current task and/or the value for one or more experiential metrics associated with the patient. For example, when the value for a difficulty metric associated with the current task is above a threshold value and/or the value for an experiential metric associated with the patient is below a threshold value, the patient management unit <b>908</b> may determine that a greater amount of guidance content should be presented, that more detailed guidance content should be presented and/or that richer or more engaging guidance content should be prevented to better assist the patient with the current task. Conversely, when the difficulty metric is below a threshold value and/or the value for an experiential metric associated with the patient is above a threshold value, the patient management unit <b>908</b> may determine that a lesser amount of more simplified guidance content should be presented since the patient is likely to require less assistance with the current task. Moreover, in some scenarios, the patient management unit <b>908</b> may determine the guidance content should pertain to an advanced or optional feature associated with the current task or the configuration procedure to facilitate better utilization of the medical device features or functionality when the patient is unlikely to require assistance.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Thereafter, in response to subsequent output from the sensor unit <b>902</b> indicative of gestures corresponding to performance of the current task of the configuration procedure, the gesture recognition unit <b>904</b> and/or the event detection unit <b>906</b> may be cooperatively configured to detect the performance of the task and provide a corresponding indicia to the patient management unit <b>908</b>, which, in turn, dynamically updates the presented guidance information to reflect the completion of the task of the configuration procedure the patient was previously on. In this regard, the patient management unit <b>908</b> may identify or otherwise determine subsequent task or step of the configuration procedure that followed the recently completed task is now the current task, and then similarly determine and present guidance content for performing that task based on the difficulty metric(s) associated with the task and/or the experiential metric(s) associated with the patient for that task. Thus, the amount, detail, and other characteristics of the presented guidance content may dynamically vary throughout performance of the configuration procedure as the patient progresses between more difficult and less difficult tasks.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">It should be appreciated the procedural gesture guidance process <b>1000</b> may be utilized to provide improved training and adherence to proper medical device operation or configuration, and improve familiarity with different device features, actions or capabilities that could otherwise be underutilized. In this regard, the procedural gesture guidance process <b>1000</b> may provide an improved onboarding experience with step-by-step guidance that may be tailored to individual users or individual mechanical or physical tasks within a procedure based on the relative complexity or difficulty associated with those tasks. For example, children or adolescents may utilize different gesture movements associated with handling system components while also having differing levels of comprehending how to execute different tasks. Accordingly, the gesture recognition unit <b>904</b> and/or the event detection unit <b>906</b> may be trained using data sets derived from particular age groups or other classifications of patients or users, thereby allowing the gesture recognition unit <b>904</b> and/or the event detection unit <b>906</b> to better identify procedural gestures and corresponding medical procedures being performed for similar patients or users belonging to those age groups. The age-stratified data sets may also be utilized to relative complexity or difficulty associated with different tasks across a particular age group, which may be utilized to better tailor guidance for patients or users belonging to that age group. For example, training videos or other guidance can be made more effective by focusing on the more difficult tasks in greater detail, while training or guidance may be simplified for less difficult tasks to reduce the amount of time or attention required and improve the user experience. Improving a patient's user experience and ability to understand and execute medical device procedures may also improve adherence to those procedures (e.g., by replacing or changing sensors or infusion sets at a recommended replacement interval).</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">An individual's procedural medical device gesture data may also be utilized to score or otherwise assess an individual's skill, experience, or familiarity with respect to particular features, functionality, or device capabilities, which, in turn, may be utilized to push additional training materials or guidance to a particular individual, provide remote training for that particular individual, or otherwise improve troubleshooting or managing complaints by that particular individual. For example, a patient's historical procedural medical device gesture data may be analyzed to determine one or more experiential metrics that score or grade how the patient changes an insulin cartridge (e.g., how effectively or efficiently the patient performs connecting, rewinding and/or priming of the cartridge based on time required, repetition frequency, etc.), how the patient inserts an interstitial glucose sensor (e.g., based on the patient's insertion angle data derived from the gesture data, the time required and/or repetition frequency for pressing and/or taping the sensor, etc.), how the patient operates a medical device (e.g., based on the amount of time required to mute alerts, request or administer a bolus, make changes to device settings, etc.), and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">After determining a personalized score for performing the configuration procedure (or a task thereof) based on the patient's historical procedural gesture data, the patient management unit <b>908</b> generates or otherwise provides guidance information in a manner that is influenced by the patient's personalized score. For example, when the patient's personalized score for the configuration procedure (or the current task thereof) is greater than a threshold value indicating a more experienced or advanced user, the patient management unit <b>908</b> may determine, generate, select or otherwise obtain guidance content for an advanced feature associated with the configuration procedure (or the current task thereof). Conversely, when the patient's personalized score for the configuration procedure (or the current task thereof) is less than a threshold value indicating a less experienced or beginner user, the patient management unit <b>908</b> may determine, generate, select or otherwise obtain more detailed guidance content to assist completion of the current task.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In addition to providing real-time guidance tailored to an individual patient's skill, experience and/or familiarity, the scoring or other characterization of a patient's historical procedural medical device gesture data may be utilized to provide additional supplemental guidance to patients in a patient-specific manner. For example, a remote server or other cloud-based processing system <b>114</b> may be configured to periodically analyze a patient's historical procedural medical device gesture data in the database <b>116</b> and automatically push or otherwise provide guidance to the patient's user device <b>108</b> and/or the patient care application <b>110</b> regarding specific device features that the patient may be experiencing difficulty with or underutilizing, such as, for example, sending an e-mail or other electronic message with information pertaining to best practices for specific device features, replaying or repeating certain information about device features in the patient care application <b>110</b>, prompting or automatically scheduling a call or other meeting with support personnel to discuss specific device features, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The patient's historical procedural medical device gesture data may also be used in the context of insertion site usage monitoring and related insertion site rotation guidance or other insertion site notifications. For example, the gesture recognition unit <b>904</b> and the event detection unit <b>906</b> may be trained or otherwise cooperatively configured to detect insertion events or site change events based on the patient's gestures with respect to a medical device. In response to the event detection unit <b>906</b> detecting an insertion site event, the patient management unit <b>908</b> may automatically generate guidance pertaining to the insertion site event, such as, for example, outputting instructions or training material pertaining to the detected insertion site event or providing reminders to reorder supplies (and/or automatically directing the patient care application <b>110</b> to a website for reordering supplies). The patient management unit <b>908</b> may also utilize the detected insertion site event gesture data to automatically update or adjust reminders for future insertion site changes. The detected insertion site event gesture data may also be analyzed to collect statistics pertaining to the patient's insertion site usage or otherwise derive metrics for the patient's insertion site usage, which, in turn, may be utilized to automatically and dynamically generate insertion site recommendations in a patient-specific manner to achieve better insertion site utilization. Some examples of insertion site algorithms or applications that may utilize the detected insertion site event gesture data as a potential input are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 10,201,657, and 10,272,201 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 17/086,147.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Detection of procedural medical device gestures and related events may also be utilized to facilitate automatic logging of patient behavior, thereby reducing patient burdens and improving user experience. For example, patients on a manual therapy regimen may generally be required to manually log injection events, sensor changes, and the like. In this regard, automatically recording or logging the procedural medical device gesture events in concert with other gestured events (e.g., meal events or other food intake events, exercise events, and/or the like) provides an improved record of the patient's behavior that facilitates a patient's healthcare provider analyzing the patient's behavior and optimizing the patient's therapy in a patient-specific manner. For example, in response to the event detection unit <b>906</b> detecting an injection event (e.g., based on the procedural medical device gestures of filling a syringe and manipulating an injection pen), the patient management unit <b>908</b> may automatically generate a GUI display within the patient care application <b>110</b> at the patient's user device <b>108</b> substantially in real-time that prompts the patient to input the amount of insulin being injected for recordation or logging in association with the gestured injection event (e.g., by uploading the amount of insulin and the time associated with the injection event to a remote processing system <b>116</b> for analysis and/or storage in a remote database <b>114</b>). Accordingly, a more accurate diary or log of insulin doses may be obtained, which, in turn improves health care provider decisions on therapy recommendations. Additionally, or alternatively, the log of insulin doses may also be analyzed by an automatic therapy advisor algorithm (e.g., at a cloud-based processing system <b>116</b>) in concert with the patient's glucose measurement data (e.g., obtained via analyte sensor <b>106</b>) to automatically determine optimal therapy guidance that may be transmitted or otherwise provided to the user device <b>108</b> and generated or otherwise displayed by the patient care application <b>110</b> in response to an injection event.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>12</b></figref>, the procedural gesture guidance process <b>1000</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> may be configured to provide a configuration procedure GUI display <b>1200</b> on a display of an electronic device associated with a patient, such as an infusion device <b>1202</b>, in response to detecting a procedural gesture <b>1100</b> corresponding to the patient detaching or otherwise removing an infusion set <b>1102</b> from the patient's body. In response to detecting the gesture <b>1100</b> based on movement of the patient's hand or wrist, the procedural gesture guidance process <b>1000</b> determines the patient is attempting to replace a reservoir of the infusion device <b>1202</b>. Based on the patient's current state within the reservoir replacement configuration procedure, the procedural gesture guidance process <b>1000</b> generates or otherwise provides the configuration procedure GUI display <b>1200</b> that includes graphical indicia <b>1204</b> of the next task of the reservoir replacement configuration procedure to be performed by the patient, thereby reminding or otherwise informing the patient of what the patient needs to do next to effectuate the reservoir replacement. In some embodiments, the graphical indicia <b>1204</b> may be realized as a hyperlink or other selectable GUI element which the patient may select or otherwise activate to cause the procedural gesture guidance process <b>1000</b> to generate or otherwise provide more detail explanatory text for how to perform the next task or a video or other illustration or imagery of how to perform the next task (e.g., a video of a reservoir cap or fitting being unscrewed from the infusion device). In this manner, the procedural gesture guidance process <b>1000</b> facilitates successful and expeditious performance of the detected configuration procedure by providing guidance information relative to the tasks yet to be performed by the patient.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">While at least one exemplary embodiment has been presented in the foregoing detailed description, it should be appreciated that a vast number of variations exist.
