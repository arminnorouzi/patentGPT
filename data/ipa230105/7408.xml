The hearing device comprises electronic components including a first electronic component. The plurality of antennas comprises a first antenna and a second antenna. The first antenna may comprise a coil part coiled along a first antenna axis. The first antenna may be configured for magnetic induction communication. Magnetic induction communication provides communication in a range of frequencies between 3 MHz and 30 MHz. The first antenna provides the electro-magnetic radiation that propagates through and around the human head and body of the user without significant losses in the tissue. The first antenna configured for magnetic induction communication operating in the range of frequencies can be susceptible to electro-magnetic interference, such as noise, originating from the electric components.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The second antenna may be configured for communication in a frequency band in the GHz range. The second antenna may comprise a shielding part configured to shield the first antenna. The second antenna may be configured for communication in a frequency band in the GHz range, such as in the 5 GHz range, such as in the 2.4 GHz range, such as in the 2.1 GHz range. The second antenna may be configured for communication in the frequency band corresponding to the communication system used by the hearing device. In other words, the second antenna may be configured for communication in different frequency bands depending on the communication system used. The second antenna may be seen as a shielding antenna, e.g. configured to shield the first antenna.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one or more example hearing devices, the shielding part is configured to shield the first antenna from electro-magnetic interference from one or more electronic components comprised in the hearing device, such as the first electronic component of the hearing device.

For example, the first electronic component can be a power management unit of the hearing device.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one or more example hearing devices, the shielding part extends along the first antenna axis.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one or more example hearing devices, the shielding part extends along a shielding axis. In one or more example hearing devices, an angle between the shielding axis and the first antenna axis is less than 20 degrees. For example, the shielding part has a lengthwise extension parallel to the first antenna axis+/&#x2212;20 degrees.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one or more example hearing devices, the first antenna has a first length in the direction of the first antenna axis. In one or more example hearing devices, a shielding length of the shielding part is at least 75% of the first length.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one or more example hearing devices, the shielding part is arranged at a shielding distance from the first antenna. For example, the shielding distance is less than 3 mm.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one or more example hearing devices, the shielding part is curved and/or bent around the first antenna axis. For example, the shielding part may be formed as a cylinder cut-out. For example the shielding part can be co-centric with the first axis.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one or more example hearing devices, the shielding part is flat. In one or more examples, the shielding part is in form of a comb. In one or more examples, the shielding part is in form of a half circle.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one or more example hearing devices, the shielding part has an angular extension around the first antenna axis. In one or more example hearing devices, the angular extension is at least 45 degrees, preferably at least 90 degrees. The angular extension may be seen as a width of the shielding part.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one or more example hearing devices, the shielding part extends from a first end to a second end along the shielding axis. In one or more example hearing devices, the shielding axis is configured to form an angle less than 30 degrees with an ear-to-ear axis of the user, e.g. when the hearing device is arranged in or at the ear of the user. For example, the first antenna axis forms an angle less than 30 degrees with an ear-to-ear axis of the user when the hearing device is arranged in or at the ear of the user.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one or more example hearing devices, the second antenna comprises a first part and a second part. In one or more example hearing devices, the first part and the second part may be electrically connected to each other. In one or more example hearing devices, the shielding part may be electrically connected to the second part. For example, the first part has a first normal, and the second part has a second normal. For example, the first normal and the second normal may form angle of 75 to 105 degrees. In one or more example hearing device, the first part may be planar. In one or more example hearing device, the second part may be planar. For example, the second part may form part of a top printed circuit board, PCB. For example, the second part has a cut and/or a slit.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one or more example hearing devices, the second part has a second primary cut extending along a cut axis. In one or more example hearing devices, the cut axis may form an angle with the first antenna axis in the range from 75 degrees to 105 degrees.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one or more example hearing devices, the second antenna has a first intermediate cut between the first part and the second part. For example, the second antenna may have the first cut intermediate forming connections parts between the first part and the second part.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one or more example hearing devices, the second antenna comprises a printed circuit board, PCB, with one or more inner surfaces. The PCB may be a foldable PCB, such as a flexible PCB. For example, the second antenna may comprise a folded PCB. For example, one or more ground layers of the printed circuit board may be arranged between the first part and the second part so that resonance defining the second antenna is provided. The first part of the second antenna may be seen as a ground plane. The second part may be seen as the main radiator. In one or more examples, signals (such as all the signals) from the first part to the second part may be decoupled to avoid any dead resonance, such as resonance that is not needed and/or that is seen as interference. For example, the PCB may be coated by copper wherein a cut on the ground plane forms the second antenna on the PCB surface. The second antenna may be an inverted L-shape antenna and/or a C-shape antenna, for example depending on an architecture of an antenna assembly.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one or more example hearing devices, the first electronic component is mounted on an inner surface of the printed circuit board. For example, the first electronic component may be a power management unit.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one or more example hearing devices, one or more electronic components are mounted on the first part of second antenna (e.g. serving as ground plane). For example, the one or more electronic components mounted on the first part of second antenna comprises one or more of: a transducer, a signal processor (such as a signal processor configured to process an input signal and providing an output signal, such as an output sound signal), a transmission and/or reception circuit for transmission and/or reception of electro-magnetic energy for the first antenna and the second antenna.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one or more example hearing devices, the second electronic component is mounted on an inner surface of the printed circuit board. For example, when the second electronic component is a receiver, the second electronic component is mounted in an ear canal part of the hearing device (such as in a shell and/or a shell frame, and/or in an ear canal part of a housing of the hearing device). For example, the receiver is coupled (e.g. soldered) to the first part of the second antenna, e.g. via wires.
