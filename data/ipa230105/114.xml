By spraying with certain binders, the storage stability of the particulate product is significantly improved, and the flavorant(s) and/or odorant(s) is/are protected, in particular, from oxidation. The present invention also relates to particulate products containing one or more flavorant(s) and/or odorant(s), preferably prepared by a process according to the invention, and to the use of certain substances for improving the storage stability of particulate products containing one or more flavorant(s) and/or odorant(s).</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The production of particles with active ingredients is of great importance for applications in the food and beverage sector as well as in the pharmaceutical industry. For example, instant products are usually in the form of dry powder, and aroma particles are used in tea bags or seasoning mixtures. But a particulate form can also be advantageous for active ingredient processing in pharmaceuticals. Depending on the application, it is usually necessary to provide particles of a certain size that form a flowable powder that does not clump together even during prolonged storage and also does not have a tendency to abrasion and dust formation. In addition, the active ingredients should be incorporated into the particles in such a way that they do not decompose and are not released before the end application.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">EP0705062B1 relates to a process for producing agglomerated powder of a dairy product, e.g. baby food, wherein a concentrated liquid is first atomized and agglomerated in a drying chamber. The agglomerated particles are then taken up into an internal fluidized bed and finally transferred to an external fluidized bed. The powder thus obtained is divided by returning one part to the drying chamber, while water is atomized over the other part to further agglomerate the product.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">GB 1167692A describes a process in which particles in a fluidized bed are sprayed with an agglomerating agent which wets the particles and thereby causes them to adhere to one another. The process can be applied in particular to foodstuffs such as sugar, flour, milk powder or starch, and water, sugar solutions or condensed milk are used as agglomerating agents, for example.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">AU2007336516B2 discloses a process for the production of agglomerates by fluidized spray drying, whereby larger particles are separated and dust that has not yet been agglomerated is returned to the drying chamber by an air stream for further agglomeration. According to AU2007336516B2, the process is advantageously used for the preparation of drugs containing poorly soluble active ingredients. For example, the active ingredient is spray-dried together with a polymer as a carrier.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Aroma substances are used in particle form in numerous foodstuffs and semi-luxury foods. In the production of such aroma particles, certain requirements usually have to be met in terms of size distribution, as well as mechanical stability of the particles and storage stability. In particular, it is desirable to achieve the highest possible loading of the particles with aroma while at the same time ensuring that the aroma is incorporated into the particles in such a way that it is not released prematurely or decomposes or volatilizes before final application. Flavorants and odorants are also often particularly sensitive to oxidation by atmospheric oxygen, which contributes to severely limited storage stability. Improvements are therefore needed in known manufacturing processes and in the selection of materials used.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">EP1064856B1 describes a process for the production of microcapsules containing active ingredients, such as flavorants, in a matrix. The process comprises several steps, wherein the active ingredients are first spray-dried in an emulsion or suspension with at least one low molecular weight carbohydrate or polyalcohol and a film-forming component, and then transferred to a fluidized bed and further dried.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">From EP3117720A1 a process is known in which powdery particles of a certain minimum size are produced. An apparatus used in the process according to EP3117720A1 is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The method comprises the steps<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0009">(i) Producing powdery particles by spray drying, in a spray drying agglomeration apparatus having a spray drying section (A) in the upper part of a chamber for drying feed liquid sprayed from a feed liquid atomizer (Z1),</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0010">(ii) spraying the powdery particles with a binder liquid, in an integrated fluidized bed (B) in the spray drying agglomeration apparatus, which is located in the lower part of a chamber in which the powder from the spray drying section of step (i) is sprayed with a binder liquid by means of nozzle or atomizer structure (Z2) attached to the bottom of the fluidized bed (B),</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0010" num="0011">whereby the particles are permanently kept in motion and swirled up during production.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0012">The process described in EP3117720A1 can be used for the production of aroma particles. In the examples of EP3117720A1, particles produced by the method were stored in a climatic chamber for a period of 144 h and the weight increase of the particles due to hygroscopicity was determined. However, EP3117720A1 does not deal with the storage stability of the aroma particles and in particular the stability of the aroma over several months.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0013">It was an object of the present invention to provide aroma particles and processes for their production, whereby the aroma particles should be suitable for use in foodstuffs and semi-luxury foods. In particular, the particles should have a suitable size, be stable against abrasion and have a low dust value as well as good flowability, i. e. not easily clump together.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0014">Furthermore, it was an object of the present invention to ensure that the aroma particles can be produced by an efficient process and have a high storage stability, preferably over several months to years. In particular, the aroma substances should not be released prematurely and should be protected from oxidation.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0015">The above objects are fulfilled by a process for the production of a particulate product containing one or more flavorant(s) and/or odorant(s), comprising:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0016">(i) Producing particles comprising or consisting of one or more flavorant(s) and/or odorant(s) and one or more carrier(s) by spray drying in a drying chamber of a spray drying apparatus,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0017">(ii) spraying the particles with one or more binder(s) selected from the group consisting of mono- or polysaccharides with reducing groups and sugar alcohols or mixtures thereof, in a fluidized bed which is integrated into the drying chamber, wherein the binder(s) is/are used in total in a concentration of 10 to 30 vol %, preferably 10 to 20 vol %, in aqueous solution,</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0015" num="0018">wherein steps (i) and (ii) take place simultaneously and the particles are permanently kept in motion and agglomerated in the drying chamber, and</p><p id="p-0016" num="0019">wherein the aqueous solution of the binder(s) does/do not contain any flavorants and/or odorants.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0020">Preferably, the process described above is a continuous process in which agglomerates that have reached a certain size are continuously removed from the drying chamber without interrupting the process.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0021">The particles are permanently kept in motion and agitated and/or circulated in the drying chamber. This ensures that smaller particles and dust are continuously wetted with binder and are then very likely to collide with other particles and agglomerate further. Individual particles coated with binder are not generated in the process due to the frequent collision of particles wetted with binder, but loose agglomerates with a porous structure are formed. Advantageously, the process according to the invention can be carried out in a spray drying chamber with an integrated fluidized bed without the need for transfer to another device. Ways of separating such particles agglomerated to the desired size, as well as effective wetting with binder and circulation of the particles are described in EP3117720A1. Preferably, the process according to the invention is carried out in a spray drying agglomeration apparatus as disclosed in EP3117720A1.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0022">In the context of the present invention, a particulate product means any product consisting of particles. In particular, a particulate product is a granule or a powder. A particulate product may also comprise or consist of agglomerated particles.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0023">In the context of the present invention, it has been found that the selection and composition of the binder plays a decisive role in stabilizing the flavorant(s) and/or odorant(s) in the agglomerated particles. When the binder is used in concentrations of 10 to 30%, preferably 10 to 20%, particularly good results are obtained. Here, the concentration of the binder determines the drying rate of the binder on the surface of the particles to be agglomerated. The choice of binder can also control how strongly the particles &#x201c;stick together&#x201d; in the process. The higher the molecular weight of the binder, the slower it dries; if it is then also used in too high a concentration, the fluidized bed can collapse because the particles stick together so quickly or strongly that the air flow present can no longer fluidize and dry them. In addition, it has been shown that the choice of binder has a major influence on the stability and storage stability of the aroma particles. By using the binders of the invention, flowable, non-cohesive, agglomerated particles with high bulk densities and low dust values can be produced. Mono- or polysaccharides and sugar alcohols are particularly suitable, and it is especially advantageous to use substances or mixtures containing reducing groups, since these effectively protect the flavorant(s) and/or odorant(s) from oxidation. This can significantly improve the storage stability of the aroma particles.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0024">The binder liquid used in step (ii) is prepared at about 10 to 30% and the feed amount is calculated on the feed amount of the spray emulsion used in step (i). For example, for every 100 liters of spray emulsion, about 10 l of binder liquid is fed, or in terms of solids: for every 50 kg of solids from the spray emulsion, about 1 kg of binder dry mass is sprayed.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0025">Monosaccharides or polysaccharides include mono-, di-, oligo- and polysaccharides. The monosaccharides and polysaccharides to be used according to the invention contain reducing groups, i. e. free aldehyde groups with reducing properties. In particular, the monosaccharides or polysaccharides with reducing groups or the mixtures thereof have a dextrose equivalent of at least 8, preferably at least 12, particularly preferably at least 18.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0026">A process as described above is preferred, in which the binder(s) is/are selected from the group consisting of sugar alcohols, in particular mannitol, mono-, di- and oligosaccharides with reducing groups, or mixtures containing or consisting of mono-, di- and/or oligosaccharides with reducing groups, in particular glucose, mannose, galactose, maltose, lactose, cellobiose and maltodextrin, and polysaccharides with reducing groups, preferably vegetable gums, in particular gum arabic, traganth, gum ghatti, agar, carrageenan, guar flour and carubin.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0027">The mono-, di- and oligosaccharides with reducing groups or the mixtures containing or consisting of mono-, di- and/or oligosaccharides with reducing groups preferably have a dextrose equivalent of at least 8, preferably at least 12, particularly preferably at least 18.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0028">In particular, a combination of vegetable gum and modified starch as a binder is also according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0029">With the preferred binders mentioned, particularly stable particles can be obtained in which the odorant(s) and/or flavorant(s) are not prematurely released or decomposed even after longer storage time. Surprisingly, it has been found that reducing groups in the binder in particular provide effective oxidation protection for the flavorant(s) or odorant(s), even though the binder was initially used only for agglomeration and does not completely cover or seal the particles.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0030">Further preferred is a process as described above in which the flavorant(s) and/or odorant(s) is/are selected from the group consisting of fruit aromas, especially citrus aromas, meat, vegetable and spice aromas, and meat, vegetable and spice extracts. Specific flavorant(s) and/or odorant(s) are described below.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0031">Citrus aromas are particularly sensitive to oxidation and are efficiently protected from oxidation by the aforementioned binders.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0032">Also preferred is a process as described above in which the carrier(s) is/are selected from the group consisting of maltodextrins, dextrins, starches, flours and fibrous materials.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0033">Fibrous materials are insoluble dietary fibers from the group of celluloses, modified celluloses, cereal fibers (e. g. wheat or oats), fruit and vegetable fibers (e. g. apple, carrot, potato, pea or bamboo). Preferably, the fibrous materials have typical particle sizes of 10-500 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0034">Preferred according to the invention is a process as described above, wherein in step i) an emulsion comprising one or more flavorant(s) and/or odorant(s), one or more carrier(s) and at least one emulsifier is sprayed, preferably wherein the flavorant(s) and/or odorant(s) is/are used in a ratio of 2:1 to 1:2, preferably 1.5:1 to 1:1.5 to the at least one emulsifier and/or wherein the flavorant(s) and/or odorant(s) is/are used in a ratio of 1:2 to 1:4, preferably 1:2.5 to 1:3.5 to the carrier(s).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0035">Further preferred is a process as described above in which the at least one emulsifier is selected from the group consisting of gum arabic, modified starches, proteins, in particular vegetable proteins, native or modified pectins and soluble fractions of soy polysaccharides.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0036">A (spray) emulsion as used in step (i) preferably comprises 10 to 30% by weight, preferably 15 to 25% by weight flavorants and/or odorants, 10 to 30t % by weight, preferably 15 to 25% by weight emulsifier and 40 to 80t % by weight, preferably 50 to 70% by weight carrier. These substances are adjusted to a sufficient viscosity with water. The amount of water used for this purpose is approximately equal to the weight of the previously mentioned components or somewhat less.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0037">Also preferred according to the invention is a process in which the emulsion from step (i) is used in a volume ratio of 5:1 to 15:1, preferably 8:1 to 12:1 to the binder solution from step (ii) and/or wherein the solids in the emulsion from step (i) are used in a weight ratio of 30:1 to 70:1, preferably 40:1 to 60:1 to the solids in the binder solution from step (ii).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0038">The present invention also relates to a particulate product, preferably produced or producible by a process as described above, wherein the product consists of particles comprising or consisting of a flavorant and/or odorant and one or more carrier(s) agglomerated with a binder, wherein the agglomerated particles have a porous structure and wherein the binder(s) is/are selected from the group consisting of monosaccharides or polysaccharides with reducing groups and sugar alcohols or mixtures thereof, and wherein the binder(s) does/do not contain a flavorant and/or odorant.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0039">In particular, the monosaccharides or polysaccharides with reducing groups or the mixtures thereof have a dextrose equivalent of at least 8, preferably at least 12, more preferably at least 18.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0040">The product according to the invention is a loose agglomerate of flavorant and/or odorant particles. The binder thereby covers the surface of the particles only incompletely. In particular, the product according to the invention differs from individual coated particles having an &#x201c;onion structure&#x201d; in which there is a core that is completely and uniformly covered with one of several layers of binder. Rather, the product of the invention has a &#x201c;grape structure&#x201d; in which individual particles are bonded together by the binder. The product has a porous structure and is therefore readily and rapidly dispersible or soluble in water, which is particularly advantageous for use in instant products.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0041">Since the binder itself does not contain any flavorants and/or odorants, the flavorants and/or odorants are not evenly distributed over the agglomerate and are hardly present on the surface. As a result, they are effectively protected from oxidation by the binder. This is remarkable in that the binder does not form a closed layer on the surface of the particles, but merely glues them together. Surprisingly, however, it appears that the presence of reducing groups on the surface is sufficient to protect the flavorants and/or odorants from oxidation.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows spray-dried particles with lemon flavoring that have not been agglomerated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the same spray-dried particles agglomerated with water.

Stability was tested after 6 or 12 months of accelerated storage, depending on the shelf life of the liquid flavor. The results are shown in Table 1.

It is surprising, however, that substances which are actually only applied to bond the particles increase the storage stability more than pure surface reduction (simulated by bonding by means of water or steam) does. This is because the substances do not cover the entire surface of the particles, so they cannot seal them.

num="0083">Because the panelists' descriptions in Example 1 showed strong differences that were not reflected in the &#x201c;pass, fail&#x201d; classification, another testing method was used to further tease out the differences.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0084">The stored samples that passed the test in example 1 were tasted against each other according to the DoD (Degree of difference) test procedure. In order not to overload the panelists, the tests had to be divided up, as no more than 5 samples should be compared at the same time, otherwise the risk of panelist fatigue increases.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0085">The task of the panelists was to describe the differences of the samples from the standard (STD) using the given terms. To validate the results, the standard was also tasted as a sample. The fresh sample produced by spray drying without agglomeration was used as the standard. Accordingly, a slight difference means that the stored sample is very close to the fresh product, which indicates a good protective effect of the agglomeration carried out by means of the binder substance. The % values given refer to the proportion of panelists who arrived at the respective assessment.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0086">Tasting was performed with 0.2% of sample on a test solution with sugar and citric acid.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0087">The result shows that the stored samples<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0088">Lemon with binder glucose</li>        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0089">Lemon with binder maltodextrin EN 17-20</li>        <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0090">Lemon with binder gum/modified starch</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0085" num="0091">showed a better protective effect than the other binders used for agglomeration.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0092">The protective effect of the glucose and maltodextrin is possibly due to the reducing effect of the sugar. However, it is surprising that a reducing sugar applied to the outside of the particles has such an effect. In the case of the agglomerate, where a mixture of gum arabic and modified starch was used as a binder, it can be assumed that due to the high interfacial activity of these substances, the binder liquid spreads particularly well and thus leads to an even coating of the particles, accompanied by a sealing. In addition, gum arabic has reducing groups, as can be seen from Example 3, and can thus contribute to oxidation stability.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00003" num="00003"><table
