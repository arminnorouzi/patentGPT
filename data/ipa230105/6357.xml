id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A microwave prism is used to repoint an operational Direct-to-Home (DTH) or Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) reflector antenna as part of a ground terminal to receive (or transmit) signals from a different satellite or orbital position without physically moving the reflector or the feed horn antenna. The microwave prism operates by shifting the radiated fields from the horn antenna generally perpendicular to the focal axis of the parabolic reflector in order to cause the main beam of the reflector to scan in response. For an existing reflector antenna receiving signals from an incumbent satellite, a prism has been designed to be snapped into place over the feed horn and shift the fields laterally by a calibrated distance. The structure of the prism is designed to be positioned and oriented correctly without the use of skilled labor. This system allows a satellite service provider to repoint their subscribers to a new satellite by shipping a self-install kit of the prism that is pre-configured to have the correct orientation and position on the feed antenna to correctly re-point the beam at a different satellite once the prism is applied. One benefit of the system is that unskilled labor, i.e., the subscribers themselves, can be used to repoint a large number of subscriber antennas in a satellite network rather than requiring the cost of a truck roll and a technician to visit every site. The microwave prisms to implement this functionality can be constructed in different ways, with homogeneous slabs or blocks, Gradient-Index (GRIN), multi-layered dielectric, geometric or graded-index Fresnel-zone, metasurface, or metamaterial prisms. The geometric and electrical constraints of the design are determined by the incumbent and target satellites, and the ground terminal location.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="72.39mm" wi="69.51mm" file="US20230006358A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="168.74mm" wi="88.98mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230006358A1-20230105-D00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-D00002" he="164.76mm" wi="69.51mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230006358A1-20230105-D00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-D00003" he="209.47mm" wi="94.23mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230006358A1-20230105-D00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-D00004" he="152.57mm" wi="106.43mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230006358A1-20230105-D00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-D00005" he="154.43mm" wi="117.09mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230006358A1-20230105-D00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-D00006" he="165.10mm" wi="92.12mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230006358A1-20230105-D00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00007" num="00007"><img id="EMI-D00007" he="186.52mm" wi="123.78mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230006358A1-20230105-D00007.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00008" num="00008"><img id="EMI-D00008" he="265.94mm" wi="101.01mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230006358A1-20230105-D00008.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><description id="description"><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser.

The most common satellite antenna for microwave (C, X, Ku, Ka, and higher bands) applications is a horn-illuminated reflector, either a center-fed or offset-fed parabolic (or nearly parabolic) reflector, of which a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and operational frequencies are available.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Mobile platforms and ground terminals that are used to communicate with non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) satellites will typically have motorized tracking systems and electronics to maintain the connection while either the ground terminal or satellite is in motion relative to the other. However, this hardware is very expensive. For a stationary ground location communicating with a GEO (Geostationary Earth Orbit) satellite, a fixed antenna that is pointed at the satellite once and then locked in place is cost effective and simple. However, the disadvantage of the fixed reflector is that changing the satellite to which the antenna is connected requires skilled or semi-skilled labor and tools to accomplish. This reduces the ability of the subscriber to change their service provider or broadcaster, and also restricts the ability of the service provider or broadcaster to change satellites or operators for capacity, commercial, or other reasons. It is desirable that, while the terminal and antenna costs remain low for the mass market, there is an easy way for the subscriber to repoint their own antenna from an original incumbent satellite to a new satellite, without tools, tuning, or significant effort.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This present disclosure introduces a system and method by which a microwave prism or lens can be used by an unskilled person on a reflector antenna by snapping to or otherwise mating with the horn in a controlled orientation to point the main beam of the reflector to connect to a different satellite.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, parabolic reflector antennas <b>101</b> for SATCOM purposes have at a minimum of a piece of shaped metal or conductive material reflector <b>103</b> in the shape of a paraboloid, a horn antenna <b>109</b> that serves to feed or illuminate the reflector <b>103</b>, as well as support structure <b>105</b>, <b>107</b> to mount the components in the correct relative positions and fix the entire assembly to point rigidly at the satellite. A radome or cover <b>111</b> over the mouth of the horn protects it from water or debris incursion. Some antennas will include additional shaped or parabolic subreflectors in the beam path to better control the illumination of the primary reflector, and/or modify the shape of the primary reflector. The very low-cost antennas for Ku and Ka DTH most typically use an offset-fed reflector, which reduces the blockage caused by the feed horn. The feed horn will commonly be highly integrated with the Low-Noise Block (LNB) Downconverter circuitry <b>113</b>, and with a mounting arm supporting the LNB and feed. A pole- or wall-mounting fixture is included on the back of the reflector that allows the orientation of the reflector and feed assembly to be adjusted and then locked into place by means of bolts or other fasteners.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">New subscribers of a broadcast or bidirectional satellite service either purchase the antenna <b>101</b> or are provided the antenna <b>101</b> as part of the service. Although at times advertised as being able to be installed and pointed by the subscribers themselves, installation by a service provider is almost universal.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The reflector <b>103</b>, although presumably mounted to a solid structure and securely locked in place, can still become moved out of position by wind, snow, or other events. Correcting this problem requires a truck roll, which means sending a technician with training and tools to correctly re-point the antenna. Service visits represent a significant expense to the service provider, even when the issue may take only a few minutes to resolve.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Changing which satellite is connected when the antenna is not configured with multiple pre-pointed receivers requires both knowledge, tools, and skills. Currently, there are smartphone apps and websites that provide direction for how to point a satellite antenna, but the majority of subscribers would not be interested in doing so themselves. For this reason, service providers are locked into particular orbital slots by their subscriber base&#x2014;the more successful the broadcaster, the less flexibility they have when trying to provide or modify the satellite from which they provide their service.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Microwave lenses and prisms constructed from dielectric, metamaterial, or metasurfaces are commonly used to control the radiation patterns or direction of antennas. Microwave lenses use the same principles as optical lenses, but use materials that have desirable properties for radio frequencies rather than optical wavelengths. Different features and methods have different benefits. Anti-reflective coatings are commonly but not universally used, typically in microwave lenses implemented as a quarter-wave plate or coating over the lens. An anti-reflective coating serves to improve the impedance match of the signal travelling from free space into the lens material, and again to improve the impedance match of the signal exiting the lens. Due to the difficulty of achieving the low dielectric constants needed for a good anti-reflective coating, there are many methods of constructing such lenses, including the use of foams, textured surfaces, and 3D printing.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Beam shifters are common devices in optics, composed of a polished parallel-plate prism, which could also be described as a slab of glass. When rotated at various angles relative to an incident light beam, the exit point of the light from the prism is laterally shifted by a distance related to the incidence angle of the light and the thickness of the prism. Such devices will include an optical anti-reflective coating, and are used as adjustment points in optical and laser workbenches to align different parts of the system. A typical example is provided by Thorlabs XYT/M-A Post-Mountable Tweaker Plate, 2.5 mm thick (Optical Beam Shifter), thorlabs.com.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A reflector antenna repointing device for use with a reflector antenna.

Separate devices <b>201</b> or different orientations of the same device <b>201</b> can enable scanning within a range of +/&#x2212; 10 degrees from the nominal angle. This is not a hard limit, but further scanning will result in more significant performance degradation compared to the nominal case without the reflector repointing device installed. As a specific example, an antenna <b>200</b> located within 50 miles of (for example) Washington DC and configured to receive signals from a satellite at 50&#xb0; W could be converted to instead receive signals from a satellite at 45&#xb0; W, without skilled installation or pointing calibration, by installing the device <b>201</b> specifically designed for a 5 deg shift over the feed <b>109</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">For convenience, the following sections describe signals and fields as being transmitted from the antenna and reflector towards one or another satellite. The reciprocal behavior of transmission from the satellite and reception by the antenna is not described, but is exactly analogous to the described case.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>, the horn antenna <b>109</b> when in typical operation is sited such that the aperture of the horn is located at the focal point <b>203</b> of the parabolic reflector <b>103</b>. In typical operation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>, the system <b>101</b> is oriented such that the signals or antenna fields <b>205</b> from the horn interact with the reflector <b>103</b> and are directed towards the desired target satellite <b>213</b>, forming a beam <b>207</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, steering the system <b>101</b> to form a beam <b>211</b> towards a different satellite <b>215</b> can be performed by reorienting the entire antenna <b>101</b>, but can also be performed by shifting the feed horn <b>109</b> away from the focal point <b>203</b> of the reflector <b>103</b>. The antenna fields <b>209</b> from the offset horn then interact with the reflector <b>103</b> to form a beam <b>211</b> directed at the alternate satellite <b>215</b>. However, either re-orienting the entire antenna <b>101</b> or physically moving the horn <b>109</b> both require skilled labor to perform, as well as support for the movement in the design of the reflector, neither can easily be performed without tools as a retrofit operation in most cases.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>, <b>3</b>, the reflector repointing device <b>201</b> is added to the horn <b>109</b> at the focal point <b>203</b> of the reflector <b>103</b> to laterally shift the fields <b>205</b> that would ordinarily direct a beam <b>207</b> at the original satellite <b>213</b> to instead produce a beam <b>211</b> at the alternate satellite <b>215</b>. Here a lateral shift indicates a direction perpendicular to the axis of symmetry of the parabolic reflector, which is also the direction of the feed support arm. A lateral shift could be horizontal, vertical, or a combination of both, but should remain within the plane aligned with the original feed aperture perpendicular to the reflector axis to ensure that the apparent phase center continues to lie approximately on the focal plane of the reflector <b>103</b>. The location of the feed aperture defines the starting point for comparison for all shifts. Laterally shifting and potentially correcting the angle of the fields effectively forces the reflector <b>103</b> to behave as though the horn <b>109</b> was in a different location, thus generating a beam <b>211</b> in a new, desired direction.

There is not a strict separation between these two concepts, as a prism can also be designed to focus, and a lens can also be designed to bend the energy.

Due to this difference between lasers and microwaves, so the reflector repointing device <b>201</b> can include corrections to allow for the cone-shaped emanation of energy coming from the horn, unlike the simple planar beam shifters for optical purposes. For example, the reflector repointing device <b>201</b> can have a non-planar surface (in particular, the bottom prism surface <b>402</b><i>b </i>and/or the top prism surface <b>402</b><i>a</i>) for nonzero optical power to correct the field curvature and axial location of the effective phase center of the output fields coming out of the repointing device <b>201</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The core operation of the prism <b>401</b> is to shift the fields laterally compared to the location of the horn <b>109</b>.

The prism <b>401</b> is held at a prescribed angle relative to the horn antenna <b>109</b>, and more specifically the first and/or second surfaces <b>402</b><i>a, </i><b>402</b><i>b </i>are at an angle with respect to the plane of the open mouth of the horn <b>109</b> and at an angle with respect to the central longitudinal axis of the horn <b>109</b>. This can optionally include anti-reflective layers <b>403</b> to support higher performance. However, to create a large lateral shift or offset <b>507</b>, this embodiment might require the prism to be very thick, have a high angle of incidence of the fields (which limits the transmission efficiency), and a large dielectric constant &#x3b5;. These factors combined to make the prism option <b>401</b><i>a </i>bulky and heavy.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, another prism <b>401</b><i>b </i>includes coupling and antireflective layers to more smoothly convert the direction of the signal throughout the structure with a series of one or more wedges <b>508</b>. The prism <b>401</b><i>b </i>has a central body or plate <b>502</b> having a parallel shape, as with the prism <b>401</b><i>a, </i>and one or more wedges <b>508</b> are connected (e.g., by adhesive) or integrally formed thereto extending outward from the top and/or bottom of the central plate <b>502</b>. A first set of one or more wedges <b>508</b><i>a </i>are arranged at the first side (the top) of the main body <b>502</b>, and a second set of one or more wedges <b>508</b><i>b </i>are arranged at the second side (the bottom) of the main body <b>502</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The wedges <b>508</b> can have any suitable shape. However, in the embodiment shown, each wedge <b>508</b> is substantially triangular in shape with a first planar primary surface that faces the main body <b>502</b>, a second planar primary surface that faces away from the main body <b>502</b>, and a small secondary surface. The bottom surface of the bottommost wedge of the first set of wedges <b>508</b><i>a, </i>contacts the top surface <b>502</b><i>a </i>of the main body <b>502</b>, and the top surface of each wedge contacts the bottom surface of the adjacent wedge.

Each wedge has an acute angle formed between the first and second primary surfaces. In one embodiment, the first set of wedges <b>508</b><i>a </i>have a combined angle that can be the same as the offset angle &#x3b8; of the bottom surface <b>402</b><i>b </i>of the main body <b>502</b> with respect to the plane of the mouth of the horn <b>109</b>.

Accordingly, the bottom wedge surface of the bottommost wedge <b>508</b><i>b </i>of the lower wedge set is substantially parallel to the plane of the horn mouth and to the top wedge surface of the topmost wedge <b>508</b><i>a </i>of the top wedge set. Thus, the acute angle of the top set of wedges <b>508</b><i>a </i>is aligned at one side of the main body <b>502</b> (i.e., the left side in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>), and the acute angle of the bottom set of wedges <b>508</b><i>b </i>is aligned at the opposite side of the main body <b>502</b> (i.e., the right side). In this configuration, the signal emerges substantially parallel to and offset from the original signal axis <b>506</b>, which can also be parallel to the central horn longitudinal axis.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment, the multiple dielectric layers &#x3b5;<sub>1</sub>, &#x3b5;<sub>2</sub>, &#x3b5;<sub>3</sub>, &#x3b5;<sub>4</sub>, and &#x3b5;<sub>5 </sub>for each wedge <b>508</b> are successively higher in dielectric constant the further from the central plate <b>502</b>, with &#x3b5;<sub>1 </sub>the lowest and &#x3b5;<sub>5 </sub>the highest. That is, the central plate <b>502</b> has the highest dielectric constant, and each adjacent wedge <b>508</b> from the central plate <b>502</b> has a successively lower dielectric constant. This design allows increased transmission efficiency with the increased number of layers and much smaller field incidence angle at each layer but does little to minimize the size and mass of the design.

This embodiment reduces the mass of the prism <b>401</b><i>c </i>by reducing the volume of required material, but with a corresponding reduction in the operational bandwidth and an increase in insertion loss. Rather than use bulk dielectric whose properties are defined by the dielectric constant and the shape, a metasurface prism has one or more layers of metamaterial or metasurface suspended in air by a supporting structure. For this implementation, a prism <b>401</b><i>c </i>may be constructed from two layers <b>531</b>, <b>535</b> of a spatially varying metamaterial or metasurface that changes the direction of the fields from the horn <b>109</b> at two points by introducing a phase gradient in the transmitted fields. The metamaterial or metasurface prism does not rely on refraction within a dielectric region as does a conventional prism, and does not include the dielectric regions included in <b>401</b><i>a </i>and <b>401</b><i>b. </i>Accordingly, the bottom metamaterial or metasurface <b>531</b> refracts the signal away from the original signal axis <b>506</b> so that the signal travels at an angle with respect to the original signal axis <b>506</b>. And the top metamaterial or metasurface <b>535</b> refracts the signal back to being parallel to the original signal axis <b>506</b>. The double refraction offsets the signal from the original signal axis <b>506</b> and parallel thereto.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">A gap or separation between the two layers <b>531</b>, <b>535</b> is required to allow distance for the fields to propagate and create the lateral offset. The greater the separation, the greater the lateral offset. The separation is maintained by a mechanical structure <b>533</b> internal to the prism structure that maintains the space between the layers <b>531</b>, <b>535</b> as an air gap. For example, the mechanical structure <b>533</b> can be a support or beam and one or both of the layers <b>531</b>, <b>535</b> can be connected to the support at different positions that maintains the desired air gap distance between them. This supporting structure internal to the prism is separate in purpose and implementation from the structure <b>407</b> that holds the prism <b>401</b> to the feed <b>109</b>, and can be implemented using supports, bolts, clips, or other physical features to maintain a fixed spacing between the two layers <b>531</b> and <b>535</b>. The artificial dielectrics or metasurface structures forming the layers <b>531</b> and <b>535</b> require periodic changes to their structure across the surface of each layer <b>531</b> and <b>535</b> to set up a phase gradient across the surfaces and therefore steer the beam, which limits the usable bandwidth of the design. Metamaterial and metasurface designs are often narrowband and lossy, but for some applications may be sufficient. Transmission efficiency through both layers is a key metric for this style of implementation.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>d</i>)</figref>, a corrugated prism <b>401</b><i>d </i>is shown that reduces the thickness of the structure. That, in turn, reduces the weight, since the supporting structure <b>407</b> and radome <b>405</b> can then be smaller as well. The large height of the prisms shown in <b>401</b><i>a </i>and <b>401</b><i>b </i>is also reduced by introducing shaped corrugations to the top and bottom surfaces of the prism <b>401</b><i>d. </i>The corrugations have a sawtooth type shape. From the left, each tooth of the top surface has a straight leading rising edge that is substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the horn, followed by an angled trailing falling edge.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The prism <b>401</b><i>d </i>shows a collapsed version of the prism <b>401</b><i>a, </i>but the same approach could be applied to the multilayer <b>401</b><i>b. </i>Collapsing the size and shape of the prism by using a Fresnel-style corrugation in the top and bottom surfaces <b>401</b><i>d </i>can maintain largely the same beam steering properties, but with a reduced height of the prism. This will produce dispersive effects that limit the operational bandwidth, but is likely to have smaller dispersion than the metasurface/metamaterial approach. An antireflective coating can be applied to the top and bottom corrugated surfaces of <b>401</b><i>d, </i>and will follow the shape of the corrugations itself. The bottom surface refracts the signal to form an angle with respect to the original signal axis <b>506</b>, and the top surface refracts the signal back to being parallel to (and offset from) the original signal axis <b>506</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>e</i>)</figref>, a graded-index or inhomogeneous prism <b>401</b><i>e, </i>with full control over the internal dielectric constant &#x3b5;(x,y,z) offers significant benefits of collapsing functionality into the smallest possible contiguous package. The challenge in both smoothly varying (continuous) as well as stepped gradient designs is fabrication of the often complex shapes and structures required to achieve the necessary performance.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>f</i>)</figref>, two half-prisms <b>401</b><i>f </i>are shown. Since the mass of the prism <b>401</b> is a major factor in the design of the repointing device <b>201</b>, other actions to reduce the mass of the prism can be taken, including prisms where regions of dielectric in the interior of the prism are removed when unnecessary, effectively forming two half-prisms <b>401</b><i>f </i>that are separated from one another by a distance or gap of air. In some implementations, this gap might be implemented a hollow air region might be constructed within an otherwise solid prism, reducing the weight but not requiring a separate mounting or support structure similar to support <b>533</b>. The half-prisms <b>401</b><i>f </i>can have the shape of a triangle, with planar or curved surfaces. As shown, the upper half-prism can have an inward-facing surface that is curved to be slightly concaved, and the lower half-prism can have an inward-facing surface that is curved to be slightly convex. The inward-facing surface of the upper half-prism faces and has a mating shape with the inward-facing surface of the lower half-prism. Matching the profile of the inner surfaces of the prism to the propagation direction of the fields at each angle allows the fields to continue straight without refraction at the interface, as though the removed material were still there. This mass-reduction approach is also useful when the loss tangent of the available dielectrics is high compared to air. The bottom surface of the lower half-prism <b>401</b><i>f </i>is angled &#x3b8; with respect to the plane of the horn mouth, and refracts the signal to be at an angle with respect to the original signal axis <b>506</b>. The top surface of the lower half-prism <b>401</b><i>f </i>further refracts the signal. The bottom surface of the upper half-prism <b>401</b><i>f </i>refracts the signal back toward being parallel to the original signal axis <b>506</b>, and the upper surface of the upper half-prism <b>401</b><i>f </i>further refracts the signal to be parallel to and offset from the original signal axis <b>506</b>. The greater the distance between the upper and lower half-prisms <b>401</b><i>f, </i>the greater the achievable lateral offset of the signal from the original signal axis <b>506</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Because the fields propagating through a dielectric region will not expand by as much as if they were propagating only through air, the effective phase center of the fields coming from the device <b>201</b> may no longer match the reflector. Even though the lateral position may be correct, the distance of the phase center of the feed distribution to the reflector still needs to match the focal length of the reflector to maintain aperture efficiency. The inclusion of nonzero optical gain (through curvature of the surface(s) or interior dielectric gradients) can be used to correct both the angular distribution of the fields as well as the effective phase center.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The required size of the prism <b>401</b> is determined jointly by the degree of lateral shift needed for the fields and the geometry of the reflector. A good prism should be small, lightweight, and compact in order to minimize cost and simplify installation. However, the prism <b>401</b> must be sized to intercept all of the power from the feed horn and redirect all of that energy to the reflector.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, for reflectors with a small f/D (focal length <b>603</b> to diameter <b>605</b>) ratio, or equivalently a wide illumination cone angle <b>609</b>, a particular prism <b>611</b> implementation of a certain thickness must be large enough in the lateral directions to cover the original radiation pattern cone <b>631</b> from the horn at the base of the prism, large enough at the exit of the prism <b>611</b> to release energy across the entire surface of the re-centered cone <b>633</b>, and allow for enough internal thickness <b>615</b> and width <b>613</b> to reshape the energy sufficiently to follow the desired path <b>607</b>. If a thicker <b>625</b> prism <b>621</b> implementation is required in order to provide the necessary lateral shift (in general, further shift requires a thicker prism to provide more room to propagate), then the prism (at least at the output) must be wider <b>623</b> as well, thus making the volume and mass of the prism proportional (roughly, in general) to the cube of prism thickness. This leads to the imperative requirement to minimize the prism thickness while achieving other performance parameters, so as to also control the mass.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The f/D ratio also affects the amount of lateral shift required to steer the reflector to a given angle. A reflector with a low f/D ratio, like many common consumer DTH antennas, allows a small change in effective feed position <b>109</b> to produce a larger shift in beam scan angle.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Reflectors with high f/D would require a smaller prism to shift the aperture fields by a given distance since the cone angle is small, but would require a larger physical shift to obtain the same scan angle of the main beam in degrees.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one embodiment, the reflector repointing device <b>201</b> is retrofit to (and connected, such as by fastener mechanisms, adhesive or the like) existing horn antennas. Accordingly, it is configured to work with existing horn antenna and parabolic reflector. The properties of the prism <b>401</b> are designed to suit the antenna system <b>101</b>. However, in other embodiments, the horn antenna and parabolic reflector can be designed to work with the device <b>201</b>, which would involve mounting features <b>407</b> ready for easy and precise installation of the device <b>201</b>, a strong mounting arm <b>107</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) to support the additional weight of the device <b>201</b> without deflection, and a sufficiently large f/D ratio to optimize the mass of the entire system <b>201</b>.

Based on the location of a target installation of the reflector repointing device <b>201</b>, a chart similar to that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is consulted and the necessary correction angle and direction selected. The correction angle and direction are then applied by implementation in an independent prism and mounting design for each combination, or by means of an adjustable fixture or mounting arrangement the scan angle and direction are set appropriately using a single prism and fixture design for a broader geographic region. The prism is effectively rotated about the central axis of the horn antenna <b>109</b> by the correction angle in order to have the resulting beam be pointed at the target satellite based on the location of the system <b>200</b>. The prism or setting selection can be performed before shipping the device to the end-user, or the end user can be provided the instructions to use a particular numbered or labeled setting depending on their location. i.e., the instructions might read, &#x201c;For your postcode ABC, rotate the mounting clip to align the arrows with Position D before installing on your antenna&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">These instructions would apply to an implementation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>. A horn antenna <b>109</b> is shown mounted with its center at point <b>811</b>. The prism <b>401</b> (shown for illustrative purposes only, but contained within the radome <b>405</b> of the device <b>201</b>) shifts the fields of the horn to be re-centered to point <b>813</b> on leaving the prism. A set of detents and alignment markings are provided on the outer housing or radome material to be adjustably aligned either by the end user or before shipping. The alignment markings allow the user to adjust the mounting structure to set an adjustable position and adjustable orientation of the microwave prism relative to the reflector antenna, and specifically relative to the horn feed <b>109</b>. That is, the mounting structure <b>407</b> fixedly attaches the device <b>201</b> to the antenna <b>101</b>, but at a position and orientation that is defined by the adjustable alignment markings. The alignment features define a plurality of positions and orientations of the microwave prism relative to the mounting structure, and can be set at the factory based on geographic location. The end user can then determine (such as by using the map of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) the proper setting based on the geographic location of the installation location.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Changing the orientation of the prism <b>401</b> relative to the central axis of the feed horn <b>109</b> changes the angle of the re-steered beam relative to the original mounted antenna. For example, the prism can be rotated about the feed horn <b>109</b> central axis such that the resulting beam is pointed East or West of the original beam direction, as well as adjusting the elevation angle that the beam is pointed above the horizon to accurately point at the desired satellite <b>215</b>. One or more support members or fastening members can be provided to move the prism <b>401</b>. For instance, a fastening member can movably connect the prism <b>401</b> to the radome <b>405</b> or to the mounting structure <b>407</b> so that the prism <b>401</b> can change orientation relative to the feed horn <b>109</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref> shows the device <b>401</b> aligned to position A, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> shows the device <b>401</b> aligned to position E. Here, it is noted that the signal that is emerges from the horn is offset by the prism, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>(<i>a</i>)-(<i>f</i>)</figref>. The alignment <b>817</b> can be connected to the prism <b>401</b>, so that rotating the alignment <b>817</b> between the various positions, also rotates the entire prism <b>401</b>. When the prism and alignment <b>817</b> are at position E (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>), phase center <b>813</b> of the prism is offset from the phase center <b>811</b> of the horn. More specifically, the phase center <b>813</b> of the prism is at about 2 o'clock with respect to the phase center <b>811</b> of the horn. When the prism and alignment <b>817</b> are at position A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>), the phase center <b>813</b> of the prism is at about 4 o'clock with respect to the phase center <b>811</b> of the horn. Thus, the phase center <b>813</b> of the prism rotates as the alignment rotates, which in turn moves the signal that is output by the prism. In another embodiment, the different positions of the alignment can create different angles for the prism.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The prism <b>401</b> may take on any of the shapes or varying orientations with respect to the feed horn as previously described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, and the shape and boundary of the radome is then selected to cover the prism appropriately.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">After aligning the adjustable alignments <b>817</b>, the device would fixedly connect to the horn in any suitable manner. For example, the mounting system <b>407</b> can include a snap connector <b>819</b> that snaps onto the mounting bar of the antenna, stabilized and oriented by the horn shroud <b>815</b>. Once installed, the device would now cause the reflector to point its main beam at the new desired satellite <b>215</b>. The mounting features <b>407</b> fixedly hold the device in the proper position to intercept all of the fields from the horn <b>109</b> that would otherwise reach the reflector <b>103</b>, and shift the fields laterally to effect a change in scanning angle of the reflector antenna <b>101</b>. No further motion or activity is then required during proper operation of the antenna <b>101</b> and the device <b>201</b>. If the antenna is desired to be repointed again at the original incumbent satellite <b>213</b>, then the device <b>201</b> can be removed by detaching the mounting features <b>819</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">It is noted that the drawings may illustrate, and the description and claims may use geometric or relational terms, such as right, left, above, below, upper, lower, side, top, bottom, elongated, parallel, laterally, orthogonal, angle, rectangular, square, circular, round, axis.
