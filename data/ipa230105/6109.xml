Such an LED panel can be used for a computer, touch panel device, personal digital assistant (PDA), cell phone, television monitor, and the like.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An LED panel that uses micron-scale LEDs based on III-V semiconductor technology (also called micro-LEDs) would have a variety of advantages as compared to OLEDs, e.g., higher energy efficiency, brightness, and lifetime, as well as fewer material layers in the display stack which can simplify manufacturing. However, there are challenges to fabrication of micro-LED panels. Micro-LEDs having different color emission (e.g., red, green, and blue pixels) need to be fabricated on different substrates through separate processes. Integration of the multiple colors of micro-LED devices onto a single panel typically requires a pick-and-place step to transfer the micro-LED devices from their original donor substrates to a destination substrate. This often involves modification of the LED structure or fabrication process, such as introducing sacrificial layers to ease die release. In addition, stringent requirements on placement accuracy can limit the throughput, the final yield, or both.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An alternative approach to bypass the pick-and-place step is to selectively deposit color conversion agents (e.g., quantum dots, nanostructures, photoluminescent materials, or organic substances) at specific pixel locations on a substrate fabricated with monochrome LEDs. The monochrome LEDs can generate relatively short wavelength light, e.g., purple or blue light, and the color conversion agents can convert this short wavelength light into longer wavelength light, e.g., red or green light for red or green pixels. The selective deposition of the color conversion agents can be performed using high-resolution shadow masks or controllable inkjet or aerosol jet printing.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, shadow masks are prone to problems with alignment accuracy and scalability, whereas inkjet and aerosol jet techniques suffer from resolution (inkjet), accuracy (inkjet) and throughput (aerosol jet) problems. In order to manufacture micro-LED displays, new techniques are needed to precisely and cost-effectively provide color conversion agents for different colors onto different pixels on a substrate, such as a large area substrate or flexible substrate.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This disclosure generally relates to polymerizable compositions including chelating agents for stabilizing quantum dot precursor materials in color conversion layers and micro-LED systems and devices including these color conversion layers.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a first general aspect, a photocurable composition includes quantum dots, quantum dot precursor materials, a chelating agent, one or more monomers, and a photoinitiator.

Followed by UV curing, the quantum dots locked in a polyacrylate matrix can be used as a color conversion layer for advanced displays. However, these color conversion layers can include defects that result in imperfect film formation. In some examples, these defects are metal particles having a size in a range between about 1 &#x3bc;m to about 5 &#x3bc;m. These particles are believed to be formed from metals that are stable in solution but decompose and aggregate during deposition or curing.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A technique that may address problems associated with metal aggregates in color conversion layers include the addition of chelating agents in formulations for micro-LED color conversion layers. These chelating agents can chelate metals (e.g., quantum dot precursor materials) in solution, thereby facilitating formation of smooth color conversion layers free of metal aggregates.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As described in this disclosure, a formulation for a micro-LED color conversion layer typically includes a color conversion agent (e.g., quantum dots), a chelating agent, a reactive component, and a photoinitiator. The formulation may optionally include one or more of a solvent, a functional component (e.g., high refraction index additive, a surfactant, a stray light absorber or UV blocker).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The color conversion agents are materials that emit visible radiation in a first visible wavelength band in response to absorption of UV radiation or visible radiation in a second visible wavelength band. The UV radiation typically has a wavelength in a range of 200 nm to 400 nm. The visible radiation typically has a wavelength or wavelength band in a range of 400 nm to 800 nm. The first visible wavelength band is different (e.g., more energetic) than the second visible wavelength band. That is, the color conversion agents are materials that can convert the shorter wavelength light from a micro-LED into longer wavelength light.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The color conversion agents include photoluminescent materials, such as organic or inorganic molecules, nanomaterials (e.g., nanoparticles, nanostructures, quantum dots), or other appropriate materials. Suitable nanomaterials typically include one or more III-V compounds. Examples of suitable III-V compounds include CdSe, CdS, InP, PbS, CuInP, ZnSeS, and GaAs. In some cases, the nanomaterials include one or more elements selected from the group consisting of cadmium, indium, copper, silver, gallium, germanium, arsenide, aluminum, boron, iodide, bromide, chloride, selenium, tellurium, and phosphorus. In certain cases, the nanomaterials include one or more perovskites.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">At least one of the color conversion agents includes photoluminescent quantum dots. Photoluminescent quantum dots typically include one or more III-V compounds. Examples of suitable III-V compounds include CdSe, CdS, InP, PbS, CuInP, ZnSeS, and GaAs. The quantum dots can be homogeneous or can have a core-shell structure. The quantum dots can have an average diameter in a range of about 1 nm to about 10 nm. One or more organic ligands are typically coupled to an exterior surface of the quantum dots. The organic ligands promote dispersion of the quantum dots in solvents. Suitable organic ligands include aliphatic amine, thiol or acid compounds, in which the aliphatic part typically has 6 to 30 carbon atoms. Commercially available quantum dots typically include quantum dot precursor materials (e.g., metal atoms and ions) along with the quantum dots.
