These wireless networks may be multiple-access networks capable of supporting multiple users by sharing the available network resources. Such networks may be multiple access networks that support communications for multiple users by sharing the available network resources.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A wireless communication network may include several components. These components may include wireless communication devices, such as base stations (or node Bs) that may support communication for a number of user equipments (UEs). A UE may communicate with a base station via downlink and uplink. The downlink (or forward link) refers to the communication link from the base station to the UE, and the uplink (or reverse link) refers to the communication link from the UE to the base station.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A base station may transmit data and control information on a downlink to a UE or may receive data and control information on an uplink from the UE. On the downlink, a transmission from the base station may encounter interference due to transmissions from neighbor base stations or from other wireless radio frequency (RF) transmitters. On the uplink, a transmission from the UE may encounter interference from uplink transmissions of other UEs communicating with the neighbor base stations or from other wireless RF transmitters. This interference may degrade performance on both the downlink and uplink.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As the demand for mobile broadband access continues to increase, the possibilities of interference and congested networks grows with more UEs accessing the long-range wireless communication networks and more short-range wireless systems being deployed in communities. Research and development continue to advance wireless technologies not only to meet the growing demand for mobile broadband access, but to advance and enhance the user experience with mobile communications.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF SOME EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The following summarizes some aspects of the present disclosure to provide a basic understanding of the discussed technology.

Rather, the detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the inventive subject matter. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that these specific details are not required in every case and that, in some instances, well-known structures and components are shown in block diagram form for clarity of presentation.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Various aspects of the present disclosure are directed to systems and methods that support mechanisms for determining a transmit power of a paging early indication (PEI) transmission. In particular, in aspects of the present disclosure, a user equipment (UE) may be configured to receive a PEI from a base station indicating whether the UE is being paged during a paging occasion. The UE may be configured to determine a transmit power of the PEI transmission. In aspects, the UE may determine the transmit power of the PEI transmission based on a configuration of the PEI provided to the UE. In aspects, the determined transmit power of the PEI transmission may be an absolute power value or may be a power offset value. The power offset value may be a power offset with respect to a transmission of another signal or channel. In some aspects, the transmit power of the PEI transmission may be based on whether the PEI transmission is a beamformed transmission. In aspects, the transmit power of the PEI transmission may be the same for all beams, and the transmit power value may be provided in a single configuration for all beams.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">This disclosure relates generally to providing or participating in authorized shared access between two or more wireless devices in one or more wireless communications systems, also referred to as wireless communications networks. In various implementations, the techniques and apparatus may be used for wireless communication networks such as code division multiple access (CDMA) networks, time division multiple access (TDMA) networks, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) networks, orthogonal FDMA (OFDMA) networks, single-carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA) networks, LTE networks, GSM networks, 5<sup>th </sup>Generation (5G) or new radio (NR) networks (sometimes referred to as &#x201c;5G NR&#x201d; networks, systems, or devices), as well as other communications networks. As described herein, the terms &#x201c;networks&#x201d; and &#x201c;systems&#x201d; may be used interchangeably.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A CDMA network, for example, may implement a radio technology such as universal terrestrial radio access (UTRA), cdma2000, and the like. UTRA includes wideband-CDMA (W-CDMA) and low chip rate (LCR). CDMA2000 covers IS-2000, IS-95, and IS-856 standards.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">A TDMA network may, for example implement a radio technology such as Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM). The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) defines standards for the GSM EDGE (enhanced data rates for GSM evolution) radio access network (RAN), also denoted as GERAN. GERAN is the radio component of GSM/EDGE, together with the network that joins the base stations (for example, the Ater and Abis interfaces) and the base station controllers (A interfaces, etc.). The radio access network represents a component of a GSM network, through which phone calls and packet data are routed from and to the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and Internet to and from subscriber handsets, also known as user terminals or user equipments (UEs). A mobile phone operator's network may comprise one or more GERANs, which may be coupled with UTRANs in the case of a UMTS/GSM network. Additionally, an operator network may also include one or more LTE networks, or one or more other networks. The various different network types may use different radio access technologies (RATs) and RANs.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">An OFDMA network may implement a radio technology such as evolved UTRA (E-UTRA), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11, IEEE 802.16, IEEE 802.20, flash-OFDM and the like. UTRA, E-UTRA, and GSM are part of universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS). In particular, long term evolution (LTE) is a release of UMTS that uses E-UTRA. UTRA, E-UTRA, GSM, UMTS and LTE are described in documents provided from an organization named &#x201c;3rd Generation Partnership Project&#x201d; (3GPP), and cdma2000 is described in documents from an organization named &#x201c;3rd Generation Partnership Project 2&#x201d; (3GPP2). These various radio technologies and standards are known or are being developed. For example, the 3GPP is a collaboration between groups of telecommunications associations that aims to define a globally applicable third generation (3G) mobile phone specification. 3GPP LTE is a 3GPP project which was aimed at improving UMTS mobile phone standard. The 3GPP may define specifications for the next generation of mobile networks, mobile systems, and mobile devices. The present disclosure may describe certain aspects with reference to LTE, 4G, or 5G NR technologies; however, the description is not intended to be limited to a specific technology or application, and one or more aspects described with reference to one technology may be understood to be applicable to another technology. Additionally, one or more aspects of the present disclosure may be related to shared access to wireless spectrum between networks using different radio access technologies or radio air interfaces.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">5G networks contemplate diverse deployments, diverse spectrum, and diverse services and devices that may be implemented using an OFDM-based unified, air interface. To achieve these goals, further enhancements to LTE and LTE-A are considered in addition to development of the new radio technology for 5G NR networks. The 5G NR will be capable of scaling to provide coverage (1) to a massive Internet of things (IoTs) with an ultra-high density (e.g., &#x2dc;1 M nodes/km<sup>2</sup>), ultra-low complexity (e.g., &#x2dc;10 s of bits/sec), ultra-low energy (e.g., &#x2dc;10+ years of battery life), and deep coverage with the capability to reach challenging locations; (2) including mission-critical control with strong security to safeguard sensitive personal, financial, or classified information, ultra-high reliability (e.g., &#x2dc;99.9999% reliability), ultra-low latency (e.g., &#x2dc;1 millisecond (ms)), and users with wide ranges of mobility or lack thereof; and (3) with enhanced mobile broadband including extreme high capacity (e.g., &#x2dc;10 Tbps/km<sup>2</sup>), extreme data rates (e.g., multi-Gbps rate, 100+ Mbps user experienced rates), and deep awareness with advanced discovery and optimizations.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Devices, networks, and systems may be configured to communicate via one or more portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The electromagnetic spectrum is often subdivided, based on frequency or wavelength, into various classes, bands, channels, etc. In 5G NR two initial operating bands have been identified as frequency range designations FR1 (410 MHz-7.125 GHz) and FR2 (24.25 GHz-52.6 GHz). The frequencies between FR1 and FR2 are often referred to as mid-band frequencies. Although a portion of FR1 is greater than 6 GHz, FR1 is often referred to (interchangeably) as a &#x201c;sub-6 GHz&#x201d; band in various documents and articles. A similar nomenclature issue sometimes occurs with regard to FR2, which is often referred to (interchangeably) as a &#x201c;millimeter wave&#x201d; (mmWave) band in documents and articles, despite being different from the extremely high frequency (EHF) band (30 GHz-300 GHz) which is identified by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) as a &#x201c;mmWave&#x201d; band.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">With the above aspects in mind, unless specifically stated otherwise, it should be understood that the term &#x201c;sub-6 GHz&#x201d; or the like if used herein may broadly represent frequencies that may be less than 6 GHz, may be within FR1, or may include mid-band frequencies. Further, unless specifically stated otherwise, it should be understood that the term &#x201c;mmWave&#x201d; or the like if used herein may broadly represent frequencies that may include mid-band frequencies, may be within FR2, or may be within the EHF band.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">5G NR devices, networks, and systems may be implemented to use optimized OFDM-based waveform features. These features may include scalable numerology and transmission time intervals (TTIs); a common, flexible framework to efficiently multiplex services and features with a dynamic, low-latency time division duplex (TDD) design or frequency division duplex (FDD) design; and advanced wireless technologies, such as massive multiple input, multiple output (MIMO), robust mmWave transmissions, advanced channel coding, and device-centric mobility. Scalability of the numerology in 5G NR, with scaling of subcarrier spacing, may efficiently address operating diverse services across diverse spectrum and diverse deployments. For example, in various outdoor and macro coverage deployments of less than 3 GHz FDD or TDD implementations, subcarrier spacing may occur with 15 kHz, for example over 1, 5, 10, 20 MHz, and the like bandwidth. For other various outdoor and small cell coverage deployments of TDD greater than 3 GHz, subcarrier spacing may occur with 30 kHz over 80/100 MHz bandwidth. For other various indoor wideband implementations, using a TDD over the unlicensed portion of the 5 GHz band, the subcarrier spacing may occur with 60 kHz over a 160 MHz bandwidth. Finally, for various deployments transmitting with mmWave components at a TDD of 28 GHz, subcarrier spacing may occur with 120 kHz over a 500 MHz bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The scalable numerology of 5G NR facilitates scalable TTI for diverse latency and quality of service (QoS) requirements. For example, shorter TTI may be used for low latency and high reliability, while longer TTI may be used for higher spectral efficiency. The efficient multiplexing of long and short TTIs to allow transmissions to start on symbol boundaries. 5G NR also contemplates a self-contained integrated subframe design with uplink or downlink scheduling information, data, and acknowledgement in the same subframe. The self-contained integrated subframe supports communications in unlicensed or contention-based shared spectrum, adaptive uplink or downlink that may be flexibly configured on a per-cell basis to dynamically switch between uplink and downlink to meet the current traffic needs.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">For clarity, certain aspects of the apparatus and techniques may be described below with reference to example 5G NR implementations or in a 5G-centric way, and 5G terminology may be used as illustrative examples in portions of the description below; however, the description is not intended to be limited to 5G applications.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Moreover, it should be understood that, in operation, wireless communication networks adapted according to the concepts herein may operate with any combination of licensed or unlicensed spectrum depending on loading and availability.

A base station may be a station that communicates with the UEs and may also be referred to as an evolved node B (eNB), a next generation eNB (gNB), an access point, and the like. Each base station <b>105</b> may provide communication coverage for a particular geographic area. In 3GPP, the term &#x201c;cell&#x201d; may refer to this particular geographic coverage area of a base station or a base station subsystem serving the coverage area, depending on the context in which the term is used. In implementations of wireless network <b>100</b> herein, base stations <b>105</b> may be associated with a same operator or different operators (e.g., wireless network <b>100</b> may include a plurality of operator wireless networks). Additionally, in implementations of wireless network <b>100</b> herein, base station <b>105</b> may provide wireless communications using one or more of the same frequencies (e.g., one or more frequency bands in licensed spectrum, unlicensed spectrum, or a combination thereof) as a neighboring cell.

A macro cell generally covers a relatively large geographic area (e.g., several kilometers in radius) and may allow unrestricted access by UEs with service subscriptions with the network provider. A small cell, such as a pico cell, would generally cover a relatively smaller geographic area and may allow unrestricted access by UEs with service subscriptions with the network provider. A small cell, such as a femto cell, would also generally cover a relatively small geographic area (e.g., a home) and, in addition to unrestricted access, may also provide restricted access by UEs having an association with the femto cell (e.g., UEs in a closed subscriber group (CSG), UEs for users in the home, and the like). A base station for a macro cell may be referred to as a macro base station. A base station for a small cell may be referred to as a small cell base station, a pico base station, a femto base station or a home base station.

In an unlicensed frequency portion of the shared radio frequency spectrum band, UEs <b>115</b> or base stations <b>105</b> may traditionally perform a medium-sensing procedure to contend for access to the frequency spectrum. For example, UE <b>115</b> or base station <b>105</b> may perform a listen-before-talk or listen-before-transmitting (LBT) procedure such as a clear channel assessment (CCA) prior to communicating in order to determine whether the shared channel is available. In some implementations, a CCA may include an energy detection procedure to determine whether there are any other active transmissions. For example, a device may infer that a change in a received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of a power meter indicates that a channel is occupied. Specifically, signal power that is concentrated in a certain bandwidth and exceeds a predetermined noise floor may indicate another wireless transmitter. A CCA also may include detection of specific sequences that indicate use of the channel. For example, another device may transmit a specific preamble prior to transmitting a data sequence. In some cases, an LBT procedure may include a wireless node adjusting its own backoff window based on the amount of energy detected on a channel or the acknowledge/negative-acknowledge (ACK/NACK) feedback for its own transmitted packets as a proxy for collisions.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Current implementations of wireless communication systems put a significant emphasis on power saving performance of a device (e.g., a UE) in order to provide an adequate battery life that enhances the user experience. Various approaches have been implemented and proposed for improving power savings. One particular approach for improving power savings involves configuring a UE with various power modes or states. The various power modes or states may include an active mode, an inactive mode, an idle mode, etc. In the active mode (also referred to herein as the awake state), the UE may be fully powered on to transmit to and received from a base station (and/or other UEs). In the inactive and idle mode (also referred to herein as sleep states), the UE may be configured to turn-off various components (e.g., some radio transceivers, etc.) in order to conserve battery life. In a sleep state, the UE may still receive (and/or transmit) some control signals that may be used to control when the UE may be awaken (e.g., transitioned in to the awake state to process received signals). In some cases, the UE may be configured to transition from a sleep state to the awake state periodically to determine whether the UE is being paged during periodic paging occasions. After the paging occasion, the UE may transition back a sleep state. Although the reduced-power modes (e.g., the sleep states) provide power savings to the UE, the periodic transitions between the awake state and the sleep state reduce the power savings that may be obtained by the usage of the different power modes.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">One approach that has been proposed to improve the power savings performance of wireless communication devices in reduced-power modes (e.g., sleep state) includes a proposal to reduce unnecessary paging and/or paging receptions of the UE. In one solution, a paging early indication (PEI) may be transmitted before a paging occasion from a base station to a UE to indicate to the UE whether the UE is being paged. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a configuration for transmitting a PEI from a base station to a UE. As shown, UE <b>115</b> may be configured to receive a PEI <b>410</b> before paging occasion <b>430</b>. In typical implementations (e.g., in implementations configured without PEI techniques), UE <b>115</b> may typically wake up (e.g., transition from a sleep state to the awake state) at the start of period <b>450</b>, before paging occasion <b>430</b>, in order to determine whether UE <b>115</b> is being paged during paging occasion <b>430</b> or not. In one example of typical operations, base station <b>105</b> may page UE <b>115</b> during paging occasion <b>430</b> and may transmit a PDCCH and a PDSCH during the paging occasion. In this case, UE <b>115</b> may decode the PDCCH (which may not include an identity of UE <b>115</b>) and the PDSCH (which may include an identify of UE <b>115</b>) during paging occasion <b>430</b>. In another example of typical operations, base station <b>105</b> may not page UE <b>115</b> during paging occasion <b>430</b> and may either not transmit a PDCCH or a PDSCH during paging occasion <b>430</b> or may transmit a PDCCH/PDSCH that is not intended for UE <b>115</b> (e.g., in implementations where a paging PDSCH is transmitted to a group of UEs that includes UE <b>115</b>). In this case, UE <b>115</b> may still wake up during period <b>450</b>, and may attempt to decode the PDCCH. The attempt to decode the PDCCH may yield a result indicating that no PDCCH was transmitted to UE <b>115</b>, in which case UE <b>115</b> may determine that it is not being paged, or a result indicating that PDCCH has been received. In the latter case, UE <b>115</b> may still not be able to determine whether UE <b>115</b> has been paged or not because the PDCCH may not include an indication that UE <b>115</b> is being paged. As such, in the latter case, UE <b>115</b> may proceed to decode the PDSCH, which may include an indication (e.g., identity of UE <b>115</b>) as to whether UE <b>115</b> is being paged or not. As will be appreciated, in these typical implementations, UE <b>115</b> wakes up and process the PDCCH/PDSCH transmission even when it is not being paged, thereby increasing power consumption.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">PEI <b>410</b> provides an improvement of the power savings performance of UE <b>115</b> in several ways. In one way, receiving PEI <b>410</b> before paging occasion <b>430</b> may allow UE <b>115</b> to determine whether UE <b>115</b> is being paged during paging occasion <b>430</b> or not. If PEI <b>410</b> indicates that UE <b>115</b> is being paged during paging occasion <b>430</b>, UE <b>115</b> may wake up (or may remain awaken as it may have awakened to receive the PEI) to process the PDCCH/PDSCH transmissions during paging occasion <b>430</b>. However, if PEI <b>410</b> indicates that UE <b>115</b> is not being paged during paging occasion <b>430</b>, UE <b>115</b> may remain or transition back to a sleep state, instead or processing transmissions during the paging occasion <b>430</b>, thereby resulting a power savings.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The above is also the case where the group to which UE <b>115</b> belongs is being paged, even though UE <b>115</b> is not being paged. In this case, PEI <b>410</b> may include an indication that the subgroup to which UE <b>115</b> belongs is being paged or not, allowing UE <b>115</b> to determine whether to process transmissions during paging occasion <b>430</b> or not. For example, base station <b>105</b> may be configured with group paging PDSCH transmissions. In this case, base station <b>105</b> may be configured to transmit a paging PDSCH to a group of UEs, and every UE in the group decodes the PDSCH even if the PDSCH is intended for one UE. In this example, base station <b>105</b> may transmit the paging PDSCH to the group of UEs, which may include UE <b>115</b>, and PEI <b>410</b> may include an indication of whether a subgroup (of the group of UEs associated with the paging occasion) to which UE <b>115</b> is being paged. In this case, if PEI <b>410</b> indicates that UE <b>115</b>'s subgroup is being paged in the paging PDSCH, UE <b>115</b> may wake up (or may remain awaken as it may have awakened to receive the PEI) to process the PDCCH/PDSCH transmissions during paging occasion <b>430</b>. However, if PEI <b>410</b> indicates that UE <b>115</b>'s subgroup is not being paged in the paging PDSCH, UE <b>115</b> may remain in or transition back to a sleep state, instead or processing transmissions during the paging occasion <b>430</b>, thereby resulting a power savings.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In another example, usage of PEI <b>410</b> may provide further power savings when PEI <b>410</b> is defined based on narrowband sequences. In these cases, UE <b>115</b> may determine the narrowband over which PEI <b>410</b> is defined and, instead of waking up the entire baseband for processing PEI <b>410</b>, UE <b>115</b> may wake up only the appropriate narrowband. This may result in power savings as otherwise, UE <b>115</b> may wake up the entire baseband to process a PDSCH/PDSCH transmission. By merely waking up a portion of the baseband to determine if UE <b>115</b> is being paged, UE <b>115</b> may obtain power savings.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Usage of PEI <b>410</b> may provide further power savings by enabling UE <b>115</b> to forego processing of synchronization signal block (SSB) transmissions. Typically, SSB transmission may be used by a UE to access to a base station for processing transmissions, such as transmissions during a paging occasion, For example, UE <b>115</b> may use SSB transmission <b>420</b><i>a </i>and/or <b>420</b><i>b </i>to configure various parameters for decoding transmissions during paging occasion <b>430</b>. In some cases, the parameters may include updating a tracking loop. In this case, however, UE <b>115</b> may use the PEI to determine whether to process SSB transmissions <b>420</b><i>a </i>and/or <b>420</b><i>b </i>or not. For example, UE <b>115</b> may determine to process SSB transmissions <b>420</b><i>a </i>and/or <b>420</b><i>b </i>when PEI <b>410</b> indicates that UE <b>115</b> is being paged during paging occasion <b>430</b>, in order to configured UE <b>115</b> for processing of the transmissions. On the other hand, UE <b>115</b> may determine to forego processing SSB transmissions <b>420</b><i>a </i>and/or <b>420</b><i>b </i>when PEI <b>410</b> indicates that UE <b>115</b> is not being paged during paging occasion <b>430</b>, and may remain in or transition back to a sleep state, instead or processing the SSB transmissions during the paging occasion <b>430</b>, thereby resulting a power savings.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">However, despite the definite power savings potentials provided by the use of a PEI, there may be further power savings improvements that may be obtained by a wireless communication device based on a knowledge of the transmit power associated with the PEI. Currently, there is no mechanism to determine the transmit power of a PEI. It is noted that, as used herein, the transmit power of a PEI transmission may also refer to the signal strength of the PEI transmission, and/or an energy per resource element (EPRE) of the PEI transmission.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Various aspects of the present disclosure are directed to systems and methods that support mechanisms for determining a transmit power of a PEI transmission. In particular, in aspects of the present disclosure, a UE may be configured to receive a PEI from a base station indicating whether the UE is being paged during a paging occasion. The UE may be configured to determine a transmit power of the PEI transmission. In aspects, the UE may determine the transmit power of the PEI transmission based on a configuration of the PEI provided to the UE. In aspects, the determined transmit power of the PEI transmission may be an absolute power value or may be a power offset value. The power offset value may be a power offset with respect to a transmission of another signal or channel.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some aspects, the transmit power of the PEI transmission may be based on whether the PEI transmission is a beamformed transmission. In these aspects, the transmit power of the PEI transmission may be the same for all beams, and the transmit power value may be provided in a single configuration for all beams.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">It is noted that in some aspects, a PEI may be one of various power savings mechanisms using a pre-wakeup signal. Another power saving mechanism may include usage of a wake up signal (WUS), such as in previous implementations of wireless communication systems. A WUS, unlike the PEI of aspects of the present disclosure, is not beamformed. In PEI implementation, both the PEI transmission and the paging message (e.g., the PDCCH and/or PDSCH) may be beamformed. In that case, a quasi-colocation (QCL) of the beam transmission may be determined when receiving the PEI transmission. However, this is not the case with WUS transmissions. In some cases, systems implementing a WUS may rely on a common reference signal (CRS) as a power reference. For example, these systems may use the power of the CRS transmission as a power reference for power measurement determinations. However, systems implementing PEI in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure, which in some cases do not implement a CRS, may use the power of SSB transmissions as a power reference.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In aspects, knowing a transmit power of a PEI transmission may provide advantages for a UE. For example, a UE may use the PEI transmission for performing RRM measurements for mobility operations, and/or to perform automatic gain control (AGC) updates. In both cases, the UE may use a smaller number of SSBs for RRM measurement and/or tracking loop updates, which may provide further power savings. However, in order to perform these operations, the UE requires knowledge on the power relationship between the PEI and other channels or signals that the UE receives during the reduced-power modes. As noted above, techniques disclosed herein provide a mechanism for the UE to determine a transmit power of the PEI transmission, which may allow the UE to determine the power relationship between the PEI transmission and other channels or signals that the UE receives during the reduced-power states.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example wireless communications system <b>300</b> that supports mechanisms for determining a transmit power of a PEI transmission in a wireless communication system according to one or more aspects of the present disclosure.
