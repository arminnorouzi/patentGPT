C. using heat and a catalyst. until 100% anisotropy appears, and highly purified at a high level.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">By such a manufacturing method, finally, mesophase pitch is manufactured at a low manufacturing yield of about 5% compared to a raw material in the case of a coal-based material and 8 to 10% compared to a raw material in the case of a petroleum-based material.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, as a typical manufacturing technology for mesophase pitch, there are three types as follows.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">First, a nitrogen fractionation method developed by UCC (Union Carbide Corp.) in the U.S. is used to purify the raw material at a high level in order to prevent strength deterioration due to catalytic gasification during a high-temperature heat treatment process to manufacture the mesophase pitch by thermal polymerization, but failed in mass production due to a decrease in yield.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Second, although it was successful that a high-purity mesophase pitch was produced with a relatively high yield by using pure naphthalene as a raw material and volatile fluorine (HF/BF<sub>3</sub>) as a catalyst, an AR mesophase pitch proposed by Mitsubishi Gas chemical in Japan was impossible in low-price production and abandoned in commercialization due to a problem of a catalyst and a reactor that had to maintain 100% recycling of the manufacturing catalyst.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Third, in the 1990s, Professor Edie of Clemson University in the United States also succeeded in manufacturing mesophase pitch with a high yield compared to raw materials by supercritical fluid extraction using toluene of FCC-DO, but failed in the commercialization of the technology due to a low spinning problem of the manufactured mesophase pitch.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As such, in the related art, it was necessary to purify impurities with high purity to increase spinnability for manufacturing fibers, and as a result, due to the extremely low yield of less than 10% compared to the raw material and the resulting price problem, it was not successful in mass production, such as failing to be applied to the early industry.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">As such, mesophase pitch for manufacturing high value-added carbon materials such as pitch-based carbon fibers or a graphite anode has always a trade-off problem between maintaining high spinnability and an extremely low yield due to excessive refinement for maintaining the high spinnability. Accordingly, the pitch-based carbon fibers have been developed and commercialized with a focus on extremely expensive product groups.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As pointed out, a clear theoretically concept of mesophase pitch has not been established previously. However the present applicants proposed an innovative theory of classifying a mesophase pitch as a homogeneous mixture between a mesogen component and a solvent component that expresses liquid crystalline properties by dissolving the mesogen component.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Based on the new theoretical concept described above, the present applicants developed a method of manufacturing a high yield mesophase pitch showing liquid crystalline characteristics as the mesogen and isotropic components, a solvent component, are dissolved to each other, and a high yield mesophase pitch manufactured therefrom.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">At this time, the present applicants obtained a processing technique capable of securing high economic efficiency by remarkably increasing a manufacturing yield of mesophase pitch with high spinnability while maintaining whole anisotropy to 10 to 40 from 4 to 8% in the background art, by defining soluble mesophase pitch as a mixture of a lyotropic liquid crystalline material stacked by forming a liquid crystal phase and a solvent material, and completed the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0000">At this time, the present applicant defined the soluble mesophase pitch as a mixture of a lyotropic liquid crystalline material and a solvent material that are stacked by forming a liquid crystal phase. Through the present invention, the applicant successfully increased the pitch yield from 4 to 8% to 10 to 40% while maintaining high spinnability and whole anisotropy, thereby completing an integrated process technology that can secure high economic feasibility compared to existing technologies.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0015">An objective of the present disclosure is to provide a method for manufacturing a high yield mesophase pitch capable of obtaining high economic efficiency by increasing the production yield of a

techniques that had a problem in an extremely low yield and low economic efficiency by performing excessive hydrogenation and removal of impurities, in order to maintain high spinnability of a fiber
