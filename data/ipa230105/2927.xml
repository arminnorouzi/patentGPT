As the CZT is cooled to room temperature, the excess Te forms precipitates from &#x3c;1 to &#x2dc;25 &#x3bc;m in size. Many attempts have been made to eliminate these precipitates, yet they remain a problem. As the CZT is cooled to room temperature dislocation clusters, Te precipitates, and surface crater or void defects in epilayers grown on the substrates can occur. The voids can short p-n junctions and hence blind pixels in Focal Plane Arrays (FPAs).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The Te precipitates also give rise to high hole concentrations in Mercury Cadmium Telluride (HgCdTe) (or &#x201c;MCT&#x201d;) layers grown by liquid phase epitaxy (LPE). When nonstoichiometric CdZnTe is cooled rapidly from high temperature, the grown crystals include precipitates. In order to reduce the Te precipitates, wafer annealing of CdZnTe containing Te precipitates, over the temperature range 500-900&#xb0; C., using Cd/Zn pressures appropriate to stoichiometry, still led to an increase in dislocation density and rocking-curve width in X-Ray diffraction characterization. Under typical melt-growth conditions, CZT is grown from a melt that is slightly tellurium rich, thus leading to excess Te at growth temperatures and CZT that is supersaturated with tellurium upon cooldown. Tellurium-rich, second-phase particles form under the action of this unfavorable thermodynamic condition.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">What is still puzzling, however, is the very large size of these particles in CZT, seemingly too large to be explained by simple solid-state nucleation growth mechanisms. It is postulated that such Te precipitates may never be eliminated owing to their thermodynamic origin.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Different post-growth annealing treatments have been proposed to eliminate Te inclusions. Thermal treatments under Cd-pressure, Te-pressure, or evaporating CdZn alloy powders were proposed. Two-step annealing (the first in Cd vapors, the second in Te-vapors) demonstrated to be effective in order to preserve the material high resistivity. During this kind of annealing, when the sample experienced a temperature gradient during the heat treatment, it was shown that Te inclusions thermo-migrate towards the high temperature region. This happens due to the increasing solubility of CdZnTe in liquid Te with temperature. However, in spite of the efforts, the ideal post-growth thermal treatment, capable of eliminating Te inclusions, keeping electrical resistivity very high, and at the same time improving substrate quality is still missing. This is also because, during the heat treatment, impurities segregated inside Te inclusions are dissolved in the crystal matrix and, in general, a different defect equilibrium is obtained, with strong consequences on material resistivity and carrier traps. An alternative approach reported in literature to eliminate Te inclusions was instead based on the thermo-migration of Te impurities under the presence of a pulsed laser source.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">At the employed wavelength (10.2 &#x3bc;m from a CO<sub>2 </sub>laser source) not only CdZnTe crystals are transparent but also Te inclusion absorption is low. For these reasons the sample was heated at 300&#xb0; C. Laser-induced thermo-migration was observed in that case, but the movement of Te inclusions was low (3 &#x3bc;m/h at most). Later, it has been shown that by means of a pulsed laser at 1.064 &#x3bc;m it is instead possible to eliminate Te inclusions at room temperature, avoiding high temperature processes that can modify the defect equilibrium in CdZnTe crystals. The mechanism is driven by the strong absorption of the light by tellurium inclusions. The amount of energy transferred to the system is compatible with the proposed thermo-diffusion mechanism. Even if it was not possible to obtain thermo-diffusion of largest inclusions (over 10 &#x3bc;m in diameter), calculations however showed that by using laser pulses of longer duration (100 ns) it is possible to melt and make diffuse also large tellurium inclusions without damaging the sample surface.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An apparatus and method are disclosed to remove the Te precipitates and Te inclusions by localized in-situ annealing by an appropriate laser mounted on the CZT growth furnace.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A general-purpose crystal growth furnace can be used for growth of CdZnTe crystals. This furnace is based on an apparatus such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,562,134, herein incorporated by reference. A multizone heating scheme is used. The temperature profile is precisely varied by controlling each heater individually. Neither a crucible nor the furnace move during crystal growth.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The laser is mounted on to the furnace and by radiating a beam across the growing crystal at or near the interface between the grown crystal portion and a melt portion of the crystal material will help melting any Te precipitates or inclusions formed in the crystal during growth, by localized annealing. A mechanism is provided, such as a linear positioning mechanism, to raise the laser vertically as the crystal is grown, to radiate the crystal at or near the rising interface between the formed crystal and the crystal melt material. The mechanism can be a precise positioning device such as a piezo drive, a stepper motor, a linear actuator, a motorized screw drive, or the like.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The Te precipitates and Te inclusions are locally heated at the crystal-melt interface or close to crystal-melt interface to induce thermo-migration of Te impurities. Since this is done in-situ and close to the crystal-melt interface during the growth of CZT crystal, the defects left behind by migration of Te impurities due to localized laser annealing can be healed, thus improving the crystal quality of the grown CZT crystal and improving the overall CZT crystal growth yield. Additionally, there may be unintended nucleation at the crucible-melt interface during growth. Also, interaction between the growth interface and the ampoule wall may give rise to multiple grains in the CZT crystals, thus lowering the yield.
