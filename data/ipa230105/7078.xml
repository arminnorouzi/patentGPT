Various online network systems (such as a transaction service network system) may operate as a group of interrelated legal entities across multiple jurisdictions. For example, PayPal&#xae; or another online service network may operate globally with online systems (such as server systems) localized in or spread across different jurisdictions. A jurisdiction, as used herein, is a geographically-defined area that has a set of laws or regulations that apply to an online system operating in the geographical area. A jurisdiction may include, for example, a legal or regulatory jurisdiction (such as an individual country or a group of countries cooperating according to a treaty or other agreement) or a business jurisdiction (such as an individual business or a group of businesses). An online system (e.g., a payment processing system, a transaction processing system, a customer service system, etc.) may be located or licensed to operate in a jurisdiction. Any operations conducted by the online system may thus be subject to the set of laws or regulations for the jurisdiction as the online system is considered to be a legal entity that is operating within the jurisdiction.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In various embodiments, an online system that is localized in a jurisdiction of an online network system may be considered to be in or part of a geographic partition of the system. As used herein, a &#x201c;geographic partition&#x201d; or &#x201c;geo-partition&#x201d; is a geographically-defined subdivision of an online network system. For instance, a geo-partition may be a jurisdiction that is geographically-defined within an online network system. As such, an online network system may operate a group of interrelated geo-partitions to provide service functionality in multiple jurisdictions. A geo-partition, as described herein, may include an online system (e.g., legal entity) that operates within the geographically-defined subdivision or jurisdiction as part of the online network system. In some embodiments, online systems are located in different partitions that may or may not be defined geographically. As used herein, a &#x201c;partition&#x201d; refers to a subdivision of an online system that operates independently from another subdivision of the online system (e.g., the subdivisions operate as separate legal entities). Thus, partitioned online systems may be online systems that are located in different jurisdictions and are subject to different laws or regulations that are not necessarily geographically defined. For instance, some embodiments may be contemplated where partitioned systems are created for security reasons (e.g., to prevent unwanted sharing of data between partitioned systems).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In online network systems operating with geo-partitioned online systems, a geo-partitioned online system may provide operational functionality for users within the jurisdiction that corresponds to the geo-partition. When an operation (such as a transaction) involves only users within a geo-partition (e.g., the buyer and seller of a product or service are both located in the jurisdiction), the online system is capable of processing the operation using data available locally within the geo-partition or jurisdiction. Thus, the online system may complete the operation according to the laws or regulations for the local jurisdiction without any need for communication with other jurisdictions or other geo-partitions of the online network system.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Online network systems such as PayPal&#xae; may, however, also provide functionality for conducting operations (e.g., transactions or customer service operations) across or between geo-partitions (e.g., jurisdictions). Online network systems with operational functionality across geo-partitions allow an online system operating in one geo-partition to conduct and complete an operation that involves another online system in another geo-partition. For example, a first user accessing an online network system through a first online system in a first geo-partition may be able to conduct a transaction that involves a second user accessing the online network system through a second online system in a second geo-partition. In various embodiments, such transactions may be considered cross-partition operations. As used herein, a &#x201c;cross-partition operation&#x201d; refers to an operation that takes place between two separate geo-partitions or jurisdictions for the sharing of data or information from one geo-partition to another geo-partition or for one geo-partition to initiate activities or behaviors in another geo-partition. In some embodiments, cross-partition operations may involve transactions referred to as &#x201c;cross-geo-transactions&#x201d;. As used herein, a &#x201c;cross-geo transaction&#x201d; refers to a transaction that takes place between two separate geo-partitions or jurisdictions.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The laws or regulations for each geo-partition (e.g., jurisdiction) may, however, as described above, apply locally to operations being conducted in each geo-partition regardless of the geo-partitions involved in the operation. As such, while the first online system and the second online system may be associated with the same online network system (e.g., PayPal&#xae;), the operations conducted by each online system are subject to the laws or regulations of the geo-partition in which the online system is operating. For instance, operations such as data handling (e.g., data storage and retrieval) or data processing (e.g., transaction processing) may be subject to the laws or regulations of the geo-partition in which the operations are being conducted.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In order to complete an operation across geo-partitions, however, data (such as user data) may need to be shared or transferred between the online systems. For example, the first user accessing the online network system through the first online system in the first geo-partition may be attempting to purchase an item from the second user accessing the online network system through the second online system in the second geo-partition. To complete the transaction and allow the first user to purchase the item, the second online system may need data for the first user from the first online system. The data needed may include, for example, name, shipping address information, contact information, or other information needed to complete the transaction. Thus, data for the first user needs to be transmitted from the first online system to the second online system in order for the second online system to be able to complete the transaction.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In such instances, however, data is being shared across geo-partitions (e.g., jurisdictions) that may have different laws or regulations. The present inventors have realized that restrictions may need to be placed on the data that is shareable between geo-partitions. For example, restrictions may be placed on the data that is shareable between geo-partitions to ensure that the local laws or regulations are complied with in each geo-partition and that data processed or stored in one geo-partition is not subject to the laws or regulations of another geo-partition. As such, an operation or transaction may be completed without either online system or the online network system having to determine which laws or regulations to apply to the operation or transaction because any operations that need to comply with a geo-partition's local laws or regulations are completed by the online system in the geo-partition. For example, the first user (buyer) may access the first online system in the first geo-partition to purchase the product and the buyer's portion of the transaction is completed in the first geo-partition while the second user (seller) accesses the second online system in the second geo-partition to complete the purchase with processing of the seller's portion of the transaction is completed in the second geo-partition.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Further, restricting the data shareable between geo-partitions may prevent sensitive information (such as financial instrument information or privacy information) from being shared across geo-partitions. For instance, in the above buyer/seller example, the buyer's financial instrument information is only processed within the first geo-partition and none of the buyer's financial instrument information is shared with the second geo-partition. Preventing sensitive instrument information from being shared across geo-partitions may help prevent the sharing of data that can be used for unauthorized transactions. Additionally, an online network system can maintain or enhance its security and privacy standards by restricting the information shared. Yet further, data privacy laws and/or data-localization regulations in individual geo-partitions may be complied with by restricting the information shared across geo-partitions.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The present disclosure contemplates various techniques for the transferring and sharing of data between online systems in different geo-partitions (e.g., different jurisdictions) while placing restrictions on the data that is shareable between the online systems. Various embodiments disclosed describe that a contract (e.g., an authorization) can be established between online systems in different geo-partitions. A &#x201c;contract&#x201d; or &#x201c;authorization&#x201d; may refer to an agreement or other communication between the online systems in different geo-partitions that defines the extent of data sharing allowed between the online systems. For instance, the contract may define restrictions on the data that can be shared between the online systems by defining data types that should not be shared. In some embodiments, a contract is established between applications or application programming interfaces (&#x201c;APIs&#x201d;) located on the online systems in the different geo-partitions. In various embodiments, the contract is established by each online system in each geo-partition associated with the contract determining what data the geo-partition will share with the other. Thus, in such instances, each geo-partition determines the data that the geo-partition shares in compliance with its local laws or regulations.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Various embodiments disclosed further describe the implementation of &#x201c;auxiliary accounts&#x201d; for user accounts to allow the sharing of user data according to the contract between online systems in different geo-partitions. As used herein, an &#x201c;auxiliary account&#x201d; refers to an account generated in a particular geo-partition where the account is generated from a subset of data shared with the particular geo-partition from the user's home geo-partition. In some embodiments, the shared subset of data, and hence the auxiliary account, includes a minimum representation of the user from the user's home geo-partition that is needed to process a service or transaction in the particular geo-partition generating the auxiliary account. As described herein, the user's &#x201c;home&#x201d; geo-partition is the geo-partition in which the data for user's main or primary account is stored. For example, a home geo-partition may be the geo-partition with the online system that stores data for the user's main or primary account. The subset of data may be generated from data in the user's main or primary account.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">One embodiment described herein has three broad components: 1) receiving, at a first computer system in a first geo-partition (e.g., a first jurisdiction), account information for a second user from a second computer system of a second geo-partition (e.g., a second jurisdiction) where the account information for the second user includes a subset of data for the second user that is authorized to be passed from the second geo-partition to the first geo-partition, 2) generating, by the first computer system, an auxiliary account for the second user within the first geo-partition where the auxiliary account includes the received subset of data for the second user and at least one unique identifier generated in the first geo-partition, and 3) facilitating the cross-partition operation (e.g., cross-geo transaction) between the first geographic partition and the second geographic partition based on the subset of data for the second user and the at least one identifier for the auxiliary account. In certain embodiments, the subset of data received by the first computer system includes a global identifier for the second user that is unique within a set of geo-partitions of the network. As used herein, the term &#x201c;global identifier&#x201d; refers to an identifier for a user that is unique within a set geo-partitions of an online network system. The global identifier, as described herein, may be created in a user's home geo-partition during creation of the user's account in the home-geo-partition. The global identifier may be used to identify and distinguish the user across all geo-partitions of an online system. In some embodiments, the global identifier is an email address for the user. In various embodiments, the first computer system (e.g., the initiator of the request) may complete the cross-partition operation after receiving the subset of data for the second user and generating the auxiliary account information. Additionally, the second computer system may store the auxiliary account information for the second user for subsequent transactions involving the second user that are processed within the first geo-partition. It should be noted, however, that, as described below, the auxiliary account information for the second user may be updated in the instance of another cross-partition operation.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In embodiments described herein, the subset of data for the second user that is shared with the first geo-partition is based on the allowances or restrictions in the contract established between the online systems in the different geo-partitions. The type of information placed in the auxiliary account may depend on what type of user for which the information is being generated. For instance, in a transaction, a user may be a buyer or seller. Examples of information in the auxiliary account for a buyer includes, but is not limited to, name, shipping address, contact information (such as phone number or email address), country code, and a descriptor of the buyer (such as a tier of the buyer or a verification status of the buyer). Examples of information that may be restricted (e.g., excluded) from the auxiliary account for a buyer includes, but is not limited to, home address, date of birth, tax identifier, and financial instruments (such as credit card or bank account information). Examples of information in the auxiliary account for a seller includes, but is not limited to, business name, address, phone number, business industry, country code, and a descriptor of the seller (such as a tier of the seller). Examples of information that may be restricted (e.g., excluded) from the auxiliary account for a seller includes, but is not limited to, login credentials, verification documents, compliance status, tax rates, notification settings, product subscriptions, and owner information.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In short, it can be recognized that benefits exist in restricting the information that is shareable across geo-partitions. An online system in a geo-partition (such as part of a transaction service network system) may generate an auxiliary account from information received from another online system in a different geo-partition where the information received is restricted by a contract or authorization between the online systems. Limiting the information shared between geo-partitions may prevent unwanted sharing of sensitive information for a user (such as financial instrument or privacy data). Additionally, limiting the information shared between two geo-partitions may allow a cross-geo transaction to be processed as two separate transactions within each user's home geo-partition. Each user's home geo-partition may substantially independently fulfill (e.g., process) the transaction for its respective user (e.g., handling payment processing, handling sensitive user information, etc.). In such instances, the information shared across the geo-partitions may be limited to information needed to facilitate (e.g., complete) the cross-geo transaction between the users (e.g., shipping information for a buyer), thus ensuring user sensitive information (e.g., financial instrument information) is kept within a particular user's home geo-partition. Substantially separating the transactions may ensure that laws or regulations for individual geo-partitions are complied with by handling transaction processing largely within a user's home geo-partition.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of an online network system, according to some embodiments. As used herein, the term &#x201c;online network system&#x201d; refers to any system that implements a service over a network in which two or more parties use computer systems to exchange information. Accordingly, a &#x201c;service&#x201d; according to this disclosure may include a transaction service, a payment service (e.g., PayPal&#xae;), a transportation service, a customer service operation, a media network, a social network, a file transfer service, an online retailer, a dating site, and so on. Note that generally, this disclosure may include various examples and discussion of techniques and structures within the context of an &#x201c;online network system.&#x201d; Note that all these examples, techniques, and structures are generally applicable to any computer-based system that has a flow of information between different entities. For example, online network system <b>100</b> may include any number of online systems that communicate with each other and exchange information for transactions or services between the online systems. However, the term online network system is used for ease of understanding in various portions of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In various embodiments, online network system <b>100</b> includes first server system <b>110</b> and second server system <b>120</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, first server system <b>110</b> and second server system <b>120</b> are online systems (e.g., computer systems) associated with online network system <b>100</b>. First server system <b>110</b> and second server system <b>120</b> may be, for example, online servers or other online computer systems associated with online network system <b>100</b>. In various embodiments, first server system <b>110</b> and second server system <b>120</b> are partitioned server systems. For example, as described above, first server system <b>110</b> and second server system <b>120</b> may be online systems operating in different jurisdictions. As first server system <b>110</b> and second server system <b>120</b> operate in different jurisdictions, in some embodiments, the server systems may operate independently as separate legal entities.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In certain embodiments, first server system <b>110</b> and second server system <b>120</b> are geo-partitioned server systems in online network system <b>100</b>. For instance, in the illustrated embodiment, first server system <b>110</b> operates or is located in first geo-partition <b>130</b> and second server system <b>120</b> operates or is located in second geo-partition <b>140</b>. First geo-partition <b>130</b> and second geo-partition <b>140</b> may be, for example, separate jurisdictions or subdivisions of online network system <b>100</b> that are geographically-defined. Thus, first server system <b>110</b> may provide service functionality associated with online network system <b>100</b> in first geo-partition <b>130</b> and second server system <b>120</b> may provide service functionality associated with online network system <b>100</b> in second geo-partition <b>140</b>. It should be noted, however, the illustrated embodiment is provided merely as one non-limiting example and, in other embodiments, an online network system may operate server systems in additional, fewer, or different geo-partitions than those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In various embodiments, online network system <b>100</b> may provide a service operation (e.g., a transaction service or customer service operation) that is utilized by users located in many different geographic areas (e.g., geo-partitions). For example, online network system <b>100</b> may use server systems to provide one or more service operations to users that are located across various geo-partitions. Accordingly, online network system <b>100</b> may be said to have a global user base. Various data privacy and data-localization regulations (described above), however, may be implemented that require online network system <b>100</b> to store a user's data within a geographic area (e.g., geo-partition) in which the user resides or is operating. These requirements may create the need to split online network system <b>100</b> into multiple partitions (e.g., first server system <b>110</b> in first geo-partition <b>130</b> and second server system <b>120</b> in second geo-partition <b>140</b>) working together. In this situation, the individual partitions may only store data for a subset of the user base of online network system <b>100</b> (e.g., data for specific customers is only stored in the customers' home partition or geo-partition).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In various embodiments, a partition (e.g., first geo-partition <b>130</b> or second geo-partition <b>140</b>) includes infrastructure to operate as an individual entity. For example, first geo-partition <b>130</b> may include infrastructure to operate as a datacenter such as, but not limited to, computer processors, storage hardware, network hardware, and security hardware. Other geo-partitions may have similar infrastructure to allow the different geo-partitions to operate individually and separately. Each set of infrastructure for each geo-partition may thus be dedicated to the customers for the legal jurisdiction associated with the geo-partition. Placing the infrastructures physically within a geo-partition may also allow all data processing and storage to be handled by equipment physically within a user's home geo-partition. While geo-partitions may have similar or replicated infrastructures, the geo-partitions are individualized and independently operated such that one geo-partition may not stand in for (e.g., operate in lieu of) another geo-partition. Thus, geo-partitions may be partitions where all data access is limited to a particular partition and nothing is shared between the partitions except for any cross-geo communications enabled by externalized integrations. The externalized integrations may include, for example, cross-geo functions (such as cross-geo operations or cross-geo transactions) that are facilitated through the use of auxiliary accounts, as described herein.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">It should be noted that externalized integrations (e.g., cross-geo operations) between geo-partitions may be implemented through either private or public networks. Various security mechanisms may be implemented in the instances of either private or public networks. For example, encryption mechanisms may be implemented for communication over public networks. Such encryption mechanisms may be available to each geo-partition to allow encryption/decryption as needed. For private or localized networks, encryption mechanisms may be localized to a geo-partition and not shared with other geo-partitions. For embodiments with masking or encryption, tools such as keys or certificates for handling the auxiliary account information may be implemented through the contract between geo-partitions.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the geo-partitions may be unaware of the existence of other geo-partitions. Thus, one geo-partition may consider another geo-partition as an untrusted party or system. Accordingly, first geo-partition <b>130</b> may view second geo-partition <b>140</b> as if it were a third-party system (e.g., a system not affiliated with online network system <b>100</b>) and subject the second geo-partition to similar security or privacy standards. In various embodiments, a geo-partition may securely authenticate and authorize the identity of another geo-partition, for example, through the contract established between the geo-partitions. In some embodiments, the contract may be established through mutual agreement between the geo-partitions. For instance, each geo-partition recognizes another geo-partition as a peer (equal) geo-partition and no single geo-partition has rules or regulations that take precedence over the rules or regulations of another geo-partition.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the illustrated embodiment, first server system <b>110</b> includes applications module <b>112</b> and first geo-partition account database <b>114</b>. Similarly, second server system <b>120</b> includes applications module <b>122</b> and second geo-partition account database <b>124</b>. In certain embodiments, applications module <b>112</b> and applications module <b>122</b> implement software applications that provide functionality for data handling (e.g., data storage and retrieval) or data processing (e.g., transaction processing or customer service processing) for first server system <b>110</b> and second server system <b>120</b>, respectively. In various embodiments, applications module <b>112</b> may interact with users via various APIs or web applications to provide functionality for data handling interactions or data processing interactions in first server system <b>110</b>. Examples of APIs or web applications for interacting with applications module <b>112</b> or applications module <b>122</b> include, but are not limited to, merchant APIs, customer APIs, distributor APIs, checkout APIs, payment APIs, shipping APIs, or similar web applications. In various embodiments, applications module <b>112</b> or applications module <b>122</b> implement geo-agnostic software or generic applications.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">First account geo-partition database <b>114</b> and second geo-partition account database <b>124</b> may be databases for storing and maintaining data (e.g., account data) associated with users of online network system <b>100</b>. First geo-partition account database <b>114</b> and second geo-partition account database <b>124</b> may include single databases, groups of databases on distributed nodes, databases on a central server, etc. Because of the various data privacy and data-localization regulations described above, first server system <b>110</b> may store and maintain data for users that are associated with first geo-partition <b>130</b> (e.g., the geo-partition in which the first server system resides or operates) while second server system <b>120</b> may store and maintain data for users that are associated with second geo-partition <b>140</b> (e.g., the geo-partition in which the second server system resides or operates). As such, even though online network system <b>100</b> may be said to logically have one global user base, the online network system utilizes server systems that have access to data for one subset of users but do not have access to data for other subsets of users that are located in different geo-partitions.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In various embodiments, a particular user may have a &#x201c;home&#x201d; geo-partition. As used herein, a &#x201c;home geo-partition&#x201d; is the geo-partition in which a server system, that stores and maintains account data for a particular user, resides. For instance, geo-partition <b>130</b> may be a home geo-partition for a user that has data stored in first geo-partition account database <b>114</b> on first server system <b>110</b>. In certain embodiments, the home geo-partition is established when the user creates his/her account on online network system <b>100</b>. For example, the home geo-partition may be selected by the user during account creation (such as by selecting a country code for the account). There may, however, be constraints on the selection of the home geo-partition during account creation. For instance, where the user is located geographically or a home or business address of the user may constrain options for selection of a country and the user's home geo-partition during account creation.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">After creation of a user account, the user account data stored in a home geo-partition &#x201c;belongs&#x201d; to the home geo-partition and handling of the data is subject to the local laws or regulations associated with the home geo-partition. In some embodiments, the laws or regulations for a user's local jurisdiction (e.g., the user's home geo-partition) may apply to the user's data regardless of the location at which the user accesses his/her account. For instance, a user whose home geo-partition is geo-partition <b>130</b> may access online network system <b>100</b> from a location in geo-partition <b>140</b>. As the user's home geo-partition is geo-partition <b>130</b>, the access request and any subsequent processing may be routed to first server system <b>110</b> in geo-partition <b>130</b>. Thus, any services or transactions initiated by the user may be routed to the user's home geo-partition regardless of the location of the user. Accordingly, processing of the request may be subject to the local laws or regulations of the user's home geo-partition because the data is accessed/processed in the home geo-partition.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Additional embodiments may also be contemplated for routing and addressing any services or transactions initiated by a user. For example, in some embodiments, a request from an internet-connected device may be routed to a geo-partition based on the connectivity between the internet service provider (ISP) of the internet-connected device and a specific geo-partition. Thus, the ISP of the user may control where any request is routed within online network system <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the request may have information that defines the geo-partition to which the request is to be routed. For example, the request may have a geo-partition specific header or a geo-partition specific IP address.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In various embodiments, online network system <b>100</b> provides operational functionality across geo-partitions (e.g., across first geo-partition <b>130</b> and second geo-partition <b>140</b>). Providing operational functionality across first geo-partition <b>130</b> and second geo-partition <b>140</b> allows first server system <b>110</b> and second server system <b>120</b> to conduct and complete an operation (e.g., a transaction or service) that involves sharing of data between the server systems. For example, operational functionality may be provided in online network system <b>100</b> for a first user accessing the online network system through first server system <b>110</b> in first geo-partition <b>130</b> to conduct a transaction that involves a second user accessing the online network system through second server system <b>120</b> in second geo-partition <b>140</b>, or vice versa. A transaction that involves a first user associated with first geo-partition <b>130</b> and a second user associated with second geo-partition <b>140</b> may be referred to as &#x201c;cross-partition operation&#x201d; or a &#x201c;cross-geo transaction&#x201d;, as described herein.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an embodiment of a cross-geo transaction occurring between first server system <b>110</b> in first geo-partition <b>130</b> and second server system <b>120</b> in second geo-partition <b>140</b>. The cross-geo transaction involves a first user that has first geo-partition <b>130</b> as the first user's home geo-partition and a second user that has second geo-partition <b>140</b> as the second user's home geo-partition. In the illustrated embodiment, first server system <b>110</b> transmits a request for information involving a cross-partition operation (e.g., the cross-geo transaction) to second server system <b>120</b>. In various embodiments, the request is made by first server system <b>110</b> in response to a request to complete a transaction received by the first server system. It should be noted that while the request to complete the transaction is received by first server system <b>110</b>, an initial request for the transaction itself may be made by either party involved in the transaction (e.g., a first user or a second user) or by a third-party partner. For example, the initial request for the transaction may be received by either first server system <b>110</b> or second server system <b>120</b>. In either respect, first server system <b>110</b> may be tasked with completing the transaction request and making the call for information (e.g., the request) to second server system <b>120</b> to get data for the second user needed to complete the transaction. It should also be noted that while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts first server system <b>110</b> generating the request and completing the transaction, other embodiments may be contemplated where second server system <b>120</b> is tasked with completing the transaction and, in response, generates the request.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In certain embodiments, the request includes a request for information about the second user that is needed by first server system <b>110</b> to assess or complete a transaction involving the first user having account data in first geo-partition account database <b>114</b> and the second user having account data in second geo-partition account database <b>124</b>. The information needed may include, for example, name, shipping address, contact information, country code, or a descriptor of a user. As described above, however, a user's data belongs to his/her home geo-partition and there may be limits on the data that is shareable across geo-partitions due to data privacy or data security regulations. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, restrictions are placed on the data that is shareable between first geo-partition <b>130</b> and second geo-partition <b>140</b>. The restrictions may be put in place to ensure that data handling or data processing in each geo-partition complies with the local laws or regulations for each geo-partition or to prevent sensitive user data (such as financial information) from being shared. For instance, the restrictions may inhibit the laws or regulations for first geo-partition <b>130</b> from overlapping with the laws or regulations from second geo-partition <b>140</b>. Placing the restrictions may also allow first server system <b>110</b> in first geo-partition <b>130</b> to complete the transaction without having to make any determination of other laws or regulations to apply to the transaction.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In various embodiments, the restrictions for data sharing between first geo-partition <b>130</b> and second geo-partition <b>140</b> are implemented as an authorization or contract between the first geo-partition and the second-geo partition. In certain embodiments, the contract for data permissions is established by applications module <b>112</b> and applications module <b>122</b>. For example, the contract may be an API contract between applications module <b>112</b> and applications module <b>122</b>. In certain embodiments, the contract implements the restrictions as data sharing permissions between first geo-partition <b>130</b> and second geo-partition <b>140</b>. For example, the contract may define sets or types of data that are permitted to be shared or passed from first geo-partition <b>130</b> to second geo-partition <b>140</b> or from second geo-partition <b>140</b> to first geo-partition <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Examples of data that may be shareable between first geo-partition <b>130</b> and second geo-partition <b>140</b> include, but is not limited to, name, shipping address, contact information (such as phone number or email address), country code, business name, address, phone number, business industry, country code, a descriptor of the buyer (such as a tier of the buyer or a verification status of the buyer), and a descriptor of the seller (such as a tier or verification status of the seller). Examples of data that may be restricted from sharing between first geo-partition <b>130</b> and second geo-partition <b>140</b> (e.g., not have permission to be shared) include, but is not limited to, home address, date of birth, tax identifier, financial instruments (such as credit card or bank account information), login credentials, verification documents, compliance status, tax rates, IPN settings, product subscriptions, and owner information. In certain embodiments, the sets or types of data that are shareable is dependent on the operation or transaction being conducted. For instance, the sets or types of data that are shareable may be defined by the contract and the needs of the operation or transaction (such as buyer or seller information needed to complete a transaction) at the instance of the operation or transaction.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, the sets or types of data that are permitted to be shared by the contract varies based on the various laws or regulations of the geo-partitions.

In some embodiments, a contract may be uniformly implemented across multiple geo-partitions.

For instance, the auxiliary account number may be unique from account numbers for local users in first geo-partition <b>130</b>. Examples of identifying information that may be unique for an auxiliary account include, but are not limited to, account number or user identification (such as username). In some embodiments, the auxiliary account information may include a reference to the geo-partition from which the subset of data was received. For example, the auxiliary account information may include the global identifier, which may identify the home geo-partition (second geo-partition <b>140</b>) of the second user. The global identifier may be included as part of the auxiliary account information for the second user in first geo-partition <b>130</b>. As another example, the auxiliary account information may include a code or marker that refers back to second geo-partition <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In certain embodiments, the auxiliary account identifier for the auxiliary account of the second user is unique from the second user's global identifier and the second user's account identifier in second geo-partition <b>140</b>. For example, the second user's account may have an account number of 1234 and a global identifier of ABCD@email.com in second geo-partition account database <b>124</b> of second geo-partition <b>140</b>. The global identifier for the second user's account may be shared from second geo-partition <b>140</b> to first geo-partition <b>130</b> as part of the account information for the second user while the second user's account number is not shared. For instance, the global identifier may be the email address of the second user, which is shareable across geo-partitions. Auxiliary account identifier generation module <b>200</b> may generate an auxiliary account number (such as 9876) that is unique in first geo-partition <b>130</b> and that is different from the global identifier. As described above, the auxiliary account number of 9876 may be generated in accordance with the rules for user accounts in first geo-partition <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments, the auxiliary account information includes information that refers the auxiliary account back to the second user account. For example, as described herein, the auxiliary account may include the global identifier, which may be used as an external or public identifier used by the second user account that is shareable across geo-partitions. In some embodiments, the second user account may not receive any information identifying that an auxiliary account exists.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">After the auxiliary account information is generated (where the auxiliary account information includes the generated auxiliary account identifier along with the global identifier), the auxiliary account information may be involved in completing the cross-partition operation (e.g., cross-geo transaction) involving the first user and the second user. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram of applications module <b>112</b> with operation processing module <b>300</b> and auxiliary account generation module <b>116</b>, according to some embodiments. As described herein, the auxiliary account information for the second user includes information that is needed by operation processing module <b>300</b> in applications module <b>112</b> to complete the operation involving the first user and the second user. In various embodiments, operation processing module <b>300</b> receives the cross-partition operation request for applications module <b>112</b> and provides the request for information about the second user to applications module <b>122</b> in second geo-partition to initiate the process of receiving the information about the second user and generation the auxiliary account in auxiliary account generation module <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the illustrated embodiment, auxiliary account generation module <b>116</b> provides the auxiliary account information to first geo-partition account database <b>114</b> for storage and then operation processing module <b>300</b> accesses the auxiliary account information for the second user from auxiliary account generation module <b>116</b> along with account data (information) for the first user from first geo-partition account database <b>114</b>. In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, auxiliary account generation module <b>116</b> may provide the auxiliary account information directly to operation processing module <b>300</b> (with the account data for the first user accessed from first geo-partition account database <b>114</b>). After accessing the auxiliary account information for the second user and the account data for the first user, operation processing module <b>300</b> may determine a result for the cross-partition operation based on the auxiliary account information and the account data for the first user. In certain embodiments, the auxiliary account information is a subset of data that is treated by operation processing module <b>300</b> and applications module <b>112</b> as regular account information. For instance, no special handling of the auxiliary account information is needed and operation processing module <b>300</b> can determine the operation (transaction) result as if the operation was occurring between two accounts in first geo-partition <b>130</b>. In various embodiments, operation processing module <b>300</b> and applications module <b>112</b> may be unaware that the auxiliary account information is a subset of data as the auxiliary account includes enough information to complete the transaction.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As long as the information (data) needed by operation processing module <b>300</b> to determine an operation result is within the constraints of the data permitted by the contract to be shareable between first geo-partition <b>130</b> and second geo-partition <b>140</b>, operation processing module <b>300</b> receives enough information in the auxiliary account information to complete the transaction. In some instances, however, all the information needed by operation processing module <b>300</b> to complete the transaction may not be available in the auxiliary account information. For instance, the contract between first geo-partition <b>130</b> and second geo-partition <b>140</b> may inhibit information that is needed to complete the transaction from being included in the subset of data used to generate the auxiliary account information. As one example, the subset of data may not be able to include full vetting or verification of the second user. In such instances, operation processing module <b>300</b> may make a determination to complete the transaction or deny the transaction (e.g., ship a product) based on the auxiliary account information that is available. The determination may be based on, for example, a set of business rules applied by operation processing module <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In various embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, the auxiliary account information for the second user may be stored in first geo-partition account database <b>114</b>. The auxiliary account information for the second user may be accessed by applications module <b>112</b> for subsequent transactions or services involving the second user that are processed within first geo-partition <b>130</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram of first geo-partition <b>130</b>, according to some embodiments. Depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an embodiment of a subsequent intra-geo operation (e.g., transaction) involving the second user occurring in first geo-partition <b>130</b> after generation of the auxiliary account for the second user. The intra-geo operation may be, for example, a transaction involving only first geo-partition <b>130</b> without any cross-geo communication to another geo-partition.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the illustrated embodiment, operation processing module <b>300</b> accesses (e.g., retrieves) both the first user account data and the auxiliary account information for the second user from first geo-partition account database <b>114</b> and determines a result for the intra-geo operation in response to a request for the intra-geo operation. In certain embodiments, the intra-geo operation occurs after the initial operation involving the second user in first geo-partition <b>130</b>. For example, the initial operation involving the second user may be the first of a sequence of transactions involving the second user that are completed by operation processing module <b>300</b> in first geo-partition <b>130</b>. Thus, the auxiliary account information for the second user may be accessed from first geo-partition account database <b>114</b> for each of the transactions in the sequence. In some embodiments, the auxiliary account information for the second user is stored temporarily in first geo-partition account database <b>114</b>. For instance, the auxiliary account information for the second user may be stored temporarily for a predetermined amount of time or a predetermined number of operations. Storing the auxiliary account information temporarily may allow for a number of operations to be completed by operation processing module <b>300</b> without having to make additional cross-geo calls to applications module <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In certain embodiments, the auxiliary account information is stored in first geo-partition account database <b>114</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, with the same structure as account information for local accounts (e.g., the first user's account) in first geo-partition <b>130</b>. Using the same structure for the auxiliary account may enable a wide range of use-cases where the auxiliary account information in first geo-partition <b>130</b> is accessed consistently with local account information according to the rules in the first geo-partition. The consistency in access may be advantageous for transitioning non-partitioned systems to the partitioned system described herein without having the need to revamp the existing systems (e.g., first server system <b>110</b> or second server system <b>120</b>).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">It should be noted, however, that the auxiliary account information is valid only for the instance of the initial cross-geo transaction as there is no ongoing or continuous cross-geo syncing occurring between the auxiliary account information in first geo-partition account database <b>114</b> and the second user account information in second geo-partition account database <b>124</b>. Additionally, as the auxiliary account information is generated and stored in first geo-partition <b>130</b>, the auxiliary account information may not be stored in second geo-partition account database <b>124</b> and the second geo-partition may be unaware of the auxiliary account's existence. As such, there are no updates made to the auxiliary account information stored in first geo-partition account database <b>114</b> until another cross-geo operation involving the second user is conducted between first geo-partition <b>130</b> and second geo-partition <b>140</b>. At the time of another cross-geo operation, the auxiliary account information for the second user may be updated by auxiliary account generation module <b>116</b> with any new or changed information. For instance, the auxiliary account information may be updated if there have been changes to the second user's account in second geo-partition account database <b>124</b> since the previous cross-geo operation. Any modifications or changes may be made by auxiliary account generation module <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In various embodiments, the auxiliary account information stored in first geo-partition account database <b>114</b> is inaccessible by a user as a separate account in first geo-partition <b>130</b>. For example, the auxiliary account information does not include any information that would allow the second user (e.g., the user for which the auxiliary account information was generated) or another user from logging into or accessing applications module <b>112</b> or any computer system in first geo-partition <b>130</b>. Additionally, the auxiliary account information stored in first geo-partition account database <b>114</b> may not be counted as a &#x201c;customer&#x201d; by applications module <b>112</b>. For instance, storing the auxiliary account information does not add to any count or other index for additional customers in first geo-partition <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">As described above, sharing only a subset of data between geo-partitions and generating auxiliary account information allows operations (e.g., transactions or services) to be completed between geo-partitions without sensitive information being shared across the geo-partitions. For example, sensitive information such as financial instrument information may be prevented from being shared across geo-partitions. Preventing financial instrument information from being shared may reduce the likelihood of theft of the financial instrument information that can be used for unauthorized transactions. Accordingly, online network system <b>100</b> is able to maintain, or even enhance, the security and privacy standards of the online network system by limiting the data that is shared between geo-partitions through the use of auxiliary account information.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Additionally, as described above, the use of a subset of data for generating auxiliary account information allows the processing and handling of sensitive data (such as financial data) to be localized to a user's home geo-partition. For example, in a contemplated embodiment involving a product purchase cross-geo transaction, a second user (the buyer) in second geo-partition <b>140</b> is attempting to purchase a product from a first user (the seller) in first geo-partition <b>130</b> and have the product shipped to the second user. In this example, applications module <b>112</b> and applications module <b>122</b> may interact to attempt to complete the transaction (such as through a shared API). The interaction, however, may not include any sharing of user information between the applications modules. At a certain point during the product purchase transaction, applications module <b>122</b> in second geo-partition <b>140</b> conducts the processing of payment information for the second user (such as processing credit card information for the second user). Once the payment information is processed and verified by applications module <b>122</b>, applications module <b>122</b> may indicate to applications module <b>112</b> that payment has been approved and accepted. Applications module <b>112</b> may then determine the information that is needed to complete the transaction (such as name and shipping address information) and make the information request to applications module <b>122</b>. Applications module <b>122</b> then generates and provides the subset of data for the second user, which auxiliary account generation module <b>116</b> uses to generate the auxiliary account information to allow completion of the transaction by applications module <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The use of subsets of data to share information between geo-partitions may also reduce the need for cross-geo communication between the geo-partitions. For example, an initial request may be routed to the appropriate geo-partition and then any information that needs to be shared between geo-partitions is handled through sharing of the subset of data. Accordingly, latency for completing a transaction may be reduced by the reduction in the number of cross-geo calls that have to be made in order to complete the transaction.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the above example, the processing of the payment occurs without any financial information being shared between geo-partitions during the cross-geo transaction. Additionally, data privacy laws or data-localization regulations are complied with because of the limitations placed on the sharing of information by the contract between first geo-partition <b>130</b> and second geo-partition <b>140</b>. It should also be noted that the implementation and usage of the subset of data to limit the information shared as defined by a contract between geo-partitions, the generation of the auxiliary account information, and the localization of data processing and handling may also be implemented for many other types of cross-geo operational functionalities contemplated for online network system <b>100</b>. Examples of additional operational functionalities that may implement the use of auxiliary account information for functionality across geo-partitions include, but are not limited to, customer service operations, transaction history operations, service channel operations, consumer support service operations, reporting operations, data or document management and archive operations, technology operations, and developer tool operations and experiences.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">For instance, in various embodiments, online network system <b>100</b> may implement a customer service operation that handles customer service requests associated with the online network system. In such embodiments, applications module <b>112</b> and applications module <b>122</b> may implement customer service applications that are localized in first geo-partition <b>130</b> and second geo-partition <b>140</b>, respectively. In order to handle a customer service request, a customer service application and a customer service representative/agent that may be handling the customer service request typically need access to all of the data for a user's account. For a customer service request for a single customer, the customer service request may be handled and processed within the single customer's home geo-partition (after routing of the request to the home geo-partition). Additionally, a customer service request between multiple customers that have the same home geo-partition may be handled and processed within the home geo-partition for both customers.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">For a customer service request that involve multiple customers (e.g., a buyer and a seller) across multiple geo-partitions, however, there may be a need to share information between the geo-partitions in order to handle and process the customer service request. In such instances, the handling and processing of user information may be localized in the geo-partitions with user information only shared through a subset of data used to generate an auxiliary account, as described herein, to complete the customer service request. Sharing data through the subset of data for the customer service request involving multiple geo-partitions and generating the auxiliary account may maintain compliance with local laws or regulations for the geo-partitions as there is no cross-geo database access occurring when using the auxiliary account. Using the auxiliary account in the sharing of information may also enhance security and privacy as there is no direct data access across the geo-partitions. In some embodiments, a customer service agent is audited or monitored during the customer service request interaction to ensure that local laws or regulation are complied with during the interaction.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In various embodiments, notifications provided to a user are generated by the user's home geo-partition. The notification may be generated in the user's home geo-partition regardless of the initiator of the notification. For example, the process for providing a notification (such as an email) intended for a first user (recipient) in first geo-partition <b>130</b> may be initiated in second geo-partition <b>140</b>. The notification may be initiated, for instance, by applications module <b>122</b> to indicate completion of a transaction request or customer service request. In order to comply with data sharing permissions, however, the actual notification sent to the recipient is generated in the recipient user's home geo-partition (first geo-partition <b>130</b>) using information shared by second geo-partition <b>140</b> as a subset of data for generating an auxiliary account in first geo-partition <b>130</b>. Generating the notification in the recipient's home geo-partition allows the full information for the recipient to be accessed in generating the notification. Full access to the user's information within the home geo-partition allows any sensitive information to be referred to in the notification. The sharing of information using an auxiliary account and generating of a notification in the recipient's home geo-partition may be applied in additional systems beyond transaction and customer service systems. For example, any online network system that involves communication between different users in different geo-partitions or jurisdictions may implement the sharing of information across geo-partitions using an auxiliary account in order to generate a notification in the recipient's home geo-partition.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Three or More User Embodiments</heading><p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref> describe various embodiments of facilitating cross-partition operations between two users (e.g., a first user and a second user) in different geographic partitions.

In various embodiments, the request is made by first server system <b>110</b> in response to a request to complete a transaction received by the first server system. It should be noted that while the request to complete the transaction is received by first server system <b>110</b>, an initial request for the transaction itself may be made by either party involved in the transaction (e.g., a first user, a second user, or a third user) or by a third-party partner.
