No. 63/217,002, filed on Jun. 30, 2021, and entitled Ice Vending Machine with Reduced Footprint, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates in general to the field of ice vending machines. More particularly, the present invention relates to an ice vending machine that has a compact footprint. Additionally, the present invention relates to an ice vending machine that can quickly create bags of ice, allowing for less ice to be stored prior to bagging.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A variety of bulky ice vending machines are known in the art. Historically, ice vending machines consisted of large coolers where bags of ice that were manufactured at a different location are transported and delivered into the cooler. In addition to transportation costs, such a system oftentimes led to breaking of bags during delivery, melting of ice during the delivery process, and other undesired results.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">More recently, ice vending machines had various components that allow ice to be manufactured and bagged within the machine, before being deposited into a storage section. These types of ice vending machines required a very large footprint to accommodate the bags of ice, as well as the components required to manufacture the ice, bag the ice, seal the ice in a bag, and deliver the sealed bag to a large storage compartment. Additionally, these machines typically had a large reservoir of ice held in a hopper after manufacture by an ice maker, but prior to bagging. In order to maintain that ice, additional components were oftentimes incorporated into the hopper to break up the ice, prevent it from thawing and refreezing, etc. Also, large storage compartments for bagged ice were filled with substantial quantities of ice that had to be manufactured and stored for extended periods of time to accommodate demand. For instance, these units were routinely larger than six feet in length and four feet in depth. These large storage compartments were necessary to meet demand because systems could only bag ice at relatively slow rates, such as four minutes per bag of ice or longer.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Apart from the large space required for installation and operation of these machines, which was problematic for many convenience and other stores that had limited amounts of space for such devices, the storage of large quantities of ice frequently resulted in stale bags of ice. Additionally, machines with large storage sections filled with bags of ice are often susceptible to theft.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A number of these deficiencies were addressed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/432,531 titled &#x201c;Ice Vending Machine and Related Methods&#x201d;, which was filed on Jun. 5, 2019, which claimed priority to U.S. Application No. 62/681,328 titled &#x201c;Ice Vending Machines and Related Methods&#x201d;, which was filed on Jun. 6, 2018, the disclosure of both of which are hereby incorporated by reference. While these applications disclosed ice vending machines that were superior to the prior art described above, further improvements are desired.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For instance, there is a need for an ice vending machine having a significantly reduced footprint. Similarly, there is need for an ice vending machine that is capable of rapidly manufacturing ice and bagging the ice to meet demand. Flexibility in throughput is also desirable. Still further, ease in servicing an ice vending machine and ease in changing rolls of bags are sought after features. Overall, there is a need for an ice vending machine that is an improvement over the prior art.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, an ice vending machine is provided that includes a frame, a cabinet extending around the frame, at least one ice maker coupled to the frame, a first ice hopper, an auger, a second hopper, a bagging assembly, and a retrieval section. The first ice hopper is located beneath the ice maker and is configured to receive ice from the ice maker. The first ice hopper may be a drying hopping having a sloped bottom surface to drain water away from the second hopper. Thereafter, the auger moves ice from the first hopper through an opening into the second hopper. The bagging assembly receives ice from the second hopper, after which a bag of ice is deposited in the retrieval section. The retrieval section may include a refrigerated storage section that is located beneath the bagging assembly.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to another aspect of the present invention, the cabinet is not more than 34 inches in depth.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to yet another aspect of the present invention, the auger is rotated by an auger motor having a rotational speed of approximately 1500 rotations per minute, and a gear head that reduces the rotational speed to approximately 115 rotations per minute. Further still, the first hopper is configured to receive and hold between 300-400 pounds of ice.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another aspect of the invention, a sealing system is provided that includes a heating element, a pusher plate, and a biasing assembly coupled to the pusher plate. An opening is formed in the pusher plate, where the heating element may be exposed through the opening when the biasing assembly moves the pusher plate in order to seal a bag of ice. Furthermore, a pusher section includes a chute that extends from and is pivotable about the second hopper, as well as a motor that is coupled to the chute. The motor is configured to drive the chute towards the sealing system to facilitate the sealing of the bag of ice using the heating element.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to another aspect of the invention, the machine includes a bag of rolls that are removably mounted to the frame, as well as a motor that is configured to advance a portion of the bag of rolls to the bagging system. Further, the machine includes a sensor that scans each bag from the bag of rolls. In the event that the sensor identifies an unverified bag design, the advancement of the bag of rolls to the bagging system by the motor can be terminated.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to yet another aspect of the invention, a cradle is provided, where a bag from the bagging assembly is received. The bag may be opened by a blower, after which ice is deposited from the second hopper into the bag contained within the cradle, after which the cradle is rotated to deposit a plurality of bags of ice into the refrigerated storage section.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to yet another aspect of the present invention, a method of using an ice vending machine is provided. The method includes dropping a plurality of ice from an ice maker into a first hopper, opening a bag using a bag assembly, rotating an auger contained within the first hopper to move ice towards an opening in the first hopper, dropping ice through the opening into a second hopper, dropping the ice through the second hopper into the bag, deactivating the auger, sealing the bag, and moving the bag to a retrieval section. The rotating step may include activating a motor having a rotational speed of approximately 1500 rotations per minute to rotate the auger. The auger may be rotated within the first hopper to move ice upwardly towards the opening in the first hopper between first and second sidewalls, after which the ice is dropped through the opening into a second hopper having a funnel. The ice is then guided towards the bag using a chute.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to another aspect of the invention, the method also includes heating of a heating element, moving a pusher plate to expose the heating element, contacting the bag with the heating element to seal the bag, and moving the pusher plate to separate the heating element from the bag. Also, the method may include the steps of activating a motor associated with the chute extending from the second hopper, pivoting the chute and a support bag towards the heating element, pivoting the chute and supported bag away from the heating element, and disengaging the bag from a roll of bags.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to another aspect of the invention, the method includes the steps of advancing the bag from a roll or bags using a roller, scanning a portion of the bag using a sensor, comparing the portion of the bag to a database of acceptable bag images, and deactivating rotation of the roller if the portion of the bag does not match the database of acceptable bag images.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to yet another aspect of the invention, the method includes opening a bag in a cradle mounted within the retrieval section, filling the bag with ice from the first hopper through the second hopper, sealing the bag of ice, rotating the cradle about the retrieval section, and dropping the bag of ice into a refrigerated storage space.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">These and other aspects, advantages, and features of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the detailed description and the accompanying drawings. It should be understood, however, that the detailed description and accompanying drawings, while indicating preferred embodiments of the present invention, are given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the present invention without departing from the spirit thereof. It is hereby disclosed that the invention include all such modifications.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Exemplary embodiments of the invention are illustrated in the accompanying drawings in which like reference numerals represent like parts throughout, and in which:</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an isometric perspective view of an inventive ice vending machine;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a first isometric perspective view of an ice storage and bagging section of the inventive ice vending machine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a second isometric perspective view of the ice storage and bagging section of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a third isometric perspective view of the ice storage and bagging section of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a fourth isometric perspective view of the ice storage and bagging section of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a cutaway isometric perspective view of the ice storage and bagging section where a roll of bags is replaced;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a cutaway isometric perspective view of the ice storage and bagging section once the new bag of rolls is installed;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a cutaway side elevation view taken about line <b>8</b>-<b>8</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a detailed cutaway side elevation view taken about line <b>9</b>-<b>9</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> where the roll of bags is threaded through the machine;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a detailed cutaway side elevation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> once a tension arm is pivoted to secure the roll of bags in place and once a pair of bag rollers advance the roll of bags about the machine;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a first cutaway side elevation view showing ice being moved through a first hopper into a second hopper of the present machine;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a second cutaway side elevation view showing ice being moved through the first hopper into the second hopper and a bag that is opened by a blower;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is another cutaway side elevation view showing the ice being funneled into the bag;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a detailed cutaway side elevation view showing the bag being sealed by a sealing system;</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a detailed cutaway side elevation view showing the bag being detached from the roll once it is sealed;</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is an isometric perspective view of a cradle holding the sealed bag of ice of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is an isometric perspective view of the cradle of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> rotating to drop the sealed bag of ice into a storage section.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Illustrative embodiments of an ice vending machine in accordance with the present invention are shown in the figures. While many of the components associated with the ice vending machine and shown in the figures will be described herein, additional components, including those present in the prior art, could similarly be incorporated into the ice vending machine of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Turning initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the ice vending machine <b>50</b> includes a durable cabinet <b>52</b> and frame <b>54</b> contained within the cabinet <b>52</b>. The cabinet <b>52</b> has four sides <b>56</b>, including at least one side having a maintenance door or panel <b>58</b> that can be opened by an attendant. The maintenance door <b>58</b> may take up a full side, although it could also be limited to only a portion of the side. The ice vending machine <b>50</b> could have multiple maintenance doors (not shown) for access to different portions of the interior of the ice vending machine <b>50</b>. Additionally, the cabinet <b>52</b> preferably has at least one ice retrieval door <b>60</b> that allows a customer to retrieve a bag <b>62</b> of ice <b>51</b> once it is ready or otherwise available. The ice retrieval door <b>60</b> may be locked until a bag <b>62</b> of ice is ready or payment is received. Preferably, apart from the ice retrieval door <b>60</b>, the ice vending machine <b>50</b> is sealed such that the interior of the machine <b>50</b> cannot be accessed unless the maintenance door or panel <b>58</b> is opened. The retrieval door <b>60</b> may be made of the same material as the cabinet or as shown in the figures it may be a glass door allowing customers to see inside the machine <b>50</b> to ascertain the availability of bags of ice or to see when a bag of ice has completed filling</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Additionally, the ice vending machine <b>50</b> has at least one ice maker <b>64</b> mounted to the frame <b>54</b>. As shown, the ice maker <b>64</b> is mounted towards the top of the frame <b>54</b>, although it could be mounted elsewhere. A variety of different ice makers <b>64</b> may be installed depending on the quantity of ice <b>51</b> that is needed on a routine basis. By way of example and not limitation, potential ice makers include a KM-1301 SAJ Hoshizaki ice maker, which makes up to 1,300 pounds of ice per 24 hours, Hoshizaki model KM-1601 SAJ, which makes up to 1,600 pounds of ice per 24 hours; Hoshizaki model KM-1900 SAJ, which makes up to 1,900 pounds of ice per 24 hours; Hoshizaki model KM-2200 SRJ<b>3</b>, which makes up to 2,200 pound of ice per 24 hours; or Hoshizaki model KM-2600 SRJ<b>3</b>, which makes up to 2,600 pounds of ice per 24 hours. In terms of selection of the appropriate ice maker, for ice vending machines <b>50</b> located at high-demand locations, a higher quality, and thus faster operating ice maker <b>64</b> is preferable. This ensures that the ice maker <b>64</b> is capable of manufacturing ice <b>51</b> quickly enough to fill the bags <b>62</b>. Additionally, or alternatively, multiple ice makers <b>64</b> may be mounted to the frame <b>54</b> for high-demand locations. For instance, two KM-2600 ice makers on one system can produce up to 5200 pounds of ice per day, enough to bag 520 ten-pound bags a day despite the relatively small footprint of the ice vending machines described herein.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">For locations having less demand, slower throughput ice makers <b>64</b> may be used. Additionally, the ice makers <b>64</b> need not be permanently mounted to the frame <b>54</b> to permit flexibility in replacing the ice maker(s) <b>64</b> in the field to meet the demand of a given location.

The ice storage and bagging section <b>65</b> is shown in isolation with the sides removed to expose the interior components in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>15</b></figref>. The ice storage and bagging section <b>65</b> includes a frame <b>67</b> having various other components described herein mounted thereto. The maintenance door <b>58</b> described above is removably secured to the frame <b>67</b> to prevent unauthorized access to the interior of the frame <b>67</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the ice maker <b>64</b> is mounted to the top of the frame <b>67</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Once the ice <b>51</b> is made by the ice maker <b>64</b>, it is dropped into a first hopper <b>66</b> of the ice storage and bagging section <b>65</b> that is located beneath the ice maker <b>64</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>5</b></figref>, the first hopper <b>66</b> has an upper section <b>68</b> that is substantially triangular in shape and having three sloped sides <b>72</b><i>a, </i><b>72</b><i>b, </i><b>72</b><i>c </i>down to a lower section <b>74</b> to form a funnel shape. The sloped sides <b>72</b><i>a, </i><b>72</b><i>b, </i><b>72</b><i>c </i>funnel and move the ice <b>51</b> downwardly. Additionally, the first hopper has an opening <b>78</b> formed therein, with the opening being located towards the upper section <b>68</b> between the first side <b>72</b><i>a </i>and second side <b>72</b><i>b. </i>The first hopper <b>66</b> is oriented to allow water to drain away from the ice <b>51</b>, such that water is not transferred into a bag when the ice <b>51</b> is deposited into the bag <b>62</b>. More specifically, the sides <b>72</b><i>a, </i><b>72</b><i>b, </i><b>72</b><i>c </i>are sloped downwardly away from the opening <b>78</b>. In this way, the first (drying) hopper <b>66</b> can be used to funnel water out of the system. To facilitate this functionality, there is a drain <b>76</b> formed in the lower section <b>74</b> that allows the water to be drained out of the first hopper <b>66</b>. The drain <b>76</b> is located in the lower section <b>74</b> of the first hopper <b>66</b> and is routed to a floor drain or sump pump. In this configuration, water is harvested and drained off the ice cubes <b>51</b> before they are moved to a second hopper described below.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The first hopper <b>66</b> has a capacity of between 35-95 pounds of ice, more preferably between 50-80 pounds of ice, and most preferable approximately 65 pounds of ice. In contrast to ice vending machines of the prior art, the first hopper <b>66</b> has a reduced footprint, and is oriented in a particular manner relative to the cabinet <b>52</b> so that the cabinet <b>52</b> only needs to be 34 inches in depth. This allows the ice vending machine <b>50</b> to fit in a standard grocery store aisle, while still having sufficient capacity to manufacture and bag ice at a high speed.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Preferably sensors (not shown) are located within the first hopper <b>66</b>. In one preferred embodiment, a first sensor is located near the top of the first hopper. When the first sensor is covered by ice, the ice maker is deactivated to avoid excessive manufacture of ice. Once the first sensor is uncovered, the ice maker is reactivated to ensure that sufficient amount of ice is present in the first hopper <b>66</b> for ice to be bagged and dispensed and/or stored.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The first hopper <b>66</b> includes an auger <b>80</b> that moves ice <b>51</b> from the lower section <b>74</b> to the opening <b>78</b> and into a second hopper <b>94</b> as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. The auger <b>80</b> is positioned to extend along the first and second sidewalls <b>72</b><i>a, </i><b>72</b><i>b </i>from the lower section <b>74</b> up to the opening <b>78</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>, <b>8</b>, and <b>11</b>-<b>13</b></figref>. The lower section <b>74</b> is inclined away the opening <b>78</b> such that water is drained away from the opening <b>78</b> as described above. The auger <b>80</b> includes a shaft <b>82</b> and a corkscrew <b>84</b> configured to move ice <b>51</b> upwardly along the first hopper <b>66</b> and out of the opening <b>78</b> when the auger is rotated. The auger <b>80</b> can be powered by a motor <b>86</b> that is mounted to the frame <b>67</b> directly adjacent to the first hopper <b>66</b> next to the third wall <b>72</b><i>c. </i>In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the motor <b>86</b> is the &#xbc; horsepower motor, model number B162FT-G2 described above.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>5</b> and <b>11</b>-<b>13</b></figref>, the ice vending machine <b>50</b> also has a second hopper <b>94</b> into which ice is deposited from the first hopper <b>66</b>. The second hopper <b>94</b> has four sides <b>96</b><i>a, </i><b>96</b><i>b, </i><b>96</b><i>c, </i><b>96</b><i>d </i>with a funnel <b>88</b> at the bottom which is sloped towards an opening <b>90</b> through which the ice is funneled to a chute <b>89</b> into a bag <b>62</b> using a bagging system <b>98</b> that will be further described below. As such, the second hopper <b>94</b> serves as a chute that guides ice through the opening <b>90</b> into a bag <b>62</b>. Additionally, the second hopper <b>94</b> may also include a blower opening <b>92</b> formed in the funnel <b>88</b> directly adjacent to the opening <b>90</b>. The blower opening <b>92</b> is configured to blow air through the opening <b>90</b> in order to open a bag <b>62</b> in order to prepare the bag <b>62</b> for delivery of ice <b>51</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. In such an embodiment a blower motor <b>91</b> is connected to the blower opening <b>92</b> by a hose <b>93</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">While many of the components associated with the bagging system <b>98</b> are showed in U.S. application Ser. No. 16/432,531, which is incorporated herein by reference, some components are different and/or improved as will further be described below. The bagging system <b>98</b> includes a bagging motor <b>100</b> that rotates first and second bag rollers <b>101</b><i>a, </i><b>102</b><i>b </i>to move a bag <b>62</b> into position prior to the filling of the bag <b>62</b> with ice, as well as a sensor <b>103</b>. The bagging motor <b>100</b> is configured to move a bag or bags <b>62</b> quickly off of a roll <b>102</b> of bags to ensure high-speed filling of the bags <b>62</b> of ice. The sensor <b>103</b> is preferably configured to read a printed message, logo, bar code, etc. that is printed on the bag <b>62</b> while the bag <b>62</b> is moved into position about a viewing area <b>105</b> of the sensor <b>103</b>. An encoder is preferably connected to the sensor <b>103</b> that ensures that the bags <b>64</b> are from an authorized provider. In a preferred embodiment, the roll of bags <b>102</b> is rotated a specified amount depending on whether the sensor is blocked or unblocked. For instance, the bag feed motor <b>100</b> may be a stepper type motor, where the roll <b>102</b> of bags is rotated a certain number of &#x201c;clicks&#x201d; depending on when the sensor is blocked or unblocked to position a new bag for filling In the event that the sensor <b>103</b> and encoder are unable to verify that the bags <b>64</b> are from an authorized provider because the message, logo, bar code, etc. are not correct, the machine <b>50</b> can be powered down and an error message can be displayed until a user is able to realign the roll of bags <b>102</b> such that the sensor <b>103</b> confirms they are from an authorized provider.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, the roll of bags <b>102</b> are held in place by first and second arms <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>. The first and second arms <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> are mounted within the cabinet <b>52</b> to the frame <b>67</b>. Each of the arms <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> have a slot <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> formed therein. The slots <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> are located at the top of the arms <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> and face an exterior of the cabinet <b>52</b> so as to enable quick and easy installation of a fresh roll of bags <b>102</b> once the front maintenance panel <b>58</b> is removed. To install a fresh roll of bags <b>102</b>, opposite ends <b>114</b> of a rod <b>112</b> extending through the roll of bags <b>102</b> are engaged into the slots <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>. The roll of bags <b>102</b> is then routed around through multiple guider rolls <b>116</b> as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>. For instance, as shown the roll of bags <b>102</b> are routed under first and second guider rolls <b>116</b><i>a, </i><b>116</b><i>b, </i>and then over a third guider roll <b>116</b><i>c </i>before being secured between the bag rollers <b>101</b><i>a, </i><b>101</b><i>b. </i>Of course, additional or fewer guider rolls could be included to ensure smooth and efficient deliver of the bags from the roll of bags <b>102</b> to the bagging system <b>98</b>. Additionally, the illustrated embodiment includes a tension arm <b>118</b> configured to be lifted when a fresh roll of bags <b>102</b> are installed, and the biased downwardly directly adjacent one or more of the guider rolls <b>116</b> once the roll of bags <b>102</b> have successfully been installed and engaged with the bag rollers <b>101</b>, such that the bags <b>102</b> are secured between the guider rolls <b>116</b> and the tension arm <b>118</b>. As shown, the second roller <b>116</b><i>b </i>is affixed to the tension arm <b>118</b>. The bag of rolls <b>102</b> are advanced through the system using the bag rollers <b>101</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Once the bag has been filled by the bagging system <b>98</b>, the bag <b>62</b> is sealed using a sealing system <b>120</b>. The sealing system <b>120</b> may be similar to that shown and described in U.S. application Ser. No. 16/432,531, although some components are different and/or improved as described below. In the illustrated embodiment, the sealing system <b>120</b> includes a heating section <b>122</b> and a chute pusher section <b>124</b>, as can best be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>. The heating section <b>122</b> includes a heating element <b>126</b> that is heated to a desired temperature in order to seal the bag <b>62</b>. The heating element <b>126</b> is surrounded and protected by a pusher plate <b>128</b>. The illustrated pusher plate <b>128</b> includes a vertical portion <b>130</b>, an opening <b>132</b> in the vertical portion <b>130</b>, and an angled portion <b>134</b>. When the bag <b>62</b> is ready to be sealed, the pusher plate <b>128</b> is moved away from the chute pusher section <b>124</b> so that vertical portion is moved away from the chute pusher section <b>124</b> while the heating element <b>126</b> remains in the same location, best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>. As a result of this movement of the pusher plate <b>128</b>, the heating element <b>126</b> moves through the opening <b>132</b> such that it is exposed. When this occurs, the bag <b>62</b> contacts the heating element <b>126</b> and is sealed by the heating element <b>126</b>. For instance, the bag <b>62</b> may contact the heater element <b>126</b> for approximately 1-6 seconds, and more preferably approximately 3 seconds to ensure proper formation of the bag <b>62</b>. Once the bag <b>62</b> is sealed, the pusher plate <b>128</b> may be returned to its initial position, such that again the vertical portion <b>130</b> surrounds and protects the heating element <b>126</b>, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>. The pusher plate <b>128</b> may be spring loaded in order for it to appropriately bias between the positions described above, although any other biasing mechanism could be used to achieve the same result.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In addition to the heating section <b>122</b>, the chute pusher section <b>124</b> is also configured to help bias the bag <b>62</b> appropriately to ensure proper sealing of the bag. More specifically, the chute pusher section <b>124</b> includes components that enable movement of the chute <b>89</b> relative to the heating section. More specifically, the chute pusher section <b>124</b> includes a vertical portion <b>136</b> that is located directly adjacent to the chute <b>89</b>. When the bag <b>62</b> is being sealed, a motor <b>138</b> connected to the vertical portion <b>136</b> by an arm <b>139</b> is activated to enable movement of the vertical portion <b>136</b>. The vertical portion <b>136</b> presses against the chute <b>89</b> to move the chute <b>89</b>, and the bag <b>62</b> resting upon the chute <b>89</b>, towards the heating section <b>122</b>. This further ensures the appropriate amount of contact between the bag <b>62</b> and the heating element <b>126</b> when the bag <b>62</b> is being sealed. The chute pusher section <b>124</b> may also include a horizontal element <b>140</b>. The horizontal element <b>140</b> may include a perforated edge <b>142</b> that further assists in the separation of the bag <b>62</b> once the bag <b>62</b> is sealed. Additionally, to further assist with the separation of the bag <b>62</b> once the bag <b>62</b> is sealed, the bag rollers <b>101</b> may be rotated in the reverse direction once the bag <b>62</b> is sealed to break the seal between the formed bag <b>62</b> and the remaining roll of bags <b>102</b>. Once the bag <b>62</b> has been sealed, the motor <b>138</b> is reactivated in the opposite direction to return the chute pusher section <b>124</b> to its original position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Next, the retrieval storage section <b>144</b> will be further described. More specifically, beneath the second hopper <b>94</b>, the ice vending machine <b>50</b> has a storage section <b>144</b> for stacking and storing bags. More specifically, the frame <b>67</b> may be mounted to the storage section <b>144</b>. Since the bags <b>62</b> may be stored for extended periods of time, the storage section <b>144</b> is insulated and cooled to an appropriate temperature to maintain the ice in solid form. As such, bags <b>62</b> of ice may be manufactured until the storage section <b>144</b> is partially or substantially filled depending on the settings of the machine <b>50</b>. Preferably, the interior of the storage section <b>144</b> has a fill sensor <b>146</b>. The ice vending machine <b>50</b> continues creating bags <b>62</b> of ice until the fill sensor <b>146</b> is triggered. In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the fill sensor <b>146</b> is in the upper 25% of the storage section <b>144</b>. Once the fill sensor <b>146</b> has been blocked, the manufacture of ice and filling of bags <b>62</b> can be stopped. Once enough bags <b>62</b> of ice have been removed from the storage section <b>144</b>, the fill sensor <b>146</b> will no longer be triggered, in which case the production of bags <b>62</b> of ice will resume until the fill sensor <b>146</b> is again triggered, at which point manufacture is again suspended.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Additionally, the ice vending machine <b>50</b> has a cradle <b>148</b> which supports the bags <b>62</b> as they are filled with ice, and then deposits the filled bag into the storage section <b>144</b>. Preferably, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>-<b>17</b></figref>, the cradle <b>148</b> has a bottom <b>150</b>, and front and back sides <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> to hold the bag <b>62</b> in place. In a preferred embodiment, a cradle fill sensor <b>156</b> is located adjacent to the cradle <b>148</b> to monitor when the cradle <b>148</b> is in a position to receive a bag <b>62</b> and fill it with ice. An unfilled bag <b>62</b> extends into the cradle <b>148</b>. The bag <b>62</b> is then opened preferably using a blower motor <b>91</b> with air that is transported by the hose <b>93</b> to the blower opening <b>92</b> to allow ice to enter into the mouth of the bag <b>62</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. While the bag <b>62</b> remains in the cradle <b>148</b>, ice is moved from the first hopper <b>66</b> using the auger <b>80</b> to the second hopper <b>94</b>, after which the ice will fall downwardly into the bag <b>62</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Preferably a bag full sensor <b>158</b> is present that monitors the fill level of a bag <b>62</b> that is contained within the cradle <b>148</b>. In one preferred embodiment, the sensor <b>158</b> senses when the bag <b>62</b> is partially, but not completely full once the sensor <b>158</b> is blocked. When the sensor is blocked, the auger <b>80</b> continues to rotate by a control panel a specific number of times to ensure the bag <b>62</b> is filled to the appropriate level. By way of example, when a 10-pound bag of ice is desired, the bag <b>62</b> can be filled until the sensor <b>158</b> detects that 8 pounds of ice are in the bag <b>62</b>. Thereafter, the auger <b>80</b> is rotated a predetermined number of additional rotations to deposit two additional pounds of ice to result in the desired 10-pound bag of ice. Such a configuration results in more accurate bag weight regardless of how much ice is contained in the first hopper <b>66</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Regardless of when the bag <b>62</b> is determined to be full, it is sealed as described above and then prepared for deposit into the storage section <b>144</b>. As shown, the cradle <b>148</b> is connected to a motor <b>159</b> with a drive chain <b>160</b>. More specifically, the drive chain <b>160</b> rotates the cradle <b>148</b> in a first direction until the bag <b>62</b> slides out of the cradle <b>148</b> and into the storage section <b>144</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>. Once the bag <b>62</b> has been deposited into the storage section <b>144</b>, the motor drives the drive chain <b>160</b> in the opposite direction to return the cradle <b>148</b> to the original position so that additional bags <b>62</b> can be produced. As described above, bags <b>62</b> are continually made until the fill sensor <b>146</b> has been blocked.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As shown in the figures and described above, the ice vending machine <b>50</b> has a compact size compared to traditional ice vending machines that required a large footprint. More specifically, the ice vending machine <b>50</b> has exterior dimensions of approximately 48 inches wide by 32 inches deep by 110 inches in height, with the interior dimensions being 44 inches wide by 28 inches deep. Having such a small footprint is beneficial in that the ice vending machine of the present invention can rest on a standard shelf or fit in the space of a standard shelf of a grocery or convenience store. Because the ice vending machine <b>50</b> is approximately 48 inches wide, it is as wide as a standard grocery store shelf The reduced footprint means that there is less space to store ice in a hopper <b>66</b>. However, the combination of the speed with which the ice maker <b>64</b> makes ice and the power of the motors associated with the auger <b>80</b> and other components, the ice vending machine <b>50</b> is still capable of quickly filling, sealing, and delivering bags of ice as described above and minimal if any ice is stored in hopper <b>66</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The ice vending machine <b>50</b> has been optimized for quickly bagging the ice, while having a relatively small footprint. For instance, in a preferred embodiment, the ice vending machine is equipped to make a 10-pound bag of ice in approximately 15 seconds. In other embodiments, a 10-pound bag of ice is made in less than 15 seconds. In still other embodiments, a 10-pound bag of ice is made in less than 30 seconds.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the illustrated embodiments, the machine <b>50</b> is operated using a user interface <b>162</b> mounted to the cabinet <b>52</b>, such as a touch panel. In alternative embodiments, the machine is configured to communicate electronically with external communication devices such that bags <b>62</b> of ice can be ordered remotely, for instance by paying a cashier, ordering a bag on a phone or tablet application, ordering a bag online, or any other way known to those having ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">While the storage section <b>144</b> is shown to be insulated and refrigerated, other components of the machine could also be insulated and refrigerated if desired.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Additionally, in certain preferred embodiments, the ice vending machine is delivered in multiple sections and later assembled. For instance, the storage section <b>144</b>, the ice storage/bagging section <b>65</b> and associated components including the hoppers <b>66</b>, <b>94</b> and bagging system <b>98</b>, and the ice makers <b>64</b> could be assembled on site. Additionally, as mentioned above, the ice makers <b>64</b> may be changed or the number of ice machines increased or decreased depending on the needs of a given location. Further still, various machines <b>50</b> and associated components may be in communication with one another. For instance, when one machine <b>50</b> is low on ice or out of ice, a notification may be transmitted so that individuals may physically move filled bags <b>62</b> of ice from a location having a surplus to the location that has an insufficient number of filled bags <b>62</b> of ice. The machines <b>50</b> and associated systems may be configured to allow for and track this borrowing of bags from one to another. Live, online data may be used to monitor such activities and ensure sufficient supply to all machines <b>50</b>. Further still, live, online data may be used for other purposes, including to plan for preventative maintenance, track operation and breakdown of different components, identify machines that need to be replaced or exchanged with larger or smaller ice makers, and the like in order to optimize operation of machines <b>50</b> in general and at specific locations.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">It should be understood that the above description, while indicating representative embodiments of the present invention, is given by way of illustration and not of limitation.
