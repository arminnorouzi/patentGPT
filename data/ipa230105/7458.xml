No. 16/707,793, filed Dec. 9, 2019, issuing as U.S. Pat. No. 11,368,831 on Jun. 21, 2022, which is a continuation of International Application No. PCT/EP2018/085644, filed Dec. 18, 2018, which claims priority from European Patent Application No. 17208194.5, filed Dec. 18, 2017, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for improving the ease with which a user can locate an aerosol generation device, such as an electronic cigarette.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electronic cigarettes and other aerosol generation devices are becoming increasingly popular among consumers. Unlike conventional cigarettes, which are consumed, an electronic cigarette is intended to be re-filled and used many times. Electronic cigarettes have a high unit cost, in comparison to conventional cigarettes, and therefore more care is required by users to ensure that they do not become lost.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An object of the present invention is to assist a user in locating an aerosol generation device, such as an electronic cigarette.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to an aspect of the invention there is provided a system comprising: a positioning module arranged on a user electronic device; a communication interface to provide a communicative interaction with an aerosol generation device; and a data storage module, wherein the data storage module is configured to store a position determined by the positioning module, and wherein the stored position is associated with the communicative interaction with the aerosol generation device, wherein the position may be stored based on a trigger, which may comprise one or more of the following: upon establishing or during a communicative interaction with the aerosol generation device; and following termination of a communicative interaction with the aerosol generation device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In this way, the system can assist a user in locating the aerosol generation device. This can be done in a cost effective way since the need for a further positioning module on the aerosol generation device is obviated. When the aerosol generation device cannot be located easily the stored position can be retrieved from the data storage module. The stored position may be indicative of an assumed position of the aerosol generation device, based on the position of the electronic user device during or shortly after the communicative interaction.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, the system can determine whether a trigger event has occurred, and only store the position once this condition has been satisfied. In one example the trigger may be the aerosol generation device transitioning into an inactive mode such as a standby mode. An inactive mode may be determined after a period of inactivity has elapsed or after the aerosol generation device has been placed in an inoperative configuration. One example of an inoperative configuration may be where the mouthpiece has been retracted into the device body, which can be considered as a last puff of the device before the device enters the inactive mode.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The data storage module may be provided in the electronic user device. In an alternative the data storage module may be provided remotely, for example in a server, which can be accessed by the electronic user device when required.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The stored position may be associated with a most recent communicative interaction with the aerosol generation device. The stored position may be the &#x201c;last known position&#x201d; of the aerosol generation device. In reality the stored position may be a rough approximation of the position of the aerosol generation device when it was last in communication with the connection interface, and this information may be useful for the user in locating the aerosol generation device.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an alternative arrangement the stored position may be the most common position associated with communicative interactions with the aerosol generation device. It may also be possible to store an average position associated with communicative interactions with the aerosol generation device.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably the electronic user device comprises a display configured to indicate the stored position. In this way the stored position can be retrieved from memory and indicated to the user on a display.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The display may be configured to indicate the stored position on a map. In one arrangement the display may be configured to indicate the current position of the user, as determined by the positioning module, as well as the stored position. In this way, the user can be assisted in finding the aerosol generation device, based on its last known position. The electronic user device preferably comprises a processor that generates the instructions for an indication to be displayed on the map, where the indication is indicative of the stored position.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The indication of the stored position on the map may be changed when communicative interaction is established with the aerosol generation device. In one arrangement the indication on the map may become selectable by a user on the display.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A notification may be provided by the electronic user device when a communicative interaction is established with the aerosol generation device. The notification may include one or more of the following: haptic feedback; audible feedback; and visual feedback, including on the display. In one arrangement an icon associated with the aerosol generation device (e.g. the indication on the map) may become selectable when communicative interaction is established. The icon may provide feedback to the user indicating that communicative interaction has been established, e.g. by one or more of a change in size, shape or colour. In this way a user may firstly coarsely locate the aerosol generation device by moving to the stored position before any connection has been established. Subsequently, when the position of the user is close enough to the aerosol generation device, the user may be notified of the establishment of a connection between the electronic user device and aerosol generation device, so that they can more precisely locate the aerosol generation device.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The data storage module may be configured to store a position determined by the positioning module based on data received from the aerosol generation device in the communicative interaction. Thus, the receipt of data, or at least a certain type or pattern of data, from the aerosol generation device may be processed as an instruction for the electronic user device to store a position in the data storage module. In one example, the determination of a vape through the aerosol generation device (including termination or initiation of a vape) may trigger the electronic user device to store a position. Vaping may be determined by a flow sensor, a vaping button or other means. This may be helpful in prompting data exchange between the aerosol generation device and the user device, and a position may be determined on each or a predetermined number of occasions. This can allow the stored position to be updated, and the latest stored position may represent an assumed position of the aerosol generation device.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Preferably the position associated with the aerosol generation device is stored along with identifying information for the aerosol generation device. For example, the position may be stored along with the model and/or serial number of the aerosol generation device. This can allow a user to distinguish devices, in case they own several.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably the positioning module includes a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver. Alternatively, or in addition, the positioning module may include an inertial sensor, or a receiver for determining position using Wi-Fi or telecommunications signals.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The communication interface may be arranged to establish communicative interaction between the electronic user device and the aerosol generation device using a wireless protocol such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. A wired connection may also be established between the electronic user device and the aerosol generation device. As used herein &#x201c;communicative interaction&#x201d; may refer to: information transfer between devices; pairing; authentication; establishing of a data session or dialogue; or termination of a connection.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The system may further comprise an aerosol generation device. In one embodiment an indication may be provided by the aerosol generation device when communicative interaction is established with the connection interface or during the communicative interaction. The indication may be one or more of: visual, using a light or other indicator; audible; haptic; or other like indication.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an embodiment the aforementioned icon displayed on the electronic user device (or other element) is or becomes user selectable when a connection is established. Selection of said icon may trigger the indication by the aerosol generation device. In this way a user may firstly coarsely locate the aerosol generation device by moving to the stored position. Subsequently, the user may trigger the indication by the aerosol generation device to more precisely locate said device. An indication, which may be audible and/or haptic, may be provided by the aerosol generation device, which has a property that is dependent on the separation distance between the aerosol generation device and the electronic user device. The separation distance may be determined based on the strength of the wireless signal received at the connection interface or the aerosol generation device, as appropriate, e.g. by received signal strength indication (RSSI indicator). The indication may assist a user in locating the aerosol generation device. In one example, an audible indication may have a frequency that depends on the separation distance, and the frequency may be higher when the separation distance is small. The frequency may refer to the pitch of the indication or the rate of repetition of the indication. The audible indication may be provided by a vibration of the aerosol generation device.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Typically the indication is provided on a display of the electronic user device. The indication may include a determined numerical distance to the aerosol generating device and/or an icon that changes colour (e.g. from blue to red) based on proximity. An advantage is that the indication of the electronic user device may be used if the indication of the aerosol generating device is obscured.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Preferably the indication provided by the aerosol generation device can be inhibited by a user. The indication can be inhibited either using the aerosol generation device or the electronic user device. On the aerosol generation device a button may be activated to indicate that it has been located, and to inhibit the indication. A similar button may be provided on the display of the electronic user device.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Preferably the indication provided by the aerosol generation device is inhibited during use of the aerosol generation device. Thus, the indication can be inhibited during vaping. This may be detected by depression of a vaping button, or activation of an air pressure sensor.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one arrangement the electronic user device may be configured to provide a beaconing signal using the connection interface, and the aerosol generation device may be configured to provide an indication when the beaconing signal is received. In one arrangement the beaconing signal can be initiated by a user selecting an icon associated with the aerosol generating device on the display screen of the user device. For example, the user may be able to select an icon associated with the aerosol generating device, as displayed on a map. On receipt of the beaconing signal the aerosol generating device is adapted to provide the indication. For example, the aerosol generating device can vibrate so that it can be easily located by a user.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a method comprising the steps of: determining a position of the electronic user device; providing a communicative interaction between the electronic user device and an aerosol generation device via a communication interface in the electronic user device; and storing the position determined by the positioning module in a data storage module, wherein the stored position is associated with the communicative interaction with the aerosol generation device. The method may implement any feature of the preceding aspects.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to yet another aspect of the invention there is provided a non-transitory computer readable medium comprising instructions which, when executed by at least one processor, cause the at least one processor to perform steps comprising: determining a position of the electronic user device; providing a communicative interaction between the electronic user device and an aerosol generation device via a communication interface in the electronic user device; and storing the position determined by the positioning module in a data storage module, wherein the stored position is associated with the communicative interaction with the aerosol generation device.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a method of displaying a position associated with an aerosol generation device on a user interface of an electronic user device, the method comprising: retrieving a position determined by a positioning module from a data storage module, wherein the stored position is associated with a communicative interaction with the aerosol generation device; and generating instructions to display said position on a user interface.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Preferably the method involves receiving instructions from a user interface to locate an aerosol generation device.

The electronic cigarette <b>4</b>, which is an aerosol generation device, comprises a battery <b>6</b> and a reservoir <b>8</b> for storing vaporisable liquid. The vaporisable liquid in the reservoir <b>8</b> can be supplied to an atomiser <b>10</b>, powered by the battery <b>6</b>. Air inlets <b>12</b> are provided in the body of the electronic cigarette, and an airflow can be generated by a user inhaling via a mouthpiece <b>14</b>. The airflow can draw air into the air inlets <b>12</b> and past the atomiser <b>10</b> so that the user can inhale air which includes vaporised liquid from the reservoir <b>8</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Alternative aerosol generation devices may be provided that are not based on vaporisable liquid. In one example, an aerosol generation device can be supplied with capsules containing conventional tobacco. These capsules can be heated, without burning the tobacco, to release vapours that can be carried away from the capsule in an airflow.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The electronic cigarette <b>4</b> comprises a Bluetooth&#xae; transmitter <b>16</b>, which can be used to establish a communicative interaction with a corresponding Bluetooth transmitter <b>24</b> in the smartphone <b>2</b>. The electronic cigarette <b>4</b> also comprises an indicator light <b>18</b> and a motor <b>20</b> which can be used to generate a vibration. The indicator light <b>18</b> and the motor <b>20</b> are electrically coupled to the battery <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The smartphone <b>2</b> comprises an antenna <b>24</b> which can be used for wireless communication with the electronic cigarette <b>4</b>. The smartphone also comprises electronics for wireless communication based on cellular technology and Wi-Fi.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The smartphone <b>2</b> comprises a GPS receiver <b>26</b> that can monitor geographic position. GPS signals are typically only available in outdoor environment, and the smartphone is adapted to determine a position using alternative techniques when GPS signals are not available. A few examples of alternative techniques include Wi-Fi positioning, dead reckoning and cellular positioning. A data storage unit <b>28</b> is also provided in the smartphone <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The smartphone <b>2</b> is communicatively connected to a network <b>30</b>, such as a cellular network or the internet. A server <b>32</b> is connected to the network <b>30</b> and arranged for communication with the smartphone <b>2</b>. In some embodiments the smartphone <b>2</b> may communicate with the server <b>32</b> in order to store data. This may occur when there is no storage available on the smartphone <b>2</b>. Thus, the function of the data storage unit <b>28</b> may be performed by the server <b>32</b> in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flow diagram showing steps that can be undertaken in an embodiment of the invention. At step <b>50</b> the smartphone <b>2</b> and the electronic cigarette <b>4</b> search for a connection with one another. At step <b>52</b> a connection is established when the two devices are in the same location using, in this example, Bluetooth&#xae; protocol.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Indications can be inhibited for the smartphone <b>2</b> or the electronic cigarette <b>4</b> by selection of an appropriate button by the user. Indications can also be inhibited during a specified use of the devices. For example, indications can be inhibited while the electronic cigarette <b>4</b> is being used for vaping as may be detected by depression of a vaping button, or activation of an air pressure sensor. Therefore, at step <b>54</b> the smartphone <b>2</b> establishes whether indications are enabled for the smartphone <b>2</b> and the electronic cigarette <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">At step <b>56</b>, an indication is provided on the smartphone <b>2</b> and/or the electronic cigarette <b>4</b> to indicate that a successful Bluetooth&#xae; connection has been established. In one example, this is accomplished by turning on the indicator light <b>18</b> on the electronic cigarette <b>4</b>, and by providing a vibration in the smartphone <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">At step <b>58</b> the smartphone <b>2</b> determines whether data are received in the communicative interaction that would prompt the smartphone <b>2</b> to store a geographic position. In one example the smartphone <b>2</b> is adapted to store a geographic position, as determined by the GPS receiver <b>26</b>, whenever a successful connection has been established. In this way, the smartphone <b>2</b> can maintain a log corresponding to position at different times that a connection is established. In another example, the smartphone <b>2</b> is adapted to store a position only on receipt of a particular type of data, or a particular pattern of data from the electronic cigarette <b>4</b>. For example, the electronic cigarette <b>4</b> may be adapted to communicate to the smartphone <b>2</b> that a vaping button has been depressed. The electronic cigarette <b>4</b> may also be adapted to communicate data regarding a vaping episode including data indicative of the start or end of a user's inhalation. The smartphone <b>2</b> is adapted to store a geographic position only upon detection of depression of the vaping button, or upon detection of a vaping episode. In some embodiments these may correspond to trigger events.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">At step <b>60</b> the smartphone <b>2</b> is adapted to determine whether a trigger event has occurred. In addition to the examples above, a trigger event may correspond to the establishment of a communicative interaction with the electronic cigarette <b>4</b>. In another embodiment the trigger event may correspond to the termination of a communicative interaction with the electronic cigarette <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">At step <b>62</b> the smartphone <b>2</b> is adapted to determine a geographic position using the GPS receiver <b>26</b>. At step <b>64</b> the geographic position is stored in data storage <b>28</b> in the smartphone <b>2</b> or in the server <b>32</b>, as appropriate. The geographic position is stored along with information that can identify the electronic cigarette <b>4</b>, such its serial number, batch number or MAC address. Geographic positions may be stored in the data storage unit <b>28</b> for several different electronic cigarettes <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In use, a user can &#x2018;connect&#x2019; their electronic cigarette <b>4</b> to their smartphone <b>2</b> in order to exchange data. In this way, the user can monitor the performance of the electronic cigarette <b>4</b> using their smartphone and can connect these data to any of a wide variety of internet applications. The smartphone <b>2</b> is adapted to store a geographic position in the data storage unit <b>28</b> on each occasion that a communicative interaction is established. Thus, the smartphone <b>2</b> can maintain a log corresponding to position at different times.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flow chart showing a sequence of steps that can be undertaken when it is desired to display a stored position on a map. At step <b>70</b> the smartphone <b>2</b> receives instructions to locate a particular electronic cigarette <b>4</b>. This may be achieved by the user selecting an icon on the display screen <b>22</b> that indicates the device type or ID for the desired electronic cigarette. Often a user will have more than one electronic cigarette so this can allow the user to select the desired device. At step <b>72</b> the smartphone <b>2</b> is adapted to retrieve a stored position for the selected electronic cigarette from the data storage unit <b>28</b>. In particular, the smartphone <b>2</b> can retrieve the most recent stored position for the selected electronic cigarette <b>4</b>, even if no connection is present between the smartphone <b>2</b> and the electronic cigarette <b>4</b>. At step <b>74</b> the smartphone <b>2</b> can display the most recent stored position on a map on the display screen <b>22</b>. At step <b>76</b> the smartphone <b>2</b> can display an indicator at a position on the map corresponding to the position retrieved from the data storage unit <b>26</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> the display screen <b>22</b> shows a map including the current position of the smartphone <b>25</b> and an icon <b>27</b> that is indicative of the last known geographic position <b>27</b> of the electronic cigarette <b>4</b>. In this way, the user can be assisted in locating the electronic cigarette <b>4</b>, if it has been misplaced.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The icon <b>27</b> is displayed on the map in a first colour when no connection is present between the smartphone <b>2</b> and the electronic cigarette <b>4</b>. The icon <b>27</b> is displayed in a second colour when a connection is established.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The smartphone <b>2</b> can also be used to provide a beaconing signal to the electronic cigarette <b>4</b> when a connection is established between the two devices. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flow chart showing a sequence of steps that can be undertaken in a beaconing operation. At step <b>100</b> the user can indicate that they wish to send a beaconing signal to the electronic cigarette <b>4</b>. In this example, this is achieved by the user selecting the icon <b>27</b> for the electronic cigarette <b>4</b> displayed on the map. At step <b>102</b> the smartphone <b>2</b> is configured to determine an estimated physical separation to the electronic cigarette <b>4</b>. This can be achieved in different ways, depending on the method used to establish a communicative interaction. If a cable is used then the estimated separation may correspond to the normal length of the cable. If Bluetooth&#xae; is used then the estimated separation may be inversely proportional to the signal strength received at the smartphone <b>2</b>. At step <b>104</b> the smartphone <b>2</b> is configured to transmit a beaconing signal to the electronic cigarette <b>4</b>. The beaconing signal is received at the electronic cigarette <b>4</b> and, in response, at step <b>105</b> the electronic cigarette <b>4</b> can issue an audible alert. In this example the motor <b>20</b> in the electronic cigarette <b>4</b> is used to generate a vibration. Properties of the vibration generated by the motor <b>20</b> are proportional to the estimation of the separation distance calculated at step <b>102</b>. In one arrangement the period between a series of vibrations can be selected according to the estimated separation distance. The vibrations are preferably loud enough to be heard by the user so that they can easily locate the electronic cigarette <b>4</b>. The vibration can be cancelled by the smartphone <b>2</b> or the electronic cigarette <b>4</b> by pressing a button or a selectable item on the display screen <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an exemplary embodiment of a system according to the present invention including a smartphone <b>2</b> within a system <b>200</b> based on two parts: a frontend system <b>202</b> and a backend system <b>204</b>.
