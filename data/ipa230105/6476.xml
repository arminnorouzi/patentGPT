wearable device, a chip card and a system.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a wireless charging process in which a smartphone <b>102</b> is charged wirelessly by means of a wireless energy charger <b>106</b> in accordance with a wireless charging standard (for example a Qi charging station or a comparable apparatus that uses another standard; charger for short).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The smartphone <b>102</b> is located in a smartphone case <b>108</b>, which corresponds to a conventional storage method, in which case chip cards <b>104</b> are also stored, the chip cards being set up for near-field communication (NFC), for example as pure contactless chip cards or for example as dual-interface chip cards, and/or other contactless cards such as, for example, key cards which use RFID (radio frequency identification) technology.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">If the chip cards <b>104</b> are left in the case <b>108</b> during the charging process, they are highly likely to be damaged.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This is because, even though the standardized chargers <b>106</b> are set up to detect metallic foreign objects in the charging area and to interrupt the charging process for safety reasons, the chargers <b>106</b> are sometimes not set up to identify wearables (for example the chip cards <b>104</b>), which are set up for contactless communication and not provided for the charging process, or they are set up to identify wearables at most with considerable outlay and/or a certain efficiency (see aspect below).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This means that the charging process is carried out (for example restarted and/or continued) even in a situation as described above in which the chip card <b>104</b> is located in the charging area. The chip card <b>104</b> made then be compelled to take up energy and convert it to heat, which may damage the chip card.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Currently established or planned measures for preventing damage to wearables (also referred to as wearable devices or contactless devices for, for example, NFC, RFID, for example the chip cards <b>104</b>) caused by wireless energy chargers <b>106</b> may relate to the contactless devices, the chargers <b>106</b> or to both and may be, for example, the following:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">1. The contactless device may be set up to detect a high energy supply to the contactless device and to provide a structure which is suitable for withstanding and/or diverting and/or consuming even high amounts of energy without being damaged. To this end, for example, special antennas and/or additional capacitors are used.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, such chip-based measures are expensive and complex.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">2. In a situation as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in which the smartphone <b>102</b> itself is set up as an NFC/RFID receiver, the smartphone <b>102</b> may be set up to detect the simultaneous presence of the charger and the contactless device and to warn a user and/or the charger so that the contactless device can be removed or the charger can be switched off. This measure can be implemented without additional hardware and with at most moderate software modifications.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">For this measure, however, it is necessary that the mobile telephone is capable of NFC/RFID and the function is activated and that the charger is also set up to receive the message. It is not possible to use this measure to prevent damage to a contactless device which is brought into the charging area without a smartphone or with a smartphone not capable of NFC/RFID or a smartphone capable of NFC/RFID in which the NFC/RFID is deactivated.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">3. The charger may itself be fitted with an NFC/RFID reader which is set up to detect a contactless device in the charging area and to switch off the charger. The NFC/RFID reader may comprise an additional antenna, for example.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Although this additional hardware provision may enable a reliable function, may be purely on the charger side so that the smartphone and the contactless device manage without adjustments and may be able to be used for additional functions (for example payment functions), the charger is significantly more complex and expensive to manufacture as a result.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Various exemplary aspects provide a wearable device or a chip card which comprises an additional device which is designed so that the foreign object detection already integrated as standard in wireless energy chargers in accordance with a wireless charging standard (for example a Qi station or a comparable apparatus that uses another standard; (charger for short) is triggered.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In various exemplary aspects, the device may be formed as an electrically conductive structure arranged in a manner electrically insulated from a chip and an antenna of the wearable device or the chip card.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The device may be formed, for example, as a metal surface, as a metal ring or as an antenna or resonant circuit tuned to a charging frequency of the charger.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Exemplary aspects of the disclosure are illustrated in the figures and are explained in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the figures:</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a wireless charging process for charging a smartphone;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>D</figref> each show a schematic illustration of a wearable device, for example illustrated as a chip card, in accordance with various exemplary aspects; and</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a schematic illustration of a system in accordance with various exemplary aspects.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form part of said description and show, for illustration, specific aspects in which the aspects of the disclosure can be performed. In this respect, direction terminology, for instance &#x201c;at the top&#x201d;, &#x201c;at the bottom&#x201d;, &#x201c;at the front&#x201d;, &#x201c;at the rear&#x201d;, &#x201c;front&#x201d;, &#x201c;rear&#x201d;, etc., is used with reference to the orientation of the described figure(s). Since components of aspects can be positioned in a number of different orientations, the direction terminology is used for illustration and is not restrictive in any way. It goes without saying that other aspects can be used and structural or logical changes can be made without departing from the scope of protection of the present disclosure. It goes without saying that the features of the various exemplary aspects described herein can be combined with one another, unless specifically stated otherwise. The following detailed description therefore should not be interpreted in a restrictive sense, and the scope of protection of the present disclosure is defined by the attached claims.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Within the scope of this description, the terms &#x201c;linked,&#x201d; &#x201c;connected,&#x201d; and &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; are used to describe both a direct and an indirect link, a direct or indirect connection, and direct or indirect coupling. In the figures, identical or similar elements are provided with identical reference signs if expedient.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Wireless energy chargers often use a direct Q measurement in order to detect the presence of an object in the charging area of said chargers (for example on a transfer surface). In the direct Q measurement, changes in the quality factor (Q factor) of a transmitter coil or changes in the inductance thereof or the resistance thereof are monitored.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In other methods, changes in a capacity value, a reflectivity or a transmissivity, a weight, a pressure, a resonance at 1 MHz and/or a metal detection by means of additional coils are used.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The Qi standard contains information about the foreign object detection which is used in accordance with the standard and which is based on a method that detects and analyzes a shift in resonance and has similarities to the change in the quality factor.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The fact that most (if not all) receivers also induce a change in the resistance can be used to improve the detection accuracy but does not permit any assertion about whether the detected object would absorb enough energy during a charging process in order to noticeably heat up.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In various exemplary aspects, wearable devices such as, for example, chip cards (smartcards), key fobs, bracelets, necklaces, watches or rings are supplemented so that they are able to trigger foreign object detection of a wireless energy charger configured in accordance with standards.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The supplement may be designed as an electrically conductive device, for example as a metal object, for example a metal layer or a metal ring with a minimum surface area, or as a resonant circuit at a resonant frequency that corresponds to a charging frequency of the charger. The conductive device may be embedded, for example, in the wearable device, for example the chip card.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>D</figref> each show a schematic illustration of a wearable device <b>204</b>, for example illustrated as a chip card <b>204</b>, in accordance with various exemplary aspects. In various exemplary aspects which are not illustrated, the wearable device may be formed as a key fob, bracelet, necklace, watch, ring or other wearable device <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The wearable device <b>204</b> comprises an antenna structure <b>226</b> and a chip having a receiver which is electrically coupled to the antenna structure <b>226</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> as chip module <b>224</b>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the electrical coupling is also illustrated as an electrically conductive connection between the chip/receiver (in this case the chip module <b>224</b>) and the antenna structure <b>226</b>. As an alternative, the electrical coupling may also be formed as an inductive coupling, for example as what is known as a coil-on-module coupling.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The chip having the receiver may be set up to receive radio signals by means of the antenna structure <b>226</b>, for example radio signals from an external reader, for example a payment device or an access control device. Radio signals can be received (and radio signals may also possibly be sent, that is to say contactless communication) essentially as known in the prior art, for example as near-field communication (NFC) or as RFID technology. A carrier frequency of the received radio signals may be, for example, approximately 13.56 MHz.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The wearable device <b>204</b> may also comprise a device <b>220</b> which is arranged in or on the wearable device <b>204</b>, which device may comprise electrically conductive material and which may be set up to trigger foreign object detection in a wireless energy charger <b>330</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) in accordance with a wireless charging standard for wirelessly charging an electronic device such as, for example, the wearable device <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The wireless charging standard may be, for example, the Qi standard, the Powermat standard, the Rezence standard, the Open Dots standard or the international standard IEC 62368-1, or possibly a similar type of standard that already exists or is established in the future.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The foreign object detection can be triggered, for example, based on a load take-up from radio waves emitted by the wireless energy charger <b>330</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The load may be present in the form of eddy currents, for example.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">This may be the case, in particular, when the device <b>220</b> is formed as an annular (as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>) or closed surface (as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the chip cards <b>204</b> are illustrated as dual-interface chip cards, for example. Although the contact surfaces provided in the chip modules <b>224</b> of the dual-interface cards are made of metal, they are not suitable for triggering the foreign object detection in particular because the structuring thereof into several small individual surfaces means that eddy currents are not produced to a significant extent, in particular not to an extent that exceeds a threshold value for the foreign object detection.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">By way of example, the Qi standard is cited, which describes as a reference object that is detected by the foreign object detection a metal structure in the form of a circular area with a diameter of 22 mm and a thickness of 0.1 mm. An aluminum material (AlSiIMg1Mn 100 Hv) is specified as the material for the metal structure.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">By way of example, the international standard IEC 62368-1 is also cited, which describes three reference objects: a metal structure in the form of a circular area with a diameter of 15 mm and a thickness of 1 mm and made of steel 1.1011/RFe 160, a metal structure in the form of a circular area with a diameter of 20 mm and a thickness of 0.1 mm and made of 99.5% aluminum, and a metal structure in the form of a ring with a diameter of 22 mm and a thickness of 1 mm and made from an aluminum material (AlSiIMg1Mn 100 Hv).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Depending on the relevant standard, the device <b>220</b> can be designed in various exemplary aspects so that the design thereof, for example shape, size and material, corresponds to a reference object of a standard. The device <b>220</b> can be designed so that the dimensions thereof correspond at least to those of one of the reference objects, and the material of the device <b>220</b> can be selected so that it corresponds to the material of the corresponding reference object.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">For example, the device <b>220</b> may be formed in the manner of a circular area with a diameter of at least 15 mm, for example at least 20 mm, for example at least 22 mm, where a maximum size is restricted by dimensions of the wearable device <b>204</b>, for example by a width of the chip card <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">For example, the device <b>220</b> may be formed in the manner of a ring with a diameter of at least 20 mm, for example at least 22 mm, where a maximum size is restricted by dimensions of the wearable device <b>204</b>, for example by a width of the chip card <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">A thickness of the device may be, for example, between approximately 0.1 mm and approximately 1 mm.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In various exemplary aspects, the device may be made of aluminum, an aluminum material (for example AlSiIMg1Mn 100 Hv), steel, or another suitable electrically conductive material, for example another metal.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In various exemplary aspects, the device <b>220</b> can be formed so that the load take-up is not carried out in the form of eddy currents but by means of an electrical resonant circuit at a resonant frequency that corresponds to a charging frequency of the wireless energy charger <b>330</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A charging frequency of the wireless energy charger <b>330</b> is to be understood in this case as a frequency that is suitable for charging the wireless energy charger <b>330</b>. This may be, for example, a rated frequency that is provided for charging.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The frequency at which charging takes place, for example in accordance with the Qi standard, is 150 kHz, and a corresponding load take-up can be easily detected by the resonant circuit. In order to meet charging specifications, a resonant circuit with a low Q factor can be used.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Other charging frequencies provided are for example 360 kHz (for example Apple), 87 kHz, or for example 205 kHz.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In accordance with various exemplary aspects, the charging frequency can be set anywhere within a tolerance range. Accordingly, the electrical resonant circuit that is formed by the device <b>220</b> can be set up for a power take-up within the tolerance range, for example for a charging frequency, which is in a range of 330 kHz+/&#x2212;100 kHz.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">This is illustrated, by way of example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>. The device <b>220</b> designed as a resonant circuit may comprise, for example, an antenna <b>2201</b> and a capacitor <b>220</b>C, which are electrically conductively connected to one another.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In various exemplary aspects, the device <b>220</b> can be formed as a structured metallization layer.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The metallization layer can be formed on an electrically insulating carrier layer in a manner substantially known from chip card production, for example. For example, the metallization layer can be structured, for example by means of a mask, on the carrier layer, for example a plastic (for example PET) carrier layer. As an alternative or in addition, the metallization layer can be formed on the carrier layer over the entire surface or substantially over the entire surface, and can then be structured (for example by means of etching).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In various exemplary aspects, the device <b>220</b> together with the antenna <b>226</b> can form a joint structured metallization layer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows a corresponding exemplary aspect. The antenna <b>226</b> and the device <b>220</b> may comprise or consist of the same material, and they may be formed or they may have been formed at the same time or substantially at the same time. The antenna <b>226</b> and the device <b>220</b> can be arranged together on one side of the carrier layer, together on both sides of the carrier layer (and possibly each be connected by means of vias to form continuous lines), or together on one side of the carrier layer while either the device <b>220</b> or the antenna <b>226</b> is also formed on the second side of carrier layer.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In various exemplary aspects, the antenna <b>226</b> and the device <b>220</b> may comprise different materials.
