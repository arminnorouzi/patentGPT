Fitness enthusiasts may consider joining fitness clubs in order to access a variety of equipment and workout classes for a total body workout. However, fitness clubs are often expensive and crowded. Additionally, it may be inconvenient and inefficient to spend time traveling to and from a fitness club during designated hours. Accordingly, home fitness equipment has been highly sought after in recent years.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Owning fitness equipment at home allows fitness enthusiasts to avoid fitness club membership fees, waiting for equipment during busy gym hours, and wasting time traveling to and from fitness clubs. However, home fitness equipment can be expensive, often takes up a lot of space in a home or office, and is typically limited to a very specific workout type or muscle system. In one particular example, U.S. Pat. No. 8,734,306 teaches a resistance apparatus including a track, a vertical slide, and a resistance band. However, the device is not portable and is limited to a very specific workout. In another example, U.S. Pat. No. 8,690,742 teaches a physical training apparatus including a wall station, a floor station, and a resistance band. However, the apparatus takes up a lot of space and must be mounted to both the floor and the wall. In yet another example, U.S. Pat. No. 9,149,677 teaches exercise equipment that is mounted to a door during use. Undesirably, the equipment offers limited options for customization. Additionally, the equipment requires that a door be available and may cause damage to the door during use.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, there is a continuing need for home fitness equipment that is easy to use, store, and transport, and that is low-cost and capable of providing a full body workout. Desirably, the home fitness equipment is durable, customizable, and fun to use.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In concordance with the instant disclosure, a fitness device that is easy to use, store, and transport, and that is low-cost, capable of providing a full body workout, durable, customizable, and fun to use, has surprisingly been discovered.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In certain embodiments, a fitness device includes a main body, a left wing extending outwardly from the main body in a first direction, and a right wing extending outwardly from the main body in a second direction opposite the first direction. A cable extends from the main body to each of the left wing and the right wing. The fitness device further includes a gearbox, a spool assembly connected to an input end of the gearbox, a brake assembly connected to an output end of the gearbox, and a pulley assembly.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In certain embodiments, a fitness system includes a fitness device, a software application, and a remote device. The fitness device includes a main body, a left wing extending outwardly from the main body in a first direction, and a right wing extending outwardly from the main body in a second direction opposite the first direction. A cable extends from the main body to each of the left wing and the right wing. The fitness device further includes a gearbox, a spool assembly connected to an input end of the gearbox, a brake assembly connected to an output end of the gearbox, and a pulley assembly.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In certain embodiments, a method of using a fitness device comprises the step of providing a fitness device. The fitness device includes a main body, a left wing extending outwardly from the main body in a first direction, and a right wing extending outwardly from the main body in a second direction opposite the first direction. A cable extends from the main body to each of the left wing and the right wing. The fitness device further includes a gearbox, a spool assembly connected to an input end of the gearbox, a brake assembly connected to an output end of the gearbox, and a pulley assembly. Additional steps include positioning the fitness device in a desired location and orientation, securing the fitness device in a selected position, adjusting a setting on the fitness device, and selectively engaging the cable.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In certain embodiments, a fitness device for full body fitness is provided. The fitness device may have a main body, a left wing with a left cable, and a right wing with a right cable. The main body is centrally positioned between the left wing and right wing, such that the left wing and right wing extend out in opposite directions from one another. The main body, the left wing, and/or the right wing may be manufactured from wood, metal, plastic, and/or a composite. However, it should be appreciated that a skilled artisan may employ different materials for constructing the main body, the left wing, and the right wing as desired. The main body may include a gearbox with a gearbox shaft, a spool, and a braking mechanism. The spool may be connected to an input end of the gearbox shaft via a one-way clutch. The left cable and/or the right cable may be wrapped around the spool. The gearbox may be configured to reduce or increase the rotation of the gearbox shaft. The gearbox shaft may be configured to rotate in one direction when a user pulls either or both of the left cable and/or the right cable. The pulling of either or both of the left cable and the right cable unspools the left cable and/or the right cable from about the spool. The one-way clutch may be configured to transmit torque from the user pulling on the left cable and/or the right cable to the gearbox shaft in the one direction while stopping torque transmission in the opposite direction. The gearbox may multiply the torque by a factor of thirty (1:30 ratio). It should be appreciated that a skilled artisan may scale the gearbox ratio to be higher or lower, within the scope of this disclosure. Advantageously, by using the gearbox shaft to rotate both the left cable and/or the right cable, the user may experience resistance uniformly across the left cable and right cable, which may militate against balance issue between left cable and right cable. It should be appreciated that one skilled in the art may employ different technologies for the gearbox shaft, within the scope of this disclosure. The balance is attained by using one brake mechanism for both left and right.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The main body of the fitness device may further include a return spring. The return spring may be configured to wind back the left cable and/or the right cable on the spool without causing the gearbox shaft to rotate in the one direction. The return spring may include a first spring lock and a second spring lock. A center of the return spring may be affixed to the first spring lock via a slot. The first spring lock may be configured to be disposed adjacent to the gearbox shaft. In particular, the first spring lock may be connected to a hole in a back housing of the fitness device and a mounting hole of the gearbox. The second spring lock may be disposed adjacent to the spool. An end of the return spring may be affixed to the second spring lock. When the spool rotates, the end of the return spring also rotates, while the center of the spring remains stationary and affixed to the first spring lock. Desirably, this will cause the return spring to be pulled back once the user stops pulling the left cable and/or the right cable. However, it should be appreciated that a skilled artisan may employ different return mechanisms to wind the left cable and/or the right cable, as desired. Each spool has their own return spring. Within the spool, one end will be connected to the rim of the spool and the other end to the spring lock of the respective spool.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Each of the left cable and the right cable may have a loop, a straight pulley, and an inclined pulley. The loop may be configured to attach to a handle to permit the user to pull the left cable and/or the right cable more easily. A non-limiting example of the loop may include a carabiner. The loop may be connected to the straight pulley and the straight pulley may be connected to the inclined pulley. The inclined pulley may be connected to a central pulley, which connects the left cable and/or the right cable to the spool. Desirably, this allows the left cable and/or the right cable to cause the gearbox shaft to rotate in the one direction when the user pulls on the left cable and/or the right cable. Although this configuration has shown to be useful, it should be appreciated that a person skilled in the art may select different technologies for the cable and the gearbox shaft, as desired.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The braking mechanism may be configured to gradually engage with the gearbox shaft to militate against the gearbox shaft from rotating in the one direction. In certain examples, the braking mechanism may include a friction braking mechanism. The braking mechanism may have a brake disc, a knob, a brake shoe, and a brake liner. The brake disc may be connected to an output end of the gearbox. The brake disc may be configured to receive a brake force, which the gearbox may multiply by a factor of thirty. However, it should be appreciated that one skilled in the art may scale the gearbox ratio higher or lower, as desired. The knob may be manually adjusted by the user to move the brake shoe inward, which may push the brake liner towards the brake disc. This may gradually increase the load on the gearbox, which in turn increases the brake force. The brake force militates against the gearbox shaft from rotating in the one direction. In addition, the brake force generates resistance on the left cable and/or the right cable by militating against the gearbox shaft from rotating in the one direction when the user pulls on the left cable and/or the right cable. Advantageously, the resistance generated by the brake force to the left cable and/or the right cable requires the user to apply additional force when pulling the left cable and/or the right cable, thereby allowing the user to build muscles by pulling with the left cable and/or the right cable. It should be appreciated the braking mechanism may also include other suitable braking technologies and methods. Non-limiting examples may include electric braking technologies, fluid braking technologies, air braking technologies, etc.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In certain embodiments, the gearbox shaft may instead be driven by pulling a single cable instead of the left cable and the right cable. The user may pull the single cable with either the left hand, the right hand and/or in combination to drive the gearbox shaft. It is believed that this may result in a better distribution of the resistance felt on both hands. For example, with the left cable and the right cable, the user may unconsciously pull one of the cables with more force because of a dominant hand. With the single cable, the user may be more likely to apply equal amounts of lifting force.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The fitness device may include at least one sensor. It should be appreciated that a skilled artisan may select the sensor to use based on the data to be collected. The sensors may be configured to measure workout data. Non-limiting examples of the workout data may include a current weight the user is experiencing, a number of rotations of the gearbox shaft, and a speed of the rotation of the gearbox shaft. Desirably, the workout data may be used to determine the intensity of the workout. It should be appreciated that a skilled artisan may select other data to be included in the workout data, as desired.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The sensors may include a contact wiper and a hall sensor with a magnet. The contact wiper may be configured to determine a current position of the knob of the braking mechanism. Advantageously, this may allow the sensors to detect the current weight the user is experiencing by determining the current position of the knob. The magnet may be disposed on the spool. The hall sensor may be configured to detect the presence and magnitude of a magnetic field of the magnet, thereby allowing the number of rotations of the gearbox shaft and the speed of the rotation of the gearbox shaft to be determined by the sensors. It should be appreciated that one skilled in the art may employ different sensor technologies for measuring the workout data, within the scope of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In certain examples, the fitness device may further include a software application. The software application may be configured to receive the workout data from the plurality of sensors and display the workout data to the user. The software application may also be configured to permit the user to interface with the software application to configure settings on the fitness device and/or select predetermined exercise programs. The pre-programmed exercise programs may control the fitness device automatically according to an exercise regimen. For example, the braking mechanism may include a braking motor. The braking motor may be configured to automatically rotate the knob of the braking mechanism to adjust the current weight the user is experiencing according to the exercise program. The software application may include a mobile application, desktop application, a web application, and/or a virtual reality/augmented reality application.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The software platform may be further configured to receive an auditory command from the user. Desirably, the auditory command may be used to control the fitness device. In certain examples, when the software application is a mobile application, the user may transmit the auditory command through a microphone on a mobile device, which the software platform may then use to control the fitness device. For example, the user may use an auditory command to instruct the fitness device to adjust the current weight the user is experiencing via the braking motor moving the knob. It should be appreciated that a skilled artisan may employ different functions and features for the software application, as desired. A microphone may also be incorporated on the fitness equipment itself for fully standalone voice activated workouts without help of a smartphone or mobile application.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The fitness device may further include a speaker. The speaker may be configured to emit audio feedback. For example, the speaker may emit exercise instructions, according to the exercise program. Another example may include emitting music, which the user may listen to while using the fitness device. In certain examples, the speaker may include a wireless speaker. It should be appreciated that a person skilled in the art may utilize the speaker in different ways to enable more features for the fitness device.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The fitness device may include a built-in rechargeable battery. The battery may be used to provide power to the electronic components of the fitness device. It should be appreciated that other power sources may also be utilized, within the scope of this disclosure. In yet further examples, the fitness device may also include various mounting accessories. Advantageously, the mounting accessories may be used to affix the fitness device to the walls, doors, windows, etc. Desirably, this may allow the user to perform exercises where the left cable and/or the right cable is engaged from an elevated position.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In certain embodiments, a method for using the fitness device for full body fitness may include providing the fitness device. The user may selectively pull the left cable and/or the right cable. The gearbox shaft may be rotated in the one direction by the left cable and/or the right cable. The braking mechanism may be gradually engaged with the gearbox shaft, thereby generating a brake force. The brake force may create resistance on the left cable and/or the right cable when pulled by the user.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Advantageously, the fitness device and the method may be used for full body fitness. In addition, the gearbox shaft and the braking mechanism may allow the fitness device to be compact and easy to use.

Using the fitness device <b>100</b> in a variety of positions and orientations allows the user to exercise a variety of muscle groups in a variety of different ways. Likewise, using the fitness device <b>100</b> in combination with a variety of accessories and with a variety of training applications allows the user to create customized, inventive, and fun exercise programs.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Advantageously, the fitness device <b>100</b> is useful for any fitness level, beginner to expert, and eliminates the need to purchase and store additional equipment as exercise needs evolve. Beginner users may select zero resistance or a low level of resistance while using the fitness device <b>100</b>. Expert users may increase resistance over time, as needed. More specifically, according to certain embodiments, the gearbox <b>130</b> and the brake assembly <b>132</b> may be used in combination to generate the desired resistance. The user avoids purchasing additional equipment such as free weights and adding and removing additional equipment during use of the fitness device <b>100</b>. In certain more particular embodiments, the fitness device <b>100</b> may provide up to or more than three-hundred pounds of resistance.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">It should be appreciated that using the same brake assembly <b>132</b> for resistance with respect to both the left end cable <b>110</b> and the right end cable <b>112</b> militates against having disproportionate resistance on one side of the fitness device <b>100</b> versus the other side of the fitness device <b>100</b>, thereby allowing the user to experience a balanced exercise program benefiting the user's right and left muscle systems equally. Additionally, the pulley assembly <b>210</b> including any angular adjustments made to the pulley supports <b>216</b> at the second location <b>230</b> and the cover <b>220</b> at the first location <b>228</b> allows for a smooth user experience pulling the cable <b>108</b> from the fitness device <b>100</b> and militates against the cable <b>108</b> scraping at the exit point <b>226</b>, thereby preventing unnecessary wear and tear due to friction. Advantageously, this increases the lifespan of the fitness device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The conical or tapered outer surface <b>136</b> on the central spool <b>142</b> ensures that the cable <b>108</b> self-aligns on the central spool <b>142</b> without any entanglement. Advantageously, the user experiences a smoother pull of the cable <b>108</b> compared to pulling an unevenly wound spool. In certain embodiments including the first one-way bearing <b>170</b> and the second one-way bearing, the user may seamlessly switch from working out with one handle <b>116</b> to two handles <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Using a multi-stage planetary gearbox <b>130</b> with helical gears advantageously allows the fitness device <b>100</b> to achieve optimal gear ratios within the confined space of the main body <b>102</b>. Additionally, using helical gears results in a better sound signature and lower noise levels. The larger gear ratio achieved using the gearbox <b>130</b> means only one brake assembly <b>132</b> including one brake disc <b>172</b> and one brake liner <b>180</b> is needed to adequately apply friction to the gearbox <b>130</b>. Using a brake system requiring multiple friction pads undesirably results in suboptimal brake force in general and uneven brake force being applied to the left cable end <b>110</b> and the right cable <b>112</b> end. Advantageously, using a single brake assembly <b>132</b> eliminates issues relating to suboptimal and uneven brake force by relying on a single brake disc <b>172</b> and brake liner <b>180</b> and using the gearbox <b>130</b> to multiply the brake assembly's <b>132</b> effect. The resistance experienced by the user on the user's left and right sides will be the same. The gearbox <b>130</b> may be activated by pulling only one of the left end cable <b>110</b> and the right end cable <b>112</b>, or by pulling both at the same time. Advantageously, using a single cable <b>108</b> militates against the user applying unequal amounts of force on one side versus another side of the fitness device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Advantageously, the fitness device <b>100</b> used in combination with smart technology, such as the software application, allows the user to select an exercise program categorized and optimized using any desired criteria, such as muscle group, body system, fitness level, and workout type, as non-limiting examples.
