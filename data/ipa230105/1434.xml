This packaging assembly finds its application for example in the field of cosmetics.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">PRIOR ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In cosmetics, the packaging is an important aspect of the value that the user attributes to a product. Thus, manufacturers pay particular attention to the packaging assemblies and containers that contain the products.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In an ecological as well as economical approach, users would like to be able to refill their cosmetic product container when it is empty, rather than throwing away the packaging assembly. There is therefore a need for a new type of packaging assembly for cosmetic products.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To this end, the present disclosure relates to a packaging assembly for a cosmetic product, comprising a container able to contain said product, and an insert carrying a dispensing member and dismountably mounted on the container to allow, when it is mounted on the container, the dispensing of product by the dispensing member, in which the insert is configured to cooperate with the container so that during the movement of mounting and/or dismounting of the insert on/from the container, the insert passes successively through a first position in which the force required for said movement reaches a first local maximum, and a second position in which said force reaches a second local maximum.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The dispensing member allows the dispensing of the cosmetic product when it is mounted on the container. Thus, the cosmetic product can pass through the dispensing member, which is for example of the pump or valve type.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The first and second positions may be intermediate positions in the movement, that is to say positions which are neither at the start nor at the end of the movement of mounting/dismounting of the insert on/from the container. In other words, the dismounting movement may start before the first position and continue after the second position, and vice versa for the mounting movement. In the present disclosure, the abbreviation mounting/dismounting means mounting and/or dismounting, that is to say also at least one of the mounting and of the dismounting.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The force required for the movement is to be understood in the broad sense and encompasses, in the case of a rotation typically, the notion of torque.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">By definition of a local maximum, the force required for said movement is, just before and just after the first position, smaller than the force required for said movement exactly at the first position. In other words, at the first position, the user feels a hard spot, a resistance, whose overcoming requires a locally increased force. The same applies for the second position, it being understood that the first local maximum and the second local maximum may have the same value or different values.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thanks to the fact that the insert is dismountably mounted on the container and that the movement of its mounting/dismounting on/from the container requires passing the two aforementioned local maxima, the user can dismount and remount the insert as desired for refilling the container, while ensuring, thanks to the two hard spots, a satisfactory closing of the packaging assembly, both objectively and subjectively for the user.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, one element among the insert and the container induces on the other element among the insert and the container an elastic deformation when passing the first position and the second position. A local maximum force may correspond to a local maximum deformation of said other element. The elastic deformation makes it easy to achieve the local maximum force while ensuring the reversibility of the mounting and the dismounting.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, in the first position, a notch of the insert cooperates with a boss of the container, and in the second position, said notch or another notch of the insert cooperates with said boss or another boss of the container. Several variants can be envisaged, among which: the insert comprises at least one notch and the container comprises at least two bosses, the notch successively cooperating with each of the bosses, or the insert comprises at least two notches and the container comprises at least one boss, the boss cooperating successively with each of the notches, or the insert comprises at least two notches and the container comprises at least two bosses, one of the notches cooperating with one of the bosses then the other notch cooperating with the other boss.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">For reasons of brevity but without loss of generality, it will be assumed hereafter that the insert comprises a notch and the container comprises two bosses, but all the detailed properties concerning the notches and the bosses can be transposed to the other configurations.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Each notch-boss pair may further be duplicated, for example to ensure a good distribution of the forces and a symmetrical and balanced feeling for the user. For example, the insert may comprise at least two notches, for example five (or any number of) distributed notches, each of these notches cooperating with a first boss in the first position and a second boss in the second position. There are therefore five notch-boss pairs in the first position and five notch-boss pairs in the second position, even if, for reasons of brevity, only one notch, a first boss and a second boss are described. It should be noted, moreover, that some first bosses may coincide with some second bosses; for example, the first boss cooperating with a notch in the first position may act as a second boss cooperating with another notch in the second position.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The notches and bosses may refer to projections or protrusions of any kind, including tab-type elements.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Saying that a notch and a boss cooperate means that they are mutually bearing against each other, for example in the direction of the mounting/dismounting movement. For example, when said movement comprises a rotation, a notch and a boss may bear against each other in the circumferential direction, possibly so as to cause radial deformation of the insert.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, each said notch of the insert projects towards the container and each said boss of the container projects towards the insert.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, the container comprises a threading for the mounting of the insert, the boss or bosses being provided on an annular bead located on one side of the threading. For example, the bead may have a variable thickness forming the bosses. The bead may further have local recesses. The bead facilitates the manufacture of the bosses.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, the insert has a tubular wall from which the notch projects, the wall having a reference thickness on a portion relatively away from the notch and a thinned thickness compared to the reference thickness on a portion relatively close to the notch. In other words, the thickness of the wall is thinned in the vicinity of the notch. The deformation of the insert in the vicinity of the notch is thus facilitated and the deformation induced on portions of the insert relatively away from the notch is limited. The resistance of the insert to numerous mounting/dismounting movements is therefore improved.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, the insert has a generally annular shape including a flat from which the notch projects. The notch may project inwardly or outwardly of the insert. A flat designates a rectilinear, relatively flattened or planar, portion which may be possibly provided along a chord of the general annular shape, that is to say along a line segment passing inside the general annular shape. In these embodiments, the presence of the flat leaves a space in which the insert can deform, in this case in the vicinity of the notch, which facilitates the deformation of the insert and therefore the mounting/dismounting movement. The interaction between the insert and the other parts is thereby also limited, which further contributes to the longevity of the packaging assembly.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, the container has a neck defining an opening and the insert is configured to be mounted on the neck of the container.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, the movement of mounting and/or dismounting of the insert on/from the container comprises a rotation of the insert relative to the container and the first position is located at 90&#xb0; or less from the second position. Thus, the successive bosses (and/or the successive notches, as applicable) corresponding to the first position and to the second position are arranged at an angular distance of 90&#xb0; or less. The angle of 90&#xb0; or less may be measured about the axis which serves as axis of rotation for the rotational movement of the insert relative to the container.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Furthermore, the mounting/dismounting movement may comprise, in addition to the aforementioned rotation, a translation of the insert relative to the container. The translation may be concomitant with the rotation, typically in the case of a helical movement, for example when the insert and the container cooperate by a threading. Alternatively, the translation may occur before or after the rotation, typically in the case of a bayonet-type movement.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, the packaging assembly further comprises a masking hoop assembled to the insert. The masking hoop may be provided for essentially aesthetic reasons and be assembled to the insert by means known per se, typically clamping, bonding, hooping, crimping, etc.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, the masking hoop has, at one end, a rounded portion configured to come into contact with the container. The fact that a rounded portion of the masking hoop comes into contact with the container allows effectively hiding the insert while ensuring a soft contact between the hoop and the container, this soft contact limiting the wear of the container during the mounting/dismounting movement. In other words, at said end, the portion configured to come into contact with the container is devoid of sharp ridge which would otherwise risk scratching the container or damaging the decoration provided on the container, a fortiori given the relatively frequent mounting/dismounting that such a packaging assembly is intended to undergo. In addition, the fact that a portion is rounded can provide the end with a certain elasticity that allows it to accommodate any possible mounting clearances.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, the packaging assembly further comprises a gasket configured to be compressed during the mounting of the insert on the container. The gasket may be mounted between the insert and the container. The gasket may be compressed when the insert is beyond the second position, even possibly when the insert is between the first position and the second position.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, the insert may be made of polymer, for example polypropylene. Independently, in some embodiments, the container may be made of transparent or translucent material, for example glass. It is noted that the aforementioned elastic deformation is preferably provided to occur at least on the most elastic element among the insert and the container.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Other characteristics and advantages of the object of the present disclosure will emerge from the following description of embodiments, given by way of non-limiting examples, with reference to the appended figures.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of a packaging assembly according to one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a bottom perspective view of an insert according to one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the packaging assembly along the plane III-III of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, at the start of a movement of dismounting of the insert from the container.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the packaging assembly along the plane III-III of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, at a later stage than that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> during the movement of dismounting of the insert on the container.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the packaging assembly along the plane III-III of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, at a later stage than that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> during the movement of dismounting of the insert from the container.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the packaging assembly along the plane III-III of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, at a later stage than that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> during the movement of dismounting of the insert from the container.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the packaging assembly along the plane III-III of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, at a later stage than that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> during the movement of dismounting of the insert from the container.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a longitudinal sectional view along the plane IV-IV of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A packaging assembly <b>10</b> according to one embodiment is presented with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>4</b></figref>. The packaging assembly <b>10</b> comprises a container <b>20</b> able to contain a cosmetic product, such as a liquid, pasty or powdery product. In this case, the container <b>20</b> is of the bottle type, comprising a body <b>18</b> and a neck <b>22</b> projecting from the body and defining an opening. The container may be made of glass or any other desired material. The body <b>18</b> may have decorative patterns such as colors, reliefs, inscriptions, etc.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The opening of the neck <b>22</b> extends about an axis X defining an axial direction. A radial direction is a direction perpendicular to this axis and intersecting this axis. Similarly, an axial plane is a plane containing the axis of the opening X and a radial plane is a plane perpendicular to this axis. A circumference is understood as a circle belonging to a radial plane and whose center belongs to the axis X. A tangential or circumferential direction is a direction tangent to a circumference; it is perpendicular to the axis X but does not pass through the axis.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Furthermore, the packaging assembly <b>10</b> comprises an insert <b>30</b> carrying a dispensing member <b>40</b>. The insert <b>30</b> forms an interface for assembling the dispensing member <b>40</b> to the container <b>20</b>. In this case, the insert <b>30</b> is dismountably mounted on the container <b>20</b>, and more particularly here on the neck <b>22</b>. The dispensing member <b>40</b> may be assembled to the insert <b>30</b> by means known per se, for example by bonding, crimping, etc. Alternatively, the insert <b>30</b> may form a part of the dispensing member <b>40</b>, for example by being integrally formed with a pump body or the like.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The dispensing member <b>40</b>, here of the pump type known per se, may comprise a dispensing head <b>42</b> and a dip tube <b>44</b>. Thus, in this embodiment, the insert <b>30</b> supports a pump body. More generally, when the insert <b>30</b> is mounted on the container <b>20</b>, the dispensing member <b>40</b> allows the dispensing of the product contained in the container <b>20</b>, in this case by pressure on the dispensing head <b>42</b>. As illustrated more particularly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a gasket <b>46</b> such as a flat ring gasket may be mounted on the insert <b>30</b> or, as represented, on the dispensing member <b>40</b>. The gasket <b>46</b> is configured to be compressed during the mounting of the insert <b>30</b> on the container <b>20</b>, in this case between the distal end of the neck <b>22</b> and the dispensing member <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Furthermore, the packaging assembly may comprise a masking hoop <b>60</b>, optionally provided with a magnet <b>50</b>, and, independently, a cap or cover <b>70</b>. These elements will be described later.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The detail of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> more particularly illustrates the structure of the neck <b>22</b>. The container <b>20</b>, and more particularly the neck <b>22</b>, has a threading <b>24</b> for the mounting of the insert <b>30</b>. The threading <b>24</b> ends with a thread end stop <b>24</b><i>a</i>. The thread end stop projects transversely to the threading <b>24</b>. The threading <b>24</b> projects radially outwardly and is configured to cooperate with a corresponding threading <b>34</b> provided on the insert <b>30</b>, projecting radially inwardly (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). Thus, the insert <b>30</b> can be mounted on/dismounted from the container <b>20</b> by screwing using the threadings <b>24</b>, <b>34</b>. However, other methods of mounting/dismounting between the insert <b>30</b> and the container <b>20</b> are envisaged.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Furthermore, the container <b>20</b> has at least one boss, here a plurality of bosses, more specifically two pairs of bosses <b>26</b><i>b</i>, <b>26</b><i>c</i>. The respective bosses <b>26</b><i>b</i>, <b>26</b><i>c </i>of each pair are diametrically opposite in this case. Thus, the neck may be symmetrical by a 180&#xb0; rotation, that is to say have an invariance by a 2-fold rotation (because) 360&#xb0;=2&#xd7;180&#xb0;. More generally, the neck may have an invariance by an N-fold rotation greater than or equal to 2. As indicated above, only one boss of each pair will be described below.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The bosses <b>26</b><i>b</i>, <b>26</b><i>c </i>may project radially outwardly, and are here provided on the neck <b>22</b>, on one side of the threading <b>24</b>, in this case on the side of the threading <b>24</b> opposite to the opening formed by the neck <b>22</b>. The bosses <b>26</b><i>b</i>, <b>26</b><i>c </i>may project radially beyond the threading <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the bosses <b>26</b><i>b</i>, <b>26</b><i>c </i>may be formed by a bead <b>26</b>, for example a bead of variable thickness. The bead <b>26</b> may be annular about the axis X, it being understood that it can comprise recesses <b>26</b><i>a</i>. Thus, as indicated previously, the bosses <b>26</b><i>b</i>, <b>26</b><i>c </i>may be provided on an annular bead <b>26</b> located on one side of the threading <b>24</b>. In this case, the bead <b>26</b> adjoins the thread end stop <b>24</b><i>a</i>, opposite the threading <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> more particularly represents the insert <b>30</b> and the dispensing member <b>40</b>. In this embodiment, the insert <b>30</b> has a generally annular shape about the axis X. The insert may comprise one or several notches <b>36</b>, in this case here a pair of diametrically opposite notches <b>36</b>. Thus, the insert has an invariance by an N-fold rotation greater than or equal to 2, here N=2. As indicated previously, only one notch <b>36</b> will be described below. The notch <b>36</b> projects inwardly of the insert <b>30</b>, that is to say towards the bosses <b>26</b><i>b</i>, <b>26</b><i>c </i>which, in turn, project towards the notch <b>36</b>. The notch <b>36</b> may include chamfered edges, at least as regards the edges in the circumferential direction, to facilitate its cooperation with the bosses <b>26</b><i>b</i>, <b>26</b><i>c. </i></p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In this embodiment, the wall of the insert <b>30</b> is truncated, radially outside, in line with the notch <b>36</b>. Accordingly, the insert has a flat <b>32</b> from which the notch <b>36</b> projects. Furthermore, this also has the consequence that the tubular wall of the insert <b>30</b>, from which the notch <b>36</b> projects, may have a reduced thickness in the vicinity of the notch <b>36</b>: said wall has a reference radial thickness on a portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>relatively away from the notch <b>36</b> and a thinned radial thickness compared to the reference thickness on a portion <b>31</b><i>b </i>relatively close to the notch <b>36</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The insert <b>30</b> may be made of plastic material, for example polypropylene. To facilitate its manufacture, the insert <b>30</b> may comprise molding castellations <b>38</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The outer diameter of the threading <b>24</b> of the container may be smaller than the inner diameter of the notches <b>36</b>, so that the notches <b>36</b> do not cooperate with the threading <b>24</b> when the insert <b>30</b> is mounted on the container <b>20</b>. During the mounting/dismounting (here screwing/unscrewing) of the insert <b>30</b> on the container <b>20</b>, the notches <b>36</b> cooperate with the bosses <b>26</b><i>b</i>, <b>26</b><i>c </i>according to one example which will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>E</figref>. In this case, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>E</figref> represent a dismounting movement between the insert <b>30</b> and the container <b>20</b>, by unscrewing and therefore rotation of the container <b>20</b> relative to the insert <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrates the initial position, when the insert <b>30</b> is mounted on the container <b>20</b>. In this position, the gasket <b>46</b> is compressed and the sealing of the container <b>20</b> ensured. In this position, the notch <b>36</b> may be facing a recess <b>26</b><i>a </i>of the bead <b>26</b>. The movement of the insert <b>30</b> in the clockwise direction is blocked by the thread end stop <b>24</b><i>a</i>, while the movement in the counterclockwise direction is blocked by the first boss <b>26</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">To initiate the dismounting, a user must rotate the insert <b>30</b> in the counterclockwise direction and, to do so, provide an excess of torque (or more generally of force) so that the notch <b>36</b> passes the first boss <b>26</b><i>b</i>. This situation, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, corresponds to a first position in which the force required for the dismounting movement reaches a first local maximum. For example, the torque required for passing the first boss in the dismounting direction may be set between 40 Newton (N) and 110 N, preferably equal to 55 N.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the first position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the notch <b>36</b> cooperates with the first boss <b>26</b><i>b</i>. The container <b>20</b>, and more particularly the first boss <b>26</b><i>b</i>, induces on the insert <b>30</b> an elastic deformation. In this case, the radial deformation of the insert <b>30</b> is facilitated on the one hand by the presence of the flat <b>32</b>, which provides space radially outside the insert <b>30</b> to accommodate the deformation, and on the other hand by the presence of a portion <b>31</b><i>b </i>of relatively thinned radial thickness which promotes bending in the area of the insert <b>30</b> including the notch <b>36</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">By continuing the rotation of the container <b>20</b> in the counterclockwise direction R, the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> is passed, in which the notch <b>36</b> is located between the two bosses <b>26</b><i>b</i>, <b>26</b><i>c</i>. The shape of the first boss <b>26</b><i>b </i>is not symmetrical: the slope of the first boss <b>26</b><i>b </i>is gentler on the mounting side (side in the direction of the second boss <b>26</b><i>c</i>) than on the dismounting side (opposite side on the second boss <b>26</b><i>c</i>). More generally, the first slope of the first boss <b>26</b><i>b </i>encountered in the dismounting direction is the steepest of the slopes of the bosses <b>26</b><i>b</i>, <b>26</b><i>c</i>. Thanks to these dispositions, the first boss <b>26</b><i>b </i>provides a sharper hard spot guaranteeing better closing during the mounting, additional difficulty during the dismounting and good compression of the gasket <b>46</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The radial thickness of the bead <b>26</b> between the first boss <b>26</b><i>b </i>and the second boss <b>26</b><i>c </i>may be provided sufficiently small to allow the return of the notch <b>36</b> to its rest position, as evidenced by the gap between the notch <b>36</b> and the bead <b>26</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>. Thus, when approaching the next boss which involves a new local force maximum, a significant excess of force must be provided by the user.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, the gasket <b>46</b> may no longer be sufficiently compressed to ensure a closing sealed to the container <b>20</b>. In other embodiments, the gasket <b>46</b> could however be always sufficiently compressed when the notch <b>36</b> is between the two bosses <b>26</b><i>b</i>, <b>26</b><i>c</i>, or more generally, when the mounting/dismounting movement is between the first position and the second position described below.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">By continuing the rotation of the insert <b>30</b> in the counterclockwise direction R, it is necessary to again provide an excess of torque (or more generally of force) so that the notch <b>36</b> passes the second boss <b>26</b><i>c</i>. This situation, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>, corresponds to a second position in which the force required for the dismounting movement reaches a second local maximum. For example, the torque required for passing the second boss in the dismounting direction may be set between 8 N and 25 N, preferably equal to 15 N. It is noted that the values of torques required for passing the first position and the second position may be different (one higher or lower than the other) or identical, and may vary depending on whether a mounting or a dismounting is carried out. Typically, in the mounting direction, the torque required for passing the first boss <b>26</b><i>b </i>may be set between 2 N and 15 N, preferably equal to 6 N and, independently, the torque required for passing the second boss <b>26</b><i>c </i>may be set between 30 N and 45 N, preferably equal to 37 N.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the second position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>, the notch <b>36</b> cooperates with the second boss <b>26</b><i>c</i>. The container <b>20</b>, and more particularly the second boss <b>26</b><i>c</i>, induces on the insert <b>30</b> an elastic deformation similar to the one described with regard to the first position.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>, the first position is located at 90&#xb0; or less from the second position. More particularly, the circumferentially outer ends of the first boss <b>26</b><i>b </i>and of the second boss <b>26</b><i>c </i>may be separated from each other by an angle A about the axis X, the angle A being less than or equal to 90&#xb0;. Alternatively or additionally, the shape of the bosses <b>26</b><i>b</i>, <b>26</b><i>c </i>may be provided so as not to include any undercut part in the angular sector of angle A. In this way, the manufacture of the bead <b>26</b>, for example during the molding of the container <b>20</b>, is facilitated.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">By continuing the rotation of the insert <b>30</b> in the counterclockwise direction R, the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref> is passed, in which the notch <b>36</b> is located after the second boss <b>26</b><i>c</i>. As in the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, the insert <b>30</b> may return to the rest position. The unscrewing movement can then continue without the notch <b>36</b> encountering any obstacle: before arriving again at a first boss <b>26</b><i>b </i>in the circumferential direction, the insert will have axially shifted sufficiently for the notch <b>36</b> not to encounter said boss anymore. Conversely, the pitch of the threading <b>24</b> and the axial height of the notch <b>36</b> and of the bosses <b>26</b><i>b</i>, <b>26</b><i>c </i>are dimensioned so that, between the first position and the second position, the axial displacement of the insert <b>30</b> is sufficiently small for the notch <b>36</b> to cooperate with said bosses.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The mounting movement occurs through the same steps, in the opposite direction.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates, in axial section, the masking hoop <b>60</b>. The masking hoop <b>60</b> has, at one end, a rounded portion <b>64</b> able to come into contact with the container <b>20</b>, in this case the body <b>18</b>. To do so, in this case, said end is wound on itself, here radially inwardly, in order to form the rounded portion <b>64</b>. Alternatively, the rounded portion <b>64</b> could be formed by a bead devoid of sharp ridge in its part configured to come into contact with the container <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The assembly of the masking hoop <b>60</b> on the insert <b>30</b> may be carried out as follows. On the one hand, the insert <b>30</b> carrying the dispensing member <b>40</b> is mounted on the container <b>20</b>, as described previously. The movement of screwing of the insert <b>30</b> along the threading <b>24</b> being blocked at a certain position thanks to the thread end stop <b>24</b><i>a</i>, the relative orientation between the insert <b>30</b> and the container <b>20</b> is predetermined and can be guaranteed when the insert <b>30</b> is dismounted and then remounted on the container <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">On the other hand, the masking hoop <b>60</b> is inserted into the cap <b>70</b>. The relative orientation between the masking hoop <b>60</b> and the cap <b>70</b> may be ensured by magnetization. In this case, a magnet is housed in the cap <b>70</b> and configured to attract a magnet <b>50</b> fixedly assembled to the masking hoop <b>60</b>, typically by bonding. The magnet <b>50</b> may be mounted under a flange <b>62</b> of the masking hoop <b>60</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The cap <b>70</b> and the container <b>20</b> may include decorations. To ensure a good relative orientation of these decorations, the cap <b>70</b> carrying the masking hoop <b>60</b> is aligned relative to the container <b>20</b>, for example by means of a camera. Once the correct orientation is obtained, the cap <b>70</b> carrying the masking hoop <b>60</b> is force-fitted onto the insert <b>30</b>. The masking hoop <b>60</b> is configured to ensure a piece-to-piece clamping on the insert <b>30</b>, which normally cannot be dismounted, by example thanks to axial ribs <b>66</b> which bite into the insert <b>30</b>. The magnetized masking hoop <b>60</b> thus being well oriented relative to the container <b>20</b>, the cap <b>70</b> will be automatically oriented appropriately thereafter, whatever the orientation in which it is put back on the container <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Although the present description refers to specific exemplary embodiments, modifications can be made to these examples without departing from the general scope of the invention as defined by the claims. For example, although radial cooperation has been described between the bosses <b>26</b><i>b</i>, <b>26</b><i>c </i>and the notch <b>36</b>, it would be possible to envisage axial cooperation, for example with axial notches <b>36</b> or axially deformable tabs, and/or bosses provided not on the neck <b>22</b> but on the body <b>18</b> of the container <b>20</b>. Furthermore, the number and shape of the notches and bosses may be modified as long as the insert passes successively through a first position in which the force required for said movement reaches a first local maximum, and a second position in which said force reaches a second local maximum.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">More generally, individual characteristics of the different embodiments illustrated or mentioned can be combined in additional embodiments.
