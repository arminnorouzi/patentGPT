Patients with cardiovascular disease represent a heterogeneous group of individuals, with a disease that progresses at different rates and in distinctly different patterns. Despite appropriate evidence-based treatments for patients with cardiovascular disease, recurrence and mortality rates remain high. Also, the full benefits of primary prevention are unrealized due to our inability to accurately identify those patients who would benefit from aggressive risk reduction.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Whereas certain disease markers have been shown to predict outcome or response to therapy at a population level, they are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to provide adequate clinical utility in an individual patient. As a result, the first clinical presentation for more than half of the patients with coronary artery disease is either myocardial infarction or death.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Physical examination and current diagnostic tools cannot accurately determine an individual's risk for suffering a complication of cardiovascular disease. Known risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, family history, and smoking do not establish the diagnosis of atherosclerosis disease. Diagnostic modalities which rely on anatomical data (such as coronary angiography, coronary calcium score, CT or MRI angiography) lack information on the biological activity of the disease process and can be poor predictors of future cardiac events. Functional assessment of endothelial function can be non-specific and unrelated to the presence of atherosclerotic disease process, although some data has demons<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00001" he="2.96mm" wi="53.51mm" file="US20230003741A1-20230105-P00999.TIF" alt="text missing or illegible when filed" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> measurements. Individual biomarkers, such as the lipid and inflammatory markers, have been shown to predict outcome and response to therapy in patients with cardiovascular disease and some are utilized as important risk factors for developing atherosclerotic disease. Nonetheless, up to this point, no single biomarker is sufficiently specific to provide adequate clinical utility for the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease in an individual patient.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Inflammation has been implicated in all stages of cardiovascular disease and is considered to be a major part of the pathophysiological basis of atherogenesis, providing a potential marker of the disease process. Elevated circulating inflammatory biomarkers have been shown to stratify cardiovascular risk and assess response to therapy in large epidemiological studies. Currently, while general markers of inflammation are potentially useful in risk stratification, they are not adequate to identify the presence of CAD in an individual, due a lack of specificity for many markers. For similar reasons, the general markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) have long been abandoned as specific diagnostic markers in other inflammatory diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, although they remain important markers for risk stratification and response to therapy in clinical practice.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Atherosclerosis is characteristically silent until critical stenosis, thrombosis, aneurysm, or embolus supervenes. Initially, symptoms and signs reflect an inability of blood flow to the affected tissue to increase with demand, e.g. angina on exertion, intermittent claudication. Symptoms and signs commonly develop gradually as the atheroma slowly encroaches on the vessel lumen. However, when a major artery is acutely occluded, the symptoms and signs may be dramatic.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As mentioned above, currently, due to lack of appropriate diagnostic strategies, the first clinical presentation of more than half of the patients with coronary artery disease is either myocardial infarction or death. Further progress in prevention and treatment depends on the development of strategies focused on the primary inflammatory process in the vascular wall, which is fundamental in the etiology of atherosclerotic disease. Without good surrogate markers that accurately report the activity and/or extent of vessel wall disease, methods cannot be developed that completely define risk, monitor the effects of risk reduction toward primary disease amelioration, or develop new classes of therapies that target the vessel wall.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Modern cancer therapy has successfully cured many cancers and converted a terminal illness into a chronic disease. Cancer therapy can also cause myocardial damage, induce endothelial dysfunction, and alter cardiac conduction (Chang et al. J Am Coll Cardiol. 2018 Feb. 6; 71(5):587). Currently, there are no cardiac-specific assays for oncology patients, a significant and growing population. The last decade has witnessed a revolution in cance<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00002" he="2.96mm" wi="53.51mm" file="US20230003741A1-20230105-P00999.TIF" alt="text missing or illegible when filed" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> population of cancer survivors now exceeding 15.5 million in the United States alone. Consequently, there has been an emergence of a growing cohort of patients with increased cardiovascular complications. As described above, there is an unmet need for use in clinical medicine and biomedical research for improved tools to identify individuals with vascular inflammation and active cardiovascular disease (or a risk of developing cardiovascular disease). At present, although insights into mechanisms and circumstances of cardiovascular disease are increasing, our methods for identifying high-risk patients and predicting the efficacy of prevention strategies remain inadequate. New approaches are needed to better diagnose patients with active cardiovascular disease or at risk for cardiovascular complications. Identification of such patients can lead to initiation of much needed therapies that can result in improved clinical outcomes. The present invention addresses these and other shortcomings of the prior art.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Disclosed herein are methods for determining aberrant cardiac function or a predisposition to aberrant cardiac function, said method comprising detecting a fragment of &#x3b2;II spectrin associated with aberrant cardiac function or a predisposition to aberrant cardiac function in a sample derived from a subject, wherein the detection is indicative of aberrant cardiac function in the subject.

Such sequences are then said to be &#x201c;substantially identical.&#x201d; This definition also refers to, or may be applied to, the complement of a test sequence. The definition also includes sequences that have deletions and/or additions, as well as those that have substitutions. As described below, the preferred algorithms can account for gaps and the like.

Alignment for purposes of determining percent sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN, ALIGN-2 or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including any algorithms needed to achiev<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00005" he="2.96mm" wi="53.51mm" file="US20230003741A1-20230105-P00999.TIF" alt="text missing or illegible when filed" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> length of the sequences being compared can be determined by known methods.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">For sequence comparisons, typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence, to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and reference sequences are entered into a computer, subsequence coordinates are designated, if necessary, and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. Preferably, default program parameters can be used, or alternative parameters can be designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identities for the test sequences relative to the reference sequence, based on the program parameters.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">One example of an algorithm that is suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity are the BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms, which are described in Altschul et al. (1977) Nuc. Acids Res. 25:3389-3402, and Altschul et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410, respectively. Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information. This algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pairs (HSPs) by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence, which either match or satisfy some positive-valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as the neighborhood word score threshold (Altschul et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410). These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Cumulative scores are calculated using, for nucleotide sequences, the parameters M (reward score for a pair of matching residues; always &#x3e;0) and N (penalty score for mismatching residues; always &#x3c;0). For amino acid sequences, a scoring matrix is used to calculate the cumulative score. Extension of the word hits in each direction are halted when: the cumulative alignment score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum achieved value; the cumulative score goes to zero or below, due to the accumulation of one or more negative-scoring residue alignments; or the end of either sequence is reached. The BLAST algorithm parameters W, T, and X determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The BLASTN program (for nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 11, an expectation (E) or 10, M=5, N=&#x2212;4 and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid sequences, the BLASTP program uses as defaults a wordlength of 3, and expectation (E) of 10, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see Henikoff and Henikoff (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915) alignments (B) of 50, expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=&#x2212;4, and a comparison of both strands.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The BLAST algorithm also performs a statistical ana<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00006" he="2.96mm" wi="53.51mm" file="US20230003741A1-20230105-P00999.TIF" alt="text missing or illegible when filed" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> sequences (see, e.g., Karlin and Altschul (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5873-5787). One measure of similarity provided by the BLAST algorithm is the smallest sum probability (P(N)), which provides an indication of the probability by which a match between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences would occur by chance. For example, a nucleic acid is considered similar to a reference sequence if the smallest sum probability in a comparison of the test nucleic acid to the reference nucleic acid is less than about 0.2, more preferably less than about 0.01.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">&#x201c;Peptide,&#x201d; &#x201c;protein,&#x201d; and &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d; are used interchangeably to refer to a natural or synthetic molecule comprising two or more amino acids linked by the carboxyl group of one amino acid to the alpha amino group of another. Non-limiting examples of polypeptides include peptide fragments, denatured/unstructured polypeptides, polypeptides having quaternary or aggregated structures, etc. There is expressly no requirement that a polypeptide must contain an intended function; a polypeptide can be functional, non-functional, function for unexpected/unintended purposes, or have unknown function. A polypeptide is comprised of approximately twenty, standard naturally occurring amino acids, although natural and synthetic amino acids which are not members of the standard twenty amino acids may also be used. The standard twenty amino acids include alanine (Ala, A), arginine (Arg, R), asparagine (Asn, N), aspartic acid (Asp, D), cysteine (Cys, C), glutamine (Gln, Q), glutamic acid (Glu, E), glycine (Gly, G), histidine, (His, H), isoleucine (Ile, I), leucine (Leu, L), lysine (Lys, K), methionine (Met, M), phenylalanine (Phe, F), proline (Pro, P), serine (Ser, S), threonine (Thr, T), tryptophan (Trp, W), tyrosine (Tyr, Y), and valine (Val, V).

It is disclosed herein that &#x3b2;II-spectrin is cleaved by specific enzymes during cardiac stress and damage, and these cleavage products can be detected.

By &#x201c;aberrant cardiac function&#x201d; is meant any disease or disorder associated with abnormal function of the heart. For example, the aberrant cardiac function can be selected from the group comprising, but not limited to, coronary artery disease, heart attack, arrhythmia, heart failure, heart valve disease, congenital heart disease, rheumatic heart disease, ischemic heart disease, heart defects, atherosclerosis, cardiomyopathy, pericardial disease, aorta disease, atrial fibrillation/atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, cardio-toxicity and myopathy from chemotherapy, non-chemotherapeutic drug induced cardiomyopathy or Marfan syndrome/connective tissue disorders which impact the heart.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">The subject may have already been diagnosed with an aberrant cardiac function, or may have been determined to have a predisposition to an aberrant cardiac function. For example, the subject may have a genetic predisposition to a cardiac dysfunction. The subject may have one or more lifestyle factors that could predispose the individual to having an aberrant cardiac dysfunction. Lifestyle factors include, but are not limited to, high LDL, or &#x201c;bad&#x201d; cholesterol, and low HDL, or &#x201c;good&#x201d; cholesterol; uncontrolled high blood pressure; physical inactivity; obesity (such as a BMI greater than 25); uncontrolled diabetes; high C-reactive protein; or uncontrolled stress, depression, and anger.

For example. cancer or cancer-therapy associated diseases include, but are not limited to, systemic and pulmonary hypertension, QT-prolongation, arrhythmias, pericardial disease, and radiation-induced cardiotoxicity. Targeted cancer therapy can exert off-target effects causing hypertension, thromboembolism, QT-prolongation and atrial fibrillation. Radiation therapy often accelerates atherosclerosis. Furthermore, radiation can damage the heart valves, the conduction system, and pericardium that may take years to manifest clinically. Examples of aberrant cardiac function related to cancer can be found in Chang et al. <i>J Am Coll Cardiol. </i>2017; 70(20):2552-2565, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">A subject with any risk factor or predisposition to an aberrant cardiac function can be monitored for detection of a fragment of &#x3b2;II spectrin. For example, a subject can be monitored daily, weekly, bi-monthly, monthly, semi-monthly, or every 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11 months, or every year, or any amount above, between, below, or within those ranges. If a fragment of &#x3b2;II spectrin is detected, a health care provider can determine whether that subject should be monitored more frequently to determine if the amount of the &#x3b2;II spectrin fragment is increasing in the subject over time. The subject can also be further tested for aberrant cardiac function using means known to those of skill in the art to determine cardiac health. For example, a patient who is diagnosed with cancer is scheduled to receive chemotherapy which is potentially cardio-toxic. As part of a routine surveillance strategy, the patient will receive baseline bloodwork to detect &#x3b2;II spectrin fragments using a developed ELISA platform, followed by routine bloodwork prior to each round of chemotherapy. If a fragment is detected that will then prompt the clinician to a) consult cardiology b) obtain additional imaging of the heart (echocardiogram), c) modulate chemotherapy/reduce the dose/choose an alternative regimen d) increase the frequency of cardiac monitoring and surveillance with echocardiograms and/or ECG's. The outcome of these decisions will impact downstream surveillance and more importantly improve the cardiovascular health of the patient. A similar approach could be applied to a patient who presents to the emergency department with chest pain or an acute coronary syndrome. Initially diagnostics and bloodwork could be negative for myocardial infraction or damage (ECG/troponins), but if a &#x3b2;II spectrin fragment is detected then that patient may require continued monitoring and evaluation, including an echocardiogram and possibly cardiology consult as they would be at an increased risk for an adverse event. This can change treatment approach/strategies (stress-testing and/or angiogram), and long-term surveillance and follow-up with cardiology.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">Some examples of fragments of &#x3b2;II spectrin that can<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00011" he="2.96mm" wi="53.51mm" file="US20230003741A1-20230105-P00999.TIF" alt="text missing or illegible when filed" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> SBP<sub>50</sub>, SBP<sub>60</sub>, and SBP<sub>75</sub>.

The change may represent 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100% or more increase in the amount of &#x3b2;II spectrin fragment measured in the individual. Alternatively, the subject may have no significant levels of &#x3b2;II spectrin fragment(s), and detection of the presence of any statistically significant amount can indicate that the subject should undergo more frequent monitoring of &#x3b2;II spectrin fragment(s), and/or be monitored for aberrant cardiac function, or treated for aberrant cardiac function as described above.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">In addition to detecting a &#x3b2;II spectrin fragment, one or more additional cardiac markers can also be detected.

While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that monitoring a second substance (e.g., a secondary analyte) can provide additional information useful in determining (in real-time) the host's cardiac status, the host's cardiac health, predicting future cardiac events, providing therapy, and the like. As a non-limiting example, Level 1 can be associated with characteristics A, B and C, while Level 2 is associated with characteristics D, E, and F.

The method involves determining the level of a fragment of &#x3b2;II spectrin in the subject, and comparing the level of the fragment of &#x3b2;II spectrin molecule to a predetermined value specific for the diagnosis of a cardiovascular condition. The level of the fragment of &#x3b2;II spectrin in comparison to the predetermined value is indicative of whether the subject will benefit from treatment with said agent.

The present invention permits selection of subjects who are more likely to benefit by intervention, thereby aiding the physician in selecting a therapeutic regimen. This might include using drugs with a higher risk profile where the likelihood of expected benefit has increased. Likewise, clinical investigators desire to select for clinical trials a population with a high likelihood of obtaining a net benefit.

Many types and formats of immunoassays are known and all are suitable for detecting the disclosed biomarkers. Examples of immunoassays are enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), radioimmunoassays (MA), radioimmune precipitation assays (RIPA), immunobead capture assays, Western blotting, dot blotting, gel-shift assays, flow cytometry, protein arrays, multiplexed bead arrays, magnetic capture, in vivo imaging, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), and fluorescence recovery/localization after photobleaching (FRAP/FLAP). In some embodiments, the immunoassay is selected from the group consisting of enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), enzyme linked immunospot assays (ELIspot), radioimmunoassays (MA), immunobead capture assays, Western blotting, dot blotting, gel-shift assays, intracellular cytokine stain, immunohistochemistry, protein arrays, and multiplexed bead arrays.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">In general, immunoassays involve contacting a samp<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00018" he="2.96mm" wi="53.51mm" file="US20230003741A1-20230105-P00999.TIF" alt="text missing or illegible when filed" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> molecule of interest (such as the disclosed biomarkers) with an antibody to the molecule of interest or contacting an antibody to a molecule of interest (such as antibodies to the disclosed biomarkers) with a molecule that can be bound by the antibody, as the case may be, under conditions effective to allow the formation of immunocomplexes. Contacting a sample with the antibody to the molecule of interest or with the molecule that can be bound by an antibody to the molecule of interest under conditions effective and for a period of time sufficient to allow the formation of immune complexes (primary immune complexes) is generally a matter of simply bringing into contact the molecule or antibody and the sample and incubating the mixture for a period of time sufficient for the antibodies to form immune complexes with, i.e., to bind to, any molecules (e.g., antigens) present to which the antibodies can bind. In many forms of immunoassay, the sample-antibody composition, such as a tissue section, ELISA plate, dot blot or Western blot, can then be washed to remove any non-specifically bound antibody species, allowing only those antibodies specifically bound within the primary immune complexes to be detected.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0072">Immunoassays can include methods for detecting or quantifying the amount of a molecule of interest (such as the disclosed biomarkers or their antibodies) in a sample, which methods generally involve the detection or quantitation of any immune complexes formed during the binding process. In general, the detection of immunocomplex formation is well known in the art and can be achieved through the application of numerous approaches. These methods are generally based upon the detection of a label or marker, such as any radioactive, fluorescent, biological or enzymatic tags or any other known label.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073">As used herein, a label can include a fluorescent dye, a member of a binding pair, such as biotin/streptavidin, a metal (e.g., gold), or an epitope tag that can specifically interact with a molecule that can be detected, such as by producing a colored substrate or fluorescence. Substances suitable for detectably labeling proteins include fluorescent dyes (also known herein as fluorochromes and fluorophores) and enzymes that react with colorimetric substrates (e.g., horseradish peroxidase). The use of fluorescent dyes is generally preferred in the practice of the invention as they can be detected at very low amounts. Furthermore, in the case where multiple antigens are reacted with a single array, each antigen can be labeled with a distinct fluorescent compound for simultaneous detection. Labeled spots on the array are detected using a fluorimeter, the presence of a signal indicating an antigen bound to a specific antibody.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">Fluorophores are compounds or molecules that luminesce.

In direct labeling, the detecting antibody (the antibody for the molecule of interest) or detecting molecule (the molecule that can be bound by an antibody to the molecule of interest) include a label. Detection of the label indicates the presence of the detecting antibody or detecting molecule, which in turn indicates the presence of the molecule of interest or of an antibody to the molecule of interest, respectively. In indirect labeling, an additional molecule or moiety is brought into contact with, or generated at the site of, the immunocomplex. For example, a signal-generating molecule or moiety such as an enzyme can be attached to or associated with the detecting antibody or detecting molecule. The signal-generating molecule can then generate a detectable signal at the site of the immunocomplex. For example, an enzyme, when supplied with suitable substrate, can produce a visible or detectable product at the site of the immunocomplex. ELISAs use this type of indirect labeling.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">As another example of indirect labeling, an additional molecule (which can be referred to as a binding agent) that can bind to either the &#x3b2;II spectrin fragment directly, or to the antibody (primary antibody) to the molecule of interest, such as a second<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00022" he="2.96mm" wi="53.51mm" file="US20230003741A1-20230105-P00999.TIF" alt="text missing or illegible when filed" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> can be contacted with the immunocomplex. The additional molecule can have a label or signal-generating molecule or moiety. The additional molecule can be an antibody, which can thus be termed a secondary antibody. Binding of a secondary antibody to the primary antibody can form a so-called sandwich with the first (or primary) antibody and the molecule of interest. The immune complexes can be contacted with the labeled, secondary antibody under conditions effective and for a period of time sufficient to allow the formation of secondary immune complexes. The secondary immune complexes can then be generally washed to remove any non-specifically bound labeled secondary antibodies, and the remaining label in the secondary immune complexes can then be detected. The additional molecule can also be or include one of a pair of molecules or moieties that can bind to each other, such as the biotin/avidin pair. In this mode, the detecting antibody or detecting molecule should include the other member of the pair.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">Other modes of indirect labeling include the detection of primary immune complexes by a two-step approach. For example, a molecule (which can be referred to as a first binding agent), such as an antibody, that has binding affinity for the molecule of interest or corresponding antibody can be used to form secondary immune complexes, as described above. After washing, the secondary immune complexes can be contacted with another molecule (which can be referred to as a second binding agent) that has binding affinity for the first binding agent, again under conditions effective and for a period of time sufficient to allow the formation of immune complexes (thus forming tertiary immune complexes). The second binding agent can be linked to a detectable label or signal-generating molecule or moiety, allowing detection of the tertiary immune complexes thus formed. This system can provide for signal amplification.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">Immunoassays that involve the detection of a substance, such as a protein or an antibody to a specific protein, include label-free assays, protein separation methods (i.e., electrophoresis), solid support capture assays, or in vivo detection. Label-free assays are generally diagnostic means of determining the presence or absence of a specific protein, or an antibody to a specific protein (such as a &#x3b2;II spectrin fragment) in a sample. Protein separation methods are additionally useful for evaluating physical properties of the protein, such as size or net charge. Capture assays are generally more useful for quantitatively evaluating the concentration of a specific protein, or antibody to a specific protein, in a sample. Finally, in vivo detection is useful for evaluating the spatial expression patterns of the substance, i.e., where the substance can be found in a subject, tissue or cell.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0079">Provided that the concentrations are sufficient, the molecular complexes ([Ab&#x2014;Ag]n) generated by antibody&#x2014;antigen interaction are visible to the naked eye, but smaller amounts may also be detected and measured due to their ability to scatter a be<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00023" he="2.96mm" wi="53.51mm" file="US20230003741A1-20230105-P00999.TIF" alt="text missing or illegible when filed" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> complexes indicates that both reactants are present, and in immunoprecipitation assays a constant concentration of a reagent antibody is used to measure specific antigen ([Ab&#x2014;Ag]n), and reagent antigens are used to detect specific antibody ([Ab&#x2014;Ag]n). If the reagent species is previously coated onto cells (as in hemagglutination assay) or very small particles (as in latex agglutination assay), &#x201c;clumping&#x201d; of the coated particles is visible at much lower concentrations. A variety of assays based on these elementary principles are in common use, including Ouchterlony immunodiffusion assay, rocket immunoelectrophoresis, and immunoturbidometric and nephelometric assays. The main limitations of such assays are restricted sensitivity (lower detection limits) in comparison to assays employing labels and, in some cases, the fact that very high concentrations of analyte can actually inhibit complex formation, necessitating safeguards that make the procedures more complex. Some of these Group 1 assays date right back to the discovery of antibodies and none of them have an actual &#x201c;label&#x201d; (e.g. Ag-enz). Other kinds of immunoassays that are label free depend on immunosensors, and a variety of instruments that can directly detect antibody&#x2014;antigen interactions are now commercially available. Most depend on generating an evanescent wave on a sensor surface with immobilized ligand, which allows continuous monitoring of binding to the ligand. Immunosensors allow the easy investigation of kinetic interactions and, with the advent of lower-cost specialized instruments, may in the future find wide application in immunoanalysis.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0080">The use of immunoassays to detect a specific protein, such as a &#x3b2;II spectrin fragment, can involve the separation of the proteins by electrophoresis. Electrophoresis is the migration of charged molecules in solution in response to an electric field. Their rate of migration depends on the strength of the field; on the net charge, size and shape of the molecules and also on the ionic strength, viscosity and temperature of the medium in which the molecules are moving. As an analytical tool, electrophoresis is simple, rapid and highly sensitive. It is used analytically to study the properties of a single charged species, and as a separation technique.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0081">Generally, the sample is run in a support matrix such as paper, cellulose acetate, starch gel, agarose or polyacrylamide gel. The matrix inhibits convective mixing caused by heating and provides a record of the electrophoretic run: at the end of the run, the matrix can be stained and used for scanning, autoradiography or storage. In addition, the most commonly used support matrices&#x2014;agarose and polyacrylamide&#x2014;provide a means of separating molecules by size, in that they are porous gels. A porous gel may act as a sieve by retarding, or in some cases completely obstructing, the movement of large macromolecules while allowing smaller molecules to migrate freely. Because dilute agarose gels are generally more rigid and easy to handle than polyacrylamide of the same concentration, agarose is used to separate larger macromolecules such as nucleic acids, large proteins and protein complexes. Polyacrylamide, which is<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00024" he="2.96mm" wi="53.51mm" file="US20230003741A1-20230105-P00999.TIF" alt="text missing or illegible when filed" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> higher concentrations, is used to separate most proteins and small oligonucleotides that require a small gel pore size for retardation.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0082">Proteins are amphoteric compounds; their net charge therefore is determined by the pH of the medium in which they are suspended. In a solution with a pH above its isoelectric point, a protein has a net negative charge and migrates towards the anode in an electrical field. Below its isoelectric point, the protein is positively charged and migrates towards the cathode. The net charge carried by a protein is in addition independent of its size&#x2014;i.e., the charge carried per unit mass (or length, given proteins and nucleic acids are linear macromolecules) of molecule differs from protein to protein. At a given pH therefore, and under non-denaturing conditions, the electrophoretic separation of proteins is determined by both size and charge of the molecules.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0083">Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is an anionic detergent which denatures proteins by &#x201c;wrapping around&#x201d; the polypeptide backbone&#x2014;and SDS binds to proteins fairly specifically in a mass ratio of 1.4:1. In so doing, SDS confers a negative charge to the polypeptide in proportion to its length. Further, it is usually necessary to reduce disulfide bridges in proteins (denature) before they adopt the random-coil configuration necessary for separation by size; this is done with 2-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol (DTT). In denaturing SDS-PAGE separations therefore, migration is determined not by intrinsic electrical charge of the polypeptide, but by molecular weight.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0084">Determination of molecular weight is done by SDS-PAGE of proteins of known molecular weight along with the protein to be characterized. A linear relationship exists between the logarithm of the molecular weight of an SDS-denatured polypeptide, or native nucleic acid, and its RI The Rf is calculated as the ratio of the distance migrated by the molecule to that migrated by a marker dye-front. A simple way of determining relative molecular weight by electrophoresis (Mr) is to plot a standard curve of distance migrated vs. log 10MW for known samples, and read off the log Mr of the sample after measuring distance migrated on the same gel.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0085">In two-dimensional electrophoresis, proteins are fractionated first on the basis of one physical property, and, in a second step, on the basis of another. For example, isoelectric focusing can be used for the first dimension, conveniently carried out in a tube gel, and SDS electrophoresis in a slab gel can be used for the second dimension. One example of a procedure is that of O'Farrell, P.H., High Resolution Two-dimensional Electrophoresis of Proteins, J. Biol.

Laemmli, U.K., Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4, Nature 227:680 (1970), which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for teachings regarding electrophoresis methods, discloses a discontinuous system for resolving proteins denatured with SDS. The leading ion in the Laemmli buffer system is chloride, and the trailing ion is glycine. Accordingly, the resolving gel and the stacking gel are made up in Tris-HCl buffers (of different concentration and pH), while the tank buffer is Tris-glycine. All buffers contain 0.1% SDS.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0086">One example of an immunoassay that uses electrophoresis that is contemplated in the current methods is Western blot analysis. Western blotting or immunoblotting allows the determination of the molecular mass of a protein and the measurement of relative amounts of the protein present in different samples. Detection methods include chemiluminescence and chromagenic detection. Standard methods for Western blot analysis can be found in, for example, D. M. Bollag et al., <i>Protein Methods </i>(2d edition 1996) and E. Harlow &#x26; D. Lane, <i>Antibodies, a Laboratory Manual </i>(1988), U.S. Pat. No. 4,452,901, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for teachings regarding Western blot methods. Generally, proteins are separated by gel electrophoresis, usually SDS-PAGE. The proteins are transferred to a sheet of special blotting paper, e.g., nitrocellulose, though other types of paper, or membranes, can be used. The proteins retain the same pattern of separation they had on the gel. The blot is incubated with a generic protein (such as milk proteins) to bind to any remaining sticky places on the nitrocellulose. An antibody is then added to the solution which is able to bind to its specific protein.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0087">The attachment of specific antibodies to specific immobilized antigens can be readily visualized by indirect enzyme immunoassay techniques, usually using a chromogenic substrate (e.g. alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase) or chemiluminescent substrates. Other possibilities for probing include the use of fluorescent or radioisotope labels (e.g., fluorescein, <sup>125</sup>I).

The complexes migrate more slowly through the gel than unbound probe. Depending on the activity of the binding protein, a labeled probe can be either double-stranded or single-stranded. For the detection of DNA binding proteins such as transcription factors, either purified or partially purified proteins, or nuclear cell extracts can be used. For detection of RNA binding proteins, either purified or partially purified proteins, or nuclear or cytoplasmic cell extracts can be used. The specificity of the DNA or RNA binding protein for the putative binding site is established by competition experiments using DNA or RNA fragments or oligonucleotides containing a binding site for the protein of interest, or other unrelated sequence. The differences in the nature and intensity of the complex formed in the presence of specific and nonspecific competitor allows identification of specific interactions.

However, also contemplated are immunoassays wherein the protein or antibody specific for the protein is bound to a solid support (e.g., tube, well, bead, or cell) to capture the antibody or protein of interest, respectively, from a sample, combined with a method of detecting the protein or antibody specific for the protein on the support. Examples of such immunoassays include Radioimmunoassay (MA), Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), Flow cytometry, protein array, multiplexed bead assay, and magnetic capture.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0094">Radioimmunoassay (RIA) is a classic quantitative assay for detection of antigen-antibody reactions using a radioactively labeled substance (radioligand), either directly or indirectly, to measure the binding of the unlabeled substance to a specific antibody or other receptor system. Radioimmunoassay is used, for example, to test hormone levels in the blood without the need to use a bioassay. Non-immunogenic substances (e.g., haptens) can also be measured if coupled to larger carrier proteins (e.g., bovine gamma-globulin or human serum albumin) capable of inducing antibody formation. RIA involves mixing a radioactive antigen (because of the ease with which iodine atoms can be introduced into tyrosine residues in a protein, the radioactive isotopes <sup>125</sup>I or <sup>131</sup>I are often used) with antibody to that antigen. The antibody is generally linked to a solid support, such as a tube or beads. Unlabeled or &#x201c;cold&#x201d; antigen is then adding in known quantities and measuring the amount of labeled antigen displaced. Initially, the radioactive antigen is bound to the antibodies. When cold antigen is added, the two compete for antibody binding sites&#x2014;and at higher concentrations of cold antigen, more binds to the antibody, displacing the radioactive variant. The bound antigens are separated from the unbound ones in solution and the radioactivity of each used to plot a binding curve. The technique is both extremely sensitive, and specific.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0095">Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), or more generically termed EIA (Enzyme ImmunoAssay), is an immunoassay that can detect an antibody specific for a protein. In such an assay, a detectable label bound to either an antibody-binding or antigen-binding reagent is an enzyme. When exposed to its substrate, this enzyme reacts in such a manner as to produce a chemical moiety which can be detected, for example, by spectrophotometric, fluorometric or visual means.

In one variation, antibodies that can bind to proteins, such as a &#x3b2;II spectrin fragment, can be immobilized onto a selected surface exhibiting protein affinity, such as a well in a polystyrene microtiter plate. Then, a test composition suspected of containing a marker antigen can be added to the wells. After binding and washing to remove non-specifically bound immunocomplexes, the bound antigen can be detected. Detection can be achieved by the addition of a second antibody specific for the target protein, which is linked to a detectable label. This type of ELISA is a simple &#x201c;sandwich ELISA.&#x201d; Detection also can be achieved by the addition of a second antibody, followed by the addition of a third antibody that has binding affinity for the second antibody, with the third antibody being linked to a detectable label.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0097">Another variation is a competition ELISA. In competition ELISA's, test samples compete for binding with known amounts of labeled antigens or antibodies. The amount of reactive species in the sample can be determined by mixing the sample with the known labeled species before or during incubation with coated wells. The presence of reactive species in the sample acts to reduce the amount of labeled species available for binding to the well and thus reduces the ultimate signal.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0098">Regardless of the format employed, ELISAs have certain features in common, such as coating, incubating or binding, washing to remove non-specifically bound species, and detecting the bound immunocomplexes. Antigen or antibodies can be linked to a solid support, such as in the form of plate, beads, dipstick, membrane or column matrix, and the sample to be analyzed applied to the immobilized antigen or antibody. In coating a plate with either antigen or antibody, one will generally incubate the wells of the plate with a solution of the antigen or antibody, either overnight or for a specified period of hours. The wells of the plate can then be washed to remove incompletely adsorbed material. Any remaining available surfaces of the wells can then be &#x201c;coated&#x201d; with a nonspecific protein that is antigenically neutral with regard to the test antisera. These include but are not limited to bovine serum albumin (BSA), casein and solutions of milk powder. The coating allows for blocking of nonspecific adsorption sites on the immobilizing surface and thus reduces the background caused by nonspecific binding of antisera onto the surface.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0099">In ELISAs, a secondary or tertiary detection means r<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00029" he="2.96mm" wi="53.51mm" file="US20230003741A1-20230105-P00999.TIF" alt="text missing or illegible when filed" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> also be used. Thus, after binding of a protein or antibody to the well, coating with a non-reactive material to reduce background, and washing to remove unbound material, the immobilizing surface is contacted with the control clinical or biological sample to be tested under conditions effective to allow immunocomplex (antigen/antibody) formation. Detection of the immunocomplex then requires a labeled secondary binding agent or a secondary binding agent in conjunction with a labeled third binding agent.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0100">Enzyme-Linked Immunospot Assay (ELISPOT) is an immunoassay that can detect an antibody specific for a protein or antigen. In such an assay, a detectable label bound to either an antibody-binding or antigen-binding reagent is an enzyme.

In this assay a nitrocellulose microtiter plate is coated with antigen. The test sample is exposed to the antigen and then reacted similarly to an ELISA assay. Detection differs from a traditional ELISA in that detection is determined by the enumeration of spots on the nitrocellulose plate. The presence of a spot indicates that the sample reacted to the antigen. The spots can be counted and the number of cells in the sample specific for the antigen determined.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0101">&#x201c;Under conditions effective to allow immunocomplex (antigen/antibody) formation&#x201d; means that the conditions include diluting the antigens and antibodies with solutions such as BSA, bovine gamma globulin (BGG) and phosphate buffered saline (PBS)/Tween so as to reduce non-specific binding and to promote a reasonable signal to noise ratio.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0102">The suitable conditions also mean that the incubation is at a temperature and for a period of time sufficient to allow effective binding.

The assays are highly parallel (multiplexed) and often miniaturized (microarrays, protein chips). Their advantages include being rapid and automatable, capable of high sensitivity, economical on reagents, and giving an abundance of data for a single experiment. Bioinformatics support is important; the data handling demands sophisticated software and data comparison analysis. However, the software can be adapted from that used for DNA arrays, as can much of the hardware and detection systems.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0107">One of the chief formats is the capture array, in which ligand-binding reagents, which are usually antibodies but can also be alternative protein scaffolds, peptides or nucleic acid aptamers, are used to detect target molecules in mixtures such as plasma or tissue extracts. In diagnostics, capture arrays can be used to carry out multiple immunoassays in parallel, both testing for several analytes in individual sera for example and testing many serum samples simultaneously. In proteomics, capture arrays are used to quantitate and compare the levels of proteins in different samples in health and disease, i.e. protein expression profiling. Proteins other than specific ligand binders are used in the array format for in vitro functional interaction screens such as protein-protein, protein-DNA, protein-drug, receptor-ligand, enzyme-substrate, etc. The capture reagents themselves are selected and screened against many proteins, which can also be done in a multiplex array format against multiple protein targets.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0108">For construction of arrays, sources of proteins inc<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00031" he="2.96mm" wi="53.51mm" file="US20230003741A1-20230105-P00999.TIF" alt="text missing or illegible when filed" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> for recombinant proteins, purification from natural sources, production in vitro by cell-free translation systems, and synthetic methods for peptides. Many of these methods can be automated for high throughput production. For capture arrays and protein function analysis, it is important that proteins should be correctly folded and functional; this is not always the case, e.g. where recombinant proteins are extracted from bacteria under denaturing conditions. Nevertheless, arrays of denatured proteins are useful in screening antibodies for cross-reactivity, identifying autoantibodies and selecting ligand binding proteins.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0109">Protein arrays have been designed as a miniaturization of familiar immunoassay methods such as ELISA and dot blotting, often utilizing fluorescent readout, and facilitated by robotics and high throughput detection systems to enable multiple assays to be carried out in parallel. Commonly used physical supports include glass slides, silicon, microwells, nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes, and magnetic and other microbeads. While microdrops of protein delivered onto planar surfaces are the most familiar format, alternative architectures include CD centrifugation devices based on developments in microfluidics (Gyros, Monmouth Junction, N.J.) and specialized chip designs, such as engineered microchannels in a plate (e.g., The Living Chip&#x2122;, Biotrove, Woburn, Mass.) and tiny 3D posts on a silicon surface (Zyomyx, Hayward Calif.). Particles in suspension can also be used as the basis of arrays, providing they are coded for identification; systems include color coding for microbeads (Luminex, Austin, Tex.; Bio-Rad Laboratories) and semiconductor nanocrystals (e.g., QDots&#x2122;, Quantum Dot, Hayward, Calif.), and barcoding for beads (UltraPlex&#x2122;, SmartBead Technologies Ltd, Babraham, Cambridge, UK) and multimetal microrods (e.g., Nanobarcodes&#x2122; particles, Nanoplex Technologies, Mountain View, Calif.). Beads can also be assembled into planar arrays on semiconductor chips (LEAPS technology, BioArray Solutions, Warren, N.J.).</p><p id="p-0112" num="0110">Immobilization of proteins involves both the coupling reagent and the nature of the surface being coupled to. A good protein array support surface is chemically stable before and after the coupling procedures, allows good spot morphology, displays minimal nonspecific binding, does not contribute a background in detection systems, and is compatible with different detection systems. The immobilization method used are reproducible, applicable to proteins of different properties (size, hydrophilic, hydrophobic), amenable to high throughput and automation, and compatible with retention of fully functional protein activity. Orientation of the surface-bound protein is recognized as an important factor in presenting it to ligand or substrate in an active state; for capture arrays the most efficient binding results are obtained with orientated capture reagents, which generally require site-specific labeling of the protein.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0111">Both covalent and noncovalent methods of protein various pros and cons. Passive adsorption to surfaces is methodologically simple, but allows little quantitative or orientational control; it may or may not alter the functional properties of the protein, and reproducibility and efficiency are variable. Covalent coupling methods provide a stable linkage, can be applied to a range of proteins and have good reproducibility; however, orientation may be variable, chemical derivatization may alter the function of the protein and requires a stable interactive surface. Biological capture methods utilizing a tag on the protein provide a stable linkage and bind the protein specifically and in reproducible orientation, but the biological reagent must first be immobilized adequately, and the array may require special handling and have variable stability.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0112">Several immobilization chemistries and tags have been described for fabrication of protein arrays. Substrates for covalent attachment include glass slides coated with amino- or aldehyde-containing silane reagents. In the Versalinx&#x2122; system (Prolinx, Bothell, Wash.) reversible covalent coupling is achieved by interaction between the protein derivatized with phenyldiboronic acid, and salicylhydroxamic acid immobilized on the support surface. This also has low background binding and low intrinsic fluorescence and allows the immobilized proteins to retain function. Noncovalent binding of unmodified protein occurs within porous structures such as HydroGel&#x2122; (PerkinElmer, Wellesley, Mass.), based on a 3-dimensional polyacrylamide gel; this substrate is reported to give a particularly low background on glass microarrays, with a high capacity and retention of protein function. Widely used biological coupling methods are through biotin/streptavidin or hexahistidine/Ni interactions, having modified the protein appropriately. Biotin may be conjugated to a poly-lysine backbone immobilized on a surface such as titanium dioxide (Zyomyx) or tantalum pentoxide (Zeptosens, Witterswil, Switzerland).</p><p id="p-0115" num="0113">Array fabrication methods include robotic contact printing, ink-jetting, piezoelectric spotting and photolithography.

Fluorescent readout sensitivity can be amplified 10-100 fold by tyramide signal amplification (TSA) (PerkinElmer Lifesciences). Planar waveguide technology (Zeptosens) enables ultrasensitive fluorescence detection, with the additional advantage of no intervening washing procedures. High sensitivity can also be achieved with suspension beads and particles, using phycoerythrin as label (Luminex) or the properties of semiconductor nanocrystals (Quantum Dot). A number of novel alternative readouts have been developed, especially in the commercial biotech arena. These include adaptations of surface plasmon resonance (HTS Biosystems, Intrinsic Bioprobes, Tempe, Ariz.), rolling circle DNA amplification (Molecular Staging, New Haven Conn.), mass spectrometry (Intrinsic Bioprobes; Ciphergen, Fremont, Calif.), resonance light scattering (Genicon Sciences, San Diego, Calif.) and atomic force microscopy [BioForce Laboratories].</p><p id="p-0118" num="0116">Capture arrays form the basis of diagnostic chips and arrays for expression profiling.

Aptamers are selected from libraries of oligonucleotides by the Selex&#x2122; procedure and their interaction with protein can be enhanced by covalent attachment, through incorporation of brominated deoxyuridine and UV-activated crosslinking (photoaptamers). Photocrosslinking to ligand reduces the crossreactivity of aptamers due to the specific steric requirements. Aptamers have the advantages of ease of production by automated oligonucleotide synthesis and the stability and robustness of DNA; on photoaptamer arrays, universal fluorescent protein stains can be used to detect binding.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0120">Protein analytes binding to antibody arrays may be detected directly or via a secondary antibody in a sandwich assay. Direct labelling is used for comparison of different samples with different colors. Where pairs of antibodies directed at the same protein ligand are available, sandwich immunoassays provide high specificity and sensitivity and are therefore the method of choice for low abundance proteins such as cytokines; they also give the possibility of detection of protein modifications. Label-free detection methods, including mass spectrometry, surface plasmon resonance and atomic force microscopy, avoid alteration of ligand. What is required from any method is optimal sensitivity and specificity, with low background to give high signal to noise. Since analyte concentrations cover a wide range, sensitivity has to be tailored appropriately; serial dilution of the sample or use of antibodies of different affinities are solutions to this problem.

Concentration of unknowns is calculated for the cytometric bead array as with any sandwich format assay, i.e. through the use of known standards and plotting unknowns against a standard curve. Further, multiplexed bead assay allows quantification of soluble analytes in samples never previously considered due to sample volume limitations.

In order to establish baseline cardiac risk and spectrin expression, an ELISA using the cardiac specific antibody (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) is used to detect spectrin fragments at baseline/prior to chemotherapy. In this scenario, if a patient develops a unique fragment during treatment with chemotherapy that is NOT observed at baseline or in healthy patients (as seen in the STEMI human serum sample, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), this alerts the treating practitioner to obtain specific cardiovascular tests (echocardiogram, ECG, or even an angiogram) or obtain cardiac consultation. If the echocardiogram or ECG is consistent with cardiotoxicity or cardiac injury, this then leads to the initiation of specific cardioprotective strategies (beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors), or even a reduction of the current regimen/alternative regimen. This enhanced surveillance prevents irreversible cardiac damage and prevent downstream cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001"
