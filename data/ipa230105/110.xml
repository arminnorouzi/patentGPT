TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention belongs to the technical field of materials, and relates to the biopolymer material technology, particularly relates to method for feeding <i>Hermetia illucens </i>and used as for the preparation method of pupariums powder, composite materials and thin films, and novel antibacterial and antimycotic additives.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">2. BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">With the rapid development of materials science and the growing awareness of environmental protection, a large amount of leftover food such as kitchen waste, livestock and poultry manure and other related agricultural and livestock industries and food wastes often have problems affecting the environment, air and water quality. Therefore, some relevant scholars and experts put forward the concept of &#x201c;circular economy&#x201d;, in which the part of biological circulation is to make products from biodegradable raw materials, and products can be preferentially applied at different levels to maximize their value. Unavailable &#x201c;biomass raw materials&#x201d; can safely return to the ecological circle as nutrients after biochemical raw material extraction, biogas, composting and other procedures. Therefore, the use of agricultural resources with the concept of circular economy is a very important basis for the development of related industries of agriculture, forestry, fishery and animal husbandry. A large number of agricultural and livestock industries and food wastes can be used endlessly in the biological cycle through recycling, decomposition and reuse, thus further eliminating the concept of wastes.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A large part of China's environmental pollution comes from animal waste, which produces millions of tons of animal waste every year, such as pig manure, chicken manure, cow dung, etc., which pollutes water, soil and air, and a large amount of food waste, such as kitchen waste, vegetable residue, etc. If it can be converted into reusable resources, it can enhance the value of environmental protection and circular economy. Therefore, black hydrangea has become a major transformation of agriculture and livestock industry and food waste. The <i>Hermetia illucens </i>is a kind of resource insect, whose English name is <i>Hermetia illucens, </i>also known as Black Soldier Fly (BSF as abbreviation). The <i>Hermetia illucens </i>can digest a large amount of kitchen waste food and livestock manure, and transform it into new insect protein and new microbial and insect manure organic fertilizer, which can solve the problems that would otherwise affect the environment, air and water quality, and at the same time produce insect protein and fertile micro-ecological organic fertilizer, thus purifying the ecological environment and reducing the environmental burden.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The life cycle of <i>Hermetia illucens </i>is about 28 days, which can be roughly divided into egg stage, larval stage, pupal stage and adult stage. The egg stage is about 2 &#x2dc; 4 days, and the egg mass is about 1 mm in diameter, which is oval, showing light yellow to milk color at the first birth, and gradually deepening at the later stage. Each egg mass contains about 500 &#x2dc; 800 eggs. Adult spawning has suture-orientation, which is used to collect egg mass with corrugated board. The larval stage is about 15 days. The black water slug is plump, with a small yellow-black head and firm and tough epidermis. At the beginning of the first instar, it is milky white and about 1.8 mm long. There is little difference in size between the second and third instars. It is most efficient to digest food at the fourth and fifth instars, and can eat food equivalent to its own weight every day. It is called &#x201c;mature larva&#x201d; at Wuling stage, and the protein content is the highest at this time. Pupal stage is about 15 days, including pre-pupation stage and pupation stage. After the fifth instar, the body of the <i>Hermetia illucens </i>larvae gradually turns black, and tends to harden, so it stops eating and enters the pre-pupation stage. In the pre-pupation stage, the black fly does not need food, so it will look for a dry and hidden place to pupate, and it will move out of food. At the same time, it has the characteristics of rotation-avoiding optical activity and seam-approaching. After pupation, the pupa shell is dark brown, which is the peripupa formed by the molting of the last larvae, and the pupa body can be seen when cut open. Then, the <i>Hermetia illucens </i>will emerge as an adult, and the adult black water slug has only about 5 days to live. After the pupa emerges as an adult, it only feeds on the water and sap on the leaves, and after the flight mating, the female worm lays eggs.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The <i>Hermetia illucens </i>can circulate for 7-10 generations a year. In a suitable environment, a generation can be completed in 28 &#x2dc; 35 days. A pair of <i>Hermetia illucens </i>can lay nearly 1,000 eggs. From eggs to mature larvae, the individual growth of black hydra is nearly 4,000 times. The worm itself in each stage can be used as an important economic value. The dried and crushed black hydra larvae can be made into health products for aquatic products and livestock and poultry breeding, according to the research, the content of amino acid, crude fat and calcium in the larval powder of black hydra is very high, which is a suitable additive for pig feed and fish feed. The dung &#x201c;carbon fertilizer of black fly&#x201d; is a kind of high-quality organic fertilizer and soil conditioner, with uniform particles and no peculiar smell, and its water retention and air permeability are 2-3 times higher than that of common soil. It contains 18 kinds of amino acids, contains 42.2% of organic matter, and has 200,000-200 million beneficial bacteria per gram. Only a small amount of carbon fertilizer of <i>Hermetia illucens </i>can achieve the highest benefit and effectively increase the soil.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Although the <i>Hermetia illucens </i>has many additional economic values mentioned above, such as dried and crushed products of <i>Hermetia illucens </i>larvae used in pig feed, and black fly manure carbon fertilizer is a kind of high-quality organic fertilizer and soil modifier, a large number of pupal shells produced during the growth of <i>Hermetia illucens </i>have not been further utilized. According to the research, the <i>Hermetia illucens </i>contains a large amount of protein, lipid and soil conditioner. Most of the oil performance parameters of bio-diesel produced from the oily animal fat contained in the black fly can meet the EU bio-diesel standard, which shows that the black fly can become a new material source of bio-diesel. However, there are abundant chitin and antibacterial peptides in the pupal shell of the <i>Hermetia illucens, </i>which has not been widely used at present. Chitin, also known as chitin, is a special glycoprotein with similar chemical structure to natural cellulose, and can be effectively and widely used in medicine, bioengineering, light industry, food and other fields. The reason why the black water slug can survive in a large amount of kitchen waste and fertilizer without getting sick is that the black water slug itself has a unique immune system, which can synthesize a large number of antibacterial peptides in the body to kill invading bacteria. Antibacterial peptides are substances that can resist and inhibit <i>Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus </i>and <i>Salmonella, </i>and insect antibacterial peptides are natural products, which are not easy to produce drug resistance. These antibacterial peptides have antibacterial ability against bacteria and fungi, viruses and tumors.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To sum up, if a large amount of biological wastes such as the shell of <i>Hermetia illucens </i>can be recovered and treated as polymer matrix contents, so as to reduce the cost of the substrate, and at the same time strengthen the performance and efficacy of the polymer matrix, such as non-toxicity, antibacterial, good mechanical properties and elongation, the economic value of recycling waste shell pupa of black hydra can be greatly improved, and a high-efficiency and low-cost polymer composite material of black hydra pupa can be formed.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">3. SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of this, the inventor studied and improved the above-mentioned needs and deficiencies, and developed a method which can effectively utilize the polymer of the <i>Hermetia illucens </i>pupariums and recycle it for processing and synthesis, so as to provide a non-toxic, antibacterial, high-molecular composite material of the <i>Hermetia illucens </i>pupariums with good mechanical properties and elongation rate, and provide consumers with more innovative and unique products with excellent quality, which is the motive of the invention.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Feeding method of <i>Hermetia illucens </i>is to use starchy kitchen waste food or mixed starchy kitchen waste food, distiller's grains and corn straw (inner).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preparation method of <i>Hermetia illucens </i>pupariums powder comprises the following steps:</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">S1, dry <i>Hermetia illucens </i>pupariums and grind them into powdery,</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">S2, adding powdery of <i>Hermetia illucens </i>pupariums into sodium hydroxide aqueous solution, stirring, separating and filtering,</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">S3, adding the pupariums into hydrochloric acid solution, stirring, separating and filtering,</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">S4, placing the pupariums into sodium hydroxide aqueous solution, stirring, separating and filtering,</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">S5, drying the pupariums, and screening out the granular pretreated powder of the <i>Hermetia illucens </i>pupariums.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Preparation method of composite material of <i>Hermetia illucens </i>pupariums is to mix the pretreated powder of the <i>Hermetia illucens </i>pupariums with a polymer substrate according to the weight ratio of 0.1-25%, and then heating and melting the mixture.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, after melting the mixture and then wire drawing to form fibrous composite material.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferably, the polymer base material is any one or a mixture of a plurality of polyterephthalate, polyamide, polyolefin, polyurethane, polymethylmethacrylate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol and biodegradable polymer materials.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The preparation method of of compound thin film of <i>Hermetia illucens </i>pupariums is to add the pre-treated powder of the <i>Hermetia illucens </i>pupariums into a liquid substrate, stirring at high speed to prepare thin film, and drying the film to obtain the <i>Hermetia illucens </i>pupariums polymer composite film.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Preferably, the method for preparing the film is tape casting.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Preferably, the liquid substrate is any one of polyvinyl alcohol aqueous solution, aqueous polyurethane or carboxymethyl cellulose aqueous solution.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A novel kind of antibacterial and antimildew additive of this invention is obtained by mixing the <i>Hermetia illucens </i>pupariums pretreatment powder with oyster shell powder, and the weight content of oyster shell powder is not less than 20%.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">By adopting that method for feeding the <i>Hermetia illucens, </i>the yield of chitosan in the <i>Hermetia illucens </i>pupariums can be effectively improved.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The pupariums powder prepared by the method can be used for preparing the fiber and thin film of the <i>Hermetia illucens </i>pupariums polymer composite material, and the antibacterial effect of the obtained polymer composite material is greatly improved.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Due to the addition of <i>Hermetia illucens </i>pupariums powder particles in polymer matrix, the biodegradation efficiency can be improved, the cell activity of polymer can be improved, and the biotoxicity can be reduced. When the polymer composite material of <i>Hermetia illucens </i>pupariums is abandoned and buried, it can promote the conversion rate of microbial decomposition after being buried in soil, and can be used as the growth nutrient of crops.

This novel composite bio-based powder can be used as an excellent antibacterial and antimycotic additive.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00006" num="00006"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" rowsep="1">TABLE 6</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Relative cell</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Content of oyster</entry><entry>Antibacterial</entry><entry>proliferation</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>shell powder (%)</entry><entry>ratio(%)</entry><entry>rate(%)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="63pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Hermetia illucens</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>99.9</entry><entry>16.8</entry></row><row><entry>pupariums</entry></row><row><entry>Hermetia illucens</entry><entry>20</entry><entry>99.9</entry><entry>63.5</entry></row><row><entry>pupariums</entry></row><row><entry>Hermetia illucens</entry><entry>40</entry><entry>99.9</entry><entry>97.3</entry></row><row><entry>pupariums</entry></row><row><entry>Hermetia illucens</entry><entry>60</entry><entry>99.9</entry><entry>99.9</entry></row><row><entry>pupariums</entry></row><row><entry>Hermetia illucens</entry><entry>80</entry><entry>99.9</entry><entry>99.9</entry></row><row><entry>pupariums</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0082" num="0075">The above are various embodiments of the present invention, and their descriptions are more specific and detailed, but they cannot be understood as limiting the patent scope of the present invention.
