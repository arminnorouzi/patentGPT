The present disclosure relates specifically to a tape measure with both a retraction spring and a retraction motor and a sensor providing information to a controller/control system regarding operation of the retraction system (e.g., spring torque, retraction speed, etc.).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Tape measures are measurement tools used for a variety of measurement applications, including in the building and construction trades. Some tape measures include a graduated, marked blade wound on a reel and also include a retraction system for automatically retracting the blade onto the reel. In some tape measure designs, the retraction system is driven by a coil or spiral spring that is tensioned, storing energy as the tape is extended, and that releases energy to spin the reel, winding the blade back onto the reel.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One embodiment of the disclosure relates to a tape measure including a housing, a tape reel rotatably mounted within the housing, a rotational axis defined by the tape reel around which the tape reel rotates, an elongate tape blade wound around the tape reel, a spiral spring coupled to the tape reel, a detector made of a second material that is electrically-conductive, and a sensor that measures a capacitance of the detector. When the elongate tape blade is unwound from the tape reel to extend from the housing the spiral spring stores energy, and the spiral spring releasing energy drives rewinding of the elongate tape blade on to the tape reel. The spiral spring is made of a first material that is electrically-conductive.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another embodiment of the disclosure relates to a tape measure including a housing, a tape reel rotatably mounted within the housing, a rotational axis defined by the tape reel around which the tape reel rotates, an elongate tape blade wound around the tape reel, a spiral spring located within the housing, a magnet that emits a magnetic field, and a detector that measures a change in the magnetic field caused by a repositioning of the spiral spring in response to a portion of the tape blade being extended from or retrieved into the housing. When the elongate tape blade is unwound from the tape reel to extend from the housing the spiral spring stores energy, and the spiral spring releasing energy drives rewinding of the elongate tape blade on to the tape reel. The spiral spring is made of a first material that is electrically-conductive.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another embodiment of the disclosure relates to a tape measure including a housing defining an interior surface, a tape reel rotatably mounted within the housing, a rotational axis defined by the tape reel around which the tape reel rotates, an elongate tape blade wound around the tape reel, a spiral spring located within the housing, an axle rotatably mounted within the housing, the axle defining a first end and an opposing second end, a motor shaft rotatably mounted within the housing, the motor shaft defining a first end and an opposing second end, the first end of the motor shaft interfacing with the first end of the axle, and a sensor that measures a position of the second end of the motor shaft. When the elongate tape blade is unwound from the tape reel to extend from the housing the spiral spring stores energy, and the spiral spring releasing energy drives rewinding of the elongate tape blade on to the tape reel.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another embodiment of the disclosure relates to a motorized tape measure with a sensor. The sensor measures an aspect of the tape measure, such as the speed at which the tape blade is being extracted out of or retrieved into the housing, an amount that the tape blade is still in the housing, and/or an estimated amount of tension being exerted by the retraction system. Based on these measurements, the motor exerts a force on the tape spool. For example, the motor may exert a counter-force on the retraction system, thus moderating the speed at which the tape blade is retrieved into the housing.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to one embodiment, a tape measure includes a sensor, a housing, an arbor that rotates within the housing, a tape reel that rotates within the housing, an elongate tape blade wound around the tape reel, a retraction system for the elongate tape blade, a hook assembly coupled to an outer end of the elongate tape blade, a spiral spring, and a motor that interfaces with the retraction system. When the elongate tape blade is unwound from the tape reel to extend from the housing, the spiral spring stores energy, and the spiral spring releasing energy drives rewinding of the elongate tape blade on to the tape reel. The sensor measures an aspect of the tape measure and generates a control signal. The motor receives the control signal and interfaces with the retraction system based on the control signal.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In more specific embodiments, the motor interfaces with the tape spool via a clutch, such as a detent clutch or a slip clutch. The clutch provides an upper limit on the amount of tension in the retraction system, so when the maximum amount of tension is exceeded the clutch slips to prevent a further increase to the tension. The clutch includes an adjustment mechanism that permits a user to control the maximum amount of tension that the clutch can receive before slipping.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another specific embodiment, the tape measure includes a circuit board and a position sensor. The position sensor measures the positioning of the spring, such as by detecting the proximity of the spring to one or more sensing locations of the position sensor. In one example, the position sensor includes a series of concentric circles of varying diameters from an axis around which the spring is centered. The different concentric circles measure the amount (e.g., magnetic interference, density, mass) of the spring in proximity to the respective circle. Based at least in part on those measurements, the circuit board generates a control signal for the motor to interface with the retraction system. In one specific embodiment, the position sensor is one or more metal detectors.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another specific embodiment, the tape measure further includes a torque switch. The torque switch includes an arbor spacer coupled to the arbor, and a motor shaft spacer coupled to the motor. The arbor spacer and the motor shaft spacer are circumferentially biased away from each other by one or more biasing elements. The orientation of the arbor spacer and the motor shaft spacer changes in response to the tension in the tape measure's retraction system. The change in the relative orientation of the components of the torque switch is measured, and based on that measurement a control signal for the motor is generated.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another specific embodiment, the motor includes a shaft that is axially aligned with the arbor. The motor shaft and the arbor interface at a cammed interface. The arbor and the motor shaft define a collective length, which changes in response to the arbor and the motor shaft rotating with respect to each other. The tape measure further includes a biasing element that exerts a biasing force compressing the arbor and motor shaft together. A distance between the motor shaft and the housing is measured, and based on that measurement a control signal for the motor is generated.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another specific embodiment, the elongate blade includes a series of markings arranged along the length of the elongate blade. In another specific embodiment, a rotating component in the tape measure, such as the tape spool, includes a series of markings that are radially arranged around a central axis. The sensor monitors the series of markings to determine a status of the tape measure. In various uses, the sensor monitors the speed that the markings are moving, and/or monitors a total displacement of the elongate blade (e.g., by counting the total number of markings that have moved past a sensor).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Additional features and advantages will be set forth in the detailed description which follows, and, in part, will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the description or recognized by practicing the embodiments as described in the written description and claims hereof, as well as the appended drawings. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The accompanying drawings are included to provide further understanding and are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification.

Various embodiments of the tape measure discussed herein include an innovative retraction system that includes a motor and sensor(s) that generate control signals for the motor. Some tape measure blades are susceptible to damage/breakage due to high speed during retraction. For example, high speeds during retraction may cause the tape blade to whip (e.g., the tendency of the tape measure blade to bend or snap back on itself during fast retraction), which can crack or tear the tape blade, and similarly, high retraction speeds can damage the tape blade when the tape hook contacts the tape housing at the end of retraction. Applicant believes that the tape measure retraction system described herein provides for retraction speed control that can limit such sources of tape measure damage while at the same time providing a more compact tape measure without sacrificing tape length or retraction performance.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As will generally be understood, in certain tape measure designs, a spring stores energy during tape blade extension and applies a force/torque to a reel causing the tape blade to wind on to the reel during tape blade retraction. Various aspects of spring design, such as spring energy, torque profile, spring constant, etc., are selected to ensure that operation of the spring has enough energy to provide satisfactory tape retraction. However, because of the physics and characteristics of the typical tape measure spiral spring, in order to ensure full tape retraction at a satisfactory speed, the typical tape measure spiral spring delivers excess energy to the tape blade during retraction, which in turn translates into undesirably highly retraction speeds and whip, particularly toward the end of retraction. In addition, for a given spiral spring design increasing spring energy to provide for retraction of longer, wider and/or thicker measuring tape blades typically requires use of a larger spiral spring, which in turn results in a larger tape measure.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As discussed herein, Applicant has developed various innovative tape measure blade retraction systems that provide a desired level of spring energy while utilizing a relatively short or small volume spring, while maintaining a relatively small tape measure housing (e.g., a tape measure outer diameter) and/or while providing desired retraction characteristics. As discussed in more detail, the tape retraction system discussed herein utilizes a motor that interfaces with the retraction system based on measurements performed by sensors. The sensors monitor the current state of the tape measure (e.g., the amount of torque currently being exerted by the spiral spring) and the changing state of the tape measure (e.g., the speed at which the tape blade is being extracted from or retrieved into the housing).

It is contemplated herein that any rotating component (e.g., the arbor, the spiral spring) may include or define radially-arranged markings.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In another embodiment, the rotational speed can be converted into a linear speed of the tape blade <b>520</b> by taking into consideration the amount of tape blade <b>520</b> that has already been paid out (e.g., determining the outer radius of the tape blade <b>520</b> that is still coiled on the tape reel <b>14</b>).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Other methods of speed detection include magnetic/Hall-effect sensors. One or more magnets can be placed on the tape reel, and one or more Hall-effect sensors can determine the number of rotations, the speed of rotation, etc. of the tape reel. Another method includes a device that operates similar to a governor on an engine. As the device rotates faster, the spring-loaded arms are forced outward by centrifugal forces. The further out that the arms are, the faster that the device is spinning.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In one embodiment, the one or more sensors are rotated with respect to the housing <b>12</b> (e.g., the sensor(s) are disposed on the tape reel). The sensor(s) monitor radially-arranged markings, such as on the housing, to determine the status (e.g., the torque) of tape measure <b>10</b>. In another embodiment the sensor(s) monitor radially-arranged markings on another component that is rotating with respect to the housing (e.g., the sensor(s) are on the tape reel monitor markings on the arbor, which rotates with respect to the tape reel as the tape blade is extracted from or retrieved into the housing).</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>-<b>23</b></figref>, various aspects of tape measure <b>610</b> are shown. Tape measure <b>610</b> is similar to the other tape measures described herein except for the differences noted. Clutch <b>626</b> is between arbor <b>618</b> and motor shaft <b>632</b> to manage an amount of tension in spring <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Clutch <b>626</b> includes torque moderating component, shown as wheels <b>622</b>, that interface against plate <b>634</b>. Plate <b>634</b> circumferentially define multiple peaks <b>630</b> and valleys <b>628</b>. In a specific embodiment peaks <b>630</b>. At a position of no torque and/or low tension in spring <b>16</b>, spring <b>636</b> biases wheels <b>622</b> towards valleys <b>628</b>. As tension is exerted on spring <b>16</b> (e.g., as tape blade <b>20</b> is withdrawn from housing <b>12</b>), torque on arbor <b>618</b> rotates with respect to plate <b>634</b>, and as a result wheels <b>622</b> circumferentially move with respect to plate <b>634</b> at least partially from valleys <b>628</b> to peaks <b>630</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, various aspects of tape measure <b>710</b> are shown that includes an innovative clutch <b>736</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, a motorized/hybrid tape measure <b>710</b> includes an electric motor <b>22</b>, clutch <b>736</b> and a spiral spring <b>16</b>. An electric motor <b>22</b> drives a worm drive system. The worm drive system converts the rotational movement of the drive shaft into orthogonal rotational movement with a gear reduction. The worm drive gear reduction is optimized based on speed needed to rotate the spring arbor, the voltage and speed of the motor, and the brake force of the motor needed to maintain the spring arbor stationary when the motor is not powered, among other factors.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Between the worm drive system and the spring arbor is a clutch <b>736</b>. The clutch <b>736</b> can be a detent or slip clutch. Shown in this image is a detent clutch. The clutch <b>736</b> prevents the motor from over driving or over torqueing the spring arbor. The clutch plates are pressed together by the tensioner spring. The stronger the compressive force of the spring, the higher the torque limit before the clutch slips. The amount of force applied to the clutch plates can be adjusted via the clutch adjustment screw. Attached to the spring arbor is one end of the spring. The other end of the spring is attached to the blade spool, which can be co-axial to and surround the spring.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, the motor is used to adjust the amount of torque that the spring applies to the blade spool. As the user pulls out the blade <b>20</b> from the housing <b>12</b>, the spring <b>16</b> winds up and, if the user continues to pull out the blade <b>20</b>, the spring <b>16</b> winds to a pre-set torque limit, and the motor is used to adjust the spring arbor to unwind the spring such that the spring applies less than the pre-set toque limit. Similarly, once the user allows the blade to wind back up into the housing, the spring unwinds to another pre-set torque limit, and the motor is used to adjust the spring arbor to wind the spring such that the spring can continue to apply enough torque to the blade spool to completely reel the blade in. Accordingly, in such embodiments, torque is measured. Two options for measuring torque are (i) at the main spring and (ii) between the motor and the arbor.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">To perform these measurements, tape measure <b>10</b> may include one or more sensors to detect a state of tape measure <b>710</b>. Based on measurement(s) from the one or more sensors, a control signal for the motor is generated.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The motor interfaces with the retraction system based at least in part on the control signal. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> the motor interfaces with the tape spool. However, it is contemplated herein that the motor interfaces with any of one or more components in the retraction system (e.g., the tape spool, the elongate tape blade, the arbor).</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In various embodiments, the clutch system described herein is used in combination with the one or more embodiments with sensors also described herein.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In one embodiment, when the elongate tape blade is fully retracted within the housing, tape measure's spiral spring is in a low/no torque state. In this position, the total distance of the arbor and motor shaft is at its shortest. As the elongate tape blade is extracted from the housing, the arbor rotates with respect to the motor shaft and the total distance of the arbor and motor shaft increases. One or more sensors monitor the distance of motor shaft and arbor, and based on the measurement(s) the system infers the current positioning of the elongate tape (e.g., fully retracted within the housing, fully extended out of the housing, an intermediate state between fully retracted and fully extended).</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In one embodiment, motor shaft is rotatably coupled to three rollers, which each interface within a valley (e.g., a recessed portion between a pair of extended portions). It is contemplated herein that any number of rollers and valleys may be used, including switching which axle is coupled to the rollers and which axle includes the cammed surface.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">It is contemplated herein that any aspect of the motor shaft and arbor interface may be measured, such as an orientation of the arbor with respect to the motor shaft, a distance between the arbor and the housing (if the arbor is permitted to longitudinally slide along its axis rather than the motor shaft), and/or a distance between the housing and at least one of the arbor or housing.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">It should be understood that the figures illustrate the exemplary embodiments in detail, and it should be understood that the present application is not limited to the details or methodology set forth in the description or illustrated in the figures.
