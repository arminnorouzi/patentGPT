Certain forms of hydrocarbons require conversion, or &#x201c;upgrading,&#x201d; after recovery to help with transportation or to enhance their value at sale. The importance of upgrading these forms is ever-increasing, given the decline in available conventional hydrocarbon resources, and the increasing costs to extract, upgrade and refine heavy hydrocarbon resources.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Forty percent of the world's total oil reserves are heavy and extra heavy oil, accounting for 3.6-5.2 trillion bbl of oil. Thus, recovery of these highly viscous hydrocarbons could have major economic significance. Nonetheless, because most heavy and extra heavy oils, asphalts, tars and/or bitumens are highly viscous, they are burdensome to extract and transport. For example, a significant amount of energy is required to pump oil with higher viscosity through pipelines to refineries and processing facilities. Additionally, viscosity affects the speed at which crude oil can be pumped, with more viscous oils contributing to a decrease in overall productivity for an oil field.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Heavy hydrocarbons often must be maintained at elevated temperatures to remain flowable, and/or mixed with a lighter hydrocarbon diluent to enable pipeline transportation. Diluents can be expensive and can be costly to transport to oil production sites. Further, heavier crudes, which can contain bitumens, asphaltenes, resins, paraffins and/or other heavy hydrocarbons, can hinder processing due to the additional presence of salts, metals, and organic acids.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Using heavy oils can also be challenging when there is a substantial asphaltene content (e.g., 2-12 weight %). Asphaltene is difficult to burn, so a significant amount passes through the furnace as unburned particulate matter, decreasing the thermal efficiency of the fuel and creating serious environmental problems. The unburned combustibles frequently comprise low density, electrically-conductive cenospheric materials having a high carbon content, which makes collection of these materials difficult for electrostatic precipitators. Consequently, an increase in particular emissions often results. Furthermore, unburned carbon tends to absorb sulfuric acid, a by-product of combustion of high sulfur oils, in the combustion system and stack. This results in acid smut fallout.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Refiners continue to seek improved methods for processing and converting, or upgrading, heavy crude oil resources into more useful end products while minimizing deleterious environmental impacts. Nonetheless, many refineries are still poorly-suited for processing heavy crude oils, asphaltenes, or bitumen. In a refinery, crude oil is distilled in a column to separate the heavier hydrocarbon fractions from the lighter hydrocarbon fractions, which are used to make, for example, transportation fuels and lubricating oils and waxes. The lighter hydrocarbon products are collected, leaving behind asphalt and other heavy residual crude products, or &#x201c;residuum,&#x201d; or &#x201c;resid.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The resid usually undergoes additional processing, called &#x201c;coking.&#x201d; A coker thermally breaks down, or cracks, large hydrocarbon molecules into shorter chain molecules to produce a byproduct known as petroleum coke, &#x201c;petro coke,&#x201d; or &#x201c;petcoke.&#x201d; Petcoke is the co-product of upgrading resid into gasoline and middle distillate-range fuels. Petcoke is a black-colored solid composed primarily of carbon, and may contain limited amounts of elemental forms of sulfur, metals, and non-volatile inorganic compounds.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The petroleum industry and federal regulators characterize petcoke as a &#x201c;co-product&#x201d; because it may have some commercial value as a boiler fuel and as a raw material in manufacturing. Nearly half of U.S. petroleum refineries employ &#x201c;coking&#x201d; processes. Refineries also produce petcoke as a by-product of catalysis, which the refineries later consume as a fuel. Despite the range of potential uses for petcoke, high levels of carbon dioxide are emitted from petcoke combustion. Additionally, because petcoke cannot be easily converted to useful products by conventional methods, it is commonly removed from the process, thus reducing the overall potential yield of valuable hydrocarbon material from the upgrading process.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Upgrading petroleum compositions is primarily focused on increasing API gravity and reducing sulfur, metals, and asphaltene content in heavy hydrocarbons. Because refineries often lack the equipment or processes required for upgrading, the viscosity, density and impurity content (i.e., heavy metal, sulfur and nitrogen, content) of such heavy materials must often be altered before refining can occur. A number of layouts for upgrading heavy feeds are possible for refineries, but there are many factors such as oil and product prices, market trends, local needs, physical and chemical properties of the available heavy oil and residua, refinery configuration, and others that must be taken into consideration to define a specific upgrading process scheme. Thus, no general methods exist that can provide a scalable, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly solution to the need for upgrading heavy hydrocarbons.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Because of the importance of safe and efficient oil and gas production, the production and transport challenges caused by heavy molecular weight organic compounds in crude oil, and the untapped potential of heavy oils to be converted into useful products, there is a continuing need for improved methods of upgrading heavy oils, asphaltenes, bitumens and petcoke.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The subject invention provides microbe-based products, as well as their use to improve oil well production and increase the value of crude oil. Specifically, the subject invention provides cultivated yeast products, which can be applied to crude oil and/or to oil and gas production equipment to improve production and increase the value of crude oil by, for example, upgrading heavy oils. Advantageously, the microbe-based products and methods of the subject invention are environmentally-friendly, operational-friendly and cost-effective.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In certain embodiments, the subject invention provides microbe-based products, as well as methods of their use, for improving one or more qualities of oil. Preferably, the oil is heavy oil, which includes extra heavy oil. For example, the subject invention is useful for upgrading heavy oil containing, for example, asphaltenes, and for converting, e.g., asphalt, asphaltenes, bitumens, tars and/or petcoke into lighter, more useful hydrocarbons substances.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In certain embodiments, the subject invention provides methods for improving one or more qualities of oil, for stimulating oil wells, and/or for improving oil production efficiency, by applying a yeast-based composition having a yeast microbe and/or one or more growth by-products thereof to crude oil or to an oil well. Furthermore, the method can optionally comprise applying an ionic or semi-ionic liquid with the microbe-based composition. In preferred embodiments, the crude oil is heavy oil.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Application of the yeast-based compositions can be performed during oil recovery processes, during storage and transport, and/or before the refining process. The yeast-based compositions can be applied to a wellbore, an oilfield storage tank, a tanker, a pipeline and/or oil refinery equipment, and/or can be used for treating oil recovered from tar sands or a remediation site.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The yeast-based composition can also be applied to heavy hydrocarbon substances, such as asphalt, asphaltenes, bitumens, tars and/or petcoke, to convert such substances into lighter, more useful hydrocarbon substances.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The yeast-based composition can comprise yeast microbes and their growth by-products, or, the composition can comprise only yeast growth by-products with the microbes separated (i.e., removed) therefrom. The growth by-products can be any microbial metabolite, such as, for example, a biosurfactant.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment, the method for improving one or more qualities of oil is used for upgrading heavy oil and/or converting heavy hydrocarbons into lighter hydrocarbon substances.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one embodiment, the method for improving one or more qualities of oil is used for increasing the API gravity of heavy oil (including extra heavy oil). In one embodiment, the API gravity can be increased to values above about 20&#xb0;, even more preferably above about 25&#xb0;, 30&#xb0; or even 31&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The oil can be treated in situ, for example, while it is still in a subterranean formation. The subject invention can be used in any type of oil well, including, for example, horizontal, vertical and/or fracking wells.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The oil can also be treated after it has been recovered from an oil well, while it is being stored or transported. Advantageously, this allows for more efficient oil recovery and/or transport due to improved oil qualities, such as reduced viscosity.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment, the methods can further comprise the step of subjecting recovered oil to cavitation either immediately prior to, simultaneously with, and/or sometime after the subject microbe-based composition has been applied thereto. This is particularly useful with heavy and extra heavy oil, as the method can be useful for reducing the viscosity of the oil. The cavitation can be effected using machinery known in the art, for example, hydrodynamic or ultrasonic cavitation methods.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Advantageously, the subject invention can be used to increase the BTU of, e.g., crude oil, heavy crude, asphalts, asphaltenes, bitumens, tar and petcoke with no loss of hydrocarbon content or value. Thus, the subject invention provides methods for increasing the BTU of crude oil and other heavy hydrocarbons.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Furthermore, the subject invention can be used to reduce the viscosity of heavy oil to values below 200 cp, below 150 cp, or even values below 100 cp, 50 cp, or lower, and/or increase the API gravity by 1%, 10%, 50%, 100%, 200% or greater. In one embodiment, API gravity can be increased from values lower than 12&#xb0; (extra heavy oils) to values higher than 12&#xb0;, increased from values lower than 20&#xb0; to values higher than 20&#xb0; (heavy oils), and even to values of 25&#xb0; or 30&#xb0; or higher (medium to light oils).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In preferred embodiments, the subject methods utilize a microbe-based composition comprising a cultivated yeast strain and/or by-products of its growth. In a specific embodiment, the microbes are capable of producing beneficial metabolites, such as, for example, biosurfactants. In one embodiment, the invention provides a microbe-based product comprising cultivated <i>Starmerella </i>clade yeasts and/or growth by-products thereof, cultivated <i>Wickerhamomyces </i>or <i>Pichia </i>clade yeasts, and/or growth by-products thereof, or any yeast species related to these clades (e.g., belonging to the same family or genus), and/or growth by-products thereof.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The microbe-based compositions according to the subject invention are obtained through cultivation processes ranging from small to large scale. The cultivation process can be, for example, submerged cultivation, solid state fermentation (SSF), and/or a combination thereof. In certain embodiments, the microbe-based composition comprises one or more biosurfactants. The biosurfactants can be selected from glycolipids, such as sophorolipids (SLP), rhamnolipids (RLP), trehalose lipids (TL), and mannosylerythritol lipids (MEL). The biosurfactants can also be selected from lipopeptides, such as surfactin, iturin, fengycin and lichenysin.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The biosurfactants can be present in the composition as a result of microbial growth, i.e., they can be produced by the microorganisms of the microbe-based composition. Alternatively, or additionally, the biosurfactants can be added in a purified form and/or in a crude form (e.g., in the form of fermentation broth without being subjected to purification). In some embodiments, the composition further comprises an ionic or semi-ionic liquid.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In certain embodiments, use of yeast-based compositions according to the subject invention can be superior to, for example, purified microbial metabolites alone, due to, for example, the advantageous properties of the yeast cell walls. These properties include high concentrations of mannoprotein as a part of yeast cell wall's outer surface (mannoprotein is a highly effective bioemulsifier) and the presence of the biopolymer beta-glucan (also an effective emulsifier) in yeast cell walls. Additionally, the yeast fermentation product further can comprise a variety of metabolites in the culture, including biosurfactants, which are capable of reducing both surface and interfacial tension, emulsifying oil, and improving oil mobility, as well as others (e.g., lactic acid, ethyl acetate, ethanol, etc.).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In certain embodiments of the subject method, when oil is being treated in situ, the yeasts of the yeast-based composition have preferably been separated from the composition.

Specifically, the subject invention provides cultivated yeast products, which can be applied to crude oil and/or to oil and gas production equipment to improve production and increase the value of crude oil by, for example, upgrading heavy oils. Advantageously, the microbe-based products and methods of the subject invention are environmentally-friendly, operational-friendly and cost-effective.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In certain embodiments, the subject invention provides microbe-based products, as well as methods of their use, for improving one or more qualities of oil, stimulating oil wells, and/or improving oil production efficiency, by applying a composition having a yeast microbe and/or a growth product thereof to crude oil or to an oil well. Preferably, the oil is heavy oil.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, the subject invention is useful for upgrading heavy oil or for converting heavy hydrocarbon substances, e.g., asphalt, asphaltenes, bitumens, tars and/or petcoke, into lighter hydrocarbon substances with greater utility than their heavier predecessors.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">If desired, the subject compositions and methods can be used to supplement and/or enhance, or can be supplemented and/or enhanced by, existing mechanical, thermal and/or chemical treatments.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Advantageously, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the subject invention can be used to increase the BTU of crude oil, heavy crude and petcoke with no loss of hydrocarbon content or value and no increase in total acid number (TAN). Accordingly, the subject invention provides methods for increasing the BTU of crude oil, which can also be used to increase the value of heavy crude reserves.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Furthermore, the subject invention can be used to reduce the viscosity of heavy oil to values below 200 cp, below 150 cp, or even values below 100 cp, 50 cp, or lower, and/or increase the API gravity by 1%, 10%, 50%, 100%, 200% or greater. In one embodiment, API gravity can be increased from values lower than 12&#xb0; (extra heavy oils) to values higher than 12&#xb0;, increased from values lower than 20&#xb0; to values higher than 20&#xb0; (heavy oils), and even to values of 25&#xb0; or 30&#xb0; or higher (medium to light oils).</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Selected Definitions</heading><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As used herein, reference to a &#x201c;microbe-based composition&#x201d; means a composition that comprises components that were produced as the result of the growth of microorganisms or other cell cultures. For example, a yeast-based composition is a microbe-based composition comprising components that were produced as the result of cultivation of yeasts. The microbe-based composition may comprise the microbes themselves and/or by-products of microbial growth. The microbes may be active, vegetative or inactive, or a mixture of these. The microbes may be planktonic or in a biofilm form, or a mixture of both. The by-products of growth may be, for example, metabolites (e.g., biosurfactants), cell membrane components, expressed proteins, and/or other cellular components. The microbes may be intact or lysed. The cells may be absent (i.e., separate or removed) from the composition, or present at, for example, a concentration of 1&#xd7;10<sup>4</sup>, 1&#xd7;10<sup>5</sup>, 1&#xd7;10<sup>6</sup>, 1&#xd7;10<sup>7</sup>, 1&#xd7;10<sup>8</sup>, 1&#xd7;10<sup>9</sup>, 1&#xd7;10<sup>10</sup>, or 1&#xd7;10<sup>11 </sup>or more cells per milliliter of the composition.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The subject invention further provides &#x201c;microbe-based products,&#x201d; which are products that are to be applied in practice to achieve a desired result. The microbe-based product can be simply the microbe-based composition harvested from the microbe cultivation process. Alternatively, the microbe-based product may have components that are removed (e.g., cells) or may comprise further ingredients that have been added. These additional ingredients can include, for example, stabilizers, buffers, carriers (e.g., water or salt solutions), added nutrients to support further microbial growth, non-nutrient growth enhancers and/or agents that facilitate tracking of the microbes and/or the composition in the environment to which it is applied. The microbe-based product may also comprise mixtures of microbe-based compositions. The microbe-based product may also comprise one or more components of a microbe-based composition that have been processed in some way such as, but not limited to, filtering, centrifugation, lysing, drying, purification and the like.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">A &#x201c;metabolite&#x201d; refers to any substance produced by metabolism or a substance necessary for taking part in a particular metabolic process. A metabolite can be an organic compound that is a starting material (e.g., glucose), an intermediate (e.g., acetyl-CoA) in, or an end product (e.g., n-butanol) of metabolism. Examples of metabolites can include, but are not limited to, enzymes, toxins, acids, solvents, alcohols, proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, microelements, amino acids, polymers, and surfactants.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As used herein, &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; or &#x201c;purified&#x201d; compounds, e.g., nucleic acid molecules, polynucleotides, polypeptides, proteins or organic compounds, are substantially free of other compounds, such as cellular material, with which they are associated in nature. A purified or isolated polynucleotide (RNA or DNA) is free of the genes or sequences that flank it in its naturally-occurring state. A purified or isolated polypeptide is free of other molecules, or the amino acids that flank it, in its naturally-occurring state. A purified or isolated microbial strain is removed from the environment in which it exists in nature. Thus, the isolated strain may exist as, for example, a biologically pure culture, or as spores (or other forms of the strain) in association with, for example, a carrier.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In certain embodiments, purified compounds are at least 60% by weight the compound of interest. Preferably, the preparation is at least 75%, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably at least 99%, by weight the compound of interest. For example, a purified compound is one that is at least 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 98%, 99%, or 100% (w/w) of the desired compound by weight. Purity is measured by any appropriate standard method, for example, by column chromatography, thin layer chromatography, or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Ranges provided herein are understood to be shorthand for all of the values within the range.

With respect to sub-ranges, &#x201c;nested sub-ranges&#x201d; that extend from either end point of the range are specifically contemplated. For example, a nested sub-range of an exemplary range of 1 to 50 may comprise 1 to 10, 1 to 20, 1 to 30, and 1 to 40 in one direction, or 50 to 40, 50 to 30, 50 to 20, and 50 to 10 in the other direction.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">As used herein, &#x201c;reduces&#x201d; means a negative alteration of at least 1%, 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100%.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As used herein, &#x201c;reference&#x201d; means a standard or control condition.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As used herein, &#x201c;surfactant&#x201d; means a surface-active substance that lowers the surface tension (or interfacial tension) between two liquids or between a liquid and a solid. Surfactants act as, e.g., detergents, wetting agents, emulsifiers, foaming agents, and/or dispersants.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">A &#x201c;biosurfactant&#x201d; is a surface-active substance produced by a living cell. Biosurfactants are biodegradable and can be produced efficiently using selected organisms on renewable substrates. All biosurfactants are amphiphiles. They consist of two parts: a polar (hydrophilic) moiety and non-polar (hydrophobic) group. Due to their amphiphilic structure, biosurfactants increase the surface area of hydrophobic water-insoluble substances, increase the water bioavailability of such substances, and can even change the properties of bacterial cell surfaces.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Biosurfactants include low molecular weight glycolipids (e.g., rhamnolipids, sophorolipids, trehalose lipids and mannosylerythritol lipids), lipopeptides (e.g., surfactin, iturin, fengycin and lichenysin), flavolipids, phospholipids, and high molecular weight polymers such as lipoproteins, lipopolysaccharide-protein complexes, and polysaccharide-protein-fatty acid complexes. The common lipophilic moiety of a biosurfactant molecule is the hydrocarbon chain of a fatty acid, whereas the hydrophilic part is formed by ester or alcohol groups of neutral lipids, by the carboxylate group of fatty acids or amino acids (or peptides), organic acid in the case of flavolipids, or, in the case of glycolipids, by the carbohydrate.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">As used herein, &#x201c;heavy oil&#x201d; or &#x201c;heavy hydrocarbons&#x201d; mean viscous hydrocarbon substances. Heavy hydrocarbons may comprise highly viscous hydrocarbons such as heavy oil, extra heavy oil, bitumen, tar, petcoke, asphaltenes and/or asphalt. Heavy oils and extra heavy oils are highly viscous with a density close to or even exceeding water. The phrase &#x201c;heavy oil&#x201d; as used herein also includes &#x201c;extra heavy oil.&#x201d; Heavy hydrocarbons may comprise moderate to high quantities of paraffins, resins and asphaltenes, as well as smaller concentrations of sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. Heavy hydrocarbons may also include aromatics or other complex ring hydrocarbons. Additional elements, e.g., metals, may also be present in heavy hydrocarbons in trace amounts. Heavy hydrocarbons may be classified by API gravity. Heavy hydrocarbons generally have an API gravity below about 20&#xb0; or lower. Heavy oil, for example, generally has an API gravity of about 10-20&#xb0;, whereas extra heavy oil generally has an API gravity below about 12&#xb0;. The viscosity of heavy hydrocarbons is generally greater than about 200 cp at reservoir conditions, and that of extra heavy oil is generally about 10,000 cp or more. (For reference, as used herein, &#x201c;light oil&#x201d; or &#x201c;light hydrocarbons&#x201d; have an API gravity above 20&#xb0;, preferably above about 25&#xb0;, even more preferably above 30&#xb0; to 31&#xb0;, and a viscosity of about 1 to 100 cp).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The transitional term &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; which is synonymous with &#x201c;including,&#x201d; or &#x201c;containing,&#x201d; is inclusive or open-ended and does not exclude additional, unrecited elements or method steps.

In specific embodiments, materials and methods are provided for upgrading heavy oil and/or converting heavy hydrocarbon substances, such as asphalt, asphaltenes, bitumens, tars and/or petcoke, including those in solid form, into lighter hydrocarbons with greater utility than their heavier predecessors.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In specific preferred embodiments, methods for upgrading heavy oil are provided, wherein a microbe-based composition comprising a cultivated yeast and/or a growth by-product thereof, is applied to the heavy oil or to an oil well containing heavy oil. The composition can be applied to crude oil in situ prior to its recovery from an oil well, e.g., by injecting it into an oil well. The composition can also be applied to crude oil after its recovery, for example, while the oil is being stored or transported.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Optionally, the method can further comprise applying an ionic or semi-ionic liquid, and/or a crude form or pure form biosurfactant.

For example, the BTU, i.e., energy or heat content, of the oil can be increased, thus increasing the economic value of heavy crude before it is sold to refineries. This can also benefit oil refineries, who can purchase less expensive heavy crude and convert it to a more usable product, such as, for example, road asphalt, using the subject methods and compositions. Upgrading can also involve increasing the API gravity (e.g., converting heavy and extra heavy oil to light oil, or to oil having API gravity from values lower than 12&#xb0; (extra heavy oils) to values higher than 12&#xb0; or even up to 30&#xb0; to 31&#xb0; or higher (light oils)), reducing viscosity (e.g., to values below 200 cp, below 150 cp, or even values below 100 cp, 50 cp, or lower), and/or reducing the impurities content of heavy hydrocarbons. Typical impurities found in heavy oil can include, for example, sulfur or hydrogen sulfide, ash, nitrogen, heavy metals, olefins, aromatics, naphthenes, and asphaltenes.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The subject invention can be used to reduce the viscosity of heavy oil, and/or increase the API gravity by 1%, 10%, 50%, 100%, 200% or greater.

Thus, in one embodiment, the subject methods can comprise contacting a composition according to the subject invention with pipes, tanks, tubes, rods, pumps, equipment, and/or surfaces or materials. In one embodiment, the methods can comprise injecting the composition into horizontal, vertical, and/or fracking oil wells, into wellbores, into refinery separators, desalters or dehydrators, or into the piping, pumps, flowlines, storage tanks, etc. associated with oil wells and/or refineries. Even further, the method can comprise contacting the composition directly with crude oil and other heavy hydrocarbons, for example, if the oil is present in any of the above equipment or structures at the time of application.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Advantageously, the subject invention can be applied during all stages of the chain of operations, including exploration and production (E&#x26;P) operators (e.g., onshore and offshore wellbores, flowlines, and tanks), midstream (e.g., pipelines, tankers, transportation, storage tanks), and as part of refining (e.g., pre-refining treatment).</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In one embodiment, a method of treating a working well, including the surrounding formation, includes the steps of pouring or injecting the composition down the casing side (back lines) of a well and allowing it to mix with the fluid that is already in the well. When enough fluid is present, the composition can then optionally be circulated by, for example, a pump for 24-72 hours, preferably 48-72 hours. Prior to circulating, the composition may be allowed to set for 8 to 24 hours, for example. The setting time, circulating time and dosage depend on the amount heavy oils, asphaltene, asphalt, tar, etc., anticipated to be present, as well as the depth and size of the well. A basic initial dosage can be, but is not limited to, 20 gallons of composition and for maintaining a clear structure, at least about 5 gallons of composition per well on periodic basis, e.g., biweekly, monthly, bimonthly.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In additional embodiments, the method may comprise applying a composition of the subject invention directly to equipment. For example, prior to placing rods and casings into gas and/or oil wells, these parts may be sprayed with, or soaked in, the composition. The parts may also be dipped into tanks filled with the composition.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The composition may be introduced by means of injection pumps into off-shore gas or oil wells. To treat the lines, from 40-50 gallons to 20-100 barrels, for example, of the composition can be dropped into the lines at an injection rate of, for example, 1 to 10 gallons per minute, or 1 to 10 barrels per minute.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In one embodiment, the subject invention can be used for treating heavy oil, for example, prior to refining or distillation. In another embodiment, the subject invention can be used for liquefying, dissolving or softening solidified or precipitated asphaltenes, or other heavy hydrocarbon substances, such as asphalts, tars, bitumens. In some embodiments, the heavy hydrocarbon substances were previously separated and/or recovered from heavy crude oil fluids. In yet another embodiment, the subject invention can be used as part of the refining process for treating resid and/or petcoke.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Advantageously, the subject invention can be effective for converting heavy elements of crude oil to more economically valuable elements. In some embodiments, the subject invention can convert, for example, asphaltenes, asphalts, tar, bitumens and/or petcokes into more valuable and useful components, such as lighter hydrocarbon substances, without degrading the crude oil into methane or other gases. This can be achieved in, for example, 12 hours or less, preferably in 8 to 12 hours. The heavy hydrocarbon substances can be converted into a flammable, soluble form, with greater utility over their less flammable solid states. Additionally, heavy hydrocarbon precipitate that would otherwise be disposed of as waste can be made valuable again by dissolving the precipitate back into liquid solution either in situ in the well or in storage tanks after extraction.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The composition may also be applied to formations containing heavy crude oil. Advantageously, the subject invention can reduce the viscosity and increase the API gravity of heavy crudes, as well as reduce or eliminate the need for steam injection and other thermal, chemical and mechanical methods of heavy oil extraction. Further reduced or eliminated are the need for diluents (e.g., light or refined crude oil) and water jackets to help move heavy crude through pipelines. Even further, with the reduction of heavy oil viscosity, transportation of oil is less complicated or costly, as the need for tanker trucks and storage tanks is reduced and the use of pipeline transport becomes more feasible.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">If desired, however, the subject compositions and methods can be used to supplement and/or enhance, or can be supplemented and/or enhanced by, existing mechanical, thermal and/or chemical treatments.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In one embodiment, the subject methods further comprises the step of subjecting the heavy oil to cavitation either immediately prior to, simultaneously with, and/or sometime after the subject microbe-based composition has been applied to the heavy oil. The cavitation can be effected using machinery known in the art, for example, hydrodynamic or ultrasonic cavitation methods.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">As used herein, &#x201c;cavitation&#x201d; in the context of treating heavy oil means the formation, growth, and collapse or implosion of gas or vapor filled bubbles in liquids. Cavitation requires the presence of small and transient microcavities or microbubbles of vapor or gas, which grow and then implode or collapse. During cavitation of heavy oil, a portion of the liquid comprising the heavy oil is in the form of a gas, which is dispersed as bubbles in the liquid portion. The process effectively destructures the molecular arrangement of heavy hydrocarbons in oil (e.g., asphaltenes, which can form highly associative and cohesive aggregates), thereby reducing its viscosity.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The cavitation step according to the subject methods can be applied to heavy crude oil at any point during the oil recovery and transport chain of operation in order to prevent or reduce sedimentation of heavy hydrocarbons in the crude fluids, for example, after recovery from a well and before being placed in a collection tank; during storage; after storage in a collection tank and before being transported in a tanker; during transportation; and before the refining process. Cavitation machinery can be attached to a storage tank, tanker truck, pump system, piping, tubing, and/or any other equipment used for transport, transmission and/or storage of crude oil.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In one embodiment, the methods can be used to upgrade oil that has been recovered from oil sands and/or from a remediation site (e.g., an oil spill).</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In certain embodiments, the present invention can be used for the liquefaction and/or dispersal of precipitated and/or solid asphaltene and/or other heavy hydrocarbon substances that might act as contaminants on the surfaces of equipment, thus allowing for efficient removal of these contaminants from the crude oil and from equipment.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In one embodiment, the subject invention can be used for preventing heavy hydrocarbons from precipitating and/or depositing onto surfaces. Dispersal, or dissolution, of precipitates decreases the concentration of contaminants available in the oil to deposit on or in the oil and gas equipment. Thus, the present invention allows for delaying or completely removing the necessity for preventative maintenance related to removing precipitates and deposits, as well as the need for replacing or repairing equipment parts.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In some embodiments, it may be desirable to introduce the composition through perforations in the casing, into the surrounding formation. The composition may be forced into the surrounding formation by applied pressure or, if the composition is allowed to set at the bottom of the casing, the composition may seep into the formation without additional pressure. The composition permeates the formation, dissolving blockages in the formation to provide more efficient oil and gas recovery.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The microbe-based product may be applied with a composition that promotes adherence of the microbe-based product to a surface to be treated. The adherence-promoting substance may be a component of the microbe-based product or it may be applied simultaneously with, or sequentially with, the microbe-based product. Adherence-promoters can include organic or inorganic particles, ions such as calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and sodium, iron, carbon sources that are metabolized to acetyl coenzyme A, acetyl phosphate, and acetate.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Advantageously, the subject invention is environmentally friendly in that it can reduce greenhouse gas emissions related to the extraction, transport and refining of heavy crude oil, for example, by 50%, when compared to existing operations. This is mainly due to a reduction in the energy required for transportation and hauling via fuel-burning trucks; however, reduction in methane released during treatment of oil, and reduced exhaust from engines, turbines and fired heaters in extraction and refining of heavy oils also contribute to the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Local Production of Microorganisms</heading><p id="p-0104" num="0103">The subject invention provides methods for cultivation of microorganisms and production of microbial metabolites and/or other by-products of microbial growth.

Advantageously, the compositions can be tailored for use at a specified location. In one embodiment, the microbe growth facility is located on, or near, a site where the microbe-based products will be used.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Advantageously, in preferred embodiments, the methods of the subject invention harness the power of naturally-occurring local microorganisms and their metabolic by-products to improve oil production, transmission and/or refining. Local microbes can be identified based on, for example, salt tolerance, ability to grow at high temperatures, and the use of genetic identification of the sequences described herein.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The microbe growth facilities provide manufacturing versatility by their ability to tailor the microbe-based products to improve synergies with destination geographies. The microbe growth facilities may operate off the grid by utilizing, for example, solar, wind and/or hydroelectric power. Thus, the microbe-based compositions can be produced in remote locations.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">The growth vessel used for growing microorganisms can be any fermenter or cultivation reactor for industrial use. In one embodiment, the vessel may have functional controls/sensors or may be connected to functional controls/sensors to measure important factors in the cultivation process, such as pH, oxygen, pressure, temperature, agitator shaft power, humidity, viscosity and/or microbial density and/or metabolite concentration.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In a further embodiment, the vessel may also be able to monitor the growth of microorganisms inside the vessel (e.g., measurement of cell number and growth phases). Alternatively, a daily sample may be taken from the vessel and subjected to enumeration by techniques known in the art, such as dilution plating technique. Dilution plating is a simple technique used to estimate the number of microbes in a sample. The technique can also provide an index by which different environments or treatments can be compared.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In one embodiment, the method includes supplementing the cultivation with a nitrogen source. The nitrogen source can be, for example, potassium nitrate, ammonium nitrate ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonia, urea, and/or ammonium chloride. These nitrogen sources may be used independently or in a combination of two or more.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">The method can provide oxygenation to the growing culture. One embodiment utilizes slow motion of air to remove low-oxygen containing air and introduce oxygenated air. The oxygenated air may be ambient air supplemented daily through mechanisms including impellers for mechanical agitation of the liquid, and air spargers for supplying bubbles of gas to the liquid for dissolution of oxygen into the liquid.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">The method can further comprise supplementing the cultivation with a carbon source. The carbon source is typically a carbohydrate, such as glucose, sucrose, lactose, fructose, trehalose, mannose, mannitol, and/or maltose; organic acids such as acetic acid, fumaric acid, citric acid, propionic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, and/or pyruvic acid; alcohols such as ethanol, isopropyl, propanol, butanol, pentanol, hexanol, isobutanol, and/or glycerol; fats and oils such as soybean oil, rice bran oil, canola oil, olive oil, corn oil, sesame oil, and/or linseed oil; etc. These carbon sources may be used independently or in a combination of two or more.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In a preferred embodiment, the method comprises use of two carbon sources, one of which is a saturated oil selected from canola, vegetable, corn, coconut, olive, or any other oil suitable for use in, for example, cooking. In a specific embodiment, the saturated oil is 15% canola oil or discarded oil that has been used for cooking.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In one embodiment, growth factors and trace nutrients for microorganisms are included in the medium.

Antimicrobial agents or antibiotics are used for protecting the culture against contamination. Additionally, antifoaming agents may also be added to prevent the formation and/or accumulation of foam when gas is produced during cultivation.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">The pH of the mixture should be suitable for the microorganism of interest. Buffers, and pH regulators, such as carbonates and phosphates, may be used to stabilize pH near a preferred value. When metal ions are present in high concentrations, use of a chelating agent in the liquid medium may be necessary.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">The method and equipment for cultivation of microorganisms and production of the microbial by-products can be performed in a batch, quasi-continuous, or continuous processes.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">In one embodiment, the method for cultivation of microorganisms is carried out at about 5&#xb0; to about 100&#xb0; C., preferably, 15 to 60&#xb0; C., more preferably, 25 to 50&#xb0; C. In a further embodiment, the cultivation may be carried out continuously at a constant temperature. In another embodiment, the cultivation may be subject to changing temperatures.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">In one embodiment, the equipment used in the method and cultivation process is sterile. The cultivation equipment such as the reactor/vessel may be separated from, but connected to, a sterilizing unit, e.g., an autoclave. The cultivation equipment may also have a sterilizing unit that sterilizes in situ before starting the inoculation. Air can be sterilized by methods know in the art. For example, the ambient air can pass through at least one filter before being introduced into the vessel. In other embodiments, the medium may be pasteurized or, optionally, no heat at all added, where the use of low water activity and low pH may be exploited to control bacterial growth.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In one embodiment, the subject invention provides methods of producing a microbial metabolite by cultivating a microbe strain of the subject invention under conditions appropriate for growth and production of the metabolite; and purifying the metabolite. In a specific embodiment, the metabolite is a biosurfactant. The metabolite may also be, for example, ethanol, lactic acid, beta-glucan, proteins, amino acids, toxins, peptides, metabolic intermediates, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and lipids. The metabolite content produced by the method can be, for example, at least 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90%.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">The biomass content of the fermentation broth may be, for example from 5 g/l to 180 g/l or more. In one embodiment, the solids content of the broth is from 10 g/l to 150 g/l.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">The microbial growth by-product produced by microorganisms of interest may be retained in the microorganisms or secreted into the liquid medium. In another embodiment, the method for producing microbial growth by-product may further comprise steps of concentrating and purifying the microbial growth by-product of interest. In a further embodiment, the liquid medium may contain compounds that stabilize the activity of microbial growth by-product.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">In one embodiment, all of the microbial cultivation composition is removed upon the completion of the cultivation (e.g., upon, for example, achieving a desired cell density, or density of a specified metabolite in the broth). In this batch procedure, an entirely new batch is initiated upon harvesting of the first batch.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">In another embodiment, only a portion of the fermentation product is removed at any one time. In this embodiment, biomass with viable cells remains in the vessel as an inoculant for a new cultivation batch. The composition that is removed can be a microbe-free broth or contain cells, spores, mycelia, conidia or other reproductive propagules. In this manner, a quasi-continuous system is created.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Advantageously, the methods of cultivation do not require complicated equipment or high energy consumption. The microorganisms of interest can be cultivated at small or large scale on site and utilized, even being still-mixed with their media. Similarly, the microbial metabolites can also be produced at large quantities at the site of need.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">Because the microbe-based products can be generated locally, without resort to the microorganism stabilization, preservation, storage and transportation processes of conventional microbial production, a much higher density of live microbes, spores, mycelia, conidia or other microbial propagules can be generated, thereby requiring a smaller volume of the microbe-based product for use in the on-site application or which allows much higher density microbial applications where necessary to achieve the desired efficacy. This allows for a scaled-down bioreactor (e.g., smaller fermentation tank, smaller supplies of starter material, nutrients, pH control agents, and defoaming agents), which makes the system efficient. Local generation of the microbe-based product also facilitates the inclusion of the growth broth in the product. The broth can contain agents produced during the fermentation that are particularly well-suited for local use.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">Locally-produced high density, robust cultures of microbes are more effective in the field than those that have undergone vegetative cell stabilization, have been sporulated or have sat in the supply chain for some time. The microbe-based products of the subject invention are particularly advantageous compared to traditional products wherein cells, spores, mycelia, conidia and/or other microbial propagules have been separated from metabolites and nutrients present in the fermentation growth media. Reduced transportation times allow for the production and delivery of fresh batches of microbes and/or their metabolites at the time and volume as required by local demand.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Advantageously, these microbe growth facilities provide a solution to the current problem of relying on far-flung industrial-sized producers whose product quality suffers due to upstream processing delays, supply chain bottlenecks, improper storage, and other contingencies that inhibit the timely delivery and application of, for example, a viable, high cell- and/or propagule-count product and the associated broth and metabolites in which the microbes are originally grown.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">Local production and delivery within, for example, 24 hours of fermentation results in pure, high cell density compositions and substantially lower shipping costs. Given the prospects for rapid advancement in the development of more effective and powerful microbial inoculants, consumers will benefit greatly from this ability to rapidly deliver microbe-based products.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Preparation of Microbe-Based Products</heading><p id="p-0134" num="0133">The subject invention provides microbe-based products (e.g., yeast fermentation products) for use in improving the quality of oil, stimulating oil wells, and/or improving oil production efficiency. One microbe-based product of the subject invention is simply the fermentation broth containing the microorganism and/or the microbial metabolites produced by the microorganism and/or any residual nutrients. The product of fermentation may be used directly without extraction or purification. If desired, extraction and purification can be easily achieved using standard extraction and/or purification methods or techniques described in the literature.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">The microorganisms in the microbe-based product may be in an active or inactive form. Furthermore, the yeast cells can optionally be separated from the composition altogether. The microbe-based products may be used without further stabilization, preservation, and storage. Advantageously, direct usage of these microbe-based products preserves a high viability of the microorganisms, reduces the possibility of contamination from foreign agents and undesirable microorganisms, and maintains the activity of the by-products of microbial growth.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">The microbes and/or broth resulting from the microbial growth can be removed from the growth vessel and transferred via, for example, piping for immediate use.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">In one embodiment, the microbe-based product is simply the growth by-products of the microorganism.

Typically, the pH begins at 5.0-5.5, then decreases to 3.0-3.5, where it is stabilized. The fermentation broth, which can be harvested after, for example, 20-24 hours of cultivation at 25-30&#xb0; C., comprises the yeast fermentation product.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">In certain embodiments, use of yeast fermentation products according to the subject invention can be superior to, for example, purified microbial metabolites alone, due to, for example, the advantageous properties of the yeast cell walls. These properties include high concentrations of mannoprotein as a part of yeast cell wall's outer surface (mannoprotein is a highly effective bioemulsifier) and the presence of biopolymer beta-glucan (an emulsifier) in yeast cell walls. Additionally, the yeast fermentation product further can comprise biosurfactants in the culture, which are capable of reducing both surface and interfacial tension, and other metabolites (e.g., lactic acid, ethyl acetate, ethanol, etc.) in the culture.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">Upon harvesting the yeast-based composition from the growth vessels, further components can be added as the harvested product is placed into containers and/or piped (or otherwise transported for use).
