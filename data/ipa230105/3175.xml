The present disclosure also concerns an alveolar core structure thus obtained, and an acoustic attenuation panel and a nacelle including such an alveolar core structure.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The statements in this section merely provide background information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An aircraft is propelled by one or several propulsion unit(s) each comprising a turbojet engine housed within a nacelle. Each propulsion unit is attached to the aircraft by a mast generally located below or over a wing or at the fuselage of the aircraft.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A nacelle generally has a tubular structure comprising an air inlet upstream of the turbojet engine, a middle section intended to surround a fan of the turbojet engine, a downstream section which can accommodate thrust reversal means and intended to surround the combustion chamber of the turbojet engine, and generally terminates in an ejection nozzle whose outlet is located downstream of the turbojet engine.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Turbojet engines generate significant noise pollution. To address this noise pollution, acoustic-type structures including a so-called acoustic or resistive, air-permeable front skin, and a so-called solid, air-impermeable rear skin are disposed along surfaces guiding the air flows of the turbojet engine. An alveolar core comprising cells is disposed between these two skins, and fastened to at least one of the two skins. In this type of acoustic structure, the acoustic skin is arranged opposite the sound source to be attenuated, and it has perforations to enable the passage of sound waves through the acoustic skin, so that the sound wave penetrates into the cells of the alveolar core. Each cell extends along a longitudinal main axis corresponding to a noise propagation axis. The length of the cells allows determining the frequency at which the acoustic attenuation of the cells is maximum. Typically, an alveolar core with a 30 millimeter thickness is adapted to attenuate frequencies close to 2000 Hertz, and an alveolar core with a 70 millimeter thickness is adapted to attenuate frequencies close to 880 Hertz.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a known manner, according to a so-called &#x201c;Honeycomb&#x201d; structure technique, an alveolar core is generally obtained by superimposing several light alloy or composite metal sheets between which gluing means, which cause the sheets to adhere to each other in some points, called nodal areas, are punctually disposed. The alveolar core structure thus produced is considered to be in a compacted form. In order to form the alveolar cells, the structure in a compacted form undergoes a stretching so as to separate the sheets which remain joined together at the nodal areas. The alveolar core structure thus produced is considered to be in an expanded form.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The length of the cells allows determining the frequency at which the acoustic attenuation of the cells is maximum. Typically, an alveolar core with a 30 millimeter thickness is adapted to attenuate frequencies close to 2000 Hertz, and an alveolar core with a 70 millimeter thickness is adapted to attenuate frequencies close to 880 Hertz.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">To acoustically attenuate low sound frequencies, and limit the thickness of the acoustic cells, it is known to dispose an obstacle in the acoustic cells, so as to increase the length of the path traveled by the sound waves through the cell.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Such an obstacle is, for example, a cone, open at its base and including a second opening defining a separation between two ducts in the acoustic cell and a communication neck between these two ducts for circulating the sound wave. By providing for such cones, the average frequency effectively attenuated by the acoustic system is lowered, yet without increasing the thickness of the acoustic structure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">These cones are placed in the alveolar core structure, in particular by welding.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The manufacture of these cones inside the alveolar cells is thus extremely complex, and the time required for the manufacture of the alveolar core structure is very long. Also, an alveolar core structure manufactured by this type of prior art method is very expensive.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present disclosure provides a method for manufacturing an alveolar core structure for an acoustic attenuation panel. The alveolar core structure includes a plurality of adjoining acoustic cells which form the alveolar core, each acoustic cell extending along a main axis corresponding to an axis of propagation of a sound wave, from a front end up to a rear end, and being delimited by a peripheral wall defining a primary duct for circulating the sound wave, at least one cell including a secondary duct for circulating the sound wave, the secondary duct comprising a secondary duct wall having a first end proximal to the front end of the cell, the first end defining a sound wave inlet, and an opposite second end, the secondary duct comprising a sound wave outlet located near the rear end of the cell. The method comprises a fastening step in which adhesive tapes parallel to each other and transverse to the longitudinal direction of said first plate are applied, on a first longitudinal plate, so as to form nodal areas. The secondary duct in the form of a flattened element is fastened, on the first plate between two nodal areas, by gluing at its sound wave inlet. A second plate is applied so that it is fastened by gluing to the nodal areas, and to the flattened element at the wave inlet. A deployment step in which the first and second plates are moved away from one another so as to form the peripheral wall of the cells and so that the flattened element is deployed to form the secondary duct.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Thus, the step of fastening the secondary duct is carried out at ground level, which simplifies the manufacturing method and thus reduces costs. Following the fastening step, an unexpanded block, also called an unexpanded honeycomb block, is obtained.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">As used herein, &#x201c;adhesive tape&#x201d; should be understood to mean any gluing means, such as a film of glue or any other sticky element.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The secondary duct is a sound wave guide.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The nodal areas correspond to the junction areas between the first and second plates to form the peripheral walls of the cells.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The flattened element is shaped as at least one secondary duct in a flattened form of an acoustic cell.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to other features of the present disclosure, the method includes one or more of the following optional features considered alone or according to all possible combinations.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the deployed form of the alveolar core, when cut to the desired thickness, the secondary duct is characterized in that it is glued along a perimeter of attachment to the walls of the cell delimited by two nodal areas between two plates. In addition, it includes in the portion not glued to the walls of the cell, at least one orifice so as to constitute a connection neck between the primary duct and the secondary duct.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The non-glued portion has a perimeter smaller than the attachment perimeter.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to one feature, the fastening step is repeated by alternating the positions of the nodal areas, so as to obtain several superimposed layers of flattened elements between the first and second plates, before the deployment step.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to this feature, the second plate serves as a second plate for one layer and as a first plate for another adjacent layer.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to one feature, the deployment step is preceded by a consolidation step during which the adhesive tapes are polymerized organic tapes.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to one feature, at least two adjoining cells include a secondary duct for circulating the sound wave, said secondary circuits being fastened to the first plate in a flattened form while being linked to each other by their wall at their wave inlet.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to one feature, the flattened element is shaped as two flattened secondary ducts, linked by their respective sound wave inlet.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Thus, during the fastening step, between two nodal areas, a flattened element shaped as first and second flattened secondary ducts, linked by their sound wave inlet, is fastened before applying the second plate, so as to obtain a substantially flat assembly, comprising the first plate, the second plate and the flattened element.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to this feature, the method includes a step of cutting, transversely to the longitudinal direction of the first and second plates, so as to separate the flattened element to form two distinct assemblies, one including a first secondary duct and the other including a second secondary duct.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one form, this cutting step is carried out by machining after the deployment step.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Alternatively, the cutting step is carried out before the deployment step.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to this feature, the deployment step is carried out separately for each substantially flat assembly including a flattened secondary duct.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to one feature, the cells have a larger dimension comprised between 3 and 50 mm.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to one feature, the nodal areas are spaced apart by a distance comprised between 3 and 100 mm and, in one form, between 4 and 75 mm.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to one feature, the perimeter of attachment of the secondary duct to the walls of the cell is comprised between 9 and 300 mm.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to one feature, the nodal areas are spaced apart by a variable distance comprised between 3 and 100 mm.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to one feature, the flattened element has a flattened conical or frustoconical shape so that the secondary duct has a conical or frustoconical shape.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Alternatively, the flattened element has a diabolo, an ogive-like or a flattened semi-circle shape, so that the secondary duct has a diabolo, an ogive-like or a semi-circle shape.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to one feature, the wave outlet of the secondary duct has a diameter smaller than that of the wave inlet.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to one feature, the wave outlet of the secondary circuit is disposed in the wall of the secondary duct, in its rear half, that is to say proximal to the rear end of the cell.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to one feature, the acoustic cells have a deployable polygonal shape (for example, pentagonal or hexagonal).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to this feature, the first and second plates have folds intended to delimit edges to obtain polygonal acoustic cells during the deployment step.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In addition, the flattened element has folds intended to delimit edges to obtain a polygonal conical or frustoconical-shaped secondary duct.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to one feature, the acoustic cells have flat or corrugated peripheral walls.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to one feature, the wave outlet of the secondary circuit is circular in shape.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to one feature, the constituent material of the first and second plates is an aluminum alloy.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to one feature, the constituent material of the secondary duct is an organic material, in one form selected from the groups of thermoplastics, such as, for example, PEI PEEK, PI, Polyester, PA.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">According to one feature, the constituent material of the first and second plates is a composite material such as a phenolic, epoxy, bismaleideimide (BMI) or polyimide matrix material and including fibers such as glass fibers, or aramid fibers, such as fibers registered under the trademark Nomex&#xae; or Kevlar&#xae;.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to another feature, the constituent material of the first and second plates is a composite material of the family of so-called ceramic materials, based on carbon fibers or SiC or aluminized oxides, and having a ceramic matrix such as geopolymers, Sic or aluminized oxides.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The present disclosure further concerns an alveolar core structure obtained according to the method as previously described, comprising at least one acoustic cell extending along a main axis corresponding to an axis of propagation of a sound wave, from a front end up to a rear end, and being delimited
