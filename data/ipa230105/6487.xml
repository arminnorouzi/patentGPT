For example, an interior permanent magnet rotor is known in which an end part of a magnet inserted into a hole provided in a rotor core is held and fixed to the rotor core by swaging a steel plate located at an end of laminated steel plates constituting a yoke of the rotor core.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the configuration as described above, the dimension of the laminated steel plates may be actually larger than the dimension of the magnet in the central axis direction of the rotor core due to manufacturing tolerance or the like. In such a case, when the steel plate located at the end in the central axis direction of the laminated steel plates is swaged, a portion protruding in a direction intersecting the central axis direction does not contact the magnet or butts against an end of the magnet in the central axis direction. When the swaged steel plate does not contact the magnet, the magnet cannot be fixed. In addition, when the swaged steel plate butts against the end of the magnet, the magnet may be damaged. As described above, the configuration described above has a problem that it is difficult to reliably fix the magnet to the rotor core while suppressing damage of the magnet.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one aspect of the present invention, an exemplary rotating electrical machine includes: a rotor that is rotatable about a central axis; and a stator that is located radially outside the rotor.
