A sliding carriage is positioned upon the parallel rails and is attached to a first end of the structure by one or more spring biasing means that produce an exercise resistance. Sliding the carriage away from the first end of the apparatus creates a workload against which exercises can be safely and beneficially performed. The slidable carriage may freely slide along the parallel rails substantially the entire longitudinal length of the apparatus between the first and second ends of the apparatus.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The method by which an exerciser executes an exercise upon a Pilates apparatus is not arbitrary. Each and every exercise comprises at least these four components, although some exercises may encompass other performance variables:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">a) A first time element (duration of the total exercise session, for instance, 45 minutes);</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0008">b) A second time element (the duration of one repetition of any given exercise, a repetition being defined as the routine that slides the carriage away from a starting position to a distal position upon the rails, and subsequently returning the carriage back to the starting point);</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0009">c) A distance element (the distance that an exerciser should move the carriage distal to the starting point before pausing, and immediately thereafter returning the carriage to the starting position).</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0010">d) Workload (each exerciser will be required to attach one or more tension devices (e.g. resistance springs) between the slidable carriage and the stationary first end of the apparatus, thereby creating an exercise resistance workload.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0008" num="0011">The proper distance that the carriage should be moved away from its starting position during an exercise is substantially determined by the human range of motion of the exerciser. Taller exercisers will invariably move the carriage a further distance from the starting point than a shorter exerciser, merely as a function of the relatively different limb lengths. Coaching of Pilates exercisers is required to ensure that each exercise is performed within the certain time, range of motion distance and workload parameters established for each exerciser by the coach. A Pilates coach is most often referred to by those in the industry as an instructor.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0012">The coaching process follows three fundamental steps, although some methods employ many more additional steps. The fundamental steps are:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0013">a) Exerciser performs an exercise;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0014">b) Instructor observes the performance, and collects empirical data related to form, speed, workload and other performance parameters;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0015">c) Instructor analyses the performance data;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0016">d) Instructor provides the exerciser with instructions to improve performance.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0010" num="0017">Typically, each exercise within a routine of exercises is performed only for a few minutes before moving to a new exercise. Each exercise is comprised of a given number of repetitions that should be completed within the given time.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0018">Pilates instructors provide direction to an exerciser as a means to increase the safety and effectiveness of the workout, such direction including any of the following:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0019">a) Increase or decrease carriage travel distance. This instruction is based on the height of the exerciser, and the exerciser's normal range of motion;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0020">b) Increase or decrease the speed at which each repetition is being performed. The speed of performing each exercise repetition should be substantially the same for all exercisers in the class;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0021">c) Increase or decrease workload. Resistance settings that are too high or too low result in decreased exercise benefits, and typically negatively impact the speed and carriage travel distance as just described.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0012" num="0022">As can be readily understood, an instructor instructing a class of a dozen or more Pilates exercisers is unable to provide one-on-one coaching for every exerciser, or for every repetition performed each exerciser throughout the class exercise period. Understanding these well-known problems and limitations with traditional Pilates apparatuses, an instructor traditionally moves about the class of Pilates exercisers to coach each exerciser individually, advising on the proper speed and carriage travel for each exerciser's unique range or motion. Since an instructor can reasonably spend only a small amount to time coaching only one exerciser at a time, many exercisers in a large Pilates exercise class will never receive thorough coaching on proper exercise movement before the class is required to change to a new exercise.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0023">As just described, and despite the best efforts of Pilates class instructors, most Pilates exercisers are left to perform exercises substantially self-directed throughout exercise class periods, and without the benefit of persistent form, speed and workload monitoring, or corrective instruction from an instructor. The lack of continual performance monitoring results in a less efficient and less effective workout than would otherwise be achieved by exercisers who have the benefit of persistent coaching.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0024">Therefore, one well-known problem is that traditional Pilates apparatuses fail to provide any means of measuring the travel distance of a slidable carriage during exercise. As a consequence of the inability to measure carriage travel distance, traditional Pilates apparatuses are not able to correlate carriage travel distances with the corresponding proper range of motion of exercisers of different heights.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0025">Another well-known problem is that traditional Pilates apparatuses fail to provide any means to determine the velocity at which the slidable carriage moves during the performance of an exercise. As a consequence of the inability to measure carriage velocity during exercises, traditional Pilates apparatuses are not able to provide exercisers with corrective information to speed up or slow down their exercise repetition speed.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0026">Another problem with traditional Pilates apparatuses is that they do not provide a means for exercisers of different heights to determine the proper velocity they should move the slidable carriage during work or recovery phases of an exercise repetition. The result is that many exercisers ultimately perform many repetitions of many exercises incorrectly, in some cases, exercisers moving the carriage too far and over extend their normal range of motion, thereby causing injury to joints or soft tissue, or in other cases moving the carriage too slowly or quickly, thereby missing the strength benefit of controlled-speed exercising.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0027">Pilates instructors and others in the exercise industry will recognize the enormous benefit of a system and method that would simultaneously coach all of the exercisers throughout the duration of a Pilates class, providing exercisers with instruction on the proper range of motion and repetition speed for each exercise, and proper workload settings. Further, Pilates studio owners, managers and instructors will appreciate the commercial value of improved Pilates apparatuses that provide exercisers with safer, more efficient workouts that burn more calories within a specified Pilates class period, especially when compared to competitors relying on traditional apparatuses and one-on-one coaching.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0028">An example embodiment of the present invention is directed to an exercise machine monitoring and instruction system. The exercise machine monitoring and instruction system includes an exercise machine having a movable element that moves between a first position and a second position in a reciprocating manner, a sensor that detects a real-time position of the movable element, a processor in communication with the sensor to receive the real-time position data from the sensor related to a position of the movable element and a feedback device in communication with the processor that provides real-time instructions to the exerciser on how to adjust their workout to achieve a desired result.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0029">Pilates exercises are designed by knowledgeable Pilates exercise instructors with the objectives of maximizing the workload on targeted muscles or muscle groups, and exercising the targeted muscles or muscle groups through a prescribed range of motion. Exercisers upon a Pilates apparatus are properly performing exercises when a plurality of previously established parameters are met. Coaching is a process that defines the exercise performance objectives, monitors the exerciser's actual performance against the objectives, and provides instructions back to the exerciser with regard to modifications to range of motion, speed and/or workload as required to perform more in line with the established performance objectives. More specifically, exerciser performance data observed by an instructor is empirical, but analysis of the data by an instructor is subjective, and limited to the one person being observed, and only for the period of time of observation.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0030">The automated coaching system of the improved Pilates apparatus provides for the persistent monitoring, analysis and instruction of all exercisers in a Pilates class simultaneously, throughout the duration of a class session. Each apparatus therefore provides for exercise performance coaching by the following process:<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0031">A.

The actual data is further analyzed based on the exerciser's physiology.</li>        <li id="ul0008-0004" num="0034">D. Instructional Feedback: Based on the data comparison (C), the present invention provides feedback to the exerciser, the feedback including, but not limited to recommended increases or decreases to the carriage speed, carriage travel distance, repetition cyclic rate, or workload resistance.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0021" num="0035">Further, the new and novel system and method of automated coaching of Pilates exercisers provides for real time computation of physiological performance data, such as caloric burn rate, or total calories consumed during the exercise class period.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0036">Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the nearly 100 year body of work teaching the Pilates exercise method does not teach the unique and valuable automated coaching or performance monitoring functions just described.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">A.

Alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the spirit or the scope of the present disclosure. Additionally, well-known elements of exemplary embodiments will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure relevant details. Further, to facilitate an understanding of the description, a discussion of several terms used herein follows.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0066">The word &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is used herein to mean &#x201c;serving as an example, instance, or illustration.&#x201d; Any embodiment described herein as &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. Likewise, the term &#x201c;embodiments&#x201d; is not exhaustive and does not require that all embodiments include the discussed feature, advantage or mode of operation.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0067">The word &#x201c;instructor&#x201d; as used herein means the knowledgeable person or persons guiding one or more exercisers in a Pilates class. Instructor shall also mean &#x201c;coach&#x201d; or &#x201c;trainer&#x201d; with no difference in meaning or intention. These descriptions are interchangeable.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0068">The phrase &#x201c;Pilates Method&#x201d; as used herein means the body or aft related to the method of exercising on a Pilates apparatus. However, many adaptations of the Pilates Method are known. Therefore, Pilates Method shall also mean &#x201c;Lagree Method&#x201d; or any other non-specific method of exercising on a substantially horizontal exercise apparatus providing for a spring-biased slidable carriage. These descriptions are interchangeable.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an exemplary diagram showing a flow chart of the virtual Pilates instructional process. As is well known in the fitness industry, exercisers performing an exercise for the first time require guidance. In the process shown in the drawing, an exerciser starts and exercise <b>100</b> on a Pilates apparatus, and is immediately directed on how far they should slide the slidable carriage on the first repetition of the exercise, the direction being made by one or more methods of instructional guidance <b>102</b> as will be fully described herein.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0070">Upon completion of one first repetition of a first exercise, the system and method of the novel instructional process collects data <b>102</b> related to the carriage travel distance, travel direction, and travel speed, referred to herein as a portion of the &#x201c;known data&#x201d;. The known data is subsequently analyzed <b>103</b> by means of a computer processor <b>10</b> (e.g. control unit, a computer, a mobile electronic device, etc.) in order process the known data into data format that may be compared to the estimated performance metrics expected of exercisers of similar height performing the same exercise on the same apparatus.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0071">The actual performance data as analyzed <b>103</b> is then compared to the estimated ideal performance metrics <b>104</b> as a means to determine the accuracy and efficiency of the exerciser's performance against the estimated ideal performance. After analysis, as would be expected by analysis by a live person coaching the performance of an exerciser, instructions and feedback <b>105</b> are subsequently provided to the exerciser, the instructions thereby providing advice on corrections that should be made to the exerciser's performance of the exercise, for instance, advising the exerciser to increase or decrease the speed of each repetition of the exercise.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0072">As the exerciser continues to exercise, the process is continually repeated, with the collection of known data being updated with each movement of the slidable carriage, and the refinements to corrective instructions being made and delivered back to the exerciser.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0073">Upon completing the sequence of exercises performed during a Pilates workout session, the system and method of the present invention completes the analysis of the entire workout session, and delivers a post-exercise performance summary <b>106</b> to the exerciser for baseline performance reference, and as guidance as to corrective measures the exerciser should employ during their next workout session in order to improve their efficiency and fitness levels.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is an exemplary diagram showing a top three-quarters view of a Pilates apparatus <b>200</b>. More specifically, the primary operable components of a typical Pilates apparatus are shown, including a pair of parallel rails <b>201</b> extending substantially the length of a rectangular Pilates structure, the rails being aligned with the longitudinal axis of the apparatus, and affixed to a structure supported by support feet <b>202</b>. A stationary exercise platform <b>204</b> is shown at a first end of the apparatus, and a second stationary exercise platform <b>206</b> is shown at a distal second end of the apparatus. Therebetween, a slidable carriage <b>203</b> is shown slidable upon the parallel rails, and biased toward the first end by means of one or more removable attachable spring biasing means <b>205</b>. The spring biasing means provide a resistance force against which an exerciser must overcome in order to move the slidable carriage in a direction towards the second end of the apparatus. U.S. Pat. No. 7,803,095 titled Exercise Machine to Lagree and U.S. Pat. No. 8,641,585 titled Exercise Machine to Lagree are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0075">Although the structure and operation of a Pilates apparatus is well known to those skilled in the art, it will be noted that a new and novel addition is a sensor <b>20</b> to determine the position of the slidable carriage <b>203</b>. One example of a sensor <b>20</b> is a rotary displacement sensor, also referred to as a string potentiometer <b>207</b> with a first end affixed to and proximal to the first end of the apparatus structure, and a second end affixed to the slidable carriage <b>203</b>. As the slidable carriage is moved upon the sliding rails, the string of the string potentiometer unwinds or winds about the pulley of the potentiometer, thereby creating an electrical signal corresponding to the actual position of the slidable carriage. In the drawing, and merely to illustrate the approximate placement of a string potentiometer upon a Pilates apparatus, the slidable carriage <b>203</b> is shown in &#x201c;Position 2&#x201d;, meaning that the carriage has been moved against the spring biasing means from its default starting position.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is an exemplary diagram showing a top three-quarters view of a Pilates apparatus <b>200</b>. More specifically, the slidable carriage <b>203</b> is shown in its default position &#x201c;Position 1&#x201d;, biased toward the first end of the apparatus to which the removably attachable spring biasing means are affixed. Position 1 represents what is often the position of the slidable carriage prior to an exerciser beginning a Pilates exercise.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0077">As previously described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the slidable carriage, when in Position 2, is recognized to have moved a certain travel distance &#x394;P away from Position 1. The travel distance is measured by the string potentiometer not shown, but which was previously described.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0078">It should be noted that for any given exercise there is a theoretically optimal travel distance depending in the height, and correspondingly the range of motion, of any exerciser. Therefore, one important and novel element of the present invention provides for the measurement of the travel distance of the slidable carriage by any exerciser of any height performing any given exercise upon the apparatus.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0079">The measurement of the travel distance of a Pilates slidable carriage therefore provides for the collection of measurement data that for the first time may be used to assess the performance of an exerciser upon a Pilates apparatus.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0080">It should be noted that although the preferred method of measuring the position of a slidable carriage, and further the direction of carriage movement is by use of a high reliability, low cost, and highly precise string potentiometer, any of the foregoing measurement methods may be used provided they meet the production and performance criteria necessary to deliver the performance and economic requirements of the apparatus and instruction process of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an exemplary diagram showing a top three-quarters view of a Pilates apparatus with sensor options. More specifically, although the string potentiometer as just described is one device that may be used to measure the travel distance of a Pilates apparatus, those skilled in the art will appreciate that other sensors and measuring means may be used in the alternate.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0082">One means of measuring travel distance of a slidable carriage in real time is by acoustic means <b>300</b> whereby ultrasonic sound is transmitted from one position, towards a movable object, the distance between the two objects being measured by correlating the wavelength of the transmitted sound to the wavelength of the sound reflected by the targeted object. This distance measurement means is known as the Doppler Effect. Although this method may be used in the present invention, it is more costly than a string potentiometer as previously described, and encounters measurement problems related to traditional materials used on exercise platforms of Pilates apparatuses that are relatively non-reflective of sound waves, and further encounter problems with the distance between the slidable carriage and the first end of the apparatus approach zero.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0083">Distance measurement may also be accomplished using laser measurement <b>302</b>, however the high speed of a laser pulse is best used at distances longer than the expected normal travel distance of a Pilates carriage, unless highly sensitive and more expensive measurement devices are used. The added expense is not preferred when lower cost production options are available.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0084">A linear displacement sensor <b>301</b> may also be used to measure the real-time position of a slidable Pilates carriage. However, linear displacement sensors are typically less reliable over hundreds of thousands of cycles, and are typically more expensive than the preferred string potentiometer.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0085">Further, although real-time position measurement is one function performed by a measurement system and device, use of a timer <b>303</b> provides for computation of the speed at which the carriage travels between any two given positions, and further provides for the determination of the direction of carriage movement.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0086">For the first time, speed and direction of a slidable carriage are therefore provided for on an improved Pilates apparatus. Speed and direction are important elements of the system and method of the present invention since proper coaching of an exerciser requires the determination of how efficient the exerciser is working against the resistance bias, determined as the carriage moves away from the first end of the apparatus, and whether the exerciser is completing each repetition within the allotted timeframe.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0087">Those skilled in the art will appreciate the microprocessors provide for a digital clock function, but also that a digital signal from an external clock may be used.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an exemplary diagram showing a flow chart of known and computed data components of a virtual Pilates instructor which are calculated by a computer processor <b>10</b> or similar device. In the system of the present invention, certain data related to the exercise and exercise apparatus are known. Known data <b>400</b> is used to compute real-time exercise performance data.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0089">The known data therefore includes user physiology <b>402</b>, namely the exerciser's height. It is well known that the stride of a tall person is typically much longer than a short person. Similarly, the travel distance of the slidable carriage caused by performance of an exercise by a tall person will typically be longer than the travel distance caused by a short person. Physiological measurement is a key component in determining the proper range of motion <b>411</b>, and therefore the proper carriage travel distance, for exercisers of any height.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0090">Alternatively, physiological data may include other body measurements, for example, the length of the femur, length of the forearm, length of torso, or the reliable measurement of other body parts that could be considered for determining the proper range of motion while performing exercises on a Pilates apparatus.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0091">As previously discussed, time <b>403</b> is a data element used to determine a variety of performance elements including the total power output <b>409</b>, and speed of exercise repetitions <b>408</b>. Absolute carriage position <b>404</b> is determined by use of a measurement device as previously discussed.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0092">As initially instructed by a live person instructor, or as called for in an exercise routine plan, the exercise to be performed <b>405</b> is also known prior to beginning an exercise. There are literally many hundreds of exercises that are typically performed on a Pilates apparatus, the exercise therefore providing to a processor the estimated range of motion information that corresponds to the particular exercise.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0093">Prior to starting an exercise, either via manual or automated means, an exerciser establishes the resistance level <b>406</b> against which they will exercise by attaching an appropriate number of springs between the slidable carriage and the stationary first end of the apparatus that correspond to the desired workload, usually expressed in pounds. The spring resistance is used to determine power output, and correspondingly, the estimated calories consumed during the workout session.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0094">Those knowledgeable of the Pilates industry will appreciate that exercisers typically perform Pilates exercises in a class environment in which each exerciser is exercising on their respective apparatus. An exercise class may consist of as few as one individual, or dozens of individual exercisers. As just discussed, certain data is known about the exerciser, time and the apparatus. Within a class environment, all of the data of all of the exercisers performing on all of the apparatuses are also known. Therefore, the performance of all users <b>407</b> are known, and may be displayed as a means to inform the live instructor as to exercisers who may need additional assistance, or to provide a performance &#x201c;leader board&#x201d; showing the exercisers performing the exercises most efficiently or accurately.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0095">Therefore, with the known data <b>400</b> having been established, the present invention provides for computed data <b>401</b> to be generated in order to determine exerciser performance.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0096">Pilates classes are conducted for a specific amount of time, and exercise routines are comprised of a plurality of different exercises. Further, each exercise is typically repeated a prescribed number of times before changing to a new exercise. Therefore, one important element of exercise performance is ensuring that every exerciser performs the same number of repetitions within the same allocated time. By using known data time <b>403</b> and carriage position <b>404</b>, the present invention provides for counting the number of repetitions, and further determining whether the repetitions are performed within the prescribed timeframe.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0097">Many exercisers desire to know how many calories they &#x201c;burned&#x201d; during an exercise session. The present invention provides for the computation of caloric consumption during a workout session in part, by computing the total power output <b>409</b> during the session. By using the known spring resistance <b>406</b> in pounds, the carriage position <b>404</b> as used to determine the distance over which the pounds were pushed, and the time <b>403</b>, power can be computed using well known formulae.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0098">Further, as a novel and previously unavailable means of determining exercise efficiency corresponding <b>410</b>, the present invention provides for the analysis of power output over time by assessing whether the work phase and recovery phase of each work cycle, or repetition, was smooth and consistent, or jerky and erratic.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0099">By further analyzing this new Pilates performance metric against the speed of exercise repetitions <b>408</b>, the total power output <b>409</b>, and the range of motion <b>411</b>, this novel performance metric is a powerful new indicator to determine whether the exerciser is struggling too much <b>414</b>, or in other words, whether the exerciser may be attempting to work out against too high a resistance, or over-extending their recommended range of motion during exercise.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0100">A live instructor, armed with the previously unavailable information that one or more members of a class are struggling, can immediately stop the exerciser and reduce the resistance level of the spring biasing means, thereby preventing soft tissue or joint injury.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0101">As exhaustively discussed herein, exercising throughout the entire range of motion is a key performance objective if the exercisers are to maximize cardiovascular and strength improvements from an exercise session. Therefore, the actual range of motion <b>411</b> for any given exerciser can now be determined with precision by comparing exerciser physiology <b>402</b> and the estimated distance they should be able to move the slidable carriage, with the actual carriage position <b>404</b>. The estimated range of motion is further refined <b>412</b> over time by collectively comparing all users' performances against all users' physiological measurements, thereby establishing more accurate mean and average ranges of motions for each exercise based on a larger exerciser cohort.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0102">In some instances, it is desirable to provide a &#x201c;leader board&#x201d; that displays the performance of all exercisers within a Pilates class. A class competition board <b>413</b> can induce a consciousness among all exercisers to perform higher efficiency and more accurate exercises in order to successfully compete with their peers.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0103">A fundamental aspect of the virtual instructor of the present invention, as previously discussed, is to provide constructive, real-time feedback <b>415</b> to each exerciser, the feedback therefore providing for recommendations to improve efficiency, maximize the benefits of the exercise period, and to prevent injuries. The specifics of the feedback, and the methods of delivering feedback to the exerciser are later discussed in more detail.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> is an exemplary diagram showing a side view of a person exercising on a Pilates apparatus. Merely as one illustrative example showing the travel distance of a slidable carriage during an exercise, a representative exerciser <b>500</b> is shown on a Pilates apparatus with the right foot placed on the stationary exercise platform <b>204</b>, and the left foot placed upon the slidable carriage <b>203</b>. The left illustration shows the exerciser in the starting position, ready to perform the &#x201c;lunge&#x201d;, an exercise well known in the fitness industry.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0105">Having previously established a predetermined resistance level by attaching resistance springs between the carriage <b>203</b> and stationary first end of the apparatus, the exerciser moved the left foot forward, working against the resistance means. In the drawing, it can be readily determined that the exerciser has moved the carriage an actual distance referred to as &#x394;P<sup>1</sup>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0106">In practice, an exerciser often times does not know when they have pushed the carriage forward far enough, or too far. Therefore, those skilled in the art will appreciate that many exercisers may under-extend the forward foot, and in some cases over-extend the forward foot. They will also appreciate that the actual distance considered ideal for a tall person will be a larger dimension when compared to a shorter person.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0107">It is therefore desirable to inform the exerciser, in real time, and while they are performing the lunge, when they have achieved the ideal estimated carriage travel distance.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> is an exemplary diagram showing an illustration and chart to determine estimated range of motion. More specifically, in order to determine the estimated ideal range of motion for an exerciser, the present invention provides for a mathematical formula to be applied to known physiological dimensions of the exerciser.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0109">In the drawing, the exerciser's height is shown as D<b>1</b>, while the estimated carriage travel distance is shown as D<b>2</b>. In the chart <b>501</b>, representative of a database containing a plurality of exercises and corresponding formulae for converting a physiological measurement to a corresponding carriage travel distance, an exercise <b>502</b> is listed as one of the exercises to be performed. Upon inputting of the physiological measurement <b>503</b> of the exerciser into the system of the present invention, the estimated ideal carriage travel distance for that particular exerciser, and for that particular exercise is retrieved from a lookup table <b>504</b>, the data in the lookup table having been previously inputted.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0110">As yet another means of estimating the carriage travel distance based on a physiological measurement, a ratio formula may be applied to the physiological measurement <b>503</b>, thereby resulting in a corresponding dimension for the estimated travel distance. This method of computing the estimated travel distance may be applied equally and accurately to any physiological measurement of any exerciser whether their actual measurement is contained in a lookup table.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0111">Further, by incorporating other known data not previously discusses, that data comprising gender, age, or known medical conditions that may impact the estimated normal range of motion, alternate ratios can be incorporated into the present invention. This preferred method results in a significant reduction in time and expense in building a relational database comprising physiological measurements, estimated carriage travel dimensional, and modifications accounting for age, gender or other parameters, especially when considering that literally hundreds of exercises may be inputted into the database.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref> are exemplary diagrams showing top views of a Pilates apparatus with an instructional feedback system. More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> shows a top view of a Pilates apparatus comprising a monorail <b>600</b>, although a pair of parallel rails as previously described may be used. Further, the drawing shows a slidable carriage <b>203</b> and a stationary exercise platform <b>204</b> at a first end. Footprints <b>601</b> represent the approximate foot positions of an exerciser not shown readying to perform a &#x201c;lunge&#x201d; exercise.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0113">As will be further described, illuminated and non-illuminated lights are shown in the drawing, the purpose of which is to guide an exerciser's movement of the slidable carriage to a position estimated to correspond to the exerciser's unique range of motion for this exercise.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0114">Since the hypothetical exerciser has yet to start the exercise, three series of lights <b>602</b>, <b>603</b>, <b>604</b> are all shown as not being illuminated. Three series of lights are shown merely for example, and only one series of lights may be preferred. Further, only four lights are shown in each of the series, but the number of lights are not meant to be limiting, and any number of lights may be used.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0115">With a left foot <b>601</b> placed upon the slidable carriage, the exerciser begins the exercise by pushing the left foot towards the second of the apparatus. As one example of how lights guide the exerciser to move their left foot to the estimated ideal stopping point, the stopping point corresponding to the estimated full extension of their range of motion for this exercise, lights <b>605</b>, <b>606</b>, <b>607</b> are sequentially illuminated as the carriage moves away from the first end. As can be readily seen, the lights illuminate until the carriage travels to an estimated maximum distance from the first end, the distance correlating to the range of motion limit.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0116">In the drawing, the estimated range of motion limit is shown as &#x394;P<sup>2</sup>, the point of left foot forward extension to which the exerciser should aspire to achieve at the mid-point of each exercise repetition.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0117">As one example of correlating illuminated lights to carriage position, each series of lights would represent the total possible travel distance of a slidable carriage of the apparatus.

As the carriage continues moving distal to the first end of the apparatus, the blinking frequency increases until the lights illuminate without blinking.

In the chart, the exercise name and repetition number <b>901</b> are displayed as a means to inform exercisers that they are to perform five more repetitions of the &#x201c;lunge&#x201d; before changing to a new exercise in the routine.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0152">Scoreboards and leader boards are a well-known means to display relative ranking of competitors during a sports event, for example, golf and basketball games, and tennis tournaments. However, no such leader boards have been found in Pilates studios since no method of assessing performance of Pilates exercisers has been available to drive the competitive performance information.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0153">The novel system of the present invention provides for displaying data received from a plurality of apparatuses <b>902</b> in a Pilates studio or gym facility, and further provides for the performance ranking <b>903</b> of participants performing on the apparatuses.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0154">Although the columns of the chart <b>900</b> highlight various known and computed data corresponding to the performance of each of the class participants, the data points shown are not meant to be limiting, and any known or computed data may be displayed.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0155">It should be noted that a live person instructor typically presides over each Pilates class, but as previously discussed, instructors are ill-equipped to monitor the real-time performance of every class participant. The chart therefore provides the live instructor with important real-time information, for instance, that participants on machine numbers 5 and 9 are struggling <b>904</b>, and may need immediate help. A struggle alert displayed by the present invention indicates, as one possible cause of the exercisers' problem, that the resistance level on their apparatuses may have been set too high. Having been alerted to the extraordinary effort of the two exercisers just described, the live instructor can immediately reduce the resistance level on the two just-mentioned apparatuses by simply detaching one spring. Without the new and novel exerciser performance information now made possible by the present invention, the two exercisers just mentioned would have unduly struggled throughout the exercise session, possibly overexerting muscles or sustaining injury.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0156">Therefore, those skilled in the art will appreciate that exercise performance feedback is not only important information useful to Pilates exercisers who endeavor to improve their fitness levels, but the newly available information is also highly valuable to live person instructors as a means to identify, with precision, which exercisers require the additional help or assistance of a live instructor.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0157"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is an exemplary diagram <b>1000</b> showing a block diagram of network features.

Rowing machines intended to simulate rowing of a scull or working shell are well known in the industry. However, one widely recognized problem with rowing machines is that the apparatuses allow exercisers to overextend their normal range of motion, and provide no feedback with regard to the distance an exerciser should push the seat back with their legs, and more importantly, what distance the exerciser should pull the pull handle towards them during exercising.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0168">As one variation of the present invention, a plurality of sensors are affixed to the apparatus. More specifically, one sensor <b>1203</b> is affixed to apparatus in such a manner as to measure travel of the seat <b>1204</b> of a rowing machine, as it closely correlates to the slidable carriage of a Pilates apparatus, and a second sensor <b>1204</b> is affixed to the apparatus to measure travel of the pull rope <b>1205</b>.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0169">Generally, a rowing machine apparatus comprises a resistance flywheel <b>1200</b> to which a pull rope <b>1205</b> is attached. An exerciser <b>1201</b> sits upon a sliding seat <b>1202</b> slidable along one or more rails aligned with the longitudinal axis of the apparatus. At the beginning of an exercise, the handles of the exerciser grasp a handle of the pull rope while seated as shown, with the feet positioned upon foot platforms against which the exerciser will push during exercising. At the start of an exercise, the seat is positioned at a &#x201c;zero&#x201d; point shown as A<sup>0</sup>. At this point, the arms are fully extended, while the knees are bent, allowing the seat to position as closely as possible to the flywheel end <b>1200</b> of the apparatus.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0170"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref> is an exemplary diagram showing a side view of representative exerciser at the &#x201c;catch&#x201d; phase of a rowing machine exercise. As the exerciser begins straightening their legs, thereby pushing the seat with a force F<b>1</b> from a first position A<sup>0 </sup>to a second variable position A<sup>2</sup>, they simultaneously begin to pull their hands towards their chest, thereby increasing the amount of pull rope played out by the rope windings on the flywheel <b>1200</b>. As may be readily seen, the distance that the pull rope travels between starting position B<sup>1 </sup>and intermediate position B<sup>2 </sup>is greater than the distance that the seat travels at this stage of the exercise.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0171">It should be noted that the travel distance relationship between the pull rope and the seat are critically important to properly performing the exercise, and that the relationship varies throughout each repetition of the exercise. It should also be noted that those skilled in the art will appreciate that no rowing machine apparatuses currently provide for continuous, real-time analysis of pull rope versus seat travel during an exercise. It should also be noted that as the travel distance of the pull rope <b>1206</b> is typically greater than the travel distance of the seat <b>1207</b> throughout the exercise, the speed of travel differ between the pull rope and seat. However, traditional rowing machine apparatuses fail to measure the relative distances, do not analyze the travel ratios through the pull cycle, and do not provide feedback to exercisers as to corrective measures they should take to ensure proper form and performance of the exercise.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0172"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>C</figref> is an exemplary diagram showing a side view of representative exerciser at the &#x201c;full pull&#x201d; phase of a rowing machine exercise. In the drawing, the exerciser has reached a position wherein their legs are fully extended, indicating the maximum leg range of motion, and correspondingly the maximum seat travel <b>1209</b> between starting position A<sup>0 </sup>and maximum position A<sup>3</sup>. It should be noted that this travel distance is relative to the physiological measurements of the exerciser. More specifically, a taller person will push the seat a greater distance from the flywheel end of the apparatus as compared to a shorter person.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0173">Correspondingly, the exerciser has pulled the rope pull handle fully towards the body, creating nearly the maximum pull distance <b>1208</b> between the starting point B<sup>0 </sup>and full-pull position B<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0174">However, as can been seen in the illustration, the exerciser's back <b>1210</b> has been extended slightly away from the flywheel end at an angle &#x3b8;, thereby extending the pull rope an additional short distance beyond the full-pull position when their hands are fully against their body. Those skilled in the art suggest that the back should angle away from the flywheel end at approximately 25 to 35 degrees from the vertical as shown.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0175"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>D</figref> is an exemplary diagram showing a side view of representative exerciser beginning the recovery phase of a rowing machine exercise.
