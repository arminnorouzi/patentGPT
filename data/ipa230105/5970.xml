The CMOS image sensor also provide relatively low power consumption, as compared with CCD image sensors, a useful attribute when the CMOS image sensor is incorporated in a battery-powered product. Further, since the process technology used to manufacture CMOS image sensors is generally compatible with existing CMOS process technologies, the CMOS image sensor may be fabricated at a relatively lower cost point.
