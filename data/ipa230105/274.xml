Hanging items include curtains, drapes, plants, art, and so forth. Hanging items typically include a hanger, a mount, and something suspended from the hanger. Using a plant as one example, the hanger may comprise a metal hook, with the plant suspended beneath the hook. A user may couple the hook to a loop, perhaps mounted on the ceiling, to hang the plant.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">While there are a variety of types of hangers and types of hanging items, curtains provide special challenges for designers. This is especially true in medical or hospital environments. It is frequently the case that medical service providers employ curtains to separate patients, conceal medical procedures from view, and to segregate areas of operating rooms and care centers. It is advantageous to launder such curtains to prevent the curtains from acting as a vector to transfer pathogens and bacteria from one patient to the next. Even where the curtains are disposable, they still need to be changed to prevent transfer of pathogens and bacteria from one patient to the next. However, prior art curtains are difficult to take down and clean due to the fact that they are frequently attached to carriers that slide within a metal track. The dismounting process is costly and labor intensive.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It would be advantageous to have an improved hangable apparatus, suitable for use in curtain and drape systems, which is easier and quieter to dismount.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings"

Referring to the drawings, like numbers indicate like parts throughout the views. Apparatus components and method steps have been represented where appropriate by conventional symbols in the drawings, showing only those specific details that are pertinent to understanding the embodiments of the present disclosure so as not to obscure the disclosure with details that will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of the description herein.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As used in the description herein and throughout the claims, the following terms take the meanings explicitly associated herein, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise: the meaning of &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; includes plural reference, the meaning of &#x201c;in&#x201d; includes &#x201c;in&#x201d; and &#x201c;on.&#x201d; Relational terms such as first and second, top and bottom, and the like may be used solely to distinguish one entity or action from another entity or action without necessarily requiring or implying any actual such relationship or order between such entities or actions.

In one embodiment, the item to be hung is a curtain. Illustrating by example, for a hospital setting where infection control is an area of high concern, track hangers configured in accordance with embodiments of the disclosure can be used to hang curtains between patients, procedures, areas, and so forth. Track hangers configured in accordance with embodiments of the disclosure are easier to mount and dismount than are prior art designs. Accordingly, embodiments of the disclosure advantageously make it easier for health care practitioners to change and launder the curtains to ensure that bacteria and other pathogens are not readily transferred from patient to patient or from patient to health care practitioner.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Embodiments of the disclosure contemplate that it is very difficult to change prior art curtain systems designed for health care environments. The hangers are difficult to dismount. Additionally, a technician, and sometimes multiple people, equipped with ladders or specialized equipment are required to dismount the curtains, making changing or laundering the curtains a labor-intensive and costly endeavor. For this reason, curtains are rarely changed or washed. In some situations, it is considered fortunate if the curtains were changed three times a year.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Advantageously, embodiments of the disclosure offer an improved track hanger that is easier to mount to a tiled ceiling, e.g., a dropped ceiling that includes a suspension grid of metal channels or rails, which are suspended to support ceiling panels, as are found in most hospitals, doctor's offices, and other health care offices. In one or more embodiments, the track hanger includes a hook, an extension, a head, a base member, and a key. Each component can be modular and detachable from the other. For example, the key can be detachable from the hook. Similarly, the base member can be detachable from the extension, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one or more embodiments, the key includes a first major surface and a second major surface. One or both of the first major surface or the second major surface can define one or more barbs that facilitate a one-way insertion of the key into the track. This makes the track hangers and track extremely quick to mount.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Once mounted, curtains can be hung from the track. These curtains, such as those described in commonly assigned U.S. Ser. No. 15/651,774, filed Jul. 17, 2017, which is incorporated herein by reference, are quick and simple to mount and dismount. They require only a single person&#x2014;working for a few minutes&#x2014;to change the curtains. Accordingly, embodiments of the disclosure allow for more frequent changing and laundering of curtains, thereby promoting health and safety when used in hospitals or other health care settings.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In addition to potentially serving as vectors for bacteria and other pathogens, prior art curtain hanging systems have other problems as well. Most hangers require special mounting hardware and/or tools to mount to a wall or ceiling. Additionally, the mounting hardware leaves scars in the wall or ceiling should the hanger ever be taken down. Embodiments of the disclosure provide a solution to each of these problems by providing a base member that includes a first base member portion and a second base member portion. The first base member portion and the second base member portion are separable from each other along a medial major axis of the base member.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one or more embodiments, the first base member portion comprises a first half rail clamp. Similarly, the second base member portion can include a second half rail clamp. In one or more embodiments, the first half rail clamp defines a first half head-receiving aperture, while the second half rail clamp defines a second half head-receiving aperture. In one or more embodiments, coupling the first base member portion to the second base member portion causes the first half head-receiving aperture to abut the second half head-receiving aperture, thereby resulting in the base member defining a head-receiving aperture into which the head of the hanger may situate.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one or more embodiments, the hanger is then coupled to the base member. In one or more embodiments, the hanger includes a head, which is coupled to the extension. In one or more embodiments, the extension is situated between the head and the hook. In one or more embodiments, the head of the hanger is locked into the head-receiving aperture of the base member such that it is able to &#x201c;clamp&#x201d; onto a rail passing through the base member.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one or more embodiments, separating the first base member portion from the second base member portion along the medial major axis therefore separates the first half rail clamp from the second half rail clamp and splits the head-receiving aperture. When used with a drop ceiling having a suspension grid of rails, one can simply place the first rail half clamp to the left of a rail and the second rail half clamp to the right of the rail, or vice versa.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The first base member portion can then be pressed against the second base member portion along the medial major axis, which causes the rail of the suspension grid to be caught between the first half rail clamp and the second half rail clamp. The head of the hanger can then be situated within the head-receiving aperture. A fastener can then be attached to the base member to both retain the first base member portion against the second base member portion and to clamp the head of the hanger against the rail. The fastener can be coupled and uncoupled as desired so as to allow quick and easy coupling of the base member and head of the hanger to the rails of the suspension grid.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one or more embodiments, the coupler engages one or more threads disposed on the exterior surface of a head receiver extending distally from the base member to retain the first base member portion against the second base member portion and the head of the hanger against the rail through the head-receiving aperture. As will be shown in more detail below, the coupler can also be used to bias and claim the head, which is attached to the extension and hook, against a major face of the rail within an interior socket supporting the threads. Thus, in one or more embodiments, the rail is clamped on three sides&#x2014;two by the first base member portion and the second base member portion, and a third by the head of the hanger against the major surface of the rail. Advantageously, a track hanger for an item comprises a uniquely configured base member that facilitates simple mounting and dismounting of the track hanger to a rail of a conventional suspension grid of a drop ceiling while also biasing the head of a hanger against the same rail for additional coupling power.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, illustrated therein is one explanatory embodiment of a track hanger <b>100</b> configured in accordance with one or more embodiments of the disclosure. In one embodiment, the track hanger <b>100</b> is to suspend a track from a surface such as a wall or ceiling.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The track hanger <b>100</b>, in one or more embodiments, includes a hanger <b>101</b>, a base member <b>102</b>, and a key <b>403</b>. In one or more embodiments, each of the hanger <b>101</b>, the base member <b>102</b>, and the key <b>403</b> are separable from each other. For example, in one embodiment the hanger <b>101</b> can be detached from the base member <b>102</b>. Similarly, the key <b>403</b> can be detached from the hanger <b>101</b>. It should be noted that the track hanger <b>100</b> can be manufactured in different sizes and shapes so as to be compatible with, and fit appropriately, differently sized suspension grids of drop ceilings.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one or more embodiments, the hanger <b>101</b> comprises a hook <b>103</b> and an extension <b>104</b>. In one or more embodiments, the key <b>403</b> attaches to a distal end <b>105</b> of the hook <b>103</b>. Accordingly, where the key <b>403</b> is detachable from the hanger <b>101</b>, the attachment location to attach or detach the key <b>403</b> from the hook <b>103</b> is the distal end <b>105</b>. Thus, in one or more embodiments the key <b>403</b> is detachable from the hook <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one embodiment, the hanger <b>101</b> is configured as a single, unitary element. Said differently, in one embodiment the hook <b>103</b> and the extension <b>104</b> are manufactured as a single, integral unit. As will be described in more detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the hanger <b>101</b> can also include a head. Where included, the hook <b>103</b>, the extension <b>104</b>, and the head can be manufactured as a single, integral unit.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Illustrating by example, in one embodiment the hook <b>103</b>, the extension <b>104</b>, and the head are manufactured from a thermoplastic material by way of an injection molding process. The hook <b>103</b>, the extension <b>104</b>, and the head can be manufactured from nylon, styrene, ABS, polycarbonate, or polycarbonate-ABS, PMMA, PVC, or other polyamide-based thermoplastics in one embodiment. Other materials suitable for manufacturing the hook <b>103</b>, the extension <b>104</b>, and the head will be obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure. While the base member <b>102</b> and the key <b>403</b> are separable from the hanger <b>101</b>, in one or more embodiments the base member <b>102</b> and the key <b>403</b> can be manufactured from the same material as is the hanger <b>101</b>. In other embodiments, the hanger <b>101</b> is manufactured from materials different from the base member <b>102</b> and/or key <b>403</b>. The base member <b>102</b>, hanger <b>101</b>, and key <b>403</b> can each be manufactured from different materials as well.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in one embodiment the key <b>403</b> includes a first major surface <b>401</b> and a second major surface <b>402</b>. In this illustrative embodiment, the first major surface <b>401</b> defines one or more barbs <b>404</b>. Each barb comprises a hemi-triangular protrusion with the base of each hemi-triangular protrusion being disposed beneath the side of the hemi-triangular protrusion. In this illustrative embodiment, the second major surface <b>402</b> is substantially planar.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In one or more embodiments, a track <b>106</b> attaches to the key <b>403</b>. In this illustrative embodiment, the track <b>106</b> has a first flat side <b>407</b> and a second flat side <b>408</b>. An arch <b>409</b> spans between ends of the first flat side <b>407</b> and the second flat side <b>408</b> in this embodiment.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In one embodiment, the track <b>106</b> is flexible so that it can be shaped into different contours when attached to a track hanger <b>100</b>. For example, in one embodiment the track <b>106</b> is manufactured from plastic. One suitable plastic for the track <b>106</b> is polypropylene, although other flexible materials, such as polyethylene, will be obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure. Additionally, other material such as ABS plastic can be used in other embodiments. In one embodiment, the track <b>106</b> is manufactured from an extrusion process.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In one embodiment, the track <b>106</b> is a continuous piece. In other embodiments, segments of different tracks can be aligned end-to-end to form a composite track. In one embodiment, the track <b>106</b> is malleable. While the cross section of the track <b>106</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is generally flat along each of the first flat side <b>407</b> and the second flat side <b>408</b>, it should be noted that the cross section could take other shapes as well, such as ovular or flat.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In one embodiment the track <b>106</b> is configured so as to be easily cleanable. In one embodiment, the track <b>106</b> is manufactured so as to be light beige in color. In another embodiment, the track <b>106</b> is manufactured so as to be white in color. Other colors for the track <b>106</b> will be obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure. In one embodiment, the track <b>106</b> is cut to predefined lengths, such as twenty-foot lengths. In one or more embodiments, the ends of the track <b>106</b> can be contoured for smooth interconnection to adjacent track segments.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In one embodiment, the track <b>106</b> comprises a coating <b>107</b>. For example, in one embodiment the track <b>106</b> is coated with a silicon-based coating to allow curtains or other hangers to more smoothly slide along the track <b>106</b>. It should be noted that one primary advantage offered by embodiments of the disclosure is that hanging systems configured in accordance with embodiments of the disclosure are very, very quiet when in operation. For example, where the track <b>106</b> is manufactured from polyethylene and coated with silicon, and a curtain having a hanger such as those described in commonly assigned U.S. Ser. No. 15/651,774, filed Jul. 17, 2017, which is incorporated herein by reference, which is made from a woven polyester mesh, moving the hanger along the track <b>106</b> is nearly a silent procedure. This is advantageous in hospitals and other medical environments where noise is problematic. Prior art hanging systems, which primarily include metal, are loud and intrusive. In one embodiment of the present disclosure, each of the track <b>106</b>, the hanger, and any item attached thereto is made without any metal. This greatly reduces&#x2014;if not eliminates&#x2014;noise when the hangers are moved on the track <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">A second advantage of not including metal in either the track <b>106</b> or items hanging therefrom is that components of systems configured in accordance with various embodiments of the disclosure can be extremely light in weight. This enables the track <b>106</b> to easily be mounted on the key <b>403</b>. The process can be accomplished by anyone, regardless of size or strength.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The inclusion of the first flat side <b>407</b>, the second flat side <b>408</b>, and the arch <b>409</b> define a peninsular indentation <b>410</b> into which the key <b>403</b> may be inserted. In this illustrative embodiment, the track <b>106</b> comprises one or more complementary barbs <b>405</b>. Each of the one or more complementary barbs <b>405</b> is complementary in shape to the one or more barbs <b>404</b> of the key <b>403</b>. Here, each complementary barb comprises an inverted hemi-triangular protrusion with a base of each inverted hemi-triangular protrusion being disposed above a side of the inverted hemi-triangular protrusion.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Using this configuration, the one or more barbs <b>404</b> of the key <b>403</b> facilitate one-way penetration of the key <b>403</b> into the track <b>106</b>. In one or more embodiments, the track <b>106</b> is manufactured from a pliable material, such as a thermoplastic. When the key <b>403</b> is inserted into the peninsular indentation <b>410</b>, the first flat side <b>407</b> of the track <b>106</b> flexes so that the one or more complementary barbs <b>405</b> of the track <b>106</b> pass over the one or more barbs <b>404</b> of the key <b>403</b>. Once the key <b>403</b> is fully inserted into the peninsular indentation <b>410</b> of the track <b>106</b>, first flat side <b>407</b> of the track <b>106</b> flex back toward the key <b>403</b>, thereby causing the one or more complementary barbs <b>405</b> to engage the one or more barbs <b>404</b> of the key <b>403</b>. This results in the key <b>403</b> being frictionally retained within the track <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In one or more embodiments, the second flat side <b>408</b> of the track <b>106</b> terminates at an end opposite the arch <b>409</b> in an L-shaped latch <b>411</b>. In one or more embodiments, the second major surface <b>402</b> of the key includes a complementary L-shaped indention <b>412</b> into which the base of the &#x201c;L&#x201d; of the L-shaped latch <b>411</b> seats when the key <b>403</b> is fully inserted into the track <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In operation, when the key <b>403</b> is inserted into the peninsular indentation <b>410</b>, the second flat side <b>408</b> of the track <b>106</b> flexes so the base of the &#x201c;L&#x201d; of the L-shaped latch <b>411</b> of the track <b>106</b> can pass over the second flat side <b>408</b> of the key <b>403</b>. Once the key <b>403</b> is fully inserted into the peninsular indentation <b>410</b> of the track <b>106</b>, second flat side <b>408</b> of the track <b>106</b> flexes back toward the key <b>403</b>, thereby causing the base of the &#x201c;L&#x201d; of the L-shaped latch <b>411</b> to seat within the complementary L-shaped indention <b>412</b> of the key <b>403</b>. This assists in retaining the key <b>403</b> within the track <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In one or more embodiments, the base member <b>102</b> comprises a first base member portion <b>108</b> and a second base member portion <b>109</b>. In one or more embodiments, the first base member portion <b>108</b> and the second base member portion <b>109</b> are separable along a medial major axis <b>110</b>. In the illustrative embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, the first base member portion <b>108</b> and the second base member portion <b>109</b> have been placed together such that their inner surfaces abut along the medial major axis <b>110</b>. A coupler <b>111</b>, which in this embodiment is a plastic hex nut, couples the first base member portion <b>108</b> and the second base member portion <b>109</b> together to retain the inner surfaces abutting at the medial major axis <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In one or more embodiments, the first base member portion <b>108</b> defines a first half rail clamp <b>112</b>. Similarly, the second base member portion <b>109</b> defines a second half rail clamp <b>113</b>. Each of the first half rail clamp <b>112</b> and the second half rail clamp <b>113</b> includes a vertical member extending distally from the first base member portion <b>108</b> and the second base member portion <b>109</b>, respectively, and a horizontal member extending distally from its respective vertical member only a portion of the width of the first base member portion <b>108</b> and the second base member portion <b>109</b>. This leaves a gap between each horizontal member, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Separating the first base member portion <b>108</b> from the second base member portion <b>109</b> along the medial major axis <b>110</b> therefore separates the first half rail clamp <b>112</b> from the second half rail clamp <b>113</b>. When used with a drop ceiling having a suspension grid of rails, one can simply place the first half rail clamp <b>112</b> to the left of a rail and the second half rail clamp <b>113</b> to the right of the rail, or vice versa. The first base member portion <b>108</b> can then be pressed against the second base member portion <b>109</b> along the medial major axis <b>110</b>. This causes the rail of the suspension grid to be caught between the first half rail clamp <b>112</b> and the second half rail clamp <b>113</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">When the coupler <b>111</b> is then be attached to the base member <b>102</b> to retain the first base member portion <b>108</b> against the second base member portion <b>109</b>, this causes the first half rail clamp <b>112</b> from the second half rail clamp <b>113</b> to couple the track hanger <b>100</b> to the rail of the suspension grid. In one or more embodiments, as will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, the coupler <b>111</b> engages one or more threads disposed on the exterior surface of a head receiver extending distally from the base member <b>102</b> to retain the first base member portion <b>108</b> against the second base member portion <b>109</b>. As will be also shown in more detail below in these figures, the coupler <b>111</b> can also be used to retain a head, which is attached to the extension <b>104</b> and hook <b>103</b>, within an interior socket supporting the threads. Thus, in one or more embodiments, the track hanger <b>100</b> comprises a uniquely configured base member <b>102</b> that facilitates simple mounting and dismounting of the track hanger <b>100</b> to a track of a conventional suspension grid of a drop ceiling.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the illustrative embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, hanger <b>101</b> of the track hanger <b>100</b> includes one or more bends <b>114</b>,<b>115</b>,<b>116</b>. In this illustrative embodiment, the hanger <b>101</b> includes three bends <b>114</b>,<b>115</b>,<b>116</b>. Bend <b>114</b> and bend <b>115</b> are obtuse, while bend <b>116</b> is substantially orthogonal.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">As noted above, in one or more embodiments each of the hanger <b>101</b>, the base member <b>102</b>, and the key <b>403</b> are separable from each other. For example, in one embodiment the hanger <b>101</b> can be detached from the base member <b>102</b>. Similarly, the key <b>403</b> can be detached from the hanger <b>101</b>. Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, illustrated therein is the key <b>403</b> detached from the end <b>501</b> of the hook <b>103</b>.

To attach the key <b>403</b> to the end <b>501</b> of the hook <b>103</b>, the end <b>501</b> of the hook <b>103</b> opposite the extension (<b>104</b>) of the hanger <b>101</b> is inserted into an aperture <b>502</b> defined within a connector <b>504</b> of the key. In one or more embodiments, the aperture <b>502</b> is configured to frictionally retain the key <b>403</b> to the end <b>501</b> of the hook <b>103</b>. However, in other embodiments, a latch, snap, one-way latch, or other mating feature can be incorporated into either the aperture <b>502</b> or the end <b>501</b> of the hook <b>103</b> to frictionally retain the key <b>403</b> to the end <b>501</b> of the hook <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In this illustrative embodiment, the aperture <b>502</b> and the end <b>501</b> of the hook <b>103</b> are geometrically configured to prevent rotation of the key <b>403</b> about the end <b>501</b> of the hook.

In the illustrative embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the first base member portion <b>1108</b> and the second base member portion <b>1109</b> have been placed together such that their inner surfaces abut along the medial major axis <b>1110</b>. A coupler <b>1111</b>, which in this embodiment is a plastic hex nut, couples the first base member portion <b>1108</b> and the second base member portion <b>1090</b> together to retain the inner surfaces abutting at the medial major axis <b>1110</b>.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In one or more embodiments, the first base member portion <b>1108</b> defines a first half rail clamp <b>1112</b>. Similarly, the second base member portion <b>1109</b> defines a second half rail clamp <b>1113</b>. Each of the first half rail clamp <b>1112</b> and the second half rail clamp <b>1113</b> includes a vertical member extending distally from the first base member portion <b>1108</b> and the second base member portion <b>1109</b>, respectively, and a horizontal member extending distally from its respective vertical member only a portion of the width of the first base member portion <b>1108</b> and the second base member portion <b>1109</b>. This leaves a gap between each horizontal member, as shown.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Separating the first base member portion <b>1108</b> from the second base member portion <b>1109</b> along the medial major axis <b>1110</b> therefore separates the first half rail clamp <b>1112</b> from the second half rail clamp <b>1113</b>. When used with a drop ceiling having a suspension grid of rails, one can simply place the first half rail clamp <b>1112</b> to the left of a rail and the second half rail clamp <b>1113</b> to the right of the rail, or vice versa. The first base member portion <b>1108</b> can then be pressed against the second base member portion <b>1109</b> along the medial major axis <b>1110</b>. This causes the rail of the suspension grid to be caught between the first half rail clamp <b>1112</b> and the second half rail clamp <b>1113</b>.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">When the coupler <b>1111</b> is then be attached to the base member <b>1102</b> to retain the first base member portion <b>1108</b> against the second base member portion <b>1109</b>, this causes the first half rail clamp <b>1112</b> from the second half rail clamp <b>1113</b> to couple the track hanger <b>1100</b> to the rail of the suspension grid. In one or more embodiments, the coupler <b>1111</b> engages one or more threads <b>1171</b> disposed on the exterior surface of a head receiver <b>1172</b> extending distally from the base member <b>1102</b> to retain the first base member portion <b>1108</b> against the second base member portion <b>109</b>. The coupler <b>1111</b> can also be used to retain a head <b>1170</b>, which is attached to the extension <b>1104</b> and hook <b>1103</b>, within an interior socket supporting the threads.

The track (<b>106</b>) can be flexible so that it can be shaped into different contours when attached to a track hanger <b>1500</b>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">In one or more embodiments, the inclusion of the first flat side (<b>407</b>), the second flat side (<b>408</b>), and the arch (<b>409</b>) define a peninsular indentation (<b>410</b>) into which the key <b>1503</b> may be inserted. The track (<b>106</b>) can comprise one or more complementary barbs (<b>405</b>). Each of the one or more complementary barbs (<b>405</b>) is, in one or more embodiments, complementary in shape to the one or more barbs <b>1802</b> of the key <b>1503</b>. For example, each complementary barb can comprise an inverted hemi-triangular protrusion with a base of each inverted hemi-triangular protrusion being disposed above a side of the inverted hemi-triangular protrusion.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">Using this configuration, the one or more barbs <b>1802</b> of the key <b>1503</b> facilitate one-way penetration of the key <b>1503</b> into the track (<b>106</b>). In one or more embodiments, when the key <b>1503</b> is inserted into the peninsular indentation (<b>410</b>), the first flat side (<b>407</b>) of the track (<b>106</b>) flexes so that the one or more complementary barbs (<b>405</b>) of the track (<b>106</b>) pass over the one or more barbs <b>1802</b> of the key <b>1503</b>. Once the key <b>1503</b> is fully inserted into the peninsular indentation (<b>410</b>) of the track (<b>106</b>), first flat side (<b>407</b>) of the track (<b>106</b>) flex back toward the key <b>1503</b>, thereby causing the one or more complementary barbs (<b>405</b>) to engage the one or more barbs <b>1802</b> of the key <b>1503</b>.

Effectively, this allows the head <b>1605</b> of the hanger <b>1501</b> to be exposed to the first half rail clamp <b>1512</b> and the second half rail clamp <b>1513</b>. That the head <b>1605</b> of the hanger <b>1501</b> is exposed to the first half rail clamp <b>1512</b> and the second half rail clamp <b>1513</b> means that the head <b>1605</b> can be inserted into the head receiver defined by the first half head receiver <b>2015</b> and the second half head receiver <b>2016</b> until it touches the first half rail clamp <b>1512</b> and the second half rail clamp <b>1513</b>.
