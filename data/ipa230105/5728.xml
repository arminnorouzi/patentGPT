Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation (&#x201c;MALDI&#x201d;) mass spectrometry is a known process which is particularly suited for the analysis of non-volatile biomolecules. A suitable matrix material (e.g. an organic solvent) is added to a sample so that the sample becomes embedded in the matrix material. The embedded sample is then positioned on a metal plate and a laser pulse is directed on to the target sample. The laser pulse impinging upon the target sample causes analyte material to be ablated and desorbed from the target sample. Analyte ions are generated by analyte material being protonated or deprotonated in a hot plume of gaseous molecules which is released from the target. The matrix has a strong absorption at the wavelength of the laser pulse and acts as a proton source to encourage ionisation of the analyte. The gaseous plume which is released from the target comprises a mixture of analyte ions together with neutral particles. The mixture of analyte ions and neutral particles is then directed towards the inlet of a mass spectrometer. The analyte ions are separated from the neutral particles with the analyte ions being onwardly transmitted to a mass analyser of the mass spectrometer in order to be mass analysed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation mass spectrometry imaging (&#x201c;MALDI-MSI&#x201d;) involves analysing the distribution of biomolecules across the surface of a target (e.g. a tissue embedded in a matrix) by scanning the target with a focused laser beam and recording the ion profile at each irradiated pixel. An image of the mass spectral properties of the target across the surface of the target can then be constructed.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to a known mass spectrometer comprising a Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation (&#x201c;MALDI&#x201d;) ion source analyte ions generated by the ion source are onwardly transmitted to further stages of the mass spectrometer via a first rod set ion guide which is provided in a first or initial vacuum chamber of the mass spectrometer.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One problem with the known arrangement is that the first rod set ion guide can become contaminated or the rod electrodes comprising the first rod set ion guide may otherwise become dirty or coated with analyte and background material. In particular, ions and neutral particles may impact the outer surface of the electrodes forming the first rod set ion guide over a period of time so that the electrodes forming the first rod set ion guide become coated with insulating material which degrades the performance of the first rod set ion guide and hence negatively impacts the overall performance of the mass spectrometer.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to maintain performance of the first rod set ion guide and the overall mass spectrometer it is necessary periodically to remove the first rod set ion guide from the first or initial vacuum chamber of the mass spectrometer in order to clean the first rod set ion guide by removing any surface build up of contaminants on the surface of the electrodes of the first rod set ion guide.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, the process of removing the first rod set ion guide from the first vacuum chamber of the known mass spectrometer is relatively complex and time consuming. The first rod set ion guide of the known arrangement is not readily removeable from the vacuum chamber of the mass spectrometer in which it is housed. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, the first rod set ion guide and the geometry of the vacuum chamber is such that the first rod set ion guide can not be serviced by non-skilled users. In particular, it requires the services of a skilled service engineer in order to remove the first rod set ion guide from the first vacuum chamber of the mass spectrometer.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Furthermore, the process of removing the first rod set ion guide from the first vacuum chamber of the mass spectrometer for cleaning purposes involves fully venting the mass spectrometer prior to removal of the first rod set ion guide from the first vacuum chamber.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the process of establishing a high vacuum (low pressure) in a downstream analyser stage of a mass spectrometer is a time consuming process. Accordingly, the conventional approach to cleaning the first rod set ion guide of a mass spectrometer is both relatively complex in that it requires the services of a skilled engineer as well as being relatively time consuming in that the mass spectrometer will be offline for a period of time whilst the mass spectrometer is initially fully vented. Furthermore, once the first rod set ion guide has been removed, cleaned and reinstalled in the first vacuum chamber of the mass spectrometer it then takes a considerable period of time in order to reestablish a high vacuum (low pressure) in the downstream analyser stage of the mass spectrometer.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an analagous manner, conventionally if it is desired to remove a sub-atmospheric pressure ion source housed in a vacuum chamber of the mass spectrometer in order to operate a different type of ion source then this similarly involves the complete venting of the instrument. Accordingly, conventionally seeking to change a sub-atmospheric pressure ion source for an atmospheric pressure ion source can be a relatively complex and time consuming process requiring the services of a skilled engineer.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is desired to provide an improved mass spectrometer.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to an aspect there is provided apparatus comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0014">a vacuum chamber;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0015">an isolation valve having a curved, spherical, cylindrical or concave portion; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0016">a first ion guide, wherein at least a portion of the first ion guide extends, in use, within a swept volume of the isolation valve or within the curved, spherical, cylindrical or concave portion of the isolation valve.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0015" num="0017">The apparatus may, for example, comprise an analytical device, a mass spectrometer or an ion mobility spectrometer.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0018">The curved shape or profile of the isolation valve allows the first ion guide to cooperate with the isolation valve so that an end of the first ion guide sits within a swept volume of the isolation valve. According to various embodiments the isolation valve is rotatable and as the isolation valve is rotated the profile of the isolation valve sweeps out a volume which may be referred to as a &#x201c;swept volume&#x201d; as will be understood by those skilled in the art. The positioning of at least a portion of the first ion guide within a swept volume of the isolation valve (or within a curved, spherical, cylindrical or concave portion of the isolation valve) and the curved, spherical, cylindrical or concave nature of the isolation valve enables a compact design to be provided and enables a downstream end of the first ion guide to be located close to the entrance of a downstream second ion guide thereby ensuring high ion transmission efficiency between the two ion guides.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0019">The contours of the isolation valve and the arrangement of electrodes forming the first ion guide (which may be arranged upstream of the isolation valve) and/or the arrangement of electrodes forming a second ion guide (which may be arranged downstream of the isolation valve) may be designed to accommodate the isolation valve in an optimum manner. In particular, the electrodes of the first upstream ion guide may be arranged so that the electrodes of the first ion guide extend within and into the swept volume of the isolation valve so as to minimise the distance between the exit or a downstream end of the first ion guide and the entrance or an upstream end of a second downstream ion guide located downstream of the first ion guide and the isolation valve. In particular, when the isolation valve is positioned in an open position in normal operation then the downstream end of the first ion guide may be arranged so as to abut relatively closely to the entrance of the second downstream ion guide so as to provide high ion transmission efficiency between the two ion guides whilst also allowing the isolation valve to be closed in a mode of operation so as to isolate the downstream second ion guide from the upstream first ion guide.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0020">The curved shape or profile of the isolation valve allows the isolation valve to be positioned in close proximity to a second ion guide which may be arranged downstream of the first ion guide. As a result, the first and second ion guides can be located close to each other or in close proximity to each other. The distance between the exit of the first rod set ion guide and the entrance to the second downstream ion guide can therefore be reduced or minimised enabling ions to be transferred efficiently from the first ion guide to the second ion guide without ion loss.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0021">The isolation valve may be operable to enable a first ion optic assembly to be removed from and/or inserted within a first upstream section of a vacuum chamber at the same time as a second downstream section of the vacuum chamber is maintained at a lower pressure than the first upstream section of the vacuum chamber. The first ion optic assembly may comprise one or more first ion guides. For example, the one or more first ion guides may comprise a multipole rod set arrangement comprising a plurality of rod electrodes or a ring set arrangement of electrodes. The first ion optic assembly may comprise a plurality of electrodes, wherein one or more of the electrodes extend within a swept volume of the isolation valve. The isolation valve may have or present a substantially concave profile relative to the first ion optic assembly. The apparatus may further comprise a second ion optic assembly arranged downstream of the isolation valve. The isolation valve may have or present a substantially convex profile relative to the second ion optic assembly. The isolation valve may be rotatable or actuable between an open position and a closed position. When the isolation valve is in an open position the first upstream section of a vacuum chamber including the first ion optic assembly may be in fluid communication with the second downstream section of the vacuum chamber. When the isolation valve is in a closed position the first upstream section of the vacuum chamber including the first ion optic assembly is not in fluid communication with the second downstream section of the vacuum chamber thereby enabling the pressure within the first upstream section to be raised to atmospheric or ambient pressure whilst the second downstream section may be maintained at a substantially lower pressure.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0022">According to various embodiments a spherical or curved valve or isolation valve is provided which is capable of isolating a small chamber containing a first ion guide from further stages of a mass spectrometer. The provision of the isolation valve allows the instrument vacuum to be maintained whilst venting the source. The isolation valve may be provided in conjunction with an ion guide assembly having one or more guide rails and the ion guide assembly may be retained in position by one or more latching clip releases.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0023">The overall arrangement enables a non-skilled user to perform various functions such as closing the isolation valve in order to maintain the low pressure (high vacuum) in downstream vacuum chambers of the instrument and then remove and optionally clean and/or replace the first ion guide. It will be understood that conventionally such functions are reserved for skilled engineers. An analytical instrument, mass spectrometer or ion mobility spectrometer according to various embodiments therefore has an improved serviceability compared with conventional arrangements and in particular an analytical instrument, mass spectrometer or ion mobility spectrometer according to various embodiments may be serviced by non-skilled users.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0024">The isolation valve enables a source or ion source to be vented without the requirement of venting an analyser which may be provided in a downstream analyser vacuum chamber.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0025">According to various embodiments an isolation valve is provided which allows a vacuum chamber containing or housing a first ion guide assembly to be vented and opened without an analyser needing to be vented or fully vented.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0026">Maintaining the vacuum in the analyser enables the voltages applied to the electrodes inside the analyser to be maintained during cleaning and maintenance of the first ion guide or first ion guide assembly with the result that it is not necessary to re-calibrate the instrument upon return to operation.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0027">The first ion guide may comprise a plurality of rod electrodes.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0028">The first ion guide may comprise a multipole rod set. For example, according to various embodiments the first ion guide may comprise a quadrupole rod set ion guide, a hexapole rod set ion guide or an octopole rod set ion guide. The first ion guide may comprise more than eight rod electrodes.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0029">One or more RF or AC voltages may be applied to the rod electrodes in order to generate a pseudo-potential ion confinement region within a volume defined by the inscribed radius of the rod set electrodes.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0030">The rod electrodes once removed from the vacuum chamber may be easily cleaned and reinserted into the instrument by a non-skilled user.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0031">At least some of the rod electrodes may have a bevelled, curved or non-planar portion or end which is located, in use, adjacent the isolation valve.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0032">The curved shape or profile of the isolation valve and the bevelled, curved or non-planar portion or end of the first rod set ion guide enables the first ion guide to be positioned in close proximity to the isolation valve and in particular in close proximity with a curved, spherical, cylindrical or concave portion of the isolation valve.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0033">The first ion guide may comprise a plurality of electrodes having an upstream end and a downstream end, wherein a portion or a downstream end of at least some or all of the electrodes is bevelled, curved or non-planar.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0034">The bevelled, curved or non-planar portion or end(s) of the first ion guide enables the ion guide to cooperate with the isolation valve so that the end of the first ion guide sits within a swept volume of the isolation valve. As a result, a compact design is provided which enables the first ion guide to be located close to the entrance of a downstream second ion guide thereby ensuring a high ion transmission efficiency between the two ion guides.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0035">The first ion guide may comprise a ring set ion guide or a plurality of electrodes having apertures through which ions are transmitted in use. The electrodes forming the first ion guide may have an external diameter or profile and the external diameter or profile of one or more electrodes forming the first ion guide may reduce or taper towards a downstream section of the first ion guide.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0036">The ring electrodes may have an internal diameter or first profile and an external diameter or second profile. The external diameter or second profile of one or more electrodes forming the first ion guide may reduce or taper towards a downstream section of the first ion guide so that the first ion guide extends, in use, within a swept volume or a curved, spherical, cylindrical or concave portion of the isolation valve. As a result, the first ion guide can be located close to the entrance of a downstream second ion guide thereby ensuring a high ion transmission efficiency between the two ion guides.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0037">A downstream end of the first ion guide may be located, in use, 10 mm from the isolation valve.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0038">According to various embodiments the first ion guide may be located particularly close to the isolation valve or a curved, spherical, cylindrical or concave portion of the isolation valve in order to improve ion transmission efficiency. For example, according to various embodiments a downstream end of the first ion guide may be located &#x2264;9 mm, &#x2264;8 mm, &#x2264;7 mm, &#x2264;6 mm, &#x2264;5 mm, &#x2264;4 mm, &#x2264;3 mm, &#x2264;2 mm or &#x2264;1 mm from the isolation valve or a portion of the isolation valve.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0039">The apparatus may further comprise a second ion guide, wherein in a mode of operation at least a portion of the isolation valve extends within a portion of the second ion guide.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0040">The second ion guide may be located downstream of the isolation valve and/or downstream of the first ion guide. According to various embodiments ions may be efficiently transmitted from the first ion guide to the second ion guide with essentially negligible loss of ions due to the close packed arrangement between the first ion guide, the isolation valve and the second ion guide.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0041">The second ion guide may comprise a ring set ion guide or a plurality of electrodes having apertures through which ions are transmitted in use.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0042">The second ion guide may comprise a plurality of ring electrodes wherein one or more RF or AC voltages may be applied to the ring electrodes in order to generate a pseudo-potential ion confinement region within the ring set or within the apertures of the electrodes.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0043">According to various embodiments the second ion guide may comprise a StepWave&#xae; ion guide arrangement comprising a stacked ring ion guide which is arranged to maximise ion transmission from a source to a mass analyser. The device also allows for the active removal of neutral contaminants, providing an enhancement to overall signal to noise. The second ion guide may facilitate the efficient capture of a relatively diffuse ion cloud entering the first stage, which is then focused into an upper ion guide for transfer to the mass analyser.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0044">The first ion guide may be located, in use, in the vacuum chamber and the isolation valve may be operable to isolate a region downstream of the first ion guide.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0045">For example, the isolation valve may be operable to isolate a portion of a vacuum chamber or a vacuum chamber housing the first rod set ion guide from a second downstream ion guide. The second downstream ion guide may be provided in the same vacuum chamber as the first ion guide or alternatively the second downstream ion guide may be provided in a second or different vacuum chamber.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0046">The isolation valve can be operated by a non-skilled user and enables e.g. a mass analyser to be maintained at a low pressure whilst the first ion guide is removed for servicing.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0047">The apparatus may further comprise an analytical device, a mass analyser or an ion mobility spectrometer arranged downstream of the isolation valve, wherein the isolation valve may be operated so as to maintain the analytical device, mass analyser or ion mobility spectrometer at a sub-atmospheric pressure whilst the first ion guide is removed.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0048">The analytical device, mass analyser or ion mobility spectrometer may be provided in a vacuum chamber which may be maintained, in use, at a relatively low pressure. For example, according to various embodiments the vacuum chamber housing the analytical device or mass analyser may be maintained at a pressure &#x2264;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>mbar whilst the first rod set ion guide is removed. According to other embodiments the vacuum chamber housing the analytical device or mass analyser may be maintained at a pressure &#x2264;10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>mbar, &#x2264;10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>mbar, &#x2264;10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>mbar, &#x2264;10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>mbar or &#x2264;10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>mbar whilst the first rod set ion guide is removed. It will be understood that maintaining the analytical device or mass analyser at sub-atmospheric pressure whilst the first rod set ion guide is removed (at atmospheric or ambient pressure) and serviced reduces the downtime of the instrument and removes any need to recalibrate the instrument.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0049">The isolation valve may be rotatable between an open position and a closed position.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0050">The curved shape or profile of the isolation valve enables the isolation valve to be rotated from an open position to a closed position in a compact manner enabling close positioning of the first and second ion guides.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0051">According to an aspect there is provided a method comprising:</p><p id="p-0050" num="0052">guiding ions through a first ion guide, wherein at least a portion of the first ion guide extends, in use, within a swept volume of an isolation valve or within a curved, spherical, cylindrical or concave portion of an isolation valve.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0053">The method may further comprise operating the isolation valve so as to maintain an analytical device, a mass analyser or an ion mobility spectrometer at a sub-atmospheric pressure whilst the first ion guide is removed.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0054">The method may further comprise rotating the isolation valve between an open position and a closed position.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0055">According to another aspect there is provided apparatus comprising:</p><p id="p-0054" num="0056">a vacuum chamber;</p><p id="p-0055" num="0057">a housing located within the vacuum chamber and having a guide mechanism; and</p><p id="p-0056" num="0058">a first ion optic assembly which is slidable or translatable in cooperation with the guide mechanism thereby enabling the first ion optic assembly to be inserted and aligned within the vacuum chamber.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0059">A MALDI mass spectrometer is known having an ion guide assembly located within a vacuum chamber. However, the ion guide assembly of the known arrangement is not readily removeable and requires tools in order to unfasten and remove the ion guide assembly from the vacuum chamber. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, removing the ion guide assembly of the known mass spectrometer requires the services of a skilled engineer. Removing an ion guide assembly from the vacuum chamber of a conventional mass spectrometer also requires that the MALDI ion source is retracted from the vacuum chamber so that the ion guide assembly can then be manipulated out through a lid in the housing of the vacuum chamber. This is problematic for a number of reasons.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0060">Firstly, during its manipulation, extraction and replacement, a mirror inside the vacuum chamber which provides a viewing window for a MALDI camera can be caught and displaced from its critical alignment.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0061">Secondly, the voltages that are provided to the electrodes that comprise the known ion guide assembly are delivered using wires and connectors that are part of the ion guide assembly. During its manipulation, the wires can become caught or dislodged resulting in a risk of close proximity or contact with other electrodes or components consequently causing an increased risk of electrical breakdown once returned to an operational state.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0062">In contrast to the known arrangement, according to various embodiments a housing is provided within a vacuum chamber and the housing may include guided bearings which ensure that a first ion optic assembly, ion guide or ion transmission device can be removed and/or (re-)inserted without the risk of moving or damaging any of the parts inside the chamber or vacuum chamber.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0063">According to various embodiments a guide rail and associated guide bearings may be provided which allow one or more laser mirrors to be positioned close to the ion optic axis of the ion guide thereby enabling a laser beam to be delivered to a sample at an angle close to normal incidence whilst also reducing the overall working distance between the focusing lens and the sample plate. This has a number of benefits.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0064">Firstly, the reduced angle of incidence reduces the degree of distortion of the incident beam resulting in a more circular illumination of the sample.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0065">Secondly, the ability to include a shorter focal length lens means that the incident laser beam can be more tightly focused on to the sample plate, enabling increased spatial resolution of the locality of the detected ions.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0066">When loading or unloading a sample on a conventional MALDI ion source, a sample plate carrier must travel to a load lock location before sealing against a door. The load lock chamber is then vented. By isolating the analyser vacuum using an isolation valve according to various embodiments and venting the entire chamber there is no requirement for the sample plate carrier to be moved. This reduces the time it takes to unload a sample.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0067">Another problem with the conventional load lock system is the risk that, during loading, a difference between the pressure that is achieved in the load lock chamber and the sample chamber can result in sudden gas flow from the load lock into the sample chamber as the sample carrier retracts from the load lock seal. On occasions, this can result in sample plates falling from the carrier into the main sample vacuum chamber during this transition, resulting in a need to dismantle the whole of the sample chamber in order to retrieve the sample.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0068">In contrast to the known arrangement, the sample chamber according to various embodiments may be fully opened allowing any sample that falls off the carrier to be retrieved easily.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0069">Another benefit of the removal of a load lock is that larger sample plates can be used whilst maintaining a similar length of leadscrew.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0070">Conventionally, changeover from one ion source to another currently requires the complete venting of the instrument. The combination of the isolation valve and the guide bearings and/or a rail configuration according to various embodiments allows the first ion guide assembly to be removed and replaced with an assembly suitable for alternative ion sources without the need to vent the entire instrument.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0071">According to various embodiments an ion guide may be mounted to an assembly which may comprise a guided mounting mechanism. The combination of a vacuum isolation valve and a guided mounting mechanism for an ion guide (which may also have an integrated latch and seal mechanism) enables rapid exchange of an initial or first ion guide and reduces the downtime of a mass spectrometer or other analytical instrument being taken offline for servicing.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0072">The cooperation between the first ion optic assembly and the guide mechanism allows the first ion optic assembly to be removed from the vacuum chamber without becoming tangled or caught with wires or electrical cables. Furthermore, the first ion optic assembly can be inserted and/or removed from the vacuum chamber without any risk of damaging other components including sensitive ion optical components, laser mirrors and the like.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0073">The apparatus according to various embodiments enables the first ion guide of an analytical instrument, mass spectrometer or ion mobility spectrometer to be removed easily for cleaning. After cleaning, the ion guide can be replaced easily by a non-skilled user i.e. a specialist service engineer is not required. In particular, mounting the first ion guide as part of an ion optic assembly and being able to axially slide or translate the first ion guide and associated ion optic assembly into and out of a first (or subsequent) vacuum chamber optionally in the direction of the ion optic axis (i.e. axially) enables a non-skilled user to insert and/or remove a first ion guide without specialist skill. The first ion optic assembly may be provided with a guide mechanism such as one or more guide rails. The guide rails may slide into or engage with one or more guide bearings optionally mounted on a second assembly or a housing which may be arranged to connect with or interlock with the first assembly which may house or include the first ion guide.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0074">The guide rail mechanism according to various embodiments is particularly effective at ensuring and facilitating easy alignment of the first ion guide with the rest of the housing of the analytical instrument, mass spectrometer or ion mobility spectrometer and in ensuring correct and precise positioning of the first ion guide within the first vacuum chamber of an analytical instrument such as a mass spectrometer or ion mobility spectrometer.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0075">Embodiments are contemplated wherein the guide mechanism may comprise a different form of sliding mechanism or wherein the tracks or guides may have different profiles at different axial positions.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0076">Although various embodiments are disclosed wherein the assembly housing the first ion guide comprises one, two or more than two guide rails which slide within or engage with one, two or more than two guide bearings mounted to a second assembly or housing, other embodiments are contemplated wherein the first ion guide assembly may comprise one, two or more than two guide bearings and the second assembly or housing may comprise one, two or more than two guide rails.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0077">The guide mechanism may enable the first ion optic assembly to slide or translate in an axial direction thereby enabling the first ion optic assembly to be removed from and/or inserted within a chamber or vacuum chamber of an analytical instrument such as a mass spectrometer or ion mobility spectrometer.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0078">The first ion optic assembly may further comprise a sealing member having an ion inlet orifice therewithin, wherein the sealing member is arranged to seal against a front portion of the vacuum chamber.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0079">The sealing member may form a vacuum tight seal with the front portion of the chamber or vacuum chamber with the exception of the ion inlet orifice provided in the sealing member. Optionally, the sealing member may include one or more O-ring seals for sealing against the front portion of the vacuum chamber. However, the provision of one or more O-rings is not essential. Accordingly, the sealing member of the first ion optic assembly may seal against the front portion of the chamber or vacuum chamber and pressure may effectively only be equalised via the ion inlet orifice.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0080">The apparatus may further comprise a releasable latch for securing the sealing member against the front portion of the vacuum chamber and/or for securing the first ion optic assembly within the vacuum chamber.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0081">The releasable latch enables the first ion optic assembly to be secured to a front face of a chamber or a vacuum chamber in a manner which enables a non-skilled user to remove or withdraw the first ion optic assembly from the vacuum chamber without the use of tools.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0082">The first ion optic assembly may further comprise a first electrical connector and the housing may further comprise a second electrical connector, wherein in use insertion of the first ion optic assembly into the vacuum chamber causes the first electrical connector to connect with the second electrical connector.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0083">According to various embodiments contact pins and plates may be used to provide electrical connections to the ion guide or first ion guide. The use of contact pins and plates according to various embodiments removes any risk of wires moving or becoming tangled. Furthermore, the guide rail mechanism prevents accidental clashes with any critically aligned components inside the chamber or vacuum chamber such as laser mirrors.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0084">One problem with the known MALDI mass spectrometer is that conventionally the first ion guide located within a vacuum chamber has a series of relatively complex electrical connections which need to be disconnected and then reconnected before the first ion guide can be removed and service. The disconnection and reconnection of the electrical supplies to the first ion guide of the known MALDI mass spectrometer requires the services of a skilled engineer.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0085">However, in contrast to the known arrangement according to various embodiments electrical connections to the ion guide or first ion guide may be made via spring contacts inside the chamber or vacuum chamber. Accordingly, the ion guide or first ion guide can be disconnected and/or reconnected to an electrical supply in a simple manner which does not require the services of a skilled engineer.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0086">A small roughing pump may be connected to a pumping port in the vacuum chamber enabling the pressure in the vacuum chamber to be reduced to a level sufficient to open the isolation valve once the source or ion source and the first ion guide are in position.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0087">In contrast to the known arrangement, the electrical connections to the first ion guide may be disconnected from (and reconnected to) its electrical power supply in a safe manner without requiring the services of a skilled engineer. Furthermore, the electrical connections are kept away from an upstream end of the first ion guide thereby improving both the safety and serviceability of the analytical instrument, mass spectrometer or ion mobility spectrometer and improving the process of removing, cleaning and reinserting the first ion guide from and into the chamber or first vacuum chamber.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0088">According to various embodiments contact pins and plates may be used to provide electrical connections to the ion guide or first ion guide. The use of contact pins and plates according to various embodiments removes any risk of wires moving and enables a first ion guide to be electrically connected and/or disconnected to an associated power supply without requiring a specialist service engineer. The connectors may be positioned so as to connect with a rear (downstream) portion of the first ion guide thereby keeping the connection to an associated power supply away from a user. Accordingly, the design enables electrical contact to be made to and broken with the ion guide in a safe manner without requiring specialist skill.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0089">The first ion optic assembly may comprise one or more guide mechanisms, one or more guide rails or one or more guide bearings arranged to receive one or more guide rails. The apparatus may further comprise a second assembly which is arranged to connect with, secure to or interlock with the first ion optic assembly. The second assembly may be arranged and adapted to facilitate alignment of the first ion optic assembly when the first ion optic assembly is inserted into the vacuum chamber. The second assembly may comprise one or more guide mechanisms, one or more guide rails or one or more guide bearings arranged to receive one or more guide rails. The first ion optic assembly may comprise one or more first electrical contacts which in use engage with one or more second electrical contacts provided on the second assembly. The one or more first electrical contacts may be retractable and/or the one or more second electrical contacts may be retractable. The guide mechanism may be arranged so as to enable the ion optic assembly to slide or translate in an axial direction which is substantially parallel to an ion optic axis.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0090">The first ion optic assembly and/or a portion of the vacuum chamber may comprise a spring release mechanism allowing the first ion optic assembly to be releasably secured to a portion of the vacuum chamber. The first ion optic assembly may further comprise one or more extraction electrodes having one or more apertures through which ions are transmitted in use. According to various embodiments either: (i) the one or more apertures may be sized so as not to form a differential pumping aperture; or (ii) the one or more apertures may be sized so as to form a differential pumping aperture.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0091">The first ion optic assembly may form a seal with a front face of the vacuum chamber or a front face of a mass spectrometer.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0092">The first ion optic assembly may comprise a consumable component which is replaced when contaminated.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0093">According to another aspect there is provided a method comprising:</p><p id="p-0092" num="0094">sliding or translating a first ion optic assembly in cooperation with a guide mechanism of a housing located within a vacuum chamber thereby enabling the first ion optic assembly to be inserted and aligned within the vacuum chamber.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0095">According to an aspect there is provided apparatus comprising:</p><p id="p-0094" num="0096">a vacuum chamber having an ion inlet orifice; and</p><p id="p-0095" num="0097">an assembly housing a first sub-atmospheric pressure ion source, wherein in a first mode of operation the assembly may be secured to the vacuum chamber so as to align the first ion source with the ion inlet orifice and wherein in a second mode of operation the assembly may be detached thereby enabling a second different ion source to be located adjacent the ion inlet orifice.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0098">Conventionally, changeover from one ion source to another may be a relatively a difficult process. According to various embodiments the apparatus comprises an assembly housing a first sub-atmospheric pressure ion source. In a first mode of operation the assembly may be secured to the vacuum chamber so as to align the first ion source with the ion inlet orifice and in a second mode of operation the assembly may be detached thereby enabling a second different ion source to be located adjacent the ion inlet orifice. As a result, a non-skilled user may operate a sub-atmospheric pressure ion source located within a housing of an assembly and then simply detach the assembly in order to use a different ion source. For example, the second ion source may comprise an atmospheric pressure ion source.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0099">According to various embodiments the assembly or door assembly which was used in a first mode of operation may be re-used to provide a support for a second different ion source. However, whereas in the first mode of operation the assembly or door assembly may have made a vacuum tight seal against a front face of the vacuum chamber or a vacuum chamber, in the second mode of operation the assembly or door assembly may be used simply as a support for the second ion source i.e. in the second mode of operation the assembly or door assembly may not make a tight seal against the front face of the vacuum chamber or a vacuum chamber.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0100">Conventionally, changeover from one ion source to another requires the complete venting of the instrument.

The assembly or door assembly can be easily detached from the vacuum chamber enabling a different type of ion source to be used.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0107">The assembly may comprise a translation stage.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0108">According to various embodiments the assembly may comprise an x-y translation stage for translating a sample plate such as a MALDI sample plate in one or more orthogonal directions.

Some of the plume of material is ionised and is onwardly transmitted into the analyser whilst neutral species spread within the first vacuum chamber and are deposited on the localised surfaces. Over time, and use, this deposit on the surface of the electrodes can affect the electric fields generated by the electrodes and be detrimental to the sensitivity of the instrument.
