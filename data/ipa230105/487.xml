This disclosure finds particular utility in the field of orthopedics and specifically for reducing fractures and maintaining compression between bone fragments, and/or for reducing openings and maintaining compression between bone segments in osteotomies, and/or for inducing fusion across the bones of a joint in an arthrodesis. While the disclosure has application throughout the body, its utility will be illustrated herein in the context of the repair of fractured or displaced bone tissue, such as during an Akin Osteotomy of the foot or an Isolated Lunocapitate Arthrodesis of the hand/wrist, and in the context of stabilizing the spine as an aid to fusion through bilateral immobilization of the facet joints.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the field of orthopedic surgery, it is common to rejoin broken bones. The success of the surgical procedure often depends on the ability to reapproximate the fractured bones, the amount of compression achieved between the bone fragments, and the ability to sustain that compression over a period of time. If the surgeon is unable to bring the bone fragments into close contact, a gap will exist between the bone fragments and the bone tissue will need to fill that gap before complete healing can take place. Furthermore, gaps between bone fragments that are too large allow motion to occur between the bone fragments, disrupting the healing tissue and thus slowing the healing process. Optimal healing requires that the bone fragments be in close contact with each other, and for a compressive load to be applied and maintained between the bone fragments. Compressive strain between bone fragments has been found to accelerate the healing process in accordance with Wolf's Law.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Broken bones can be rejoined using staples. Staples are formed from a plurality of legs (typically two legs, though sometimes more) connected together by a bridge. Staples are typically manufactured from either stainless steel alloys, titanium alloys or Nitinol, a shape memory alloy. The staples are inserted into pre-drilled holes on either side of the fracture site, with the bridge of the staple spanning the fracture line.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">While these staples are designed to bring the bone fragments into close contact and to generate a compressive load between the bone fragments, the staples do not always succeed in accomplishing this objective. It is widely reported that the compressive load of staples dissipates rapidly as the bone relaxes and remodels around the legs of the staples. Furthermore, current staple systems do not allow the surgeon to control the amount of compression that the staple will exert when it is released from the delivery device, do not allow the surgeon to control the rate at which the staple loads the bone when it is removed from the delivery device, and do not allow the surgeon to control the extent to which the staple's legs are opened.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus there exists a clinical need for fixation devices that are able to bring bone fragments into close proximity with each other, generate a compressive load, and maintain that compressive load for a prolonged period of time while healing occurs.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Moreover, existing staples have bridges that are fixed in size, shape, and dimension, while each procedure presents a unique anatomical requirement (which is set by a combination of indication and patient-specific anatomy). Existing staples with fixed shape and dimension bridges will often sit &#x201c;proud&#x201d; of the cortical bone, resulting in irritated and inflamed adjacent soft tissue and, in some cases, bursitis.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus there also exists a clinical need for a staple with a malleable bridge that may be bent so as to conform to the unique anatomical structure of each patient and sit flush on the cortical surface of the bone.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Moreover, in the field of spine surgery, it is common to fuse adjacent vertebra. Facet fixation screws are commonly used to induce fusion. The screws are intended to stabilize the spine as an aid to fusion through bilateral immobilization of the facet joints. For transfacet fixation, the screws are inserted through the inferior articular process across the facet joint and into the pedicle. For translaminar facet fixation, the screws are inserted through the lateral aspect of the spinous process, through the lamina, through the inferior articular process, across the facet joint and into the pedicle. The current invention disclosed herein may be utilized for bilateral facet fixation, with or without bone graft, at single or multiple levels from C<b>2</b> to S<b>1</b> inclusive.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus there further exists a clinical need for fixation devices that are able to bring adjacent vertebra into close proximity with each other, generate a compressive load, and maintain that compressive load for a prolonged period of time while fusion occurs.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">This disclosure provides novel fixation devices (e.g., staples, screws, etc.) which are able to bring bone fragments into close proximity with each other, generate a compressive load, and maintain that compressive load for a prolonged period of time while healing occurs.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Among other things, this disclosure includes the provision and use of a novel monolithic staple which is manufactured from a single piece of shape memory material (e.g., a material capable of exhibiting superelasticity and/or a temperature-induced shape change). The shape memory material may be a metal alloy (e.g., Nitinol) or a polymer (e.g., appropriately processed PEEK). The staple is designed to reduce fractures and generate and maintain more uniform compression between the cortical bone and cancellous bone of the bone fragments to aid in fracture healing.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an embodiment, a staple includes an elastic bridge and two elastic legs. The bridge and the legs meet at a pair of curved hinge regions which are also elastic. In the un-restrained state, the legs of the staple are bent inward with an angle of less than 90&#xb0;. Prior to implantation, the bridge of the staple can be reversibly strained outward (i.e., stretched longitudinally outward) and the legs of the staple can be reversibly bent to a position perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the bridge so as to allow for insertion of the staple into a prepared fracture site. A delivery device may be used to strain the bridge, bend the legs to parallel, hold the staple in this strained state prior to implantation, and insert the strained staple into the prepared fracture site. When the constraint on the bridge and legs is removed, the bridge and legs attempt to return to their original unrestrained state, thereby generating a greater, and more uniform, compressive load and maintaining that greater, and more uniform, compressive load for a prolonged period of time while healing occurs.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another embodiment, a staple includes a malleable bridge and two elastic legs. The bridge and the legs meet at a pair of curved hinge regions which are also elastic. In the unrestrained state, the legs of the staple are bent inward with an angle of less than 90&#xb0;. Prior to implantation, the malleable bridge may be deformed so that it conforms to the unique anatomical structure of the patient, such that it will sit flush with the cortical surface of the bone after implantation. And prior to implantation, the legs of the staple can be reversibly bent to a position perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the bridge so as to allow for insertion of the staple into a prepared fracture site. A bending device may be used to deform the bridge, and a delivery device may be used to hold the deformed bridge, bend the legs, hold the staple in this state prior to implantation, and insert the staple into the bone, with the bridge of the staple extending across the fracture line. Alternatively, a combined bending/delivery device may be used to deform the bridge, bend the legs, hold the staple in this condition prior to implantation, and insert the staple into the bone, with the bridge of the staple extending across the fracture line. Upon insertion of the deformed and strained staple into the prepared fracture site, the constraint on the legs of the staple is removed, whereupon the legs of the staple attempt to return to their original unrestrained state, thereby generating a compressive load and maintaining that compressive load for a prolonged period of time while healing occurs. Significantly, the deformed bridge of the staple can be matched to the unique anatomical structure of the patient, such that the bridge of the staple will sit flush with the cortical surface of the bone.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Additionally, it is possible that where the staple comprises a malleable bridge with two elastic legs, the staple can be inserted into the fracture site prior to bending the bridge. The bridge can be bent after implantation using a tamp-like device of the sort known in the art.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another embodiment, a surgical system includes a delivery device and a staple. The delivery device may engage the staple underneath a bridge of the staple. The delivery device may be actuated to deform the staple bridge such that staple legs are substantially parallel to each other for insertion into prepared bone holes. Releasing the staple from the delivery device allows the staple legs to re-assume a convergent position.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In another embodiment, a compression screw is manufactured from a shape memory material (e.g., a material capable of exhibiting superelasticity and/or a temperature-induced shape change). The shape memory material may be a metal alloy (e.g., Nitinol) or a polymer (e.g., appropriately processed PEEK). The compression screw is designed to engage bones and to generate compression between the bones. The compression screw has an enlarged head and a distal threaded region. The head is connected to the threaded region by a hollow central bridge region. The hollow central bridge region can be strained and reversibly elongated, e.g., up to about 8% where the compression screw is formed from Nitinol. The hollow central bridge region may be strained and reversibly elongated prior to implantation by releasing that strain after implantation of the compression screw across the fusion line. The contracting hollow central bridge region can aid in approximating and provide additional therapeutic compression to the bones, whereby to provide superior fusion.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another embodiment, a screw is inserted through an optional washer. The hole in the washer is sized so as to allow the distal threads to pass through, but not to allow the enlarged head to pass through. This allows for a large surface area for the screw to distribute its compressive force over. Furthermore, the enlarged head can articulate in the washer, allowing the screw to be inserted at an angle, but still have the washer shit flush with the bone surface.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In another embodiment, a compression screw system includes a compression screw having a shaft, a screw thread formed on the shaft at a distal location, and an enlarged head formed on the shaft at a proximal location. At least a portion of the shaft disposed between the screw thread and the enlarged head feature is capable of being stretched. A holding element is connectable to the compression screw for releasably holding the portion of the shaft in a stretched condition.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In another embodiment, a method for fusing bone longitudinally stretching a compression screw so that the compression screw is in a longitudinally stretched condition, holding the compression screw in its longitudinally stretched condition, inserting the compression screw into bone while the compression screw is in its longitudinally stretched condition so that the compression screw extends across the fusion site, and releasing the compression screw from its longitudinally stretched condition to apply compression across the fusion site.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In yet another embodiment, a compression screw system includes a compression screw having a shaft capable of being stretched. The shaft has a proximal end, a distal end, and a lumen extending therebetween. The proximal end of the shaft includes an enlarged head and the distal end of the shaft includes a distal screw thread. The lumen includes a distal bore, an intermediate counterbore communicating with the distal bore so as to define a first shoulder, and a proximal counterbore communicating with the intermediate counterbore so as to define a second shoulder. The proximal counterbore includes a connection feature and the proximal end of the shaft includes a drive feature for turning the compression screw. An internal retaining pin includes a pin shaft having a proximal end, a distal end, and a lumen extending therebetween. The proximal end of the pin shaft includes a second connection feature configured to mate with the connection feature of the proximal counterbore of the compression screw. The distal end of the pin shaft terminates in a distal end surface. The internal retaining pin includes a pin drive feature for turning the internal retaining pin, and the internal retaining pin is sized such that, when the shaft of the compression screw is stretched, and when the internal retaining pin is inserted into the lumen of the compression screw such that the second connection feature of the internal retaining pin is engaged with the connection feature of the proximal counterbore of the compression screw and contacts the second shoulder of the compression screw, the distal end surface of the pin shaft engages the first shoulder of the compression screw to prevent foreshortening of the stretched compression screw.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The various features and advantages of this disclosure will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description.

This is done by moving handles <b>45</b> of delivery device <b>30</b> together, thereby forcing staple-stretching linkages <b>65</b> of staple mount <b>50</b> apart, and causing bridge <b>10</b> of staple <b>5</b> to be stretched and causing legs <b>15</b> of staple <b>5</b> to be positioned substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of bridge <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In an embodiment, the delivery device <b>30</b> is constructed so that upon squeezing the handles <b>45</b>, the legs <b>15</b> of the staple <b>5</b> are first bent to perpendicular and then, when the legs <b>15</b> of the staple <b>5</b> are substantially perpendicular, the bridge <b>10</b> of the staple <b>5</b> is elongated.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In another embodiment, the staple <b>5</b> is configured so that the force that is generated as the staple <b>5</b> reconfigures (i.e., as the bridge <b>10</b> foreshortens and the legs <b>15</b> bend inward) is less than the &#x201c;tear through&#x201d; force of the bone receiving legs <b>15</b>, i.e., staple <b>5</b> is specifically engineered so as to not &#x201c;tear through&#x201d; the bone tissue when attempting to reconfigure. The delivery device <b>30</b> may include the aforementioned locking feature <b>55</b> which enables the surgeon to control the extent to which the staple <b>5</b> is strained (e.g., to bend only the legs of the staple, or to both bend the legs of the staple and strain the bridge of the staple, and to control the extent to which the bridge is stretched), thereby allowing the surgeon to tailor the compressive forces and recoverable strain imposed on the anatomy, depending on bone quality. The compressive forces of the staple <b>5</b> can be controlled by modulating the material properties of the staple and/or the geometry of the staple.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The percentage of cold work in the shape memory material forming the staple <b>5</b> affects the compressive force generated by the reconfiguring staple <b>5</b>. As the percentage of cold work increases, the compression force declines. In and embodiment, the staple <b>5</b> includes between about 15% and 55% cold work to control the recovery force of the staple <b>5</b>. However, other degrees of cold work may be used, and/or the material may not be cold worked at all.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Another material property that affects the compression force of the staple <b>5</b> is the temperature differential between the body that the staple <b>5</b> will be implanted into (assumed to be 37&#xb0; C., which is the temperature of a human body) and the austenite finish temperature of the shape memory material forming staple <b>5</b>. A smaller temperature differential between the two will result in the staple <b>5</b> generating a smaller compressive load; conversely, a larger temperature differential between the two will result in the staple generating a larger compressive load. The shape memory material that the staple <b>5</b> is made out of may have an austenite finish temperature of greater than about &#x2212;10&#xb0; C., resulting in a temperature differential of about 47&#xb0; C. when the staple <b>5</b> is implanted (assuming that the staple is implanted in a human body).</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The geometry of the staple <b>5</b> may also affect the compression forces generated. The cross-sectional area of the bridge <b>10</b> and the cross-sectional area of the legs <b>15</b> affect the compression forces generated by the reconfiguring staple <b>5</b>. As the cross-sectional areas increase, so do the compression forces that the reconfiguring staple <b>5</b> will generate.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The staple legs <b>15</b> are critical for transmitting the compression force to the bone without &#x201c;tearing through&#x201d; the bone. The height, width, and length of the staple legs <b>15</b>, and the geometry of the staple legs <b>15</b>, are all significant relative to the staple's ability to not &#x201c;tear through&#x201d; the bone. Staple legs <b>15</b> with greater surface area are better able to distribute the compression force and thus not &#x201c;tear through&#x201d; the bone.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> schematically illustrates how the staple <b>5</b> may be used to reduce a fracture <b>90</b> and generate and maintain greater and more uniform compression between bone fragments <b>80</b> and <b>85</b> to aid in fracture healing. More particularly, the fracture <b>90</b> to be fused is first re-approximated and reduced. A drill guide (not shown) of the sort well known in the art is used to drill two holes <b>95</b> the correct distance apart to accommodate the legs <b>15</b> of the strained staple <b>5</b>. The staple <b>5</b> is loaded onto the delivery device <b>30</b>, and the delivery device <b>30</b> is used to stretch the bridge <b>10</b> and straighten the legs <b>15</b> of staple <b>5</b> (i.e., by squeezing together handles <b>45</b>). While still on the delivery device <b>30</b>, the legs <b>15</b> of the staple <b>5</b> are placed into the pre-drilled holes <b>95</b>. The staple <b>5</b> is then released from the delivery device <b>30</b>, which allows the stretched bridge <b>10</b> of the staple <b>5</b> to foreshorten so as to apply compression to the fracture <b>90</b>, and which allows the strained legs <b>15</b> of the staple <b>5</b> to &#x201c;kick in&#x201d; and thereby apply additional inward pressure across the fracture <b>90</b>. Thus, the staple <b>5</b> applies more uniform compression across the fracture site, generating compression across both the cortical and intramedullary surfaces, using the compressive forces generated by the foreshortening bridge <b>10</b> of the strained staple <b>5</b> and using the compressive forces generated by the inwardly bending legs <b>15</b> of the strained staple <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Significantly, when the bridge <b>10</b> and the legs <b>15</b> of the staple <b>5</b> generate a compressive force, both the cortical regions of the bone fragments and the cancellous regions of the bone fragments are pulled together. This provides a superior balance of compression across different regions of the bone.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">It should also be appreciated that, if desired, the staple <b>5</b> could be used to attach soft tissue to bone (e.g., to attach a rotator cuff to bone).</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">It should also be appreciated that the delivery device <b>30</b> may not always seat the staple <b>5</b> with the bridge <b>10</b> of the staple <b>5</b> seated directly against the cortical surface of the bone (i.e., the bridge <b>10</b> may sit slightly above the cortical surface of the bone). Therefore, a tamp of the sort well known in the art may be used to fully seat the staple <b>5</b> bridge against the cortical surface of the bone.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In some circumstances it can be desirable to modify the delivery device <b>30</b> to ensure that the legs <b>15</b> do not be bent past 90 degrees (relative to the longitudinal axis of bridge <b>10</b>) when the staple <b>5</b> is strained. More particularly, in some constructions, the staple <b>5</b> can require more force to stretch the bridge <b>10</b> than to bend the legs <b>15</b>. In this circumstance, there is the possibility that legs <b>15</b> will be bent to 90 degrees (relative to the longitudinal axis of bridge <b>10</b>) and then, as bridge <b>10</b> is stretched, legs <b>15</b> may be bent past 90 degrees (relative to the longitudinal axis of bridge <b>10</b>). Therefore, it can be desirable to provide means for preventing legs <b>15</b> from being bent past 90 degrees (relative to the longitudinal axis of bridge <b>10</b>).</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">To this end, and looking now at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A, <b>8</b>B, and <b>8</b>C</figref>, a delivery device <b>30</b> may be constructed so that its staple-straining linkages <b>65</b> are each formed with an outboard constraint <b>97</b> that prevents legs <b>15</b> from being bent past 90 degrees (relative to the longitudinal axis of bridge <b>10</b>) when the staple <b>5</b> is strained.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In an embodiment, the staple <b>5</b> and delivery device <b>30</b> establish a surgical system that is provided in the form of a sterilized kit. The kit may include additional instruments to aid in the implantation of the staple (e.g., k-wire, drill bit, staple size guide, tamp, etc.).</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">As discussed above, the staple <b>5</b> is strained so that, upon deployment in the bone, it will provide compression across a fracture. However, it should also be appreciated that, if desired, the staple <b>5</b> could be configured to provide a distraction force to a bone. In this situation, the staple <b>5</b> can be configured and strained so that the bridge <b>10</b> is compressed, and/or legs <b>15</b> can be bent outward, such that when staple <b>5</b> is deployed in bone, the reconfiguring staple <b>5</b> applies a distraction force to the bone to cause the bone to grow and thereby elongate.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">As further discussed above, the staple <b>5</b> is manufactured from a shape memory material (e.g., a material capable of exhibiting superelasticity and/or a temperature-induced shape change). The shape memory material may be a metal alloy (e.g., Nitinol) or a polymer (e.g., appropriately processed PEEK). In this respect it should be appreciated that staple <b>5</b> can be manufactured out of a single piece of shape memory material (i.e., so as to create an integral, monolithic structure), and the different regions of the staple worked differently, in a metallurgical sense, so that different regions of the staple have different mechanical properties and exhibit different mechanical characteristics, even as they form a single, integral, monolithic structure.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In an embodiment, the staple <b>5</b> can be manufactured so that bridge <b>10</b> is elastic, the legs <b>15</b> are elastic, and the curved hinge regions <b>20</b> are elastic, in which case the bridge <b>10</b> and the legs <b>15</b> can both be elastically deformed for providing compression to the fracture site after implantation. The bridge <b>10</b> and the legs <b>15</b> may be worked metallurgically so that they have the same or different mechanical properties.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">However, in yet another embodiment, the staple <b>5</b> can be manufactured so that the bridge <b>10</b> is malleable and non-superelastic (e.g., fully annealed Nitinol, or martensitic Nitinol with an austenite start temperature greater than body temperature), and legs <b>15</b> and hinge regions <b>20</b> are superelastic (e.g., austenite but capable of forming stress-induced martensite). This allows the malleable bridge <b>10</b> of staple <b>5</b> to be inelastically bent (i.e., to take a set) to accommodate a particular geometry of the cortical anatomy, while still allowing the superelastic legs <b>15</b> of the staple to generate compression. By way of a non-limiting example, many bones exhibit an hour-glass surface profile; moreover, certain orthopedic indications (e.g., an Akin Osteotomy) often results in a cortical surface that is concave when the bones are re-approximated. In these situations, a staple with a straight bridge will not sit flush on the bone surface, which can lead to patient discomfort. In this respect it should also be appreciated that where bridge <b>10</b> is malleable and legs <b>15</b> are superelastic, legs <b>15</b> of the staple <b>5</b> may be manufactured at a more acute angle (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>10</b></figref>) to allow for adequate fracture compression and reduction in the event that bridge <b>10</b> must be bent downward (e.g., deformed to a concave position) to meet the anatomical structure of the cortical bone.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, for example, shows a monolithic staple <b>5</b> where bridge <b>10</b> is malleable and legs <b>15</b> are superelastic, and where staple <b>5</b> is shown in its unbent and unstrained condition, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows staple <b>5</b> where bridge <b>10</b> has been bent to give it an altered configuration. The staple <b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref> may be formed out of a single piece of shape memory material, whereby to form a single, integral, monolithic structure, with the single piece of shape memory material having different regions of the staple worked differently, in a metallurgical sense, so that different regions of the staple <b>5</b> have different mechanical properties and exhibit different mechanical characteristics, i.e., bridge <b>10</b> is malleable and legs <b>15</b> are superelastic.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">It may be desirable for the staple <b>5</b> to start with a bridge that is convex, e.g., such as the staple <b>5</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>. This allows the bridge <b>10</b> of the implanted staple <b>5</b> to sit flush with the cortical bone surface if the bone surface is largely planar. More particularly, if the bridge <b>10</b> of staple <b>5</b> were to be linear, and the legs <b>15</b> strained and the staple <b>5</b> inserted into a prepared fracture site where the cortical surface is largely planar, the resulting implanted staple <b>5</b> could have two small &#x201c;humps&#x201d; at the outer ends of the bridge, i.e., at the bridge-hinge interface. Starting with a convex-shaped bridge (i.e., such as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>) largely eliminates these &#x201c;humps.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Thus, in another embodiment, the staple <b>5</b> is formed out of a single piece of shape memory material (i.e., so as to form a single, integral, monolithic structure), with the shape memory material being worked so that bridge <b>10</b> is malleable (e.g., fully annealed Nitinol, or martensitic Nitinol with an austenite start temperature greater than body temperature) and legs <b>15</b> are superelastic (e.g., austenite but capable of forming stress-induced martensite), such that bridge <b>10</b> of staple <b>5</b> may be bent to contour to the surface of the bone while the compressive force generated by the superelastic legs <b>15</b> of the staple are used to help fuse the bone.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">A bending device can be used to bend the bridge <b>10</b> of the staple <b>5</b> prior to implantation of the staple <b>5</b>.
