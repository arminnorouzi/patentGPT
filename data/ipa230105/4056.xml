Each application that the present application claims benefit of or priority to as identified in the concurrently filed Application Data Sheet is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and for all purposes.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosed embodiments relate generally to bus bars for optically switchable devices, and more particularly to angled bus bars for thin film optically switchable devices.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Various optically switchable devices are available for controlling tinting, reflectivity, etc., of window panes or lites. Electrochromic devices are one example of optically switchable devices. Electrochromism is a phenomenon in which a material exhibits a reversible electrochemically-mediated change in an optical property when placed in a different electronic state, typically by being subjected to a voltage change. The optical property being manipulated is typically one or more of color, transmittance, absorbance, and reflectance. One well known electrochromic material is tungsten oxide (WO<sub>3</sub>). Tungsten oxide is a cathodic electrochromic material in which a coloration transition, transparent to blue, occurs by electrochemical reduction.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Electrochromic materials may be incorporated into, for example, windows for home, commercial, and other uses. The color, transmittance, absorbance, and/or reflectance of such windows may be changed by inducing a change in the electrochromic material; i.e., electrochromic windows are windows that can be darkened or lightened electronically. A small voltage applied to an electrochromic device of the window will cause it to darken; reversing the voltage causes it to lighten. This capability allows for control of the amount of light that passes through the window, and presents an enormous opportunity for electrochromic windows to be used not only for aesthetic purposes but also for significant energy-savings. With energy conservation being foremost in modern energy policy, it is expected that growth of the electrochromic window industry will be robust in the coming years.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Angled bus bars for thin film optically switchable devices are disclosed herein. Angled bus bars may allow for the transition of a thin film optically switchable device symmetrically and quickly, without overdriving the thin film optically switchable device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one embodiment, an apparatus includes a substrate with an optically switchable device disposed on a surface of the substrate. The optically switchable device has a perimeter with at least one corner including a first side, a first vertex joining the first side and a second side, and the second side. A first bus bar is affixed to the optically switchable device proximate to the corner and configured to deliver current and/or voltage for driving switching of the optically switchable device. The first bus bar includes a first arm and a second arm having a configuration that substantially follows the shape of the first side, the first vertex, and the second side of the corner. A second bus bar is affixed to the optically switchable device and configured to deliver current and/or voltage for driving switching of the optically switchable device. The second bus bar may be angled or not. One embodiment is an electrochromic device including at least one angled bus bar as described herein.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another embodiment, a method of changing an optical state of an optically switchable device includes applying current and/or voltage to at least one angled bus bar as described herein, which is in electrical communication with the optically switchable device. In one embodiment, the angled bus bar is as described above, and it is the first of two bus bars in electrical communication with the optically switchable device. The optically switchable device is disposed on a surface of a substrate and has a perimeter with at least one corner including a first side, a first vertex joining the first side and a second side, and the second side. The first bus bar is affixed to the optically switchable device proximate the corner. The first bus bar includes a first arm and a second arm having a configuration that substantially follows the shape of the first side, the first vertex, and the second side of the corner. A second bus bar, applied to an opposing electrode of the optically switchable device, may be angled or not. In response to current and/or voltage applied to the first and the second bus bars, an optical state of the optically switchable device changes in a substantially uniform manner.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another embodiment, a method of fabricating an optically switchable device includes fabricating the optically switchable device on a surface of a substrate in a single integrated vacuum deposition system. The substrate is in a substantially vertical orientation in the integrated vacuum deposition system. The optically switchable device has a perimeter with at least one corner including a first side, a first vertex joining the first side and a second side, and the second side. A first bus bar is formed on the optically switchable device proximate to the corner. The first bus bar includes a first arm and a second arm having a configuration that substantially follows the shape of the first side, the first vertex, and the second side of the corner. The first bus bar is configured to deliver current and/or voltage for driving switching of the optically switchable device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the method further includes forming a second bus bar on the optically switchable device. The second bus bar is configured to deliver current and/or voltage for driving switching of the optically switchable device. In some embodiments, the perimeter of the optically switchable device has a second corner including a third side, a second vertex joining the third side and a fourth side, and the fourth side. The second bus bar includes a third arm and a fourth arm having a configuration that substantially follows the shape of the third side, the second vertex, and the fourth side of the second corner.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment, an electrochromic lite includes a substantially transparent substrate with an electrochromic device thereon. The electrochromic device has an area bounded by four sides. The electrochromic lite further includes a first bus bar and a second bus bar. The first bus bar is in electrical communication with a bottom transparent conductor of the electrochromic device. The second bus bar is in electrical communication with a top transparent conductor of the electrochromic device. The first bus bar is diagonally opposed to the second bus bar. Each of the first and second bus bars spans diagonally opposing vertices of the area and at least some portion of the two sides forming each of the diagonally opposing vertices.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the area of the electrochromic device is a substantially rectangular area. The at least some portion spanned by the first and the second bus bars is between about 10% and about 90%, between about 10% and about 65%, or between about 35% and about 65% of the length of the respective sides of the substantially rectangular area.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the area of the electrochromic device is a substantially rectangular area. Each of the first and second bus bars is L-shaped. A first arm of each of the first and second bus bars traverses a portion of a longer side of the substantially rectangular area. A second arm of each of the first and second bus bars traverses a portion of a shorter side, substantially orthogonal to the longer side, of the substantially rectangular area. The first arm is longer than the second arm. In some embodiments, the first arm spans between about 75% and about 90% of the longer side, and the second arm spans between about 25% and about 75% of the shorter side. In some other embodiments, the substantially rectangular area is square and all the arms of the first and second bus bars are of substantially equal length.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, the first bus bar and the second bus bar are configured such that the optically switchable device switches from a first optical state to a second optical state in about 10 minutes or less. In some embodiments, the electrochromic device is all solid state and inorganic.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">These and other features and advantages will be described in further detail below, with

num="0039">It should be understood that while the disclosed embodiments focus on electrochromic (EC) windows (also referred to as smart windows), the concepts disclosed herein may apply to other types of switchable optical devices, including liquid crystal devices, suspended particle devices, and the like. For example, a liquid crystal device or a suspended particle device, instead of an electrochromic device, could be incorporated in any of the disclosed embodiments.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In order to orient the reader to the embodiments of angled bus bars disclosed herein, a brief discussion of electrochromic devices is provided. This initial discussion of electrochromic devices is provided for context only, and the subsequently described embodiments of angled bus bars are not limited to the specific features and fabrication processes of this initial discussion.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">A particular example of an electrochromic lite is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref>, in order to illustrate embodiments described herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a cross-sectional representation (see cut X-X&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>) of an electrochromic lite, <b>100</b>, which is fabricated starting with a glass sheet, <b>105</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows an end view (see perspective Y-Y&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>) of EC lite <b>100</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> shows a top-down view of EC lite <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows the electrochromic lite after fabrication on glass sheet <b>105</b>, edge deleted to produce area, <b>140</b>, around the perimeter of the lite. The electrochromic lite has also been laser scribed and bus bars have been attached. The glass lite <b>105</b> has a diffusion barrier, <b>110</b>, and a first transparent conducting oxide (TCO), <b>115</b>, on the diffusion barrier. In this example, the edge deletion process removes both TCO <b>115</b> and diffusion barrier <b>110</b>, but in other embodiments only the TCO is removed, leaving the diffusion barrier intact. The TCO <b>115</b> is the first of two conductive layers used to form the electrodes of the electrochromic device fabricated on the glass sheet. In this example, the glass sheet includes underlying glass and the diffusion barrier layer. Thus, in this example, the diffusion barrier is formed, and then the first TCO, an EC stack, <b>125</b>, (e.g., having electrochromic, ion conductor, and counter electrode layers), and a second TCO, <b>130</b>, are formed. In one embodiment, the electrochromic device (EC stack and second TCO) is fabricated in an integrated deposition system where the glass sheet does not leave the integrated deposition system at any time during fabrication of the stack. In one embodiment, the first TCO layer is also formed using the integrated deposition system where the glass sheet does not leave the integrated deposition system during deposition of the EC stack and the (second) TCO layer. In one embodiment, all of the layers (diffusion barrier, first TCO, EC stack, and second TCO) are deposited in the integrated deposition system where the glass sheet does not leave the integrated deposition system during deposition. In this example, prior to deposition of EC stack <b>125</b>, an isolation trench, <b>120</b>, is cut through TCO <b>115</b> and diffusion barrier <b>110</b>. Trench <b>120</b> is made in contemplation of electrically isolating an area of TCO <b>115</b> that will reside under bus bar 1 after fabrication is complete (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). This is done to avoid charge buildup and coloration of the EC device under the bus bar, which can be undesirable.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">After formation of the EC device, edge deletion processes and additional laser scribing are performed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> depicts areas <b>140</b> where the device has been removed, in this example, from a perimeter region surrounding laser scribe trenches, <b>150</b>, <b>155</b>, <b>160</b>, and <b>165</b>, which pass through second TCO <b>130</b> and the EC stack, but not the first TCO <b>115</b>. Laser scribe trenches <b>150</b>, <b>155</b>, <b>160</b>, and <b>165</b> are made to isolate portions of the EC device, <b>135</b>, <b>145</b>, <b>170</b>, and <b>175</b>, which were potentially damaged during edge deletion processes from the operable EC device. In one embodiment, laser scribe trenches <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>, and <b>165</b> pass through the first TCO to aid in isolation of the device (laser scribe trench <b>155</b> does not pass through the first TCO, otherwise it would cut off bus bar 2's electrical communication with the first TCO and thus the EC stack). The laser or lasers used for the laser scribe processes are typically, but not necessarily, pulse-type lasers, for example, diode-pumped solid state lasers. For example, the laser scribe processes can be performed using a suitable laser from IPG Photonics (of Oxford, Mass.), or from Ekspla (of Vilnius, Lithuania). Scribing can also be performed mechanically, for example, by a diamond tipped scribe. One of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that the laser scribing processes can be performed at different depths and/or performed in a single process whereby the laser cutting depth is varied, or not, during a continuous path around the perimeter of the EC device. In one embodiment, the edge deletion is performed to the depth of the first TCO.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">After laser scribing is complete, bus bars are attached. Non-penetrating bus bar (1) is applied to the second TCO. Non-penetrating bus bar (2) is applied to an area where the device was not deposited (e.g., from a mask protecting the first TCO from device deposition), in contact with the first TCO or, in this example, where an edge deletion process (e.g., laser ablation using an apparatus having a XY or XYZ galvanometer) was used to remove material down to the first TCO. In this example, both bus bar 1 and bus bar 2 are non-penetrating bus bars. A penetrating bus bar is one that is typically pressed into and through the EC stack to make contact with the TCO at the bottom of the stack. A non-penetrating bus bar is one that does not penetrate into the EC stack layers, but rather makes electrical and physical contact on the surface of a conductive layer, for example, a TCO.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The TCO layers can be electrically connected using a non-traditional bus bar, for example, a bus bar fabricated with screen and lithography patterning methods. In one embodiment, electrical communication is established with the device's transparent conducting layers via silk screening (or using another patterning method) a conductive ink followed by heat curing or sintering the ink. Advantages to using the above described device configuration include simpler manufacturing, for example, and less laser scribing than conventional techniques which use penetrating bus bars.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">After the bus bars are connected, the device is integrated into an insulated glass unit (IGU), which includes, for example, wiring the bus bars and the like. In some embodiments, one or both of the bus bars are inside the finished IGU, however in one embodiment one bus bar is outside the seal of the IGU and one bus bar is inside the IGU. In the former embodiment, area <b>140</b> is used to make the seal with one face of the spacer used to form the IGU. Thus, the wires or other connection to the bus bars runs between the spacer and the glass. As many spacers are made of metal, e.g., stainless steel, which is conductive, it is desirable to take steps to avoid short circuiting due to electrical communication between the bus bar and connector thereto and the metal spacer.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As described above, after the bus bars are connected, the electrochromic lite is integrated into an IGU, which includes, for example, wiring for the bus bars and the like. In the embodiments described herein, both of the bus bars are inside the primary seal of the finished IGU. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows a cross-sectional schematic diagram of the electrochromic window as described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-C</figref> integrated into an IGU, <b>200</b>. A spacer, <b>205</b>, is used to separate the electrochromic lite from a second lite, <b>210</b>. Second lite <b>210</b> in IGU <b>200</b> is a non-electrochromic lite, however, the embodiments disclosed herein are not so limited. For example, lite <b>210</b> can have an electrochromic device thereon and/or one or more coatings such as low-E coatings and the like. Lite <b>201</b> can also be laminated glass, such as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> (lite <b>201</b> is laminated to reinforcing pane, <b>230</b>, via resin, <b>235</b>). Between spacer <b>205</b> and the first TCO layer of the electrochromic lite is a primary seal material, <b>215</b>. This primary seal material is also between spacer <b>205</b> and second glass lite <b>210</b>. Around the perimeter of spacer <b>205</b> is a secondary seal, <b>220</b>. Bus bar wiring/leads traverse the seals for connection to a controller. Secondary seal <b>220</b> may be much thicker that depicted. These seals aid in keeping moisture out of an interior space, <b>225</b>, of the IGU. They also serve to prevent argon or other gas in the interior of the IGU from escaping.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Introduction and Overview of Electrochromic Devices: Function</heading><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> schematically depicts an electrochromic device, <b>300</b>, in cross-section. Electrochromic device <b>300</b> includes a substrate, <b>302</b>, a first conductive layer (CL), <b>304</b>, an electrochromic layer (EC), <b>306</b>, an ion conducting layer (IC), <b>308</b>, a counter electrode layer (CE), <b>310</b>, and a second conductive layer (CL), <b>314</b>. Layers <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>310</b>, and <b>314</b> are collectively referred to as an electrochromic stack <b>320</b>. A voltage source <b>316</b> operable to apply an electric potential across electrochromic stack <b>320</b> effects the transition of the electrochromic device from, for example, a bleached state to a colored state (depicted). The order of layers can be reversed with respect to the substrate.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Electrochromic devices having distinct layers as described can be fabricated as all solid state and/or all inorganic devices with low defectivity. Such devices and methods of fabricating them are described in more detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/645,111, entitled, &#x201c;Fabrication of Low-Defectivity Electrochromic Devices,&#x201d; filed on Dec. 22, 2009 and naming Mark Kozlowski et al. as inventors, and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/645,159, entitled, &#x201c;Electrochromic Devices,&#x201d; filed on Dec. 22, 2009 and naming Zhongchun Wang et al. as inventors, both of which are incorporated by reference herein for all purposes. It should be understood, however, that any one or more of the layers in the stack may contain some amount of organic material. The same can be said for liquids that may be present in one or more layers in small amounts. It should also be understood that solid state material may be deposited or otherwise formed by processes employing liquid components such as certain processes employing sol-gels or chemical vapor deposition.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Additionally, it should be understood that the reference to a transition between a bleached state and colored state is non-limiting and suggests only one example, among many, of an electrochromic transition that may be implemented. Unless otherwise specified herein (including the foregoing discussion), whenever reference is made to a bleached-colored transition, the corresponding device or process encompasses other optical state transitions such as non-reflective-reflective, transparent-opaque, etc. Further, the term &#x201c;bleached&#x201d; refers to an optically neutral state, for example, uncolored, transparent, or translucent. Still further, unless specified otherwise herein, the &#x201c;color&#x201d; of an electrochromic transition is not limited to any particular wavelength or range of wavelengths. As understood by those of skill in the art, the choice of appropriate electrochromic and counter electrode materials governs the relevant optical transition.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In embodiments described herein, the electrochromic device reversibly cycles between a bleached state and a colored state. In some cases, when the device is in a bleached state, a potential is applied to the electrochromic stack <b>320</b> such that available ions in the stack reside primarily in the counter electrode <b>310</b>. When the potential on the electrochromic stack is reversed, the ions are transported across the ion conducting layer <b>308</b> to the electrochromic material <b>306</b> and cause the material to transition to the colored state.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, voltage source <b>316</b> may be configured to operate in conjunction with radiant and other environmental sensors. As described herein, voltage source <b>316</b> interfaces with a device controller (not shown in this figure). Additionally, voltage source <b>316</b> may interface with an energy management system that controls the electrochromic device according to various criteria such as the time of year, time of day, and measured environmental conditions. Such an energy management system, in conjunction with large area electrochromic devices (e.g., an electrochromic window), can dramatically lower the energy consumption of a building.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Any material having suitable optical, electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties may be used as substrate <b>302</b>. Such substrates include, for example, glass, plastic, and mirror materials. Suitable glasses include either clear or tinted soda lime glass, including soda lime float glass. The glass may be tempered or untempered.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In many cases, the substrate is a glass pane sized for residential window applications. The size of such glass pane can vary widely depending on the specific needs of the residence. In other cases, the substrate is architectural glass. Architectural glass is typically used in commercial buildings, but may also be used in residential buildings, and typically, though not necessarily, separates an indoor environment from an outdoor environment. In certain embodiments, architectural glass is at least 20 inches by 20 inches, and can be much larger, for example, as large as about 80 inches by 120 inches. Architectural glass is typically at least about 2 mm thick, typically between about 3 mm and about 6 mm thick. Of course, electrochromic devices are scalable to substrates smaller or larger than architectural glass. Further, the electrochromic device may be provided on a mirror of any size and shape.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">On top of substrate <b>302</b> is conductive layer <b>304</b>. In certain embodiments, one or both of the conductive layers <b>304</b> and <b>314</b> is inorganic and/or solid. Conductive layers <b>304</b> and <b>314</b> may be made from a number of different materials, including conductive oxides, thin metallic coatings, conductive metal nitrides, and composite conductors. Typically, conductive layers <b>304</b> and <b>314</b> are transparent at least in the range of wavelengths where electrochromism is exhibited by the electrochromic layer. Transparent conductive oxides include metal oxides and metal oxides doped with one or more metals. Examples of such metal oxides and doped metal oxides include indium oxide, indium tin oxide, doped indium oxide, tin oxide, doped tin oxide, zinc oxide, aluminum zinc oxide, doped zinc oxide, ruthenium oxide, doped ruthenium oxide and the like. Since oxides are often used for these layers, they are sometimes referred to as &#x201c;transparent conductive oxide&#x201d; (TCO) layers. Thin metallic coatings that are substantially transparent may also be used.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The function of the conductive layers is to spread an electric potential provided by voltage source <b>316</b> over surfaces of the electrochromic stack <b>320</b> to interior regions of the stack, with relatively little ohmic potential drop. The electric potential is transferred to the conductive layers though electrical connections to the conductive layers. In some embodiments, bus bars, one in contact with conductive layer <b>304</b> and one in contact with conductive layer <b>314</b>, provide the electric connection between the voltage source <b>316</b> and the conductive layers <b>304</b> and <b>314</b>. The conductive layers <b>304</b> and <b>314</b> may also be connected to the voltage source <b>316</b> with other conventional means.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Overlaying conductive layer <b>304</b> is electrochromic layer <b>306</b>. In some embodiments, electrochromic layer <b>306</b> is inorganic and/or solid. The electrochromic layer may contain any one or more of a number of different electrochromic materials, including metal oxides. Such metal oxides include tungsten oxide (WO<sub>3</sub>), molybdenum oxide (MoO<sub>3</sub>), niobium oxide (Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), titanium oxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>), copper oxide (CuO), iridium oxide (Ir<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), chromium oxide (Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), manganese oxide (Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), vanadium oxide (V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), nickel oxide (Ni<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), cobalt oxide (Co<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and the like. During operation, electrochromic layer <b>306</b> transfers ions to and receives ions from counter electrode layer <b>310</b> to cause optical transitions.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Generally, the colorization (or change in any optical property&#x2014;e.g., absorbance, reflectance, and transmittance) of the electrochromic material is caused by reversible ion insertion into the material (e.g., intercalation) and a corresponding injection of a charge balancing electron. Typically some fraction of the ions responsible for the optical transition is irreversibly bound up in the electrochromic material. Some or all of the irreversibly bound ions are used to compensate &#x201c;blind charge&#x201d; in the material. In most electrochromic materials, suitable ions include lithium ions (Li<sup>+</sup>) and hydrogen ions (W) (that is, protons). In some cases, however, other ions will be suitable. In various embodiments, lithium ions are used to produce the electrochromic phenomena. Intercalation of lithium ions into tungsten oxide (WO<sub>3-y</sub>(0&#x3c;y&#x2264;&#x2dc;0.3)) causes the tungsten oxide to change from transparent (bleached state) to blue (colored state).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, in electrochromic stack <b>320</b>, ion conducting layer <b>308</b> is sandwiched between electrochromic layer <b>306</b> and counter electrode layer <b>310</b>. In some embodiments, counter electrode layer <b>310</b> is inorganic and/or solid. The counter electrode layer may comprise one or more of a number of different materials that serve as a reservoir of ions when the electrochromic device is in the bleached state. During an electrochromic transition initiated by, for example, application of an appropriate electric potential, the counter electrode layer transfers some or all of the ions it holds to the electrochromic layer, changing the electrochromic layer to the colored state. Concurrently, in the case of NiWO, the counter electrode layer colors with the loss of ions.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments, suitable materials for the counter electrode complementary to WO<sub>3 </sub>include nickel oxide (NiO), nickel tungsten oxide (NiWO), nickel vanadium oxide, nickel chromium oxide, nickel aluminum oxide, nickel manganese oxide, nickel magnesium oxide, chromium oxide (Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), manganese oxide (MnO<sub>2</sub>), and Prussian blue.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">When charge is removed from a counter electrode <b>310</b> made of nickel tungsten oxide (that is, ions are transported from counter electrode <b>310</b> to electrochromic layer <b>306</b>), the counter electrode layer will transition from a transparent state to a colored state.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the depicted electrochromic device, between electrochromic layer <b>306</b> and counter electrode layer <b>310</b>, there is the ion conducting layer <b>308</b>. Ion conducting layer <b>308</b> serves as a medium through which ions are transported (in the manner of an electrolyte) when the electrochromic device transitions between the bleached state and the colored state. Preferably, ion conducting layer <b>308</b> is highly conductive to the relevant ions for the electrochromic and the counter electrode layers, but has sufficiently low electron conductivity that negligible electron transfer takes place during normal operation. A thin ion conducting layer with high ionic conductivity permits fast ion conduction and hence fast switching for high performance electrochromic devices. In certain embodiments, the ion conducting layer <b>308</b> is inorganic and/or solid.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Examples of suitable ion conducting layers (for electrochromic devices having a distinct IC layer) include silicates, silicon oxides, tungsten oxides, tantalum oxides, niobium oxides, and borates. These materials may be doped with different dopants, including lithium. Lithium doped silicon oxides include lithium silicon-aluminum-oxide. In some embodiments, the ion conducting layer comprises a silicate-based structure. In some embodiments, a silicon-aluminum-oxide (SiAlO) is used for the ion conducting layer <b>308</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Electrochromic device <b>300</b> may include one or more additional layers (not shown), such as one or more passive layers. Passive layers used to improve certain optical properties may be included in electrochromic device <b>300</b>. Passive layers for providing moisture or scratch resistance may also be included in electrochromic device <b>300</b>. For example, the conductive layers may be treated with anti-reflective or protective oxide or nitride layers. Other passive layers may serve to hermetically seal electrochromic device <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a schematic cross-section of an electrochromic device in a bleached state (or transitioning to a bleached state). In accordance with specific embodiments, an electrochromic device, <b>400</b>, includes a tungsten oxide electrochromic layer (EC), <b>406</b>, and a nickel-tungsten oxide counter electrode layer (CE), <b>410</b>. Electrochromic device <b>400</b> also includes a substrate, <b>402</b>, a conductive layer (CL), <b>404</b>, an ion conducting layer (IC), <b>408</b>, and conductive layer (CL), <b>414</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">A power source, <b>416</b>, is configured to apply a potential and/or current to an electrochromic stack, <b>420</b>, through suitable connections (e.g., bus bars) to the conductive layers, <b>404</b> and <b>414</b>. In some embodiments, the voltage source is configured to apply a potential of about 2 volts in order to drive a transition of the device from one optical state to another. The polarity of the potential as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is such that the ions (lithium ions in this example) primarily reside (as indicated by the dashed arrow) in nickel-tungsten oxide counter electrode layer <b>410</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> is a schematic cross-section of electrochromic device <b>400</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> but in a colored state (or transitioning to a colored state). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, the polarity of voltage source <b>416</b> is reversed, so that the electrochromic layer is made more negative to accept additional lithium ions, and thereby transition to the colored state. As indicated by the dashed arrow, lithium ions are transported across ion conducting layer <b>408</b> to tungsten oxide electrochromic layer <b>406</b>. Tungsten oxide electrochromic layer <b>406</b> is shown in the colored state. Nickel-tungsten oxide counter electrode <b>410</b> is also shown in the colored state. As explained, nickel-tungsten oxide becomes progressively more opaque as it gives up (deintercalates) lithium ions. In this example, there is a synergistic effect where the transition to colored states for both layers <b>406</b> and <b>410</b> are additive toward reducing the amount of light transmitted through the stack and substrate.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">As described above, an electrochromic device may include an electrochromic (EC) electrode layer and a counter electrode (CE) layer separated by an ionically conductive (IC) layer that is highly conductive to ions and highly resistive to electrons. As conventionally understood, the ionically conductive layer therefore prevents shorting between the electrochromic layer and the counter electrode layer. The ionically conductive layer allows the electrochromic and counter electrodes to hold a charge and thereby maintain their bleached or colored states. In electrochromic devices having distinct layers, the components form a stack which includes the ion conducting layer sandwiched between the electrochromic electrode layer and the counter electrode layer. The boundaries between these three stack components are defined by abrupt changes in composition and/or microstructure. Thus, the devices have three distinct layers with two abrupt interfaces.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In accordance with certain embodiments, the counter electrode and electrochromic electrodes are formed immediately adjacent one another, sometimes in direct contact, without separately depositing an ionically conducting layer. In some embodiments, electrochromic devices having an interfacial region rather than a distinct IC layer are employed with angled bus bars described herein.

Switching between these states is controlled by applying predefined current and/or voltage to the device. Higher currents and/or voltages are generally applied to larger switchable optical devices compared to smaller switchable optical devices to cycle between optical states.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The speed of coloration of an electrochromic device is a function of the applied current and/or voltage. Generally, the higher the current and/or voltage applied across the electrochromic device, the faster the electrochromic device will transition between optical states. Applying a high current and/or voltage across the electrochromic device, however, depending on the configuration of the bus bars of the electrochromic device, may result in damage to regions of the electrochromic device due to the regions being exposed to too high a current and/or voltage. These regions are sometimes referred to as &#x201c;hot spots.&#x201d; On the other hand, if a low current and/or voltage is applied across the electrochromic device, the device may not completely switch between optical states or may switch at an undesirably slow rate between optical states.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Further, large electrochromic devices such as those on residential windows or architectural glass may exhibit an effect sometimes referred to as the &#x201c;terminal effect.&#x201d; This is due to the relatively high sheet resistance of thin electrochromic device films, including the electrodes, coupled with device designs having terminals (bus bars) located outside the viewable area of the substrate, for example, only at the edges of the device/substrate. In such devices, there is a considerable ohmic potential drop over the area of the device (and concomitant leakage current), from the terminal located at the edge of the device to the center of the device, where there is no contact to an external voltage source. As a result, not only does the center region of the device transition more slowly than the edge regions proximate terminal contacts (which is referred to as the &#x201c;curtain effect&#x201d;), but the center region may never fully transition. In other words, the center may transition only to a limited extent in comparison to the edges. Further, to the extent that the center of the device transitions, it does so more slowly than the edge of the device. Yet further, it may be difficult to hold a transition state, once such state is reached in the center of the device. These edge-to-center non-uniformities can be perceptible to and distracting to users.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Bus Bar Configurations</heading><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Different bus bar configurations may be used, e.g., with a large electrochromic device, to substantially minimize hot spots or exposing the electrochromic device to a damaging current and/or voltage and to substantially minimize the curtain effect.

The arms of second bus bars <b>1040</b> and <b>1045</b> along the same side of second conductive layer <b>1020</b> also may have lengths such that the electrochromic device transitions between optical states in a short time period of time. In some embodiments, the arms of the first bus bars may meet, forming a single C-shaped first bus bar. In some embodiments, the arms of the second bus bars may meet, forming a single C-shaped second bus bar. This embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. Electrochromic lite <b>1100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> includes a first bus bar, <b>1130</b>, disposed on a first conductive layer, <b>1110</b>, and a second bus bar, <b>1140</b>, disposed on a second conductive layer, <b>1120</b>. Note, for example, as described above in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, an angled bus bar may have more than one angled feature (see bus bars <b>1130</b> and <b>1140</b>, each having two angles). One embodiment is an angled bus bar having two or more angles.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The angle between the two arms of an angled bus bar may approach 180 degrees and may also be smaller than 90 degrees. For the purposes of illustration only, the embodiments above are described in terms of rectangular electrochromic lites, however, non-rectangular shapes and other optical devices are meant to be included within the scope of the disclosed embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref> depicts top view schematics of a number of electrochromic lites of varying shapes and angled bus bar configurations. For example, an electrochromic window, <b>1200</b>, has a trapezoidal shape and two bus bars. A lower transparent electrode surface, <b>1205</b>, bears an angled bus bar, <b>1215</b>, while an upper transparent electrode, <b>1210</b>, has another angled bus bar, <b>1220</b>. In this example, bus bar <b>1215</b> has an angle larger than 90 degrees, while bus bar <b>1220</b> has an acute angle, less than 90 degrees. Depending upon the shape of the electrochromic lite, the bus bars may or may not be symmetrical or span the same length on each arm or have the same total length. As well, an electrochromic lite may have a combination of angled and non-angled bus bars. For example, triangular lite, <b>1225</b>, has an angled bus bar, <b>1240</b>, on a lower electrode <b>1230</b>, and a linear bus bar, <b>1245</b>, on an upper electrode, <b>1235</b>. In another example, triangular electrochromic lite, <b>1250</b>, has a single angled bus bar, <b>1265</b>, on a lower electrode, <b>1255</b>, while also having two angled bus bars, <b>1270</b>, on an upper electrode, <b>1260</b>. The shape and orientation of the bus bars will depend on the shape of the window, the switching and/or energy requirements of the device they power, and the like, e.g., in order to maximize efficient switching and/or powering, homogeneity in transitions, and to minimize hotspots. In another example, a hexagonal electrochromic lite, <b>1275</b>, has a first angled bus bar, <b>1286</b>, on a lower electrode, <b>1280</b>, and a second angled bus bar, <b>1287</b>, on an upper electrode, <b>1285</b>. In this example, angled bus bars <b>1286</b> and <b>1287</b> each have three angle features (vertices). In another example, a hexagonal electrochromic lite, <b>1290</b>, has six angled bus bars. On a lower electrode, <b>1292</b>, there are three angled bus bars, <b>1296</b>, and on an upper electrode, <b>1294</b>, there are also three angled bus bars, <b>1298</b>. Driving algorithms for electrochromic lites are described in more detail below, particularly, in relation to angled bus bars and devices having more than two bus bars.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Angled bus bars are described herein in terms of having at least a first arm and a second arm joined at a vertex, e.g., as depicted and described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref> (some examples in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref> illustrate that there may be more vertices and arms in certain embodiments). In certain embodiments, angled bus bars do not have a physical vertex. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref>, there are configurations that are equivalent, and therefore considered, angled bus bars for the purposes of this disclosure. For example, electrochromic device <b>1201</b> has associated bus bar arms, <b>1202</b> and <b>1203</b>, which are electrically connected via a wire <b>1204</b>. Wire <b>1204</b> could also be a thin strip of bus bar material or other suitable electrical connector. Although there is not a physical vertex per se, this assembly is an angled bus bar because there is a virtual vertex, that is, a theoretical point in space that is an intersection of two axes, each axis passing through the length of each bus bar arm. Likewise, similarly situated bus bar arms electrically connected by a wire, <b>1206</b>, at their distal ends would also be an angled bus bar. Note, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref>, the electrical source can be connected via the wire or other connector, or on one (or both) of the bus bar arms. In one embodiment, if the proximal ends of two bus bar arms are: 1) at some angle relative to each other as described herein for bus bar arms having a physical vertex, 2) within about 1 mm and about 100 mm of each other, 3) in electrical communication with each other, and 4) on the same conductive layer of a device, then they are, collectively, an angled bus bar. In another embodiment, if two bus bar arms: 1) each span about 10% to 90%, about 10% to 65%, or about 35% to 65% of the length of two sides of an electrochromic device area, 2) are at some angle relative to each other as described herein for bus bar arms having a physical vertex, 3) are in electrical communication with each other, and 4) are on the same conductive layer of a device, then they are, collectively, an angled bus bar. For the purposes of these definitions, &#x201c;electrical communication with each other&#x201d; does not include the electrical communication via the conductive layer on which the pair of bus bar arms reside.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In certain embodiments, the bus bar arms need not be in electrical communication with each other. For example, in one embodiment, if two bus bar arms: 1) each span about 10% to 90%, about 10% to 65%, or about 35% to 65% of the length of two sides of an electrochromic device area, 2) are at some angle relative to each other as described herein for bus bar arms having a physical vertex, 3) are on the same conductive layer of a device, and 4) are independently held at the same polarity, either a negative or a positive polarity, then they are, collectively, an angled bus bar. In another embodiment, if the proximal ends of two bus bar arms are: 1) at some angle relative to each other as described herein for bus bar arms having a physical vertex, 2) within about 1 mm and about 100 mm of each other, 3) are independently held at the same polarity, either a negative or a positive polarity, and 4) on the same conductive layer of a device, then they are, collectively, an angled bus bar. In these embodiments, is it useful, but not necessary, if the polarity applied to each of the angled bus bar's arms is similar in magnitude. These angled bus bars, although requiring more complex drive circuits, will transition the electrochromic device as those having a physical vertex or one having a virtual vertex and having the arms electrical communication with each other. The objectives of avoiding hotspots and improving optical transitions remains the same, and are met with appropriate configurations as described herein in relation to angled bus bars having physical vertices.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In some embodiments, bus bar configurations described herein may not develop hot spots in an optically switchable device while transitioning the optically switchable device between optical states. Further, the bus bar configurations described herein may be modified and/or combined, depending on the application. For example, in some embodiments, an optically switchable device may have the shape of a polygon, a trapezoid, or a shape with one region that substantially forms a corner with other regions having curved borders; bus bars may be disposed on the first and second conductive layers in a manner that substantially minimizes hot spots, substantially minimizes the curtain effect, and quickly transitions the optically switchable device between optical states.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In some embodiments, the lengths of the first bus bars along the edges of the first conductive layer and the lengths of the second bus bars along the edges of the second conductive layer are substantially maximized without developing hot spots in an optically switchable device between the first and second conductive layers. Substantially maximizing the lengths of the first and the second bus bars may aid in quickly transitioning the optically switchable device between optical states.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Generally, for fast switching between optical states of an optically switchable device, the first and the second bus bars should be as close to one another as possible, due to the inherent resistance of the conducting layers (e.g., the TCO) of the device. Having the first and the second bus bars close to each other, however, generates hot spots in the optically switchable device, as explained above. In some embodiments, the first and the second bus bars are configured such that distances between extremities of the first bus bar and portions of the second bus bar are substantially minimized to aid in quickly transitioning the optically switchable device without developing hot spots. Similarly, distances between extremities of the second bar and portions of the first bus bar are substantially minimized. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, a corner, A, of first bus bar <b>805</b> is an extremity of first bus bar <b>805</b>. It is a point of first bus bar <b>805</b> that is furthest away from any part of second bus bar <b>815</b>. The portions of second bus bar <b>815</b> that are closest to corner A of first bus bar <b>805</b> are ends, B and C, of arms <b>816</b> and <b>817</b>, respectively, of second bus bar <b>815</b>. Thus, to aid in quickly transitioning between optical states, the distance between corner A of first bus bar <b>805</b> and either end B or C of second bus bar <b>815</b> may be substantially minimized.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Methods of Changing Optical States</heading><p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows a flowchart depicting a method of changing an optical state of an optically switchable device. The method <b>1300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> describes changing an optical state of an optically switchable device that may be similar to the electrochromic lite <b>800</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> or the electrochromic lite <b>850</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>. That is, method <b>1300</b> describes changing an optical state of an optically switchable device disposed on a surface of a substrate and having a perimeter with at least one corner including a first side, a first vertex joining the first side and a second side, and the second side. Method <b>1300</b> may be used to transition any of the optically switchable devices including an angled bus bar disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Staring with operation <b>1305</b> of method <b>1300</b>, current and/or voltage of a first polarity is applied to a first bus bar affixed to the optically switchable device proximate to the corner. The first bus bar includes a first arm and a second arm having a configuration that substantially follows the shape of the first side, the first vertex, and the second side of the corner. For example, the first bus bar referred to in operation <b>1305</b> could be first bus bar <b>805</b> of electrochromic lite <b>800</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">At operation <b>1310</b>, current and/or voltage of a second polarity is applied to a second bus bar affixed to the optically switchable device. The second bus bar referred to in operation <b>1310</b> could be second bus bar <b>815</b> of electrochromic lite <b>800</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>. However, as described in operation <b>1310</b>, the second bus bar could have any number of different configurations, and is not necessarily an angled bus bar.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">At operation <b>1315</b>, in response to the current and/or voltage applied to the first and the second bus bars, an optical state of the optically switchable device switches such that the switching occurs throughout the optically switchable device substantially uniformly. In some embodiments, having at least one angled bus bar included in an optically switchable device may allow the optically switchable device to transition between optical states more uniformly than the planar, cylindrical, or perpendicular cylindrical bus bar configurations described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>7</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Having at least one angled bus bar included in an optically switchable device may also allow the optically switchable device to switch between optical states faster than the planar, cylindrical, or perpendicular cylindrical bus bar configurations. For example, in some embodiments, switching the optical state of the optically switchable device from a first optical state to a second optical state is performed in about 10 minutes or less. Of course, the switching may depend on a number of factors, e.g., the area of the electrochromic device, the sheet resistance of the conductor layers, etc.; however, in one embodiment, the 10 minute or less switching speed applies to an optically switchable device having an area of between about 1 square foot (0.09 m<sup>2</sup>) and about 60 square feet (5.57 m<sup>2</sup>), in another embodiment between about 6 square feet (0.56 m<sup>2</sup>) and about 30 square feet (2.79 m<sup>2</sup>), and in yet another embodiment, between about 10 square feet (0.93 m<sup>2</sup>) and about 20 square feet (1.86 m<sup>2</sup>). Further, having at least one angled bus bar included in an optically switchable device may allow the optically switchable device to switch between optical states without developing hot spots in the optically switchable device. For example, switching the optical state of the optically switchable device may be performed such that the current and/or the voltage applied across the optically switchable device does not damage the optically switchable device.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">When more than two bus bars are configured on a device, one embodiment includes a driving algorithm that drives successive pairs of bus bars. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, electrochromic lite <b>1290</b>, a driving algorithm may include powering opposing pairs of bus bars <b>1296</b> and <b>1298</b>, serially, e.g., in a clockwise, counter clockwise, or random manner, rather than energizing all the bus bars at simultaneously. In another example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, bus bars on opposing corners of the EC device may be powered as pairs, serially, where only two bus bars are energized at any single moment in time. Using this driving algorithm, hot spots can be further avoided, and, because only opposing single pairs of bus bars are energized at any one time, the ends of the bus bars can be closer to each other, even overlapping (i.e., running parallel, side by side but on different electrodes) because only opposing pairs are energized in any single moment in time. Opposing pairs need not be used; the bus bar pairs may include adjacent bus bars, e.g., those described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, where the ends of the bus bars are spaced appropriately to avoid hot spots.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Methods of Fabrication</heading><p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> shows a flowchart depicting a method of fabricating an optically switchable device.

No. 12/772,055, filed Apr. 30, 2010, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/772,075, filed Apr. 30, 2010, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/814,277, filed Jun. 11, 2010, U.S. patent application Ser.

Prior to deposition, a laser isolation scribe (L1), penetrating the fluorinated tin oxide layer, was formed along the entire length of one of the 26&#x2033; sides of the substrate, approximately &#x215d;&#x2033; in from the glass edge. After the EC device coating was deposited, two laser scribes (L2) were formed, down to the glass, one each along the 30&#x2033; sides of the lite, each scribe &#x215d;&#x2033; from the glass edge. Another laser scribe (L3), parallel to L1, was formed along the other 26&#x2033; side opposite L1 and &#x215d;&#x2033; from glass edge. Between the L1 and the nearest parallel glass edge, an ultrasonic soldered bus bar was fabricated approximately the length of the edge to give a conductive path to the top conductive layer with isolation from the bottom conductive layer due to the L1 scribe. Similarly, a soldered bus bar was placed between the L3 and the nearest parallel glass edge to allow for a conductive path to the bottom conductive layer with isolation from the top conductive layer due to the L3 scribe. This yielded a 26&#x2033;&#xd7;30&#x2033; lite with an active area of 24&#xbe;&#x2033;&#xd7;28&#xbe;&#x2033; and a planar bus bar configuration (two parallel bus bars running along opposite edges of the lite).</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">The device was then run through a full coloration and bleaching cycle using a combined technique of cyclic voltammetry-chronocoulometry (CVCC). During cycling, the device was monitored near the center of the active area (plot <b>1505</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>) midway between the L1 and L3 scribes with a light source/detector pair. An edge of the device was monitored (plot <b>1510</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>) with this configuration as well. The center is the area seen to switch slowest on an electrochromic device with the aforementioned construction. This is due to the current drop off across the device due to the sheet resistance of the transparent electrode layers. The instrumentation used for measurement was an Ocean Optics Tungsten Halogen source and ThorLabs amplified silicon detector.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">The device was also probed for voltage against the voltage of the bus bar connected to the lower transparent electrode, in a 9 location grid (3&#xd7;3 matrix) on the active area of the device, as shown in the graphs in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>A</figref>.

This bus bar was extended with solder that extended approximately halfway across the 30&#x2033; edge of the lite (extension <b>1625</b> of bus bar <b>1605</b>)</p><p id="p-0127" num="0135">The bus bar electrically connected to the top transparent conducting layer was not extended as described above, but rather replaced by a similar L-shaped bus bar that extended down the L1 side of the lite, just inside the old bus bar, and halfway across the 30&#x2033; side of the lite, opposite the leg of the first L-shaped bus bar and adjacent to the L2 scribe (extension <b>1630</b> of bus bar <b>1610</b>). This bus bar was constructed of copper tape, as ultrasonic solder here would result in an undesirable shunt in the active area of the device. This is because this bus bar resides inside the first bus bar, on the device side of the L1 isolation scribe, and therefore must not penetrate the device stack.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0136">The device was monitored in the same manner at the same locations described in the setup above. That is, the device was run through a full coloration and bleaching cycle using a combined technique of CVCC. During cycling, the device was monitored near the center of the active area (plot <b>1515</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>) midway between the L1 and L3 scribes with a light source/detector pair. An edge of the device was monitored (plot <b>1520</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>), with this configuration as well. The device was also probed for voltage against the voltage of the bus bar connected to the lower transparent electrode, in a 9 location grid (3&#xd7;3 matrix) on the active area of the device, as shown in the graphs in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>A</figref>. The dotted lines in the graphs are the results of these tests, plotted as voltage versus time. Again, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>B</figref> shows an enlarged view of the graph from the upper left hand corner (i.e., graph <b>1615</b>), for reference.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0137">The L-shaped bus bar configuration significantly improved coloration and bleaching time across the device. One common metric for characterizing switching speed of an electrochromic device is t<sub>80%</sub>, or time for the device to reach 80% of its coloration in optical density (OD). For the planar bus bar arrangement, the center and edge t<sub>80% </sub>were 38.5 minutes and 22.2 minutes, respectively. With the L-shaped bus bars, the times decreased to 21.5 minutes and 11.5 minutes, respectively, with the larger percent increase occurring at the edge. Moreover, the device range increased and became more uniform with the improved bus bar configuration. Center OD range increased from 1.07 to 1.26 and edge OD range went from 1.08 to 1.35. The improved coloration can be seen in the I-V curve of the CVCC test (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>) which is a good proxy for measuring switching performance. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, the device's leakage current changed minimally, while the peak current increased by a factor of about 1.4; plot <b>1705</b> is the current density with the planar bus bars, and plot <b>1710</b> is the current density with the L-shaped bus bars. The greater increase in peak current density signifies an improvement in ion movement and hence faster coloration. The voltage profile (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>A</figref>) as measured across the device showed improvement in all locations. Voltages switched the device not only faster, but with a larger, more uniform range.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0138">Although the foregoing embodiments have been described in some detail to facilitate understanding, the described embodiments are to be considered illustrative and not limiting.
