Other alternative or equivalent rare metals may also be used.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The bond coating <b>12</b> may be metallurgically fused to the substrate <b>14</b> by, for example, one or more of chemical vapour deposition, molten salt electrodeposition, and fusion welding. Other alternative or equivalent techniques for metallurgically fusing the bond coating <b>12</b> to the substrate <b>14</b> may also be used. The microstructure of the bond coating <b>12</b> may be fully dense, or substantially fully dense, with no void space or cracks, or substantially no void space or cracks, creating a uniform, coherent and hermetic (or sealing) coating layer on the underlying substrate <b>14</b>. The full density (ie, 0% porosity), or substantially full density (ie, &#x2dc;0% porosity), of the bond coating <b>12</b> may be achieved by selectively controlling the process conditions of the above techniques for applying the bond coating <b>12</b> to the underlying substrate <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The top coating <b>16</b> may comprise one or more metal oxides, or one or more metal carbides. The one or more metal oxides may, for example, be selected from the group consisting of titanium oxide (TiOx), chromium oxide (CrOx), silicon oxide (SiOx), and titanium oxide-chromium oxide (TiOx-CrOx). Alternatively, the one or more metal carbides may, for example, be selected from the group consisting of tungsten carbide (WC), chrome carbide (CrC), and chrome carbide-tungsten carbide (CrC&#x2014;WC). Other alternative or equivalent wear and erosion resistant top coatings may also be used.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">For example, the top coating <b>16</b> may comprise selected nanocomposite coatings comprising nanostructured materials combined with a matrix of a metal or metal alloy that provides improved wear and erosion resistance. Examples of suitable nanocomposites in a metal carbide or metal oxide matrix may include: tungsten-carbide (WC) nanometer size grains in a tungsten-carbide-cobalt (WC&#x2014;Co) matrix; aluminium-silicon nanometer size grains and carbon nanotubes in an aluminum-silicon (Al&#x2014;Si) alloy matrix; and carbon nanotubes in an aluminum-oxide (Al2O3) matrix/micrometer size powder particles.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The top coating <b>16</b> may be mechanically bonded to the bond coating by thermal spraying of one or both of nanometer and micrometer size particles. The thermal spraying may, for example, comprise one or more thermal spraying techniques selected from combustion, electrical discharge, cold spraying, and laser. Examples of such techniques include powder flame spraying, atmospheric plasma spraying APS, and high velocity oxygen fuel spraying (HVOF). For example, in the case of nanometer size particles, they may be sprayed by solution or suspension plasma-spraying. Other alternative or equivalent thermal spray techniques may also be used.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The top coating <b>16</b> may be densified after mechanical bonding to the bond coating <b>12</b>. For example, the top coating <b>16</b> may be densified by, for example, applying a sealant onto the thermal spray surface to fill pores and cracks in order to make the top coating <b>16</b> more dense. Other alternative or equivalent densification techniques may also be used.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The bond coating <b>12</b> may, for example, have a thickness of 5 to 100 &#x3bc;m, for example, 30 to 70 &#x3bc;m. The top coating <b>16</b> may, for example, have a thickness of 100 to 900 &#x3bc;m, for example, 200 to 750 &#x3bc;m. The top coating <b>16</b> may, for example, have a bond or shear strength of greater than or equal to 6,000 PSI, and a hardness of greater than or equal to 700 HV0.5.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In use, the bond coating <b>12</b> may at least partially provide corrosion resistance to the substrate <b>14</b>, and the top coating <b>16</b> may at least partially provide wear and erosion resistance to the bond coating <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The metal component may, for example, be used in an industrial process, such as but not limited to, an autoclave process, such as but not limited to HPAL or POX. The metal component may, for example, comprise a valve component. It will be appreciated, however, that embodiments of the invention are not limited to metal components, such as valve components used in autoclave processes, but may be alternatively implemented to coat any and all metal components used in any and all industrial processes that require increased resistance against corrosion, wear, and erosion.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The following Example is intended to illustrate the invention.

The bi-layer coated valve trim was then trialed in a ball valve used in the same industrial process as the prior art single oxide coated valve trim described above. The bi-layer coated valve trim was subjected to the same extreme service conditions as the prior art single oxide coated valve trim described above. The bi-layer coated valve trim was removed after 310 days in-line for post-service inspection to evaluate the success of the trial, and to compare the service performance of the bi-layer coated valve trim with the prior art single oxide coated valve trim described above. Post-service inspections of the bi-layer coated parts were then conducted as follows.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref> are photographs of post-service inspections of opposite sides of the ball coated with the bi-layer coating of the present invention.
