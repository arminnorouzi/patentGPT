Neutrophils can be activated by a variety of initiating factors, including chemokine release from platelets or endothelial cells, interactions with bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Targeted drug delivery and imaging contrast focused on neutrophils may be an attractive route for nanomedicines designed for treatment and diagnosis of acute inflammatory disorders.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Activated neutrophils are particularly important in the etiology of lung disease culminating in acute respiratory distress (ARDS), a disease affecting &#x2dc;200,000 American patients per year with a &#x2dc;35-50% mortality rate. Neutrophils are retained in the lungs at high concentrations under na&#xef;ve conditions, but adhere to the lung vasculature even more avidly after acute systemic inflammatory insult. In ARDS, systemic or pulmonary inflammation results in extravasation of activated neutrophils in the lung vasculature, leading to disruption of the endothelial barrier and accumulation of neutrophils and edematous fluid in the air space of the lungs.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Focusing treatment or diagnostic strategies on neutrophils remains an open problem. Antibodies against markers such as Ly6G can achieve targeting to neutrophils, but also dramatically affect neutrophil function. Therefore, antibody targeting strategies have not been widely adopted for targeted drug delivery to neutrophils. Two previous studies noted that activated neutrophils take up denatured and agglutinated bovine albumin, concluding that denatured protein was the critical factor in the neutrophil-particle interactions.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Indeed, nanoparticle structure and composition can affect biodistribution and targeting behaviors, competing with and even superseding targeting functions defined by engineered surface chemistries (e.g., antibody functionalization). Shape, size, deformability, and zeta potential have been cited as engineering parameters that help define pharmacokinetics and immune interactions of nanoparticle drug carriers. Engineering of nanoparticle structure, rather than engineering of antibody- or peptide-based surface chemistry, shapes the in vivo behavior of translational nanomedicines like Abraxane, Doxil, and Onpattro.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A continuing need in the art exists for new and effective tools and methods for targeting leukocytes, including neutrophils.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The needs of the art are met in the methods and compositions disclosed herein.

The compositions and methods are useful in treating acute inflammatory conditions, including lung injury and the like. As demonstrated herein, nanoparticle structural properties that shape interactions with neutrophils in the setting of acute inflammation were studied. Due to the key role of neutrophils in lung physiology and the pathology of acute lung disease (noted above for its broad clinical impact) and the high concentration of neutrophils in the lung vasculature, the localization of nanoparticles to the lung vasculature in LPS injury models was of particular interest in the studies described.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Provided herein, in one aspect, is a composition comprising a nanoparticle and a D20 tag. The nanoparticle is covalently attached to the D20 tag. By &#x201c;nanoparticle&#x201d; (also referred to as &#x201c;nanocarrier&#x201d; or &#x201c;NP&#x201d;) as used herein is meant a particle having diameter of between 1 to 1000 nm. The terms nanoparticle, nanocarrier, liposome, and LNP may be used interchangeably. In one embodiment the NP is globular. Inclusive in this definition are particles with a diameter of at least 1, at least 20, at least 40, at least 60, at least 80, at least 100, at least 120, at least 140, at least 160, at least 180, at least 200, at least 220, at least 240, at least 260, at least 280, at least 300 nm in diameter. In other embodiments, also included are particles having diameters of at least 320, at least 340, at least 360, at least 380, at least 400, at least 420, at least 440, at least 460, at least 480, at least 500, at least 520, at least 540, at least 560, at least 580, at least 600, at least 620, at least 640, at least 660, at least 680, at least 700 nm.

All numbers and fractions between any two of these numbers are also included.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In one aspect, the nanoparticle employed herein is a liposome. By &#x201c;liposome&#x201d; as used herein is meant a microscopic spherical particle formed by a lipid bilayer enclosing an aqueous compartment. Liposomes can be created from cholesterol and natural non-toxic phospholipids. Due to their size and hydrophobic and hydrophilic character, liposomes are promising systems for drug delivery. Liposome properties differ considerably with lipid composition, surface charge, size, and the method of preparation. Furthermore, the choice of bilayer components determines the &#x2018;rigidity&#x2019; or &#x2018;fluidity&#x2019; and the charge of the bilayer. For instance, unsaturated phosphatidylcholine species from natural sources (egg or soybean phosphatidylcholine) give much more permeable and less stable bilayers, whereas the saturated phospholipids with long acyl chains (for example, dipalmitoylphos phatidylcholine) form a rigid, rather impermeable bilayer structure. Liposomes useful herein can be prepared using techniques known in the art. See, Akbarzadeh et al, Nanoscale Res Lett. February 2013; 8 (1):102, which is incorporated herein by reference. In one embodiment, the liposome comprises cholesterol. It has been observed that the amount of cholesterol in the liposome composition can affect the delivery of the liposome. Thus, the amount of cholesterol may be varied. In one embodiment the amount of cholesterol in the liposome is about 10 to 50% by lipid film composition. In one embodiment, the cholesterol content of the liposome is at about 25% (moles cholesterol/total moles of lipid). In one embodiment, the cholesterol content of the liposome is about 40% (moles cholesterol/total moles of lipid). In one embodiment, the cholesterol content of the liposome is at least 25% (moles cholesterol/total moles of lipid). In one embodiment, the cholesterol content of the liposome is at least 40% (moles cholesterol/total moles of lipid).

For example, the D20-tagged nanoparticles may be radiolabeled with the clinically-approved isotope indium-111. Other radioisotopes that may be used include Technetium-99m (technetium-99m), Iodine-123 and 131, Thallium-201, Gallium-67, and Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The selected nanoparticle may be loaded with a suitable drug or multiple drugs generally by incubation at about 37&#xb0; C. in a buffer. Desirable buffers are those that are physiologocally-compatible, such as phosphate buffered saline or the like. Other methods for drug loading include osmotic loading of a variety of small molecule drugs in the nanoparticles, allowing burst release of loaded drugs in targeted vascular beds. Drug loading and release from nanogels on RBCs may be modified by using crosslinkers incorporated in the nanogel to prolong or enhance encapsulation of loaded drugs and performing the crosslinking after drug loading. Crosslinkers can include responsive moieties (e.g. enzyme-cleavable crosslinkers that allow stimulated drug release in response to protease activity).

Other useful antibodies include those targeted to leukocytes (e.g., anti-CD45, -Ly6G, etc); to platelets; or to clots (e.g., antibodies binding to fibrin). In one embodiment, when an antibody is used as the protein comprised in the D20 tag, the antibody used for targeting is different. In another embodiment, the antibody used in the D20 tag and for targeting target the same cell type.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Also provided herein in another aspect is a method of generating a D20-tagged nanoparticle. In one embodiment, the selected nanoparticle (e.g., liposome) is functionalized using NHS-ester conjugation of an excess of strained alkyne (dibenzocyclooctyne, DBCO) to the selected protein (e.g., IgG), followed by reaction of the DBCO-functionalized IgG with liposomes containing PEG-azide-terminated lipids (DBCO-IgG liposomes, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>). Various DBCO to protein ratios can be utilized, with higher ratios resulting in higher levels of DBCO present on the protein molecule. As noted herein, higher levels of DBCO on the protein molecule are desirable for targeting neutrophils. In one embodiment, the DBCO is reacted with the protein at at least a 5:1 molar ratio. In another embodiment, the DBCO is reacted with the protein at at least an 8:1 molar ratio. In another embodiment, the DBCO is reacted with the protein at at least a 10:1 molar ratio. In another embodiment, the DBCO is reacted with the protein at at least an 12:1 molar ratio. In another embodiment, the DBCO is reacted with the protein at at least a 15:1 molar ratio.

In certain embodiments, the method of generating a nanoparticle includes contacting the nanoparticle with one or more complement proteins (e.g. diluted in a suspension with nanoparticles). Complement proteins include, e.g., C1, C4, C2, C3, C5, C6, C7, C8, and C9, and fragments thereof, including cleavage products (e.g., C4 is cleaved to C4b) (see Ling, M., &#x26; Murali, M. (2019). Analysis of the Complement System in the Clinical Immunology Laboratory. Clin Lab Med. 2019 December; 39 (4):579-590, which is incorporated herein by reference). In certain embodiments, following an incubation period the nanoparticles are isolated from the suspension or undergo washing to remove serum or complement proteins and/or to concentrate the nanoparticles in a solution. In certain embodiments, the method of generating a nanoparticle includes a dialysis step and/or centrifugation to wash and/or concentrate the nanoparticles in a solution.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In another aspect, provided herein are methods of treating lung injury in a subject in need thereof. The method includes administering D20-tagged nanoparticles to a subject in need thereof. By &#x201c;subject&#x201d; is meant primarily a human, but also domestic animals, e.g., dogs, cats; and livestock, such as cattle, pigs, etc.; common laboratory mammals, such as primates, rabbits, and rodents; and pest or wild animals, such as deer, rodents, rabbits, squirrels, etc. In one embodiment, the nanoparticles are used to treat pneumonia. In another embodiment, the nanoparticles are used to treat sepsis.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In certain embodiments, the nanoparticles are used to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is an acute, diffuse, inflammatory lung injury with a variety of causes, most commonly pneumonia and sepsis. ARDS causes the lungs' air sacs, called alveoli, to fill up with proteinaceous liquid, preventing the lungs from oxygenating the blood. The impact of ARDS is enormous, with 190,000 US cases per year, and a mortality rate of 35%. Decades of research have yielded myriad drug targets, but after the failure of more than a dozen large clinical trials, there are still no FDA approved drugs that improve survival in ARDS. From a pharmacology perspective, there are three reasons why many rationally chosen drugs have failed in ARDS. Firstly, ARDS patients are too fragile to tolerate drug side effects. These patients have multi-organ dysfunction, and thus cannot tolerate even mild side effects. Secondly, the inhalational route of delivery, useful for so many pulmonary problems, has limited benefit in ARDS, as the flooded alveoli (those filled with liquid) are covered by a column of fluid, which means that topical delivery to the alveoli is not possible via the inhaled route. Finally, ARDS is a very heterogeneous disease, so targeting a single pathway is unlikely to be sufficient.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In another aspect, provided herein are methods of treating inflammation or treating an inflamed tissue. The method includes administering D20-tagged nanoparticles to a subject in need thereof. The inflammation may be attributable, e.g., to an inflammatory disorder and/or infection in the subject. In certain embodiments, method of treating subacute or acute inflammation in an inflame tissue are provided.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">As demonstrated herein, when the D20 tag is conjugated onto translatable nanocarriers such as liposomes, the liposomes accumulate in inflamed, but not na&#xef;ve, lungs at &#x2dc;20% of the injected dose (% ID), which is a level of targeting similar to the previous best tag for driving liposomes into the lungs, anti-PECAM antibodies. Notably, the lungs contain the majority of the body's marginated neutrophils in sepsis, ARDS, and pneumonia. Further, the D20-tagged liposomes described herein are effective to decrease ARDS phenotype, even without drugs loaded in the nanoparticles. Thus, in one embodiment, D20-tagged nanoparticles are administered to a patient having, or suspected of having ARDS.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In another embodiment, it is desirable to incorporate drugs that will concentrate in the affected microvasculature into the D20-tagged nanoparticles. For example, for sepsis, D20-tagged liposomes are loaded with drugs that limit neutrophil damage (inhibitors of neutrophil elastase, NETosis, etc) all of which exist but barely reach neutrophils before being cleared using current therapies. Thus, in another embodiment, an ARDS-treating drug is loaded into the nanoparticles prior to administration to the patient. In another embodiment, a sepsis-treating drug is loaded into the nanoparticles prior to administration to the patient. In another embodiment, a pneumonia-treating drug is loaded into the nanoparticles prior to administration to the patient. Such drugs are known in the art, and include, without limitation, ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers; e.g., losartan), aspirin, beta-adrenergic agonists (e.g., salmeterol, albuterol, formoterol), corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, methylprednisilone), dexmedetomidine, GSK205, imatinib, inhaled nitric oxide, ketoconazole, LTRAs (leukotriene receptor antagonists; e.g., zileuton), macrolides (azithromycin, etc), methylnaltrexone, MJ33, N-acetylcysteine, NSAIDs (ibuprofen and related), pentoxifylline, roflumilast, ropivacaine, S1P-receptor agonists (fingolimod, etc), sivelestat, SSRIs (fluoxetine, etc), statins (simvastatin, etc), thiazolidinedione (rosiglitazone, etc), vitamin C, and vitamin D.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In one embodiment of the method, vascular permeability is decreased as compared to a control as a result of the treatment. In another embodiment, protein leakage in the alveoli is decreased as a result of the treatment. In yet another embodiment, cellular infiltration in the alveoli is decreased as a result of the treatment.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In another aspect, a method of targeting leukocytes is provided. The method includes administering the D20-tagged nanoparticles as described herein. The desired target of the nanoparticles can be any leukocyte, including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, eosinophils, basophils, NK cells, lymphocytes, dendritic cells. In one embodiment, the leukocytes are marginated leukocytes. The delivery of nanoparticles with tropism for neutrophils can result in enhanced uptake of the nanoparticles by neutrophils, which then leave the lung vasculature or an inflamed tissue. In this manner, injury or inflammation can be alleviate by decreasing the number and/or concentration of neutrophils. In certain embodiments, a method of targeting and depleting neutrophils in the lung vasculature is provided. In certain embodiments, a method of targeting and depleting neutrophils in an inflamed tissue is provided.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In certain embodiments, vascular permeability in an inflamed tissue is reduced as compared to a control as a result of treatment. In certain embodiments, protein leakage in the inflamed tissue is reduced as a result of treatment. In certain embodiments, cellular infiltration in the inflamed tissue is reduced as a result of treatment. In certain embodiments, the concentration and/or number of neutrophils in the inflamed tissue and/or tissue vasculature is reduced as a result of treatment.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In another aspect, a method of diagnosing a condition associated with lung injury is provided. The condition associated with lung injury is, in one embodiment, on that results in, or has as a symptom of, marginated leukocytes. Marginated leukocytes are those white blood cells that accumulate inside the vasculature of affected organs, directly in contact with the inner wall of the blood vessels (predominantly capillaries) (See, e.g., Hogg, J. C. Physiol. Rev. 67, 1249-1295 (1987); Doerschuk, C. M. et al. J. Appl. Physiol. 63, 1806-1815 (1987); and Kuebler, W. M. &#x26; Goetz, A. E. Eur. Surg. Res. 34, 92-100 (2002), which are incorporated herein by reference). Marginated leukocytes (especially marginated neutrophils) massively increase their numbers during sepsis, ARDS, and pneumonia, and have a major role in these diseases (See, e.g., Brown, K. A. et al. Lancet 368, 157-169 (2006) and Stiel, L., Meziani, F. &#x26; Helms, J. Shock 49, 371-384 (2018), which are incorporated herein by reference). The marginated neutrophils clog the microvasculature, release toxic mediators such as proteases and reactive oxygen species, produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, and induce clotting and further inflammation by releasing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) (See, e.g., Brown, K. A. et al. Lancet 368, 157-169 (2006) and Lelubre, C. &#x26; Vincent, J.-L. Nat. Rev. Nephrol. 14, 417-427 (2018), which are incorporated herein by reference). All of these marginated leukocyte functions lead to organ dysfunction. Thus, technologies to identify the presence of marginated neutrophils and modulate their activity serve as major new diagnostics and therapeutics for sepsis, ARDS, and pneumonia.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In certain embodiments, radiolabeled D20-tagged liposomes are administered to a patient suspected of having a condition associated with marginated leukocytes. In one embodiment, the radiolabel is the clinically-approved isotope indium-111. If an increase of indium-111 signal in the chest (due to abundant marginated neutrophils in the lungs in the disease of interest) is observed, the subject has a disease associated with marginated leukocytes, such as ARDS, sepsis, or pneumonia. In one embodiment, the subject is then treated for said condition using one or more of the drugs mentioned herein or known in the art. In another embodiment, additional testing is performed, to aid in the diagnosis. For example, in one embodiment, a chest X-ray is performed to determine whether there is water-density material in the airspaces. By correlating the X-ray opacities with the presence of increased D20-In-111 signal, a diagnosis of a disease associated with marginated leukocytes, such as ARDS, sepsis, or pneumonia is made.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Administration of the nanoparticle compositions described herein can be intravenously for delivery of the drug to the lungs. For example, where the disease is ARDS, pneumonia, or sepsis, the compositions may be administered intravenously. For administration to any other organ or tissue, the composition may be administered intravenously or intra-arterially immediately upstream of an organ for delivery of effective doses of the drug.

Due to the key role of neutrophils in lung physiology and the pathology of acute lung disease (noted above for its broad clinical impact) and the high concentration of neutrophils in the lung vasculature, we focused on the localization of nanoparticles to the lung vasculature in LPS injury models. After verifying the intravascular presence of activated neutrophils in mouse lungs subjected to LPS-induced inflammation, we showed that two nanoparticles, lysozyme-dextran nanogels and crosslinked albumin nanoparticles, selectively home to neutrophils in inflamed lungs, but not na&#xef;ve lungs.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In tracing the biodistributions of 23 different nanoparticles in na&#xef;ve mice and in mice subjected to model sepsis, we observed that a diverse range of protein-based nanostructures avidly localize to acutely inflamed lungs, but not na&#xef;ve lungs. We showed that 13 amorphous protein nanostructures, defined by hydrophobic protein interactions, NHS-ester protein crosslinking, and association of charged proteins, have specificity for LPS-injured lungs. Conversely, we demonstrated that three crystalline protein nanostructures, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, and ferritin, have biodistributions unaffected by LPS injury. We also showed that polystyrene nanoparticles and five liposome formulations do not have specificity for injured lungs, indicating that nanostructures not based on protein are not intrinsically drawn to pulmonary neutrophils in acute inflammation. Finally, we demonstrated that liposomes can be engineered for affinity to neutrophils in LPS-injured lungs by coating with IgG densely modified with a hydrophobic cyclooctyne tag.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Towards demonstrating translational applicability of this structure-based targeting mechanism, we applied our neutrophil-specific nanoparticles in diagnostic imaging experiments, characterization of therapeutic effects in model ARDS, and targeting to ex vivo human lungs rejected for donation due to injury. Specifically, we showed a) that lysozyme-dextran nanogels have capacity for diagnostic imaging contrast (SPECT-CT) that distinguishes acute inflammatory lung injury from cardiogenic edema; b) that liposomes modified for neutrophil affinity can ameliorate the neutrophil-mediated effects of model ARDS; and c) that lysozyme-dextran nanogels, but not ferritin nanocages, have affinity for leukocytes resident in excised human lungs rejected for transplant due to injury.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Taken together, our results show that a broad range of protein-based nanostructures may comprise agents with intrinsic ability to target neutrophils in acute inflammation.

However, LDNGs had increased hydrophobic accessibility vs. native lysozyme and albumin NPs had reduced hydrophobic accessibility vs. native albumin.

Among other protein NPs, we record LPS:na&#xef;ve lung uptake ratios of 18.88 for human albumin nanorods, 9.90 for bovine albumin NPs, 3.00 for human hemoglobin NPs, and 2.97 for human transferrin NPs. Therefore, acute inflammatory injury resulted in a minimum three-fold increase in lung uptake for all examined crosslinked protein nanoparticles, excluding crosslinked lysozyme, which still accumulated in injured lungs at 25.64% of initial dose.

In this manner, the D20-tagged liposomes act as decoys, and marginated neutrophils take up D20-tagged liposomes and leave the lung and migrate to the spleen, where they are known to undergo apoptosis (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b>I</figref>).
