Non-invasive methods have most potential for simultaneously improving basic water relations research and ground-, flight- and space-based sensing of water status, with applications in sustainability, food security and conservation. The most frequently used methods to measure the most salient proxies of plant water status, i.e., water mass per leaf area (WMA), relative water content (RWC), and leaf water potential (LP require the excision of tissues and lab analysis, and have thus been limited to relatively low throughput and small study scales.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Water within a plant absorbs electromagnetic radiation across the visible, infrared, and terahertz wavelengths distinctly from other structural plant components. (See e.g., Jones (2014) (cited above); and Knipling, (1970) Physical and physiological basis for the reflectance of visible and near-infrared radiation from vegetation. Remote Sensing of Environment 1: 155-159; the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.) Accordingly, many studies have shown correlations of radiation variables with leaf water status variables at the scale of individual leaves, whole plants and forest stands. (See e.g., Rapaport et al., (2017) The potential of the spectral &#x2018;water balance index&#x2019; (WABI) for crop irrigation scheduling. New Phytologist 216: 741-757; Cotrozzi et al., (2017) Using foliar spectral properties to assess the effects of drought on plant water potential. Tree Physiology 37: 1582-1591; Rapaport et al., (2015) Combining leaf physiology, hyperspectral imaging and partial least squares-regression (PLS-R) for grapevine water status assessment. ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing 109: 88-97; Sancho-Knapik et al., (2011) Microwave I-band (1730 MHz) accurately estimates the relative water content in poplar leaves. A comparison with a near infrared water index (R1300/R1450). Agricultural and Forest Meteorology 151: 827-832; Claudio et al., (2006) Monitoring drought effects on vegetation water content and fluxes in chaparral with the 970 nm water band index. Remote Sensing of Environment 103: 304-311; Penuelas and Inoue, (1999) Reflectance indices indicative of changes in water and pigment contents of peanut and wheat leaves. Photosynthetica 36: 355-360; Penuelas et al., (1993) The reflectance at the 950-970 nm region as an indicator of plant water status. International Journal of Remote Sensing 14: 1887-1905; Danson et al., (1992) High-spectral resolution data for determining leaf water content. International Journal of Remote Sensing 13: 461-470; Hunt and Rock, (1989) Detection of changes in leaf water content using near-and middle-Infrared reflectances.

Remote sensing of environment 22: 429-435; the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.) The power of these approaches at large scales is shown by the use of airborne hyperspectral or microwave data to detect canopy water content across large forest ranges. (See e.g., Rao et al., (2019) Satellite-based vegetation optical depth as an indicator of drought-driven tree mortality. Remote Sensing of Environment 227: 125-136; and Asner et al., (2016) Progressive forest canopy water loss during the 2012-2015 California drought. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 113: E249-E255; the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.) Yet, heretofore, the bulk of studies have focused on statistical correlations of water status variables across well hydrated and strongly dehydrated leaves, without clear resolution considering for mildly to moderately dehydrated leaves. Thus, further development is needed to sense WMA, RWC and &#x3a8;<sub>leaf </sub>in mild and moderately dehydrated leaves, i.e., in the important range of leaf dehydration for the control of gas exchange, between full turgor and turgor loss point as well as at stronger levels of dehydration below turgor loss point. (See e.g., Trueba et al., (2019) Thresholds for leaf damage due to dehydration: declines of hydraulic function, stomatal conductance and cellular integrity precede those for photochemistry. New Phytologist 223: 134-49; and Bartlett et al., (2016) The correlations and sequence of plant stomatal, hydraulic, and wilting responses to drought.

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0061" num="0054">The embodiments of the invention described herein are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to precise forms disclosed. Rather, the embodiments selected for description have been chosen to enable one skilled in the art to practice the invention.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0055">Turning to the data and drawings, systems and methods are provided which utilize THz illumination to detect water status in plants. In many embodiments, assessment of multiple measurements at terahertz frequencies is used to provide a determination of water status variables, including water mass per leaf area (WMA), relative water content (RWC), and leaf water potential (&#x3a8;<sub>leaf</sub>). Many embodiments described herein use a THz-TDS system to characterize the terahertz transmission peak field ratio (PFR) for leaves at various hydration states (e.g., various levels of dehydration), thus determining key water status variables (e.g., WMA, RWC, and &#x3a8;<sub>leaf</sub>). In particular, many embodiments use terahertz radiation for the determination of WMA, RWC and &#x3a8;<sub>leaf </sub>during mild, moderate and severe leaf dehydration. Numerous embodiments allow for the determination of water status for leaves of a single species and/or across multiple species using physical relationships.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0056">Understanding plant responses to water is increasingly urgent given drought-induced losses in crop productivity and tree mortality in many ecosystems worldwide. (See e.g., Allen et al., (2010) A global overview of drought and heat-induced tree mortality reveals emerging climate change risks for forests. Forest Ecology and Management 259: 660-684; and IPCC, (2014) Climate change 2014: synthesis report. Contribution of working groups I, II and III to the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change, Ed 5. IPCC, Geneva, Switzerland; the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.) Improving the capacity to determine tissue water status at organ, whole plant, canopy and regional scales is necessary to resolve the drought responses and water requirements of crop and wild species, for food security and agricultural and urban sustainability of water use.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0057">The most salient metrics of leaf water status at leaf scale are water mass per leaf area (WMA; numerically equal to the &#x201c;leaf equivalent water thickness&#x201d;), relative water content (RWC) and leaf water potential (&#x3a8;<sub>leaf</sub>). (See e.g., Tucker (1980) Remote sensing of leaf water content in the near infrared. Remote sensing of Environment 10: 23-32; Hunt and Rock (1989) Detection of changes in leaf water content using near-and middle-Infrared reflectances. Remote Sensing of Environment 30: 43-54; and Jones (2014) Plants and Microclimate, 3rd ed. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom; the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.) These indices are correlated for a given dehydrating leaf, and provide different information. Whereas WMA represents the absolute tissue water content normalized by leaf area, RWC, normalized by the saturated water content, also provides information of cell volume shrinkage and thereby captures more specifically the plant-experienced water stress. (See e.g., Sack et al., (2018) ABA accumulation in dehydrating leaves is associated with decline in cell volume, not turgor pressure. Plant Physiology 176: 489-495; the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.) Even more mechanistic insight is provided by &#x3a8;<sub>leaf</sub>, which enables quantification of the balance of osmotic and turgor pressures, and represents the driving force for water movement, enabling estimation of hydraulic conductances. (See e.g., Scoffoni et al., (2018) The causes of leaf hydraulic vulnerability and its influence on gas exchange in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Plant Physiology: pp. 00743.02018; Bartlett et al., (2012) The determinants of leaf turgor loss point and prediction of drought tolerance of species and biomes: a global meta-analysis: Drivers of plant drought tolerance. Ecology Letters 15: 393-405; and Scoffoni et al., (2012) Dynamics of leaf hydraulic conductance with water status: quantification and analysis of species differences under steady state. Journal of Experimental Botany 63: 643-658; the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.) However, typical methods for measuring these variables require the excision of tissues and lab analysis, either gravimetric in the case of WMA and RWC, or using the Scholander pressure chamber or psychrometry for &#x3a8;<sub>leaf</sub>, and thus measurement of plant water status has often been limited to relatively low throughput and small study scales. (Jones (2014); cited above.) By contrast, non-invasive methods have great potential for improving ground-based and remote sensing in water relations research and their applications in agriculture and conservation, especially as WMA, RWC and &#x3a8;<sub>leaf </sub>can in principle be estimated not only for leaves, but also at coarser scales, for whole canopies. Embodiments described herein provide methods and systems to estimate WMA, RWC, and deaf from terahertz radiation. Many embodiments are able to provide these measures during mild, moderate and severe leaf dehydration, for given leaves, across leaves of a given species, or across multiple species.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0058">Electromagnetic radiation in the terahertz regime (approximately 100 GHz (e.g., &#xb1;25 GHz) to approximately 10 THz (e.g., &#xb1;1 THz) frequency range or approximately 10 &#x3bc;m (e.g., &#xb1;2.5 &#x3bc;m) to approximately 1,000 &#x3bc;m (e.g., &#xb1;100 &#x3bc;m) wavelength range). Transitions between vibrational and rotational states of many polar molecules, such as water, fall in the terahertz region of the electromagnetic, and thus, terahertz wave propagation is very sensitive to the sample water content. (See e.g., Hecht, (2002) Optics. Addison-Wesley, Reading, Mass.; Ronne et al., (1999) THz spectroscopy of liquid H2O and D20. Physical Review Letters 82: 2888-2891; Mittleman et al., MC (1998) Gas sensing using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. Applied Physics B 67: 379-390; Mittleman et al., (1996) T-ray imaging. IEEE Journal of selected topics in quantum electronics 2: 679-692; and Thrane et al., (1995) THz reflection spectroscopy of liquid water. Chemical Physics Letters 240: 330-333; the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.) In addition, terahertz radiation can offer higher resolution imaging compared to microwave frequencies. Imaging and spectroscopy at terahertz frequencies are harmless since the energy of the photon is very small, compared to lower-wavelength radiation such as ultraviolet and X-rays. (See e.g., Sun et al., (2011) A promising diagnostic method: Terahertz pulsed imaging and spectroscopy. World journal of radiology 3: 55-65; the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.) Terahertz time domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) employs short pulses of electromagnetic radiation, which have a broad terahertz frequency range. (See e.g., Skoog et al., (2017) Principles of instrumental analysis. Cengage learning; the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.) The transmitted and reflected pulses through and from the sample are detected to extract the time- and frequency-domain responses. (See e.g., Yardimci et al., (2017) A high-power broadband terahertz source enabled by three-dimensional light confinement in a plasmonic nanocavity. Scientific Reports 7: 4166; and Yardimci and Jarrahi, (2017) High sensitivity terahertz detection through large-area plasmonic nano-antenna arrays. Scientific Reports 7: 42667; the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.) Because of these specifications, there has been great interest in predicting plant water status using THz-TDS systems. (See e.g., Gente et al., (2018) Outdoor measurements of leaf water content using THz quasi time-domain spectroscopy. Journal of Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz Waves 39: 943-948; Baldacci et al., (2017) Non-invasive absolute measurement of leaf water content using terahertz quantum cascade lasers.

In some embodiments, a terahertz source <b>102</b> is configured to generate a terahertz beam which are guided along an optical path to a terahertz detector <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the terahertz beam is a pulse, such that the illumination beam is transmitted for a limited time suitable for time domain spectroscopy. In many embodiments, the terahertz detector <b>104</b> is configured to receive and record a terahertz signal. In various embodiments, the terahertz detector <b>104</b> is configured to receive s spectrum of frequencies. In certain embodiments, the terahertz illumination beam is guided and focused on the terahertz detector <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the guiding and focusing uses at least one optical element <b>110</b> aligned in an optical path between the terahertz source <b>102</b> and the terahertz detector <b>104</b>. In certain embodiments, an optical element is configured to create collimated <b>106</b> or focused <b>108</b> optical path prior to guiding and focusing a terahertz illumination beam onto a terahertz detector <b>104</b>. In certain embodiments, the collimated <b>106</b> or focused <b>108</b> optical path impinges on a target plant tissue <b>112</b>, such as a leaf, stem, flower, peduncle, sepal, or other plant anatomy. In some embodiments, the terahertz detector <b>104</b> detects terahertz transmission, reflectance, and/or emission from the target plant tissue <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0060">Additional embodiments include a reference beam <b>114</b> that possesses an optical path (either collimated or focused) that does not pass through plant tissue. Some embodiments do not include a separate reference beam <b>114</b>, but instead generate reference data by detecting a terahertz beam without any sample placed in the optical path of the terahertz beam.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0061">In a number of embodiments, the terahertz beam is generated by generating an optical pulse from a light source <b>116</b>, such as a femtosecond laser, where the optical pulse is focused to impinge the terahertz source <b>102</b> to allow the terahertz source <b>102</b> to generate a terahertz pulse. In certain embodiments, the light source <b>116</b> is a Ti:Sapphire laser (e.g., Coherent MIRA0HP, Coherent Inc., Santa Clara, USA). In some embodiments, the optical pulses are generated as femtosecond pulses at a 780 nm wavelength. In many embodiments, the optical pulse generated by light source <b>116</b> pumps the terahertz source <b>102</b> to generate the terahertz pulses. In many embodiments, the terahertz source <b>102</b> is a plasmonic photoconductive nano-antenna array to provide high power terahertz radiation sensitivity over a broad terahertz frequency range. Similarly, the terahertz detector <b>104</b> can also be a plasmonic photoconductive nano-antenna array to provide high terahertz detection sensitivity over a broad terahertz frequency range. (See Yardimci and Jarrahi, (<b>2017</b>, cited above); and Yardimci (<b>2015</b>, cited above).) In a number of embodiments using a light source, the resultant beam is split using a splitter <b>118</b>, which allows a first beam to impinge on and/or pump a terahertz source <b>102</b>, while a second beam passes through a linear delay stage <b>120</b> en route to the terahertz detector <b>104</b>. In a number of embodiments, by moving the linear delay stage <b>120</b> and changing the time delay between the optical pump and probe pulses incident on the terahertz source <b>102</b> and terahertz detector <b>104</b>, respectively, the time-domain electric field profile of the terahertz pulses incident on the terahertz detector <b>104</b> can be resolved with a sub-picosecond resolution over a 400 ps time-window. While the above portions describe terahertz pulse detection from transmission of a signal through a sample, a number of embodiments detect terahertz pulses as reflectance from plant tissue.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0062">To further increase the signal-to-noise-ratio of the resolved signal in many embodiments, multiple time-domain traces (e.g., approximately 10 traces) can be captured and averaged. By taking the Fourier transform of the averaged time-domain signal, the frequency-domain data can be obtained with a 2.5 GHz frequency resolution. In various embodiments, the THz-TDS system used for measurements offers a 100-dB dynamic range and a frequency range of approximately 0.1 THz (e.g., &#xb1;10%) to approximately 5.5 THz (e.g., &#xb1;10%).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0063">Further embodiments include an analyzer <b>122</b> to determine at least one water status variable, such as water mass per area (WMA), relative water content (RWC), and water potential (Y) of the target plant tissue. Determining at least one water status variable in accordance with many embodiments is further discussed below. In various embodiments, the analyzer is any suitable dedicated or software-based device capable of determining a water status variable from a terahertz signal. In various embodiments, an analyzer <b>122</b> is in communication (e.g., wired or wireless) with a terahertz detector <b>104</b>, such that detected signals are transmitted directly to the analyzer <b>122</b>, while in some embodiments, an analyzer <b>122</b> is provided recorded signals from a terahertz detector <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0064">While many plant tissues (e.g., leaves) can vary greatly in size between species, the optical path of a terahertz pulse can be collimated or focused (e.g., a collimated path may work better for species with large leaves, while a focused path may work better for species with smaller leaves). Additionally, many embodiments use a two-dimensional stage (e.g., XY translation stage) to allow multiple measurements over an area. In such embodiments, a two-dimensional stage moves the target plant tissue in two dimensions (e.g., X- and Y-axes) to allow an individual beams or pulses to impinge the tissue at different positions, thus creating a plurality of signals from the target plant tissue. For example, a plurality of terahertz pulses can be illuminated over a grid pattern, such as a 5 mm&#xd7;5 mm grid with measurements taken at 1 mm steps to be able to measure a terahertz signal at multiple points. Additionally, in focused paths, the beam spot can have a smaller diameter (e.g., &#x2212;3 mm diameter), which can allow for smaller grids and steps, (e.g., 6 mm&#xd7;6 mm with 0.5 mm steps). The smaller diameter of a focused beam, can allow for a higher resolution imaging, but this advantage would come with increased measurement times. In additional embodiments, a collimated path, which generally have a wider beam (e.g., &#x2dc;1.5 cm diameter), can be used to collect a plurality signals from the target plant tissue across a larger area simultaneously. Additional embodiments utilize multi-pixel scanners to acquire measurements over a grid pattern. In multi-signal embodiments, the plurality of signals arising from the plant tissue can then be averaged.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0000">Determining Water Status with Terahertz Signals</p><p id="p-0073" num="0065">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an exemplary terahertz signal in accordance with some embodiments is illustrated.

While many of the embodiments discussed herein describe methods to measure water status using terahertz transmission through plant tissue, one of skill in the art would understand that these methods can be adjusted to determine water status through reflectance of a terahertz signal. As such, various embodiments incorporating these methods are able to determine water status through at least one of terahertz transmission and terahertz reflectance. Implementing these methods into an apparatus, can include handheld devices, which can be used to measure water status by transmitting a terahertz signal through individual leaves or other plant tissues.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0088">Additionally, as noted above, methods can be implemented to measure water status using terahertz reflectance. A number of embodiments utilize terahertz reflectance to measure water status of individual plants. By using terahertz reflectance, higher throughput methodologies can be developed that measure entire fields, greenhouses, forests, or other stands. Such of these embodiments are deployed as drone-mounted systems, thus allowing autonomous, semi-autonomous, or manually controlled terahertz imaging over a plant stand, field, forest, etc. Advantages of drone-based systems allow for the terahertz imaging on demand or short notice with little set up costs. Additional embodiments are mounted using cables, rails, or another mounting system that allows terahertz imaging. Such mounted systems can be mounted over fields, inside greenhouses, or on any other system where monitoring could occur on a regular or routine basis. Advantages of mounted systems include that these systems allow for monitoring with little to no damage or effects from drone propellers or other thrust or lift system.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0089">A number of embodiments are configured to achieve strong reductions in water expenditure by coupling terahertz imagers with irrigation systems. In such systems, irrigation systems can be coupled to manual (e.g., handheld) or automated (e.g., drone mounted, rigged, stationary) terahertz devices. Some of these embodiments include controllers to control the irrigation process based on the water status of a plant these irrigation systems include water distribution systems, such as sprinklers, sprayers, and/or linear irrigation systems (including linear pivots). By coupling terahertz devices and irrigation systems in many embodiments, the water status determination and irrigation control is controlled using dynamic machine learning algorithms that can determine the water status of plants with high precision, enabling only the use of water required for the growth of plants at maximum productivity. Such systems provide water conservation and crop yield enhancement simultaneously. In such settings, the acquired terahertz scanner data is processed using machine learning algorithms in combination with other environmental parameters for efficient irrigation such that water expenditure is reduced while maximizing plant productivity.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0090">Additional embodiments use machine learning algorithms to identify semantic similarities between the terahertz scan results and the plant water status parameters that are directly measured from extracted leaves. Specifically, statistical models and machine learning algorithms are used to find the unique relevance between frequency-dependent lead reflectance and transmittance at terahertz frequencies and WMA over different species. This function would be unique for each plant species. Therefore, by conducting calibration measurements on various excised leaves from different species, this unique function can be obtained and used for assessing the WMA of different plants of these species using terahertz scanning non-invasively.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0091">Further embodiments apply machine learning algorithms with different regression and regularization methods. Such embodiments are able to determine the plant water status with confidence bounds that are a function of the terahertz measurement parameters, such as the frequency dependent parameters described herein, and modalities used for the water status determinations. By providing greater amounts of data in the disclosed analysis algorithms, plant water status determinations can be improved.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0092">Even more embodiments utilize terahertz scanners to determine whether the plant is vegetative or generative by developing our novel algorithms through machine learning from the comparison of the terahertz experiment results, plant water status and other recorded environmental data. Such machine learning algorithms statistically learn from the large data sets that are created by the terahertz scanner and other recorded environmental data to automatically determine the water status and plant vegetative/generative states across various species at a wide range of dehydration states.

The beam of light was split into two, with the first beam used to pump a terahertz source to generate terahertz pulses, which were guided and focused on a terahertz detector, and the second beam passed through a linear delay stage to the terahertz detector. Plasmonic photoconductive nano-antenna arrays were used as the terahertz source and detector to provide high power terahertz radiation and high terahertz detection sensitivity over a broad terahertz frequency range. (See e.g., Yardimci and Jarrahi, (2017, cited above); and Yardimci et al., (2015,cited above).) By moving the linear delay stage and changing the time delay between the optical pump and probe pulses incident on the terahertz source and detector, respectively, the time-domain electric field profile of the terahertz pulses incident on the terahertz detector was resolved with a sub-picosecond resolution over a 400 ps time-window. Lock-in detection was used to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the resolved signal. To further increase the signal-to-noise-ratio of the resolved signal, 10 time-domain traces were captured and averaged. By taking the Fourier transform of the averaged time-domain signal, the frequency-domain data were obtained with a 2.5 GHz frequency resolution (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).

Negligible changes in the terahertz measurement results within this angle range.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0100">Hydrated leaves were sealed in bags (Whirl-Pak, Nasco, Fort Atkinson, Wis., USA) that had been exhaled into to generate a moist, high CO2 environment to minimize transpiration, and placed in a larger plastic bag with wet paper towels to equilibrate at least 30 mins before weighing with an analytical balance (0.01 mg; MS205DU Mettler Toledo, Toledo, Ohio). Then, each leaf sample was placed on a motorized XY translation stage and the position of the leaf was adjusted such that a section of lamina between two secondary veins was exposed to the terahertz radiation. A collimated terahertz beam with &#x2dc;1.5 cm-diameter beam spot size was used for the H. <i>canariensis </i>and <i>P. racemosa </i>leaves. The smaller and more fragile leaves of <i>A. thaliana </i>were placed on a glass slide to ensure proper alignment during dehydration, and the terahertz beam was focused to have a &#x2dc;3 mm-diameter beam spot size for the measurements (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0128" num="0101">The measurements with the THz-TDS system were repeated for each leaf during dehydration, with the position of the terahertz beam on the leaves marked to return to approximately the same spot for each measurement. However, given that leaves were removed from the system and replaced for repeated measurements, there were shifts in the exact position of the terahertz beam on the leaf sample in successive measurements; thus, for each dehydration stage, 25 measurements (at 1 mm steps) were made within the marked 5&#xd7;5 mm<sup>2 </sup>area for each H. <i>canariensis </i>and <i>P. racemosa </i>sample and averaged to improve the precision of the mean (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>). Since a beam with much smaller spot size was incident on <i>A. thaliana, </i>169 measurements (at 0.5 mm steps) were taken within a 6&#xd7;6 mm<sup>2 </sup>area. The THz-TDS system can image the leaf surface with even greater resolution (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>) but require significant measurement times which may result in greater than expected dehydration for excised tissues. After each THz-TDS measurement, the leaf and bag were weighed with the analytical balance, and &#x3a8;<sub>leaf </sub>was determined with a pressure chamber (0.001 MPa resolution, Plant Moisture Stress Model 1000; PMS Instruments Co). Then, the leaves were bench dried on a fan to reduce &#x3a8;<sub>leaf </sub>by 0.1-0.2 MPa, and the terahertz measurements were repeated.

For <i>A. thaliana</i>, given the fewer data available for dehydration sequences of individual leaves, data for all six leaves were pooled together into an overall pressure-volume curve.
