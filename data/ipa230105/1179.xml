For example, when deployed in the left heart, an intracardiac blood pump can pump blood from the left ventricle of the heart into the aorta. Likewise, when deployed in the right heart, an intracardiac blood pump can pump blood from the inferior vena cava into the pulmonary artery. Intracardiac pumps can be powered by a motor located outside of the patient's body via an elongate drive shaft (or drive cable) or by an onboard motor located inside the patient's body. Some intracardiac blood pump systems can operate in parallel with the native heart to supplement cardiac output and partially or fully unload components of the heart. Examples of such systems include the IMPELLA&#xae; family of devices (Abiomed, Inc., Danvers Mass.).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present technology relates to systems and methods for deriving pressures outside of a blood inlet and/or outside of a blood outlet of an intracardiac blood pump assembly, or a pressure differential therebetween. In that regard, the present technology enables pressure outside of the blood inlet to be derived based on one or more readings from a pressure sensor placed within the blood inlet, one or more readings from a differential pressure sensor configured to measure pressure differential across a wall of the pump housing or cannula, and the speed of the pump motor. Likewise, the present technology enables a pressure differential between the blood inlet and blood outlet to be derived based on one or more readings from the differential pressure sensor, and the speed of the pump motor. Further, the pressure outside of the blood outlet may be derived based on the derived pressure outside of the blood inlet and the derived pressure differential between the blood inlet and blood outlet. These derived pressures may be used for a variety of purposes, such as confirming placement of the intracardiac blood pump assembly at a desired position within the patient's heart, and monitoring heart function. Moreover, the systems and methods described herein provide the advantage of allowing inlet and outlet pressures to be derived from pressure sensors placed within the pump housing, where the sensors can also be used to monitor changes in suction which may indicate kinking of the cannula and/or the presence of an obstruction within the pump such as a blood clot.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one aspect, the disclosure describes an intracardiac blood pump system, comprising an intracardiac blood pump assembly and a controller.

In that regard, the intracardiac blood pump assembly <b>100</b> includes an elongate catheter <b>102</b>, a motor <b>104</b>, a cannula <b>110</b>, a blood inflow cage <b>114</b> arranged at or near the distal end <b>112</b> of the cannula <b>110</b>, a blood outflow cage <b>106</b> arranged at or near the proximal end <b>108</b> of the cannula <b>110</b>, and an optional atraumatic extension <b>116</b> arranged at the distal end of the blood inflow cage <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Motor <b>104</b> is configured to rotatably drive an impeller (not shown), thereby generating suction sufficient to draw blood into cannula <b>110</b> through the blood inflow cage <b>114</b>, and to expel the blood out of cannula <b>110</b> through the blood outflow cage <b>106</b>. In that regard, the impeller may be positioned distal of the blood outflow cage <b>106</b>, for example, within the proximal end <b>108</b> of the cannula <b>110</b> or within a pump housing <b>107</b> coupled to the proximal end <b>108</b> of the cannula <b>110</b>. In some aspects of the technology, rather than the impeller being driven by an in-dwelling motor <b>104</b>, the impeller may instead be coupled to an elongate drive shaft (or drive cable) which is driven by a motor located external to the patient.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Catheter <b>102</b> may house electrical lines coupling the motor <b>104</b> to one or more electrical controllers or other sensors. Alternatively, where the impeller is driven by an external motor, an elongate drive shaft may pass through catheter <b>102</b>. Catheter <b>102</b> may also serve as a conduit for wires connecting the pressure sensors described further below to one or more controllers, power sources, etc. located outside the patient's body. Catheter <b>102</b> may also include a purge fluid conduit, a lumen configured to receive a guidewire, etc.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The blood inflow cage <b>114</b> includes one or more apertures or openings configured to allow blood to be drawn into cannula <b>110</b> when the motor <b>104</b> is operating. Likewise, blood outflow cage <b>106</b> includes one or more apertures or openings configured to allow blood to flow from the cannula <b>110</b> out of the intracardiac blood pump assembly <b>100</b>. Blood inflow cage <b>114</b> and outflow cage <b>106</b> may be composed of any suitable bio-compatible material(s). For example, blood inflow cage <b>114</b> and/or blood outflow cage <b>106</b> may be formed out of bio-compatible metals such as stainless steel, titanium, or biocompatible polymers such as polyurethane. In addition, the surfaces of blood inflow cage <b>114</b> and/or blood outflow cage <b>106</b> may be treated in various ways, including, but not limited to etching, texturing, or coating or plating with another material. For example, the surfaces of blood inflow cage <b>114</b> and/or blood outflow cage <b>106</b> may be laser textured.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Cannula <b>110</b> may include a flexible hose portion. For example, cannula <b>110</b> may be composed, at least in part, of a polyurethane material. In addition, cannula <b>110</b> may include a shape-memory material. For example, cannula <b>110</b> may comprise a combination of a polyurethane material and one or more strands or coils of a shape-memory material such as Nitinol. Cannula <b>110</b> may be formed such that it includes one or more bends or curves in its relaxed state, or it may be configured to be straight in its relaxed state. In that regard, in the exemplary arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the cannula <b>110</b> has a single pre-formed anatomical bend <b>118</b> based on the portion of the left heart in which it is intended to operate. Despite this bend <b>118</b>, the cannula <b>110</b> may nevertheless also be flexible, and may thus be capable of straightening (e.g., during insertion over a guidewire), or bending further (e.g., in a patient whose anatomy has tighter dimensions). Further in that regard, cannula <b>110</b> may include a shape-memory material configured to allow the cannula <b>110</b> to be a different shape (e.g., straight or mostly straight) at room temperatures, and to form bend <b>118</b> once the shape-memory material is exposed to the heat of a patient's body.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Atraumatic extension <b>116</b> assists with stabilizing and positioning the intracardiac blood pump assembly <b>100</b> in the correct position in the patient's heart. Atraumatic extension <b>116</b> may be solid or tubular. If tubular, atraumatic extension <b>116</b> may be configured to allow a guidewire to be passed through it to further assist in the positioning of the intracardiac blood pump assembly <b>100</b>.
