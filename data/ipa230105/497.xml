No. 62/947,376, filed Dec. 12, 2019 and entitled MIS Chevron Surgical Guide and Processes for Using the Same, the entirety of both of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">1. Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates in general to the field of surgery. More particularly, the present invention relates to an orthopedic implant, surgical instruments for use and delivery of the implant, surgical instruments for creation of an osteotomy, and the surgical technique used with these items. Specifically, a preferred embodiment of the present invention relates to methods and instruments used for minimally invasive surgery.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Discussion of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">An osteotomy is a surgical procedure that involves cutting, reshaping, or removing bone. Osteotomies are usually performed to correct a deformity in the bone. One common deformity that can be repaired by surgery is hallux valgus, also known as a bunion. Hallux valgus is a foot deformity that causes functional disability and pain and involves misalignment of the first metatarsal and phalanx.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Surgical correction frequently involves cutting bone, realigning or shifting the bones to the proper anatomical configuration, and then fixing the bones in the new positions such that they heal. Fixation of the bones can occur with the use of orthopedic screws, shape memory implants, or plates and screws. The surgery frequently requires incisions in the skin and soft tissues and then subsequent cutting and drilling of bone. Many conventional systems for surgery of this type require extensive dissection of soft tissue such that the physician can see the underlying bone. Extensive dissection such as this can limit or damage blood flow to the affected area and slow healing. Extensive dissection of soft tissue also risks penetrating the area around a joint, potentially permanently compromising proper joint motion. Soft tissue dissection can also damage nerves, increase swelling, or increase post-surgical pain.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, during surgery of this type, it is frequently an objective of the surgeon to avoid unnecessary disruption of tissue. This can be accomplished by both careful surgical techniques, as well as specially designed instruments and implants that minimize unnecessary tissue disruption. In particular, a precision guide can assist a physician in accomplishing surgery with minimal tissue dissection. A medical device system that is designed to assist the surgeon in minimizing unnecessary disruption of tissue can be described as &#x201c;minimally invasive surgery&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, what is needed is a medical device system that includes instruments, implants, and a surgical technique that work together to avoid unnecessary disruption of tissue and producing a successful surgical outcome. What is further needed are medical devices and processes that solves the problem outlined above associated with large incisions and variable surgical results. What is further needed is an apparatus and method of use resulting in minimal soft tissue disruption and providing specific guided steps for the surgery.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with a first aspect of the invention, an apparatus is provided that includes a precision cutting guide for creating an osteotomy. The guide includes a main body shaped to conform to an outside surface of a foot of a patient having at least one opening, a cutting guide insert with a chevron-shaped cutting slot capable of receiving a cutting instrument, at least one adjustment screw that is movable relative to the main body to secure the main body to the foot of the patient, and at least one guide wire insertable into the at least one opening. The cutting guide insert may be radiopaque. Additionally, the main body may have at least one alignment slot formed in the main body that is configured to allow the precision cutting guide to be aligned with the foot of the patient. Similarly, the main body may have at least one notch formed along the perimeter of the main body for aligning the main body relative to the foot of the patient. The main body may also have at least one curved edge formed in the body. The curved edge may be used as a guide for a physician to make a curvilinear incision. Further still, the guide may include a targeting knob that extends from the main body. At least one hole may be formed in the targeting knob. For instance, the targeting knob may have a center targeting hold, as well as at lease one additional adjustment holes located proximate to the center targeting hole. Additionally, the guide may include a guide tube slot that is formed in the main body that is substantially perpendicular to the cutting slot.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to another aspect of the present invention, a method of performing a medical procedure is provided. The method may include the steps of aligning a precision cutting guide relative to the foot of the patient, securing the precision cutting guide relative to the foot, making an incision in the foot along an edge of the main body, inserting at least one retractor into the incision, cutting a portion of a bone into a first bone piece and a second bone piece, adjusting the location of the first bone piece relative to the second bone piece, and securing the first bone piece to the second bone piece. Additionally, the method includes the steps of drawing a first line along a centerline of a first metatarsal of the foot, drawing a second line substantially perpendicular to the first line, aligning at least one of the first line and the second line with at least one slot or notch. Further still, the method may include the step of tightening at least one adjustment screw that is rotatably attached to the main body to secure the main body to the foot. Further still, the method may include the steps of securing a targeting guide to the main body and inserting at least one guide wire through the targeting guide, the main body, and into a first metatarsal of the foot. Additionally, the method may include the steps of rotating the main body about the at least one guide wire from a first position to a second position and cutting an incision in the foot about the at least one edge. Thereafter, at least one retractor may be inserted into the incision, after which the main body may be rotated about the at least one guide wire from the second position back to the first position. Next, a screw guide may be inserted into a guide tube slot formed in the main body, after which a guide wire may be inserted through the screw guide. Thereafter, the first metatarsal of the patient's foot can be cut through a cutting guide slot formed in the main body to create a first bone piece and a second bone piece. After that, the first bone piece may be adjusted relative to the second bone piece, a hole can be drilled into the bone using the guide wire as a guide, and an implant can be screwed in to secure the first bone piece to the second bone piece. Next, any remaining guide wires can be removed, and the incision can be closed. Furthermore, x-rays or other visual scans may be taken at any point during the procedure to ensure appropriate location of the various components. The desired method creates a step-by-step surgical procedure that helps to ensure the osteotomy and implant are in the correct location for a high success outcome.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to another aspect of the present invention, a kit may be provided. The surgical kit provides a receptacle for holding the different components of the minimally invasive surgical system and keeps each component secure and sterile until the time of surgery. The kit may include a precision cutting guide, at least one screw rotatably connected to the precision cutting guide, at least one guide wire, and an implant configured to secure two pieces of bone together. The kit may also include a targeting guide that is configured to be releasably secured to the main body about a targeting knob having a plurality of openings formed therein. The kit may also include at least one retractor configured to retract soft tissue in the foot. Further still, the kit may include a screw guide that is configured to be inserted into a guide tube slot formed in the main body. Further yet, the kit may include a scalpel, a screwdriver, and a drill bit. Each of the screwdriver, drill bit, and screw guard may have a cannula formed therein dimensioned to accommodate the at least one guide wire. The kit may consist of single-use instruments and all necessary implants required to perform a surgical correction of mild to moderate hallux valgus, or similar surgical procedure.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to another aspect, the invention includes each of the following plus their combination: a precision cutting guide, a targeting guide, a screw guide, a screwdriver, one or more orthopedic implants, a drill bit with countersink, one or more tissue retractors, one or more guide wires, and a kit or kits for maintaining the sterility of the components.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The precision cutting guide is designed to conform to the anatomy of a patient. It provides a guide for a physician to create an osteotomy by guiding a bone saw blade to the proper location and at the proper angles. The precision cutting guide has numerous alignment features such as holes and notches to assist the physician with positioning the guide in the proper location for a successful osteotomy of bone. The precision cutting guide also has a guide tube slot that allows the physician to direct a guide wire directly to the location needed for proper fixation.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The targeting guide is designed to help align the precision cutting guide such that is positioned properly over a bone under the skin. The targeting guide fits over the precision cutting guide, such that the targeting guide is perpendicular to the cutting slot on the precision cutting guide. The targeting guide features a pointer that can be directed at a specific anatomic location to assist the physician. The screw guide allows the physician to determine the correct length of implant to use for fixation, and then guide an implant into the correct spot to fixate two bones. The screwdriver is cable of fitting over the guide wire while driving an implant into bone.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The orthopedic implant can consist of different types of fixation implants, such as a bone screw, bone pin, surgical staple, or orthopedic plate with screws. In this system, the orthopedic implant consists of a cannulated orthopedic screw. The precision cutting guide provides a mechanism for targeting the location of the orthopedic implant, such that the physician can rely on proper placement of the implant with no unnecessary soft tissue dissection.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The drill bit with countersink permits drilling of a pilot hole for the implant, as well cutting flutes to create a countersink area in bone so that the implant does not project above the surface after installation. The tissue retractors are designed to restrain soft tissue while making the osteotomy and allow access to bone. One or more guide wires can be smooth-shafted or threaded and can have one end pointed or both ends pointed. The purpose of the guide wires is to anchor the precision cutting guide to the patient's anatomy with minimal soft tissue disruption, so that an osteotomy can be created, and the implant targeted to the proper location.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The combination of the kit and a surgical technique that results in minimal tissue disruption (also referred to as minimally invasive) and highly reproducible and accurate correction to the hallux valgus condition. The reduces the chance of complications, scarring and pain. A minimally invasive precision surgical cutting guide instrument that has the following features: the main body is clear, so that physicians can see the underlying bone and tissue; the radiopaque cutting guide insert allows the physician to see the exact location where a bone osteotomy, or corrective cut in bone, will occur; precise alignment features that ensure the osteotomy is performed in the correct location, the osteotomy is centered on the bone, and a fixation implant can be directed to the proper location; adjustment holes that allow the physician to reposition the cutting guide without drilling additional guide wires into bone; a targeting guide instrument that ensures the osteotomy is perpendicular to the metatarsal bone that is being surgically corrected. The present invention may be is unique to foot and ankle surgery, or it similarly could be used for other surgical procedures.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">These, and other aspects and objects of the present invention will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings.

id="p-0056" num="0055">In describing the preferred embodiment of the invention which is illustrated in the drawings, specific terminology will be resorted to for the sake of clarity. However, it is not intended that the invention be limited to the specific terms so selected and it is to be understood that each specific term includes all technical equivalents which operate in a similar manner to accomplish a similar purpose. For example, the word connected, attached, or terms similar thereto are often used. They are not limited to direct connection but include connection through other elements where such connection is recognized as being equivalent by those skilled in the art.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The present invention and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non-limiting embodiments described in detail in the following description. Initially, a variety of tools will be described, after which use of the tools together will be described to perform the desired medical procedure. Preferably, the described system can be used to streamline and simplify minimally invasive surgical procedures. Additionally, the described system preferably results in better cosmetic results, such as less scarring, decreased trauma to the soft tissues, less damage to blood supply, faster healing, less time in the operating room for the patient and physicians, less post-operative pain, swelling, and complications, and/or quicker recovery time and earlier return to activities. While the description below will primarily be in relation to surgical procedures designed to correct issues relating to hallux valgus/bunions, the present invention could similarly be used to correct other issues in a patient's feet, ankles, and elsewhere on the body.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref> are perspective, side view, and end views respectively, of an orthopedic implant <b>100</b> suitable for fixating two bones after an osteotomy and corrective surgery. In one embodiment of the present invention, the implant <b>100</b> consists of a cannulated orthopedic screw. The illustrated implant <b>100</b> consists of a shaft <b>105</b>, a head <b>110</b>, upper threads <b>115</b>, and distal threads <b>120</b>. The implant <b>100</b> can be manufactured of metal, plastic, or any other suitable material depending on the objectives of the designer and the purpose of use of the implant <b>100</b>. The shaft <b>105</b> has an inner cannula <b>130</b> that extends from the head <b>110</b> to the cutting tip <b>121</b> along the entire length of the implant <b>100</b>. The diameter of the cannula <b>130</b> is sized such that a guide wire <b>650</b>, described below, passes through the cannula <b>130</b>. The head <b>110</b> contains upper threads <b>115</b>, which anchor in one bone requiring fixation. The distal threads <b>120</b> anchors in a second bone to create fixation. The thread pitch and diameter of the upper threads <b>115</b> and the distal threaded section <b>120</b> can be different, such that a compressive force is created between two bones upon the use of the implant <b>100</b>. The distal threads <b>120</b> contain a cutting tip <b>121</b>, which can self-cut threads into a bone as the implant <b>100</b> is screwed into place. The distal threads <b>120</b> also contain reverse cutting threads <b>122</b>, which allow the implant <b>100</b> to be removed from bone if desired. The head <b>110</b> also contains a screwdriver receptacle <b>140</b>. The receptacle <b>140</b> is shown in the preferred embodiment to receive a Torx head screwdriver, however any design for mating with a screwdriver could suffice. Although the implant is shown as a screw, other implants may be used to achieve the same goal, including pins, staples, plates, and any other fastener mechanism known to those having ordinary skill in the art. Additionally, the implant <b>100</b> may be a similar screw as shown, but having different lengths depending on the size and shape of the patient's foot.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Next, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>6</b></figref> are perspective, side view, and end views respectively, of one embodiment of a precision cutting guide <b>200</b>. The precision cutting guide <b>200</b> is shown designed for the left foot of a patient, but all description below applies for a right foot where a mirror image version of guide <b>200</b> would be used. The precision cutting guide <b>200</b> consists of a main body <b>205</b>, which conforms to the anatomy of the left foot. In this embodiment, the shape of the main body <b>205</b> is curved in multiple planes to best conform to the soft tissue surrounding a patient's first metatarsal. The main body <b>205</b> can be made of plastic, metal, or any other suitable material depending on a number of factors, including whether the precision cutting guide <b>200</b> is intended to be disposable, or reusable, the desire of the user, and the like. Biocompatible ink can be used on the main body <b>205</b> to highlight measurements or features to a surgeon. For example, the letter &#x201c;L&#x201d; signifying left foot could be printed on the precision cutting guide <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The main body <b>205</b> has an insert situated in it. For instance, a cutting guide insert <b>206</b> is embedded in a cavity in the main body <b>205</b>. In this embodiment, the cutting guide insert <b>206</b> is over molded into the main body <b>205</b>, but any means of attachment would suffice. For example, the cutting guide insert <b>206</b> could be glued, press fit, welded, or attached in another way to main body <b>205</b>. The cutting guide insert <b>206</b> can be made from a different material than main body <b>205</b>, or it could be made of the same material. In this embodiment, the main body <b>205</b> is made from conventional injection molded plastic, whereas cutting guide insert <b>206</b> is made from radiopaque injection molded plastic. In this way, when a physician uses the precision guide <b>200</b>, the cutting guide insert <b>206</b> is visible in fluoroscopy. A cutting slot <b>207</b> is a chevron-shaped (V-shaped) pathway that permits an orthopedic cutting instrument, such as saw or bur, to make a cut in bone. Of course, the cutting slot <b>207</b> could take any number of different shapes depending on thus surgical procedure being performed, and the preferences of the physician. When the precision cutting guide <b>200</b> is positioned on a patient's foot, and fluoroscopy is used, the cutting slot <b>207</b> would be easily visible in the center of the radiopaque cutting guide insert <b>206</b>, ensuring that a physician user would cut bone in the correct spot.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The precision cutting guide <b>200</b> includes several alignment features. First, an alignment slot <b>210</b> is a straight slot in the main body <b>205</b> that allows viewing of tissue under the precision cutting guide <b>200</b>. An upper alignment notch <b>216</b> and horizontal notches <b>217</b> and <b>218</b> are notches on the perimeter of the main body <b>205</b> that can be used by a physician to align the precision cutting guide <b>200</b> properly on a patient's foot as will further be described below. A line drawn through horizontal notches <b>217</b> and <b>218</b> would pass through alignment slot <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The precision cutting guide <b>200</b> also has two lower notches <b>215</b> and <b>219</b>, and an edge <b>209</b>, located on the bottom perimeter of the precision cutting guide <b>200</b>. The edge <b>209</b> is a surface that a physician can use to guide a scalpel or cutting device precisely along a curvilinear path. Of course, the edge <b>209</b> could similarly be a straight edge or an edge having a different curvilinear path. The curvilinear perimeter distance between the two lower notches <b>215</b>, <b>219</b> along edge <b>209</b> can be a known distance. In this embodiment, that distance between the two lower notches <b>215</b>, <b>219</b> tracing along edge <b>209</b> is one centimeter. In this way, these three features, <b>215</b>, <b>219</b>, and <b>209</b> allow the physician to create a one-centimeter guided curvilinear tissue incision with a scalpel.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The precision cutting guide <b>200</b> has multiple threaded locations for alignment screws. First, an upper alignment hole <b>240</b> is a threaded hole in the main body <b>205</b> for accepting an alignment screw <b>300</b>. Similarly, a lower alignment hole <b>241</b> is a threaded hole in the main body <b>205</b>, for accepting another alignment screw <b>300</b>. Any number of alignment screws can be used, but in this embodiment only two are needed. Alignment holes <b>240</b> and <b>241</b> are positioned on main body <b>205</b> such that they are not coplanar, allowing for better stabilization when the alignment screws <b>300</b> are inserted into the holes <b>240</b> and <b>241</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The precision cutting guide <b>200</b> may also have a guide tube slot <b>250</b> that is situated on the main body <b>205</b> that is designed such that a screw guide <b>450</b> fits into the guide tube slot <b>250</b> and can be moved from side to side. This allows the screw guide <b>450</b> to be aimed at a precise location by the physician.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Further still, the precision cutting guide <b>200</b> may also include a targeting knob <b>227</b> that extends from the main body <b>205</b>. The targeting knob <b>227</b> is designed such that a targeting guide <b>500</b> described below will snugly fit over targeting knob <b>227</b> and be secured thereto. The end of targeting knob <b>227</b> contains numerous holes. For instance, as shown a center targeting hole <b>235</b> has a diameter large enough for a guide wire <b>650</b>. Additional adjustment holes <b>230</b> may be formed in the targeting knob <b>227</b> that surround the center targeting hole <b>235</b>. There can be any number of adjustment holes <b>230</b>, but in this embodiment eight adjustment holes are shown. The diameter of each adjustment hole <b>230</b> is large enough for a guide wire <b>650</b>. The center point of each of the adjustment holes <b>230</b> is a known distance from center targeting hole <b>235</b>. For example, the center point of each adjustment hole <b>230</b> could be 1 mm from center targeting hole <b>235</b> if desired by the designer. The adjustment holes <b>230</b> allow a physician to reposition the precision targeting guide <b>200</b> in small incremental amounts to achieve proper positioning of the precision targeting guide on the patient's foot without redrilling guide wire <b>650</b>. This adjustment process will be described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Moving on, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows one embodiment of a potential alignment screw <b>300</b>. The alignment screw <b>300</b> can be made of any number of materials, but in this embodiment was designed to be injection-molded plastic. The screw <b>300</b> consists of an alignment screw head <b>310</b>, an alignment screw cannula <b>320</b>, alignment screw threads <b>315</b>, and an alignment screw tip <b>325</b>. The alignment screw head <b>310</b> includes flanges <b>312</b> such that it can be easily inserted and tightened by a physician. The alignment screw <b>300</b> is cannulated from head <b>310</b> to tip <b>325</b>. The diameter of the cannula <b>320</b> is such that it will fit over a guide wire <b>650</b>. The alignment screw threads <b>315</b> can be of any pitch and diameter, but in this embodiment the threads <b>315</b> show a course thread pattern that advances a large distance for each turn of alignment screw head <b>310</b>. In addition, the alignment screw threads <b>315</b> mate with the threads in the upper and lower alignment holes <b>240</b>, <b>241</b> of the precision cutting guide <b>200</b>. The alignment screw tip <b>325</b> is blunt with no sharp edges and designed to contact soft tissue without damaging soft tissue.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is an illustration of an assembly consisting of the precision cutting guide <b>200</b> and two alignment screws <b>300</b>. The alignment screw threads <b>315</b> are engaged with the alignment holes <b>240</b>, <b>241</b> of precision cutting guide <b>200</b>. This assembly can be placed on a patient's foot and both alignment screws <b>300</b> tightened until they contact soft tissue and stabilize the precision cutting guide <b>200</b> relative to the patient's foot.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">A screwdriver <b>350</b> used with present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. The screwdriver <b>350</b> consists of two pieces: a screwdriver shaft <b>360</b> and a screwdriver handle <b>370</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the screwdriver shaft <b>360</b> can be made of metal and over molded with a plastic screwdriver handle <b>370</b>. However, one familiar with the art can see that screwdriver <b>350</b> can be a single piece, of any suitable material, if desired, or a multiple piece screwdriver made of any desired material or materials. The screwdriver handle <b>370</b> can be a solid block, or it can be partially hollowed to reduce weight. A screwdriver cannula <b>375</b> extends from screwdriver tip <b>380</b> to the end of handle <b>370</b>. The cannula <b>375</b> is large enough for a guide wire <b>650</b>. The screwdriver tip <b>380</b> is designed to mate with screwdriver receptacle <b>140</b> on the implant <b>100</b>. In this embodiment the screwdriver tip <b>380</b> is shown as a Torx design, although any other type of screwdriver tip may be used.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Additionally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref> illustrate a drill bit <b>400</b>. The drill bit <b>400</b> consists of a drill bit body <b>410</b>, a drill bit quick connect <b>420</b>, and two sets of cutting flutes <b>425</b> and <b>430</b>. The drill bit <b>400</b> is cannulated from end to end with a drill bit cannula <b>415</b> having a diameter that is configured to receive a guide wire <b>650</b>. The drill bit quick connect <b>420</b> is a design that fits common surgical drills and can be whatever shape and design is suitable to be compatible with operating room drills. The cutting flute <b>425</b> has a diameter that is suitable for an implant <b>100</b> distal threads <b>120</b>. The countersink cutting flute <b>430</b> has a larger diameter than the cutting flute <b>425</b>, and creates an opening for the upper threads <b>115</b> on the implant <b>100</b>, such that the implant head <b>110</b> can be inserted deep enough in a bone such that it does not project above the surface of the bone. The length of fluted area on the drill bit <b>400</b> depends on whether the implant <b>100</b> contains threads with self-cutting design. In this embodiment, the implant <b>100</b> distal threads <b>120</b> are self-cutting, and therefore the cutting flute <b>425</b> does not need to be as long as the implant <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Next, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows a screw guide <b>450</b>. The screw guide <b>450</b> consists of a tissue protector sleeve <b>455</b> and a depth gauge handle <b>460</b>. The tissue protector sleeve <b>455</b> can be made of any material, but in this embodiment is made from metal. A sleeve tip <b>456</b> at the end of the tissue protector sleeve <b>455</b> has serrated edges, so that it can grip a patient's bone when used in surgery. A cannula <b>457</b> extends through the length of the screw guide <b>450</b> and is configured to receive a guide wire <b>650</b>. The depth gauge handle <b>460</b> can be printed or embossed with depth gauge measurements <b>465</b>, which can be used by a physician to determine what length of implant <b>100</b> would be needed for a given patient.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A, <b>13</b>B, <b>14</b> and <b>15</b></figref> illustrate different views of a targeting guide <b>500</b>. The targeting guide <b>500</b> has a targeting pointer <b>510</b>. A targeting guide cannula <b>512</b> may extend through a portion of the targeting guide <b>500</b>, where the cannula <b>512</b> has a diameter that is configured to receive a guide wire <b>650</b>. A targeting guide recess <b>515</b> may be shaped so that it fits over the targeting knob <b>227</b> of the precision cutting guide <b>200</b>. When the targeting guide recess <b>515</b> is slipped over targeting knob <b>227</b>, it causes the targeting pointer <b>510</b> to be oriented perpendicularly to the alignment slot <b>210</b> and the cutting guide insert <b>206</b> on the precision cutting guide <b>200</b>. In this embodiment, the targeting guide <b>500</b> is made from injection-molded plastic, although it could be made of any other suitable material. The targeting guide <b>500</b> can be designed with ribs to improve strength, if desired. In this embodiment, pointer <b>510</b> has two ribs along its length. As shown, two ribs <b>520</b>, <b>525</b> are located on the pointer <b>510</b> and designed so that a groove <b>530</b> is formed between ribs <b>520</b> and <b>525</b>. The width of groove <b>530</b> is slightly larger than the diameter of a guide wire <b>650</b>. In this way, a guide wire <b>650</b> can be laid into the groove <b>530</b> formed by the ribs <b>520</b>, <b>525</b> and extend from the targeting pointer <b>510</b> to a landmark on the patient's body. The targeting pointer <b>510</b> can also be designed such that it comes to a point at the end or left blunt as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> illustrates a short tissue retractor <b>600</b>. The retractor <b>600</b> consists of a short retractor body <b>610</b>, a grip <b>611</b>, and a short tissue hook <b>612</b>. The purpose of the tissue retractor <b>600</b> is to allow the physician user to grab and retract soft tissue around an incision, to expose bone under the tissue. Similarly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> illustrates a long tissue retractor <b>625</b>. The retractor <b>625</b> is similar in design to short tissue retractor <b>600</b>, except that the long tissue hook <b>632</b> is longer than the short tissue hook <b>612</b>. A long retractor body <b>630</b> and a grip <b>631</b> make up the body of long tissue retractor <b>625</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Further still, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> illustrates a guide wire <b>650</b>. As will further be described below, and as shown in the figures, a number of guide wires <b>650</b> may be used simultaneously during the medical procedure, although a single guide wire will be described. Of course, guide wires have different sizes and proportions could similarly be used. The guide wire <b>650</b> consists of a guide wire shaft <b>660</b> and a guide wire tip <b>662</b>. The guide wire shaft <b>660</b> is smooth to slide easily in any of the cannula features described in this specification. The guide wire tip <b>662</b> can be rounded, pointed, threaded, or be in any number of designs depending on the physician's objective. In the illustrated embodiment, the tip <b>662</b> is shown in a trocar design that can cut bone. The guide wire <b>650</b> can also have both ends pointed if desired, but in this embodiment the tip <b>662</b> is pointed while the opposite end is blunt. The guide wire <b>650</b> can have markings, such as a laser etch or ink mark (not shown), that define certain distances on the guide wire <b>650</b>. For example, a laser etch on the guide wire <b>650</b> could be used in conjunction with depth gauge measurements <b>465</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In addition to all the components described so far, a kit <b>1200</b> can be provided. For instance, the kit <b>1200</b> could a sterilizable plastic tray <b>1210</b> or any bag, box, container, or the like for holding some or all of the components. For instance, as shown the kit <b>1200</b> may include some or all of the components described above, including the implant <b>100</b>, the precision cutting guide <b>200</b>, one or more alignment screws <b>300</b>, the screwdriver <b>350</b>, the drill bit <b>400</b>, the screw guide <b>450</b>, the targeting guide <b>500</b>, the short tissue retractor <b>600</b>, the long tissue retractor <b>625</b>, and one or more guide wires <b>650</b>. In other embodiments, the kit may not include all of the tools, for instance, the screwdriver <b>350</b>, the drill bit <b>400</b>, the screw guide <b>450</b> may be excluded since these components may already be present in an operating room. In this way, the kit can be delivered to the operating room in a sterile configuration, ready for surgery. Of course, additional components or tools can also be included in the kit that are not mentioned here, including gauze and other sanitary products, as well as other products used to make incisions and close incisions.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In addition to the components described above, as well as the kit, the present invention is also directed to a method of performing a medical procedure, such as to correct and fixate a bunion in surgery. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>-<b>33</b>B</figref> illustrate such a method. Although a summary of the steps is provided below, the method could include some, but not all of the steps outlined below. Furthermore, the method may include some additional steps. Further still, the steps need not necessarily occur in the order they are described.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The general steps in the method of use are as follows: marking the patient's skin with a line over the midline of the first metatarsal; marking the patient's skin with a second line that is perpendicular to the first line; aligning the precision cutting guide with the marked lines; positioning the targeting guide on the precision cutting guide and aiming the targeting guide towards the fourth metatarsophalangeal joint, or any appropriate anatomic landmark; adjusting the one or more alignment screws on the precision cutting guide until the screws touch skin; inserting at least guide wire through targeting guide and then through the precision cutting guide into the first metatarsal; removing the targeting guide; rotating the precision cutting guide vertically and using the edge of precision cutting guide to dissect skin in an arc; placing large and small retractors in a correct position; rotating the precision cutting guide back into alignment; inserting at least two additional guide wires through the precision cutting guide into bone; inserting the screw guide; inserting a guide wire though the screw guide; creating the osteotomy; removing the precision cutting guide and guide wires that were associated with the precision cutting guide; correcting the deformity; drilling a hole for the implant over the guidewire; inserting the implant; and removing the remaining guide wire and close incisions. Additional steps may include repositioning the precision cutting guide using adjustment holes if needed, and measuring the screw length using the depth gauge.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The method of use will further be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>-<b>33</b>B</figref>. In some of these figures, the various bone features contained within the foot <b>700</b> are shown using phantom lines. Turning first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, a side elevation view of a patient's left foot <b>700</b> with a bunion deformity is shown. The foot <b>700</b> contains a first metatarsal <b>710</b> and a great toe proximal phalanx <b>720</b>. A horizontal line <b>800</b> is drawn by a physician on the skin of the foot <b>700</b> using a radiopaque or visible surgical marker. The horizontal line <b>800</b> is situated on the skin along the centerline of first metatarsal <b>710</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> illustrates a vertical line <b>810</b> that is marked on the skin of the foot <b>700</b> by a physician, where the vertical line <b>810</b> is perpendicular to the horizontal line <b>800</b>. The vertical line <b>810</b> should cross line <b>800</b> as desired by the physician, such that an osteotomy can be created on first metatarsal <b>710</b> in the proper location.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Next, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> shows the foot <b>700</b> having the precision cutting guide <b>200</b> positioned above the skin. In this figure, the two alignment screws <b>300</b> have already been installed to the alignment holes <b>240</b>, <b>241</b> of the cutting guide <b>200</b>. The horizontal notches <b>217</b>, <b>218</b> are positioned in line with the horizontal line <b>800</b>. Additionally, the upper alignment notch <b>216</b> is positioned over the vertical line <b>810</b>. The horizontal line <b>800</b> is visible through alignment slot <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> illustrates the foot <b>700</b> with the precision cutting guide <b>200</b> positioned properly on the foot <b>700</b> and the targeting guide <b>500</b> positioned over the precision cutting guide <b>200</b>. The targeting guide recess <b>515</b> is positioned over the targeting knob <b>227</b> to form a snug and secure fit. A guide wire <b>650</b> is positioned in the groove <b>530</b> and aimed at an anatomic landmark to assist the physician in ensuring that the precision cutting guide <b>200</b> is properly positioned for the surgical procedure. In this embodiment, the targeting guide <b>500</b> and the guide <b>650</b> are positioned to aim towards the 4<sup>th </sup>metatarsophalangeal joint of the patient. The alignment screws <b>300</b> are adjusted by the physician to touch the skin of foot <b>700</b>, which helps stabilize the precision cutting guide <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Next, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> shows the foot <b>700</b> with the precision cutting guide <b>200</b> in the proper position. In this figure, the alignment screws <b>300</b> have been tightened until they touch the skin of the foot <b>700</b>, and the targeting guide <b>500</b> is positioned properly. A guide wire <b>650</b> is then inserted through the targeting guide cannula <b>512</b> and then through the center targeting hole <b>235</b>, and then through the skin and into the first metatarsal <b>710</b>. If desired, the physician can use fluoroscopy to confirm whether the cutting guide slot <b>207</b> is at the proper location for the surgical procedure. In this embodiment, the cutting guide insert <b>206</b> is radiopaque, causing the cutting guide slot <b>207</b> to be easily identified by the physician in fluoroscopy. If necessary, the physician can now use the adjustment holes <b>230</b> to further refine the position of the precision cutting guide <b>200</b>, without the need to drill additional holes in the first metatarsal <b>710</b>. Usually, the physician would want to position the cutting guide slot <b>207</b> so that it is vertically centered in the first metatarsal <b>710</b>. By removing the targeting guide <b>500</b>, the physician can move the precision cutting guide <b>200</b> such that the guide wire <b>650</b> passes through the desired adjustment hole <b>230</b>, which has the effect of moving the cutting guide slot <b>207</b> relative to the first metatarsal <b>710</b>. In this embodiment, the eight adjustment holes <b>230</b> permit vertical, horizontal, and diagonal repositioning of precision cutting guide <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Looking next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, the precision cutting guide <b>200</b> is rotated approximately 90 degrees relative to the foot <b>700</b> about the guide wire <b>650</b>. The targeting guide <b>500</b> has been removed and is no longer needed in this method of surgery. In this vertical position, the utility of the edge <b>209</b> is revealed. The physician can now use a scalpel or cutting tool to make a tissue incision <b>1000</b> in the foot <b>700</b> along the curvilinear path of the edge <b>209</b>. Of course, where the edge <b>209</b> is a straight edge or an edge having a different curvilinear path, the incision would mirror the shape and length of the edge <b>209</b>. The physician can start at either lower notch <b>215</b> or <b>219</b>, and proceed to the other notch, thus creating a curved incision at the proper location with a known length. In this embodiment, the length of the incision would be 1 centimeter, because that is the curvilinear distance along the edge <b>209</b> between notches <b>215</b> and <b>219</b>. Of course, the length of the incision could vary based on any number of factors.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Next, the retractors <b>600</b>, <b>625</b> are used. More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref> illustrates the foot <b>700</b> with the retractors <b>600</b>, <b>625</b> in position to retract soft tissue away from the first metatarsal <b>710</b> underneath. Either retractor <b>600</b>, <b>625</b> can be used, or both, as desired by the physician. The guide wire <b>650</b> is shown in the center targeting hole <b>235</b>, however as noted previously, the physician can use any of the adjustment holes <b>230</b> to allow more precise positioning of the precision cutting guide <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref> show the foot <b>700</b> with the retractors <b>600</b>, <b>625</b> in position on soft tissue, after the precision cutting guide <b>200</b> has been rotated back to the horizontal position and over the retractors <b>600</b>, <b>625</b>. The precision cutting guide <b>200</b> is realigned with the horizontal line <b>800</b> such that the line <b>800</b> is visible in the alignment slot <b>210</b>. Due to the design of the precision cutting guide <b>200</b>, the tissue incision <b>1000</b> made by cutting tissue along the edge <b>209</b> will now fall directly under the cutting guide slot <b>207</b>. The physician now has access to the first metatarsal <b>710</b> through the cutting guide slot <b>207</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Next, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref> illustrates the precision cutting guide <b>200</b> in position on the foot <b>700</b>, with the cutting guide slot <b>207</b> positioned over the skin incision <b>1000</b>. The physician can anchor the precision cutting guide <b>200</b> with additional guide wires if desired. For instance, guide wires <b>650</b> are shown passing through the cannula <b>320</b> of both alignment screws <b>300</b>, into the upper and lower alignment holes <b>240</b>, <b>241</b> of the precision cutting guide <b>200</b>, and then continuing through skin until the guide wires <b>650</b> reach the first metatarsal <b>710</b>. There are three guide wires <b>650</b> shown anchoring the precision cutting guide <b>200</b> to the first metatarsal <b>710</b>. In this embodiment, the three guide wires <b>650</b> anchored into the first metatarsal <b>710</b>, and the two alignment screws <b>300</b> pressing against skin, plus the shape and contour of the precision cutting guide <b>200</b>, all combine to create a stable and secure attachment to the foot <b>700</b> in preparation for an osteotomy.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref> illustrates the next step in the surgical procedure, in which the screw guide <b>450</b> has been inserted into the guide tube slot <b>250</b>.

An additional guide wire <b>650</b> has been inserted into the screw guide <b>450</b>, and passes through the skin of the foot <b>700</b> into the first metatarsal <b>710</b>. The physician can use fluoroscopy if desired to ensure the guide wire <b>650</b> is in the proper location of the first metatarsal <b>710</b>, and the physician can reorient the tissue protector sleeve <b>455</b> in the guide tube slot <b>250</b>, if needed. The physician can then use the depth gauge measurements <b>465</b> to determine the length of implant needed for surgery.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b>A</figref> shows the guide wire <b>650</b> associated with the guide tube slot <b>250</b> partially removed so that the guide wire <b>650</b> is no longer underneath the cutting guide slot <b>207</b>. In addition, the screw guide <b>450</b> has been removed. The physician can now use a cutting instrument such as bone saw <b>1100</b>, cutting bur, scalpel or other instrument to pass through the cutting guide slot <b>207</b>, through the skin incision into first metatarsal <b>710</b>, and create an osteotomy in the first metatarsal <b>710</b>. The first metatarsal <b>710</b> now is separated such that first metatarsal fragment <b>711</b> is detached from the remainder of first metatarsal <b>710</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b>B</figref> is a cutaway view without the components other than the guide wires <b>650</b> to better show what is occurring to the first metatarsal <b>710</b>. The bone saw <b>1100</b> is intersecting the first metatarsal <b>710</b> such that it creates the osteotomy <b>1050</b>. Although the osteotomy <b>1050</b> appears as a polygon in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b>B</figref>, it is the extension of bone saw <b>1100</b> making a V-shaped cut through cylindrical and curved first metatarsal <b>710</b> based on the shape of the cutting guide slot <b>207</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref> is a top plan view of the foot <b>700</b> after the physician has corrected the deformity by using the osteotomy to realign first metatarsal fragment <b>711</b> in the desired position, where the various bone components are shown in phantom, without the components other than the various guide wires <b>650</b> to better show what is occurring.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref> shows the foot <b>700</b> with a hole being drilled for an implant.
