Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to hydrophobic mineral insulants comprising at least one aminofunctional organosilicon compound having an amine number in the range from 0.05 to 0.40 and also to a method for producing them and to the use of amino-functional organosilicon compounds having an amine number in the range from 0.05 to 0.40 for hydrophobicizing mineral insulants.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">DE102009054566A1 for example reports on the need for mineral insulants and the advantages.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An example of a typical mineral insulant is mineral wool. Mineral wool is produced from melt fiberization and processes for this are well known, as exemplified by WO2019/025706. The binder/binders, the hydrophobicizing component, the dust-binder, and any further components are sprayed onto the still hot fibers from so-called spinners, in general, directly after the fiber-foil ling step.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Mineral wool, when freshly produced, is inherently hydrophilic. This is the case particularly when no phenol-formaldehyde resin-based binders are used. The use of &#x201c;green binders&#x201d; based on organic renewable raw materials such as starch (e.g. WO2019/025672A1, Saint-Gobain). In another example, the shunning of binder for the &#x201c;blowing wool&#x201d; (e.g. WO2014/044900A1, Acoustic Scandinavia) or blown-in insulation is used. These are major trends in the industry, owing to the significantly more sustainable mode of operation.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Mineral wool before being used as insulating material is generally given a hydrophobic treatment. This may be implemented, for example, by reactive or nonreactive organosilicon compounds, generally polydimethylsiloxanes or silicone resins. CN104402211A describes the use of SILRES&#xae; BS 1042, an aqueous emulsion of a polydimethylsiloxane. WO2019/043078A1 describes the use of SILRES&#xae; BS 45, a solvent-free silicone resin emulsion.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The organosilicon compounds used, however, have little interaction with the mineral fibers. In order to achieve a uniform covering, therefore, the hydrophobicizing agent must be applied directly after the fiber production process, especially if the fiber is very hot, in order to break the emulsion and to distribute the silicone as uniformly as possible over the fiber. The amount added, moreover, must be chosen to be relatively high.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Surprisingly it has now been found that the use of amino-functional organosilicon compounds having an amine number in the range from 0.05 to 0.40, especially in the form of emulsions, for hydrophobicizing mineral insulants solves these problems in the prior art. Accordingly, by using such emulsions, a very effective and uniform distribution of the hydrophobicizing component on the mineral fibers is achieved and additionally a long-lasting hydrophobization is obtained on account of the high interaction. There is, moreover, a rapid covering of the surface, and there is no need for &#x201c;breaking&#x201d; of the emulsion by rapid evaporation of the solvent. Mineral insulants can therefore be treated both at high temperatures and at relatively low temperature.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">This allows the hydrophobicizing also to be carried out independently of the process of producing the mineral insulants. An optional possibility, moreover, is to do without the use of an adhesion promotor.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">One subject of the invention are hydrophobic mineral insulants comprising at least one amino-functional organosilicon compound having an amine number in the range from 0.05 to 0.40.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Mineral insulants are those both of natural origin and of synthetic origin. Examples are expanded clay, calcium silicates such as vermiculite, mineral foam, perlites, foamed glass, mineral wools such as rockwool and glass wool. For insulation these materials are used customarily in the form of fibers, pellets, mats, sheets or other shaped parts.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The mineral wool insulants include, for example, synthetic glass fibers, glass fibers, ceramic fibers, basalt fibers, rock fibers, etc.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The mineral wool insulants may take any desired form, such as sheets and mats, for example, or the form of a binder-free variant referred to as &#x201c;blowing wool&#x201d; for blown-in insulation.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A preferred mineral insulant used is mineral wool, and more preferably the mineral insulant used is glass wool, rockwool or &#x201c;blowing wool&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The mineral insulants may comprise binders or may be free of binders; the presence of binder has no influence on the technical effect of the invention. Typical binders, for glass wool or rockwool, for example, are phenol-formaldehyde, melamine formaldehyde, or carbohydrate-based binders (based on starch, for example). Additionally, the mineral insulants may optionally comprise further components such as dust-binders, in the form of mineral oil emulsions, for example, or adhesion promoters, such as silanes having amino side chains or silanes having glycidyloxy side chains or silanes having ureido side chains, for example.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The amino-functional organosilicon compound must have an amine number in the range from 0.05 to 0.40. The amine number is preferably in a range from 0.10 to 0.20.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The amine number is understood by definition to be the amount of potassium hydroxide (KOH) in mg which is equated with the amine fraction of 1 g of substance. It may be determined for example by potentiometric titration or titration against bromophenol blue, as described in DIN 53176. In the case of mixtures of amino-functional organosilicon compounds, accordingly, a mean amine number is obtained for the mixture.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The amino-functional organosilicon compound may be an oligomeric or polymeric organosilicon compound, and may be linear or branched. The amino groups may be distributed randomly in the molecule or may be arranged terminally. There may be further reactive groups, such as hydrolysable groups (e.g., alkoxy groups), for example.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The amino-functional organosilicon compound is preferably at least one compound of the formula (I)</p><p id="p-0021" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>(SiO<sub>4/2</sub>)<sub>a</sub>(R<sup>1</sup>SiO<sub>3/2</sub>)<sub>b</sub>(R<sup>2</sup>SiO<sub>3/2</sub>)<sub>b&#x2032;</sub>(R<sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>2/2</sub>)<sub>c</sub>(R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup>SiO<sub>2/2</sub>)<sub>c&#x2032;</sub>(R<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>2/2</sub>)<sub>c&#x2033;</sub>(R<sup>1</sup><sub>3</sub>SiO<sub>1/2</sub>)<sub>d</sub>)R<sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub>R<sup>2</sup>SiO<sub>1/2</sub>)<sub>d&#x2032;</sub>(R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>1/2</sub>)<sub>d&#x2033;</sub>(R<sup>2</sup><sub>3</sub>SiO<sub>1/2</sub>)<sub>d&#x2032;&#x2033;</sub>&#x2003;&#x2003;(I),<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0022" num="0020">in which the indices a, b, c, c&#x2032;, c&#x2033;, d, d&#x2032;, d&#x2033; and d&#x2032;&#x2033; indicate the number of the respective siloxane unit in the compound and independently of one another are an integer in the range from 0 to 100,000, with the proviso that the sum of a, b, b&#x2032;, c, c&#x2032;, c&#x2033;, d, d&#x2032;, d&#x2033;, d&#x2032;&#x2033; together adopts a value of at least 2, and at least one of the indices b&#x2032;, c&#x2032;, c&#x2033;, d&#x2032;, d&#x2033; or d&#x2032;&#x2033; is other than 0; and in which the radicals R<sup>1 </sup>independently of one another are a C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>18 </sub>hydrocarbon radical which is unsubstituted or substituted by at least one fluorine, chlorine or bromine atom or by a C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>18 </sub>alkoxy group, and in which the radicals R<sup>2 </sup>are a group of the general formula (II)</p><p id="p-0023" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x2014;R&#x2014;[NR&#x2032;(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>]<sub>a</sub>N(R&#x2032;)<sub>2</sub>&#x2003;&#x2003;(II),<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0024" num="0021">in which the index n adopts the values 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, the index a adopts the values 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, the radical R is a divalent, linear, unbranched or branched C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>18</sub>-hydrocarbon radical, the radicals R&#x2032; independently of one another are selected from the group consisting of (i) hydrogen, (ii) C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>18 </sub>hydrocarbon radical which is unsubstituted or substituted by at least one fluorine, chlorine or bromine atom or by a hydroxyl group or by a C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>5 </sub>alkoxy group, or (iii) acyl radical which is unsubstituted or substituted by at least one fluorine, chlorine or bromine atom or by a hydroxyl group or by a C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>5 </sub>25 alkoxy group.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0022">With particular preference an amino-functional organosilicon compound as follows is used: in formula (I) the radicals R<sup>1 </sup>independently of one another are a C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6 </sub>alkyl radical, more particularly a methyl radical; and in formula (II) the index a adopts a value of 1, the index n adopts a value of 2, the radicals R&#x2032; are hydrogen, and the radical R is a divalent C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6 </sub>hydrocarbon radical, more particularly a propylene radical.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0023">Amino-functional organosilicon compounds per se are known and may be produced in ways including those described in EP1580215 or DE2339761, such as by reaction of silanol-terminated silanes or polydimethylsiloxanes with amino-functional silanes, for example.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0024">Amino-functional organosilicon compounds are also available commercially, as silicone oils, for example, or in the form of emulsions.
