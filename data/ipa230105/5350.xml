Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to property management systems and, more specifically, to a dock management system.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many recreational boat owners own their own docks at which they secure their boats during the boating season. Such docks are often either mounted on wheeled structures or floating docks that are secured to the shore. When lake levels rise as a result of heavy rains, a movable dock must be moved shoreward so that people can access it. Similarly, when lake levels go down as a result of drought, the dock must be moved away from the shore so that the boat will not be grounded.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Dock and boat security are important issues. Every year, many boats are stolen by an individual transporting them to another portion of a lake. Also, boats sometimes become untethered and drift in the lake, which can be hazardous both to the boat and to others.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Many personal docks are wired for electric power, taking power from the grid and using it for lighting the dock and applying auxiliary power to the boat while it is secured to the dock. The wiring for such power is usually placed under the dock. If such wiring becomes degraded through age, it can create a shock hazard.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Many dock owners live well away from their docks and inspect them only when they are at the lake during weekends and vacations. As a result, they may not be aware of situations that require their attention on a real time basis.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Fluctuating water levels due to weather patterns and power requirements frequently ground docks, thus costing dock owners thousands of dollars in damages each year. To prevent damage to docks, lifts, and boats as well as theft and potential loss of life, docks must be monitored continuously. Currently, docks are monitored by the dock owners or dock service companies making frequent visits to the docks and visually inspecting them. This type of monitoring can be time consuming, expensive and can lead to harmful results when the docks are not inspected in sufficient detail.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Also, it is known that a high percentage of ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCI) tend to fail when used in outdoor environments. A system that trips a GFCI when a hazardous voltage is sensed in the dock environment, but that does not ensure that the dock wiring is disconnected from a voltage source can give users a false belief that there are no hazards present, which can result in serious consequences.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, there is a need for a dock information system that provides dock owners with real time information about their docks while the owners are away from their docks.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The disadvantages of the prior art are overcome by the present invention which, in one aspect, is an apparatus for managing a dock, a portion of which is disposed over a body of water, from a remote device. A control unit is disposed on the dock. A plurality of sensors is each in data communication with the control unit. Each of the plurality of sensors includes: an electric shock sensor; a water level sensor that senses a distance to the water from a predetermined location of the dock; and a theft detection circuit. A communication chipset is in data communication with the control unit. The control unit includes a processor that is programmed to transmit to the remote device via the communication chipset an indication of the following: a shock likelihood sensed by the electric shock sensor; a level detected by the water level sensor; and an alert when the theft detection circuit detects a likelihood of theft.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another aspect, the invention is a device for managing a dock, a portion of which is disposed over a body of water. A remote device includes a wireless device selected from a list of wireless devices consisting of: a smart cellular telephone; and tablet PC, a desktop computer and a laptop computer. A control unit is disposed on the dock. A plurality of sensors is each in data communication with the control unit. Each of the plurality of sensors includes: an electric shock sensor that is configured to measure a water voltage between the body of water and a ground and that is configured to trigger a ground fault interrupter circuit to disconnect components of the device from a power supply when a predetermined threshold has been reached; an ultrasound water level sensor that senses a distance to the water from a predetermined location of the dock; and a movement detector that is configured to detect movement of the dock. A cellular telephone chipset is in data communication with the control unit. The control unit includes a processor that is programmed to transmit to the remote device via the cellular telephone chipset an indication of the following: a shock likelihood sensed by the electric shock sensor; and a level detected by the water level sensor. The control unit sets a predetermined perimeter around the dock whenever the dock is purposely repositioned and the control unit issues an alert whenever the movement detector indicates that any part of the dock has moved outside of the predetermined perimeter.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another aspect, the invention is an apparatus for managing a dock, having a dock frame and a dock wiring system that is connected to a power source by a dock breaker, the dock being disposed in water, configured for use with a remote unit. The apparatus includes a shock detection system. The shock detection system includes at least one electricity probe configured to detect an electric voltage between a ground and at least one of the dock frame or the water and a shock hazard indicator disposed adjacent to the dock that generates a human-perceptible indication of a shock hazard when a shock warning signal is asserted. The system includes a communication chipset and a dock access detection system. The dock access detection system includes a digital camera mounted on the dock and aimed at a first predetermined location on the dock and two infrared sensors spaced apart from each other and mounted on the dock. A control unit is responsive to the shock detection system and is disposed on the dock and including a communication chipset in communication with the remote unit. The control unit is also in communication with the digital camera, the two infrared sensors and the communication chipset. The control unit includes a processor that is programmed to: store a first voltage value received from the at least one electricity probe, the first voltage value being no greater than a voltage known to be safe and designated as a baseline safe voltage; receive a plurality of second voltage values from the at least one electricity probe; and when at least two successive second voltage values of the plurality second voltage values exceeds the baseline safe voltage by a preset margin, then assert the shock warning signal, opening the dock breaker and transmitting a shock warning indication to the remote unit via the communication chipset. The processor is also programmed to: receive an indication from each of the two infrared sensors that motion had been detected; when both of the two infrared sensors indicate motion has been detected, then cause the digital camera to take at least one picture of the first predetermined location; submit the at least one picture to an artificial intelligence routine to determine if a probability that the at least one picture includes an image of a human is above a predetermined threshold; when the probability is above the predetermined threshold, then transmit an alert and a copy of the picture to the remote unit; and take a deterrent action at the dock when the probability is above the predetermined threshold.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another aspect, the invention is an electric shock detection system for use with a dock having a dock frame and a dock wiring system that is connected to a power source by a dock breaker, the dock being disposed in water.

Such a dock <b>10</b> is positioned in the water of a lake <b>12</b> and secured to the shore 14. The dock <b>10</b> can include wiring <b>20</b> that provides auxiliary power to the boat <b>16</b> and that powers a security light <b>18</b>. A dock management system <b>100</b> can include a master unit <b>110</b> that communicates with spaced apart sensors <b>1014</b> a video camera <b>112</b> so as to provide information to and receive control data from a remote device, such as a cellular telephone, a laptop computer, a desktop computer and the like. Communication can be effected via a transceiver that communicates, for example, via such devices as: a cellular chipset; a wireless network; a hard-wired network, and the like. Both the boat <b>16</b> and the master unit <b>110</b> can be equipped with a global positioning system (GPS) system that derives location data from GPS satellites <b>22</b>. The master unit <b>110</b> collects data from the sensors <b>114</b> and the video camera <b>112</b> and transmits the data to a remote location. In one embodiment, the camera <b>112</b> includes a chipset that transmits video data directly to a node, such as a Wi-Fi transceiver. Additional components (e.g., a motion sensor, a siren, etc.) can be included in a component box <b>116</b> affixed to the lamp pole. The remote location can be, for example, a cellular telephone tower that further transmits the data to a dock management company or to an individual user. The data can be displayed on a computer or a smart phone.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one embodiment, energy can be harvested from a solar panel <b>120</b>. In this embodiment, the controller in the master unit <b>110</b> uses a voltage regulation circuit that provides a steady 5 VDC source from a 3V to 30V solar panel input to the rest of the system. When AC main power is detected from an AC power-on detection circuit&#x2014;indicating that the system is being powered from the power grid, the controller disables the solar panel regulator so as to protect the remaining circuitry from excessive voltage input.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the system <b>100</b> can communicate with an owner via a smart phone <b>230</b>, who can then communicate with a dock management company directly <b>240</b> directly (also via smart phone), or it can communicate directly with the dock management company <b>240</b> directly if the owner authorizes such direct communication. The system <b>100</b> can include a suite of sensors and controlled devices, all of which communicate with a master processor/controller <b>210</b>. For example, the master processor/controller <b>210</b> can include a cellular chipset for communicating with the user and a wireless local personal area network chipset <b>211</b> (e.g., a Bluetooth&#xae; chipset or a ZigBee chipset) for communicating with devices that are local to the dock <b>10</b>. The master processor/controller <b>210</b> can receive input data from devices including, but not limited to: a shock sensor <b>212</b>; a water depth sensor <b>214</b>; a motion detector <b>219</b>; a camera <b>216</b> (the direction of which can be controlled by the master processor/controller <b>210</b> in some embodiments); a dock-mounted GPS chipset <b>218</b>, which provides current location data about the dock <b>10</b>; a boat-mounted GPS chipset <b>220</b>, which provides location data about the boat <b>16</b>; an ambient air temperature sensor <b>222</b>; and a water temperature sensor <b>224</b>. The master processor/controller <b>210</b> can receive backup power from a battery backup <b>221</b> and it can communicate using Wi-Fi via a Wi-Fi gateway <b>223</b>. Also, it can control a siren <b>217</b> or other audible alarm and the lamp <b>228</b> for security reasons.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the battery backup system provides power to the majority of the system devices and can include a battery recharging circuit <b>252</b> that uses power from the power grid to charge one or more batteries <b>250</b>. A battery voltage monitoring circuit <b>254</b> (which is shown separate from the recharging circuit <b>252</b>, but which can be integrated with it) monitors the current battery voltage and provides low battery voltage notifications. The system devices that can be powered by the battery backup <b>221</b> can include, the voltage detection circuit <b>254</b>, the siren <b>217</b>, a radio <b>256</b>, the master control unit (MCU) <b>210</b>, a watchdog circuit <b>260</b> (which is a timer circuit that periodically listens to the processor <b>210</b> for an indication that it is still operating and that causes the processor <b>210</b> to reboot if such an indication is not received&#x2014;thus, the watchdog circuit resets the system in the case of an unresponsive MCU by sending an active-low reset pulse control signal), an AC frame detection circuit <b>262</b> that determines if the main box for the master unit <b>110</b> has a voltage that would give rise to a potential shock hazard (essentially, the AC frame detection circuit <b>262</b> can identify a source of electric shock as being from the frame versus the water), and a power-on detection circuit <b>264</b> that indicates that the system is working. In one embodiment, the batteries can include lithium polymer (LiPo) batteries and the recharging circuit <b>221</b>&#x2014;allows the LiPo battery to be charged to 4.2V. The battery voltage monitoring circuit <b>254</b> detects and measures the battery voltage. This can be used to determine if the batteries are nearing their end-of-life. A battery low-voltage management circuit can hold certain items, such as the MCU <b>210</b> and the radio <b>256</b> in a suspended reset state (Active LOW) if battery voltage gets down to a predetermined voltage, which in one embodiment is 3.08V. It can also send a low battery alarm and operates in a low power mode, in which certain non-essential loads are taken off line.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one embodiment, the system <b>100</b> includes an unauthorized person's detection mechanism (such as a theft detection circuit <b>266</b>) that can employ a motion sensor, such as an infra-red or ultrasonic motion sensor to detect movement on the dock. Upon detecting motion, the camera takes a picture of the dock and an artificial intelligence routine (which could run on, for example, a local processor, a central server, or a cloud-based service) determines if an image of a human being is detected. If the system detects the presence of a human, then the camera is instructed to take pictures periodically (e.g., every four seconds), the siren <b>214</b> is triggered and the owner or manager is alerted. This embodiment can deter theft, vandalism and other situations in which unauthorized people are present on the dock.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, the shock detection unit <b>212</b> measures a water voltage relative to ground and can trip a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) <b>270</b> if that voltage is above a predetermined level, thereby disconnecting grid (or other supply) power from the electrical components on the dock.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one embodiment, an industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) radio <b>256</b> can be used in association with the electric shock detector, which can employ a 2.4 GHz radio running ZigBee two-way wireless communication to communicate data to the controller/collector. The electric shock detector <b>212</b> uses a GFCI tripping circuit <b>270</b> which applies a 5 mA current from line to ground to trip most GFCIs. The GFCI will be tripped when the voltage read from the voltage detection circuit reads 1 volt or greater. The electric shock detector <b>212</b> can also implement an auto-learning feature that, once enabled, sets the non-hazardous voltage read from the voltage detection circuit as the baseline. The system then triggers an alarm and/or wireless alerts when the voltage read from the voltage detection circuit reads 1 volt or greater than the baseline voltage. The baseline voltage can also learn a new baseline voltage at any interval which is useful for monitoring voltages in lakes that already have fluctuating (albeit safe) inherent voltage in the water. Additionally, a shock detector can detect a short in the above-water components to determine if a shock hazard exists and, if so, it can take appropriate actions.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>, the motion detector <b>219</b> can include such items as an accelerometer <b>280</b>, a magnetometer <b>282</b> and a digital compass <b>284</b> to supply information about movement of the dock. These items can be integrated with the MCU <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Regarding the accelerometer <b>280</b> and magnetometer <b>282</b> and digital compass <b>284</b> sensors, the controller <b>210</b> utilizes a special IC sensor with integrated accelerometer <b>280</b> and magnetometer <b>282</b>. The accelerometer <b>280</b> can be used to communicate relative dock motion in 3 axes. The magnetometer is used to determine the controller/dock's relative heading. This is useful for determining when a floating dock cable breaks which causes the dock heading to shift. This heading shift is recorded by the sensor and communicated to the system which sends wireless alerts and alarms. The depth sensor <b>214</b> can be integrated with the temperature sensor <b>224</b>. The dock controller <b>210</b> interfaces with an application specific ultrasonic depth sensor that also measures and communicates water depth and water temperature to the system. This data can be used to determine when a dock needs to be moved. If the depth is below or above a user-set threshold, then a wireless alert and an alarm may sound.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">A situation in which the water level in the lake <b>12</b> has risen so that the shoreline has expanded from a previous position <b>14</b><i>a </i>to a current position <b>14</b><i>b </i>is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>. In this situation, the system <b>100</b> can contact the owner may via a smart phone <b>230</b> app that provides information regarding the increased water depth under the dock <b>10</b>. In such a situation, the owner can contact the dock manager <b>240</b> with the app to request that the dock <b>10</b> be moved in the direction of arrow A. The owner could select an option in which the system <b>100</b> automatically communicates with the dock manager <b>240</b> to request movement of the dock <b>10</b>. This figure also shows the situation in which the system <b>100</b> indicates that the boat <b>16</b> has moved away from the dock <b>10</b> based on the GPS coordinates of the boat <b>16</b>, which could indicate either that it has become untethered or stolen. In this situation, the user can use the app on the smart phone <b>230</b> to contact the police or the dock manager <b>240</b> to take appropriate action. The situation in which lake has receded is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, in which the current position <b>14</b><i>c </i>of the shoreline requires that the dock <b>10</b> be moved inwardly in the direction of arrow B. Again, the user can use the app on the smart phone <b>230</b> to contact the dock manager <b>240</b> to take appropriate action.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Also, the system can define a perimeter <b>310</b> (also referred to as a &#x201c;GeoFence&#x201d;) around the dock <b>16</b><i>a </i>when it is in a secured position. If the dock becomes partially unsecured, such a due to untethering of one of the securing cables, allowing the dock <b>16</b><i>b </i>to move into an unsecured position, then the motion detector <b>219</b> (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>) will detect movement of the dock <b>16</b><i>b </i>outside of the perimeter <b>310</b> and the system <b>100</b> will alert the dock manager and the owner of the movement of the dock <b>16</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the user can access the system via a smart phone <b>230</b>, on which several different screen configurations may be displayed. In the example shown, the user can view video freeze frames of the dock <b>410</b> by selecting a video mode <b>412</b>. One alternate embodiment can transmit full motion real time video from the dock. At night, the user can select a &#x201c;Lamp On&#x201d; mode <b>414</b>, which turns dock lighting on for better viewing. The dock height <b>416</b> indicates how high a certain point of the dock is above the water level. The water temperature <b>418</b> and the temperature of the controller <b>420</b> are also presented to the user. There can be an indication <b>422</b> of whether the shock detector has detected a shock hazard. If the water level is such that the dock should be moved either in or out, an alert <b>430</b> to that effect may be presented to the user and the user may also be presented with at &#x201c;Request Move&#x201d; button <b>432</b> which sends a request to the user's dock service company requesting that it move the dock. A similar display can be presented to a dock manager, who may also access a display of the status of all of the docks under its management, including a status list of all requested dock moves.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the user initially powers on the MCU and the depth sensor <b>510</b> to run the system and then the user inputs customer information and a ID/password <b>512</b>. A customer app is then sent to the user <b>514</b>, which is installed on the user's smart phone and then the user can assess the system <b>516</b> to receive alerts, monitor the dock and request dock services.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Communications between the dock and the users can be effected in one of the many ways common to remote communications. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> in one embodiment, the system <b>100</b> includes a Wi-Fi chipset that communicates with a Wi-Fi node <b>630</b> near the dock. The Wi-Fi node <b>630</b> could be in communication with the global computer network <b>30</b>. Alternatively, the system <b>100</b> could communicate with a Wi-Fi node <b>612</b> in the owner's lake house <b>610</b>, if the node <b>612</b> has sufficient range. In another embodiment, the system <b>100</b> could communicate with a Wi-Fi repeater/booster/extender <b>622</b> that communicates with a Wi-Fi node <b>620</b> at a central location, such as a dock manager's office <b>240</b>. Additionally, the system <b>100</b> can include a cellular chipset that communicates directly with the concerned parties via a cellular system. Also, the system <b>100</b> could be part of a mesh network (such as a ZigBee network) that employs several other similar systems. Also, it could be hardwired or employ private radio communications, depending on the specific circumstances in which it is employed.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The present invention offers users smart mobile monitoring for docks and boats through the use of smart controller and mobile software platform, which can be used by both dock owners and dock dealers/service companies. The mobile dock management technology and service monitors, tracks, and manages docks and boats to provide a safe and secure marine environment. The system can prevent the loss or damage of valuable assets, prevent the loss of lake access, eliminate unnecessary cost, and potentially prevent the loss of life from electric shock. It connects the user, via a cellular network, to multiple devices, such as video cameras, GPS devices, water depth sensors, a water temperature gauge and light switches.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The system adds intelligence to dock and boat management by notifying the owner of problems, irrespective of the owner's location.

The user can also set a &#x201c;geo fence&#x201d; around dock and boats to establish a home position. The user can access a video camera on the dock to see the shoreline and monitor such personal items as boats. Using the app, the user can request services from the dock dealer by touching the screen of the user's smart phone.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In one embodiment, the system monitors docks remotely via a mobile app and dock management system. It receives automatic alerts via notifications and text, communicates with each dock to confirm location, water depth, and movement. It can be used to check video data to monitor the shoreline, the ramp, the dock, the boat and other personal items. When used by a dock manager, it can be used to collect dock movement fees via the mobile app and to provide the mobile app to the customer. The system also allows dock owners to communicate with their dock manager via the mobile app to order services.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The invention offers several advantages, including: it decreases operating costs; it provides automatic notification of docks that need moving; it eliminates unnecessary on-site visits; it decreases gas and wage expenses; it provides GPS dock identification &#x26; movement detection; and it ensures that dock fees are paid instantly via the mobile app.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, one embodiment of the shock safety system includes: a battery backup <b>710</b> that provides auxiliary DC power to the Electric Shock Safety System during mains AC power outage; a battery charging and protection circuit <b>712</b> that provides: current-limited charging voltage to the Battery Backup System, over-charge battery protection, over-discharge battery protection, and visual charging status and charging complete indicators; a voltage measurement circuit <b>714</b> that provides accurate full-range AC measurement from OVAC to 120 VAC, the output of which is routed to the host MCU, Zigbee, or Cellular Communications device; a dock main GFCI power shutoff <b>716</b> that shut-off trips the shore power pole GFCI breaker that feeds power to the dock (this feature is activated either by either the presence of electricity in the water or frame of the dock, depending on the sensitivity mode selected; this feature is also activated depending on the adverse electrical conditions as output from the Dock Wiring Analyzing Circuit); a test mode button <b>718</b> that allows for testing of the hazard light and siren as well as the shore power pole GFCI functionality (forces tripping of the dock electrical safety system), additionally, the test mode selects the shock detection voltage sensitivity level during the configuration mode which is initiated by a system reset by use of the system reset button; a unit status light <b>720</b> that displays the system status (the following status may be displayed via a bi-color illumination system: shock sensitivity level configuration mode; shock sensor association/pairing to a parent/coordinator/dock controller or cellular connectivity; six electrical wiring conditions via distinct illumination patterns); a communications chipset <b>722</b> that provides the host microprocessor functions in addition to the wireless communication of either Zigbee, Cellular (LTE), Bluetooth (BLE), or Digimesh protocols; a system reset button <b>724</b> that provides the ability to reset the Host MCU, Zigbee, and/or Cellular Communications Device; two shock probes <b>726</b>&#x2014;one for use in detecting shock hazards in the water and the other for detecting shock hazards on the dock frame, which provide connection of the Voltage Measurement Circuit and the frame of the dock/electrical ground and the water; a hazard light and a siren system <b>728</b> that illuminates a daylight-readable illumination device and audible siren under adverse electrical conditions as determined by the Voltage Measurement Circuit or Dock Wiring Analyzing Circuit that visually and audibly conveys the current and desired shock sensitivity level during the configuration mode; a power indicator <b>730</b> that provides visual feedback to the presence of AC mains power applied to the Electric Shock Detection System; a dock wiring analyzing circuit <b>732</b> that provides electrical circuit wiring detection with the ability to detect a minimum of 6 common electrical wiring conditions, in which each condition allows for a different and distinct Electric Shock Safety (for example; a variable alarm threshold circuit <b>734</b> for setting an safe amount of background voltage in the water as a baseline voltage; and an auxiliary relay <b>736</b> for shutting off power to auxiliary devices.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the shock safety system, the processor of the dock wiring analyzing circuit <b>732</b> is programmed to: receive voltage values from the electricity probes <b>726</b> and when at least two successive second voltage values exceeds the baseline safe voltage by a preset margin, then assert the shock warning signal <b>728</b>, opening the GFCI power shutoff dock breaker <b>716</b> and transmitting a shock warning indication to the remote unit via the communication chipset <b>722</b>. The control unit cuts off power to the dock and issues alerts when the voltage values exceed the safe baseline value by a preset margin at least two times in one second, but ignores short voltage transients.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The shock detection system can prevent electric shock drowning (ESD) by monitoring the dock frame and water for stray electricity. Stray electricity occurs when electricity escapes its intended circuit and ESD occurs when a person in the water comes in contact with a stray electric current path which causes paralysis, which can result in the victim drowning. When a hazardous voltage is detected, the siren sounds and flashes the red light, power is shut off to the dock instantly, and the unit goes on battery backup and continues to monitor for electricity. Preferably, the sensing distance is at least 80 ft. (depending on water conditions). A push button allows adjustment of threshold settings (e.g., low, medium, high). The system takes multiple readings each second to eliminate false positives from electrical spikes. When a hazardous condition is detected the system transmits a text message to the user and can telephone a dock manager regarding the situation. The system can also present to the remote unit real time voltage data graphs and reports and can track voltage levels on an hourly, daily or weekly basis.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In one embodiment, the following specifications are employed:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0062">Water or Dock Frame Voltage Sensing: 1250 mV</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0063">GFCI trip: 36 mA GFCI trip current</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0064">Sensing Distance: 80 ft.+*depending on water conditions</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0065">Siren and Hazard light: Sound pressure: 90&#xb1;5 dB(A), Outdoor visible</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0066">Battery backup: 24 hours, Chemistry: Lithium-polymer</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0067">Indicators: AC power-on &#x26; status Light</li>        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0068">AC Power: 120 VAC 60 Hz Input &#x26; 3 W Power Consumption</li>        <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0069">Environmental: &#x2212;20 to +65 C (&#x2212;4 F to 149 F), with IP66 rating</li>        <li id="ul0002-0009" num="0070">Zigbee Radio: Communicates with Dock IQ System, Range: 1200 m (4000 ft.)</li>        <li id="ul0002-0010" num="0071">Dimensions: 10&#x2033;&#xd7;7&#x2033;&#xd7;3&#x2033;</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0063" num="0072">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the dock wiring analyzing circuit <b>732</b> can indicate each of the following wiring conditions: correct wiring; open ground; open line; open neutral; line reversed with ground; and line reversed with neutral.

Next, it determines if the hazardous voltage is still present <b>1114</b> in the dock wiring system, which would indicate that the GFCI (i.e., the dock breaker) did not open correctly. In such a situation, the controller then transmits a faulty GFCI alert <b>1116</b>. Such an alert is important because a dock user might think that the tripping of the GFCI would remove any voltage hazards.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0087">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, one embodiment is a safety system for use with a community dock <b>2110</b> that includes a safety system <b>2000</b>.
