that are geographical and band specific. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has allocated spectrum into a table. Utilization is increased by slicing the spectrum into finer slices. Additionally, interference is limited by imposing penalties by strict geographical band utilization rules and licenses. However, these traditional methods of spectrum management do not work with increasing demand and new services coming out. The new services would have to be at higher frequencies (e.g., above 10 GHz), which is very expensive and requires costly transceiver with a limited distance range.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Spectrum is valuable because it is a finite resource. Further, the demand for spectrum is ever-increasing. The Shannon-Hartley theorem calculates the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted over a communications channel of a specified bandwidth in the presence of noise as follows:</p><p id="p-0097" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>C</i>=BW log<sub>2</sub>(1+SNR)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0098" num="0000">where C is the channel capacity in bits per second, BW is the bandwidth of the channel in Hz, and SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0096">Early attempts at managing spectrum include developing technology that increases spectrum efficiency (i.e., maximizing SNR). Although this results in more bits per Hz, the logarithmic function limits the gains in channel capacity resulting from improving technology. Additional attempts at managing spectrum also include developing technology to enable use of alternate spectrum (e.g., free-space optical (FSO) communication). However, using alternate spectrum, such as higher frequencies, leads to smaller ranges, line of sight limitations, increased elevation of transmission structures, and/or expensive infrastructure.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0097">The missing component to spectrum management is bandwidth management. Bandwidth management provides flexible utilization of the spectrum, enables management of spectrum resources and users, while allowing spectrum usage to be quantified. The majority of applications using the spectrum can coexist if each application knows about the spectrum needs of other applications and how they plan to use the spectrum. However, because the needs of each application are dynamic, a dynamic spectrum management system is needed. The present invention allows autonomous, dynamic sharing of the electromagnetic spectrum to allow maximum utilization by diverse applications according to specific utilization rules (dynamic and/or static) while maintaining minimum interference between applications. This requires new tools that provide dynamic environmental spectral awareness of all signals present in the electromagnetic (e.g., radio frequency (RF)) environment to properly execute utilization rules, which are operable to describe or facilitate sharing spectrum resources among several competing users or protect one service user from others, among others.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0098">5G requires spectrum awareness. Larger blocks of spectrum are required to support higher speeds. Dynamic spectrum sharing is necessary to make the spectrum assets available. Further, visibility of spectrum activity is required to support reliability targets. Interference avoidance and resolution must be embedded. Internet of Things (IoT)/machine communication wireless dependency elevates the need for real-time RF visibility to avoid disruption and safety concerns.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0099">The system of the present invention provides scalable processing capabilities at the edge. Edge processing is fast and reliable with low latency. Environmental sensing processes optimize collection and analytics, making data sets manageable. Advantageously, the system minimizes backhaul requirements, allowing for actionable data to be delivered faster and more efficiently.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0100">Deep learning techniques extract and deliver knowledge from large data sets in near-real time. These deep learning techniques are critical for identifying and classifying signals. Edge analytics further allow third party data (e.g., social media, population information, real estate information, traffic information, geographic information system) to further enrich captured data sets.

Decimation is based on channel bandwidth and desired resolution. However, these requirements are difficult to implement for channels with variable bandwidth and center frequency. Wavelet filters can be used effectively if the center frequency and channel's bandwidth follow a tree structure (e.g., Harr and Deubauchi wavelets). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is an example of a time domain programmable channelizer.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0151">In a preferred embodiment, the system includes a frequency domain programmable channelizer as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. The programmable channelizer includes buffer services, pre-processing, bin selection, at least one band pass filter (BPF), an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) function, decomposition, and/or frequency down conversion and phase correction to yield baseband I,Q for channels 1 through R. The IFFT function is done to obtain each decomposed channel I,Q at the proper sampling rate. Advantageously, the frequency domain programmable channelizer is more computationally efficient than a time domain programmable channelizer because each filter is just a vector in the frequency domain and the filtering operation is just a vector multiplication, decomposing the input signal into multiple channels of differing bandwidths is parsing the vector representing the input signal frequency domain content into a subvector of different length.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0152"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is another embodiment of a programmable channelizer. Data enters the filter and channels generators with channelization selector logic for a table lookup of filter coefficient and channelization vectors. The programmable channelizer includes a comparison at each channel, which provides anomalous detection using a mask with frequency and power, which is then sent to the learning engine and/or the alarm system (&#x201c;A&#x201d;). Data processed with the FFT is sent to the blind detection engine and/or for averaging processing (&#x201c;B&#x201d;). Data from the table lookup of filter coefficient and channelization vectors undergoes preprocessing with a mix circular rotator to produce D<sub>1 </sub>blocks of R<sub>1 </sub>points. A sum is taken of the D<sub>1 </sub>block, and an R<sub>1 </sub>point IFFT is taken to produce discor overlap samples OL<sub>1</sub>. This process occurs (e.g., in parallel) for D<sub>1 </sub>blocks of R<sub>1 </sub>points through DR blocks of R<sub>R </sub>points to produce OL<sub>1 </sub>through OL<sub>R</sub>, which are then sent to the classification engine (&#x201c;C&#x201d;). All data from the I,Q buffer is preferably stored in a buffered database (&#x201c;D&#x201d;). In one embodiment, the I,Q buffer is partitioned into N blocks with L oversamples. In one embodiment, the original sample rate is decimated by D<sub>i</sub>.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0153"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates one embodiment of a blind detection engine. Data from the programmable channelizer undergoes an N point FFT. A power spectral density (PSD) is calculated for each N point FFT and then a complex average FFT is obtained for the P blocks of N point FFT. The PSD is sent to a noise floor estimator, an edge detection algorithm, and/or an isolator. Noise floor estimates from the noise floor estimator are sent to the signal database. The edge detection algorithm passes information to a signal separator (e.g., bandwidth, center frequency). The isolator obtains information including, but not limited to, PSD, the bandwidth and center frequency per channel, the complex average FFT, and/or the N point FFT. Information from the isolator is sent to the programmable channelizer, the envelope feature extraction module, and/or the classification engine.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0154"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates one embodiment of an edge detection algorithm. Peaks are detected for all power values above the noise floor. Peaks are recorded in a power array and/or an index array. Consecutive power values are found by looping through the arrays. For each group of consecutive power values, a sub-power array and/or a sub-index array are created. The blind detection engine steps through each power value starting with a default rising threshold. If N consecutive values are increasing above the rising threshold, a first value of N values is set as the rising edge and the index of the first value of N values is recorded. The Nth value is recorded as a rising reference point. The rising threshold is updated based on the rising reference point, and the blind detection engine continues to scan for rising values. If the blind detection engine does not detect rising values and detects M consecutive values decreasing below a falling threshold, a first value of M values is set as the falling edge and the index of the first value of M values is recorded. The Mth value is recorded as a falling reference point. The falling threshold is updated based on the falling reference point. In one embodiment, x is a value between 1 dB and 2.5 dB. In one embodiment, y is a value between 1 dB and 2.5 dB.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0155">The blind classification engine receives information from the blind detection engine as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. Signals are separated based on bandwidth and/or other envelope properties (e.g., duty cycle). An IFFT is performed on R signals for narrowband and/or broadband signals. Decimation is then performed based on bandwidth. Moment calculations are performed for each signal I,Q using the decimated values and/or information from the channelizer. In a preferred embodiment, the moment calculations include a second moment and/or a fourth moment for each signal. A match based on cumulants is selected for each I,Q stream, which is sent to the demodulation bank and/or the geolocation engine.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0156">From the definitions of the second and

The geolocation engine is also operable to account for any transient signals that escape detection based on rotation speed. This is accomplished by using at least one broad antenna, reducing the chance of the system missing a signal, as well as reducing angular resolution. Practical considerations for these calculations include, but are not limited to, antenna rotation speed (<o ostyle="single">&#x3c9;</o>), a rate of arrival of signals (&#x3b3;), and/or a spatial sampling rate (F<sub>ps</sub>).</p><p id="p-0198" num="0189">The system is further operable to use amplitude ratio methods for geolocation.

When this method is used, the system behaves like a spinning DF system where the resulting beam is changing for each search angle.

For example, a local maximum of the average filter output power is operable to be shifted away from the true direction of arrival (DOA) of a weak signal by a strong source of interference in the vicinity of one of the sidelobes. Alternatively, two closely spaced signals results in only one peak or two peaks in the wrong location.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0209">In yet another example, array processing for DF is performed using a Capon Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) approach.

The result is a simultaneous beam and null forming filter. Forming nulls in other directions is accomplished by minimizing P<sub>y</sub>(&#x3b8;) while constraining a beam in the look direction.

A Capon approach is able to discern multiple signal sources because while looking at signals impinging at 0, the system attenuates a signal arrive at fifteen degrees by a formed beam.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0211">A Capon approach is one method for estimating an angular decomposition of the average power received by the array, sometimes referred to as a spatial spectrum of the array. The Capon approach is a similar approach to spectrum estimation and/or modeling of a linear system.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0212">The system is further operable to employ additional resolution techniques including, but not limited to, Multiple Signal Classifier (MUSIC), Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Technique (ESPRITE), and/or any other high-resolution DOA algorithm. These resolution techniques enable the system to find DOAs for multiple sources simultaneously. In addition, these resolution techniques generate high spatial resolution when compared with more traditional methods. In one embodiment, these techniques apply only when determining DOAs for narrowband signal sources.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0213">For example, when using MUSIC-based methods, the system computes an N&#xd7;N correlation matrix using R<sub>x</sub>=E{x(t)x<sup>H</sup>(t)}=AR<sub>s</sub>A<sup>H</sup>+&#x3c3;<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>I, where R<sub>s</sub>=E{s(t)s<sup>H</sup>(t)}=diag. {&#x3c3;<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>, . . . , &#x3c3;<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>}. If the signal sources are correlated so that R<sub>s </sub>is not diagonal, geolocation will still work while R<sub>s </sub>has full rank. However, if the signal sources are correlated such that R<sub>s </sub>is rank deficient, the system will then deploy spatial smoothing. This is important, as R<sub>s </sub>defines the dimension of the signal subspace. However, For N&#x3e;I, the matrix AR<sub>s</sub>A<sup>H </sup>is singular, where det[AR<sub>s</sub>A<sup>H</sup>]=det[R<sub>x</sub>&#x2212;&#x3c3;<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup><i>I]=</i>0.

Advantageously, using all four measurements to determine geolocation results in a more accurate determination of location. In many instances, only one type of geolocation measurement is available that forces the use of one particular approach (e.g., AOA, TDOA, FDOA), but in many cases geolocation measurements are operable to be derived from behavior of the signals, thus allowing for the use of multiple measurements (e.g., all four measurements) that are combined to obtain a more robust geolocation solution. This is especially important when most of the measurements associated with each approach are extremely noisy.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0215">Learning Engine</p><p id="p-0252" num="0216">In addition, the system includes a learning engine, operable to incorporate a plurality of learning techniques including, but not limited to, machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning (DL), neural networks (NNs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector machines (SVMs), Markov decision process (MDP), and/or natural language processing (NLP). The system is operable to use any of the aforementioned learning techniques alone or in combination.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0217">Advantageously, the system is operable for autonomous operation using the learning engine. In addition, the system is operable to continuously refine itself, resulting in increased accuracy relating to data collection, analysis, modeling, prediction, measurements, and/or output.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0218">The learning engine is further operable to analyze and/or compute a conditional probability set. The conditional probability set reflects the optimal outcome for a specific scenario, and the specific scenario is represented by a data model used by the learning engine. This enables the system, when given a set of data inputs, to predict an outcome using a data model, where the predicted outcome represents the outcome with the least probability of error and/or a false alarm.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0219">Without a learning engine, prior art systems are still operable to create parametric models for predicting various outcomes. However, these prior art systems are unable to capture all inputs and/or outputs, thereby creating inaccurate data models relating to a specific set of input data. This results in a system that continuously produces the same results when given completely different data sets. In contrast, the present invention utilizes a learning engine with a variety of fast and/or efficient computational methods that simultaneously calculate conditional probabilities that are most directly related to the outcomes predicted by the system. These computational methods are performed in real-time or near-real-time.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0220">Additionally, the system employs control theory concepts and methods within the learning engine. This enables the system to determine if every data set processed and/or analyzed by the system represents a sufficient statistical data set.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0221">Moreover, the learning engine includes a learning engine software development kit (SDK), enabling the system to prepare and/or manage the lifecycle of datasets used in any system learning application. Advantageously, the learning engine SDK is operable to manage system resources relating to monitoring, logging, and/or organizing any learning aspects of the system. This enables the system to train and/or run models locally and/or remotely using automated ML, AI, DL, and/or NN. The models are operable for configuration, where the system is operable to modify model configuration parameters and/or training data sets. By operating autonomously, the system is operable to iterate through algorithms and/or hyperparameter settings, creating the most accurate and/or efficient model for running predictive system applications. Furthermore, the learning engine SDK is operable to deploy webservices in order to convert any training models into services that can run in any application and/or environment.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0222">Thus, the system is operable to function autonomously and/or continuously, refining every predictive aspect of the system as the system acquires more data. While this functionality is controlled by the learning engine, the system is not limited to employing these learning techniques and/or methods in only the learning engine component, but rather throughout the entire system. This includes RF fingerprinting, RF spectrum awareness, autonomous RF system configuration modification, and/or autonomous system operations and maintenance.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0223">The learning engine uses a combination of physical models and convolutional neural networks algorithms to compute a set of possible conditional probabilities depicting the set of all possible outputs based on input measurements that provide the most accurate prediction of solution, wherein accurate means minimizing the false probability of the solution and also probability of error for the prediction of the solution.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0224"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref> is a diagram describing three pillars of a customer mission solution.

The spectrum management tool includes environment information obtained from at least one monitoring sensor and at least one sensor processor. The spectrum management tool further includes a policy manager, a reasoner, an optimizer, objectives, device information, and/or a device manager. The objectives include information from a mission information database. The policy manager obtains information from a policy information database. In another embodiment, the policy manager uses information (e.g., from the policy information database, measurements of the electromagnetic environment) to create policies and/or rules for conditional allowance of resources per signal using the spectrum. These policies and/or rules are then passed to the reasoner to determine optimization conditional constraints to be used by the optimizer with the goal of optimizing the utilization of the spectrum (e.g., based on mission information and objectives) by all signals present according to the policies and/or rules. At the output of the optimizer, resources (bandwidth, power, frequency, modulation, spatial azimuth and elevation focus for transmitter/receiver (TX/RX) sources) as well as interference levels per application is recommended for each signal source. After that, the loop of collecting and environmental awareness is fed to the policy manger and the reasoner.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0226"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref> is a block diagram of one embodiment of a resource brokerage application.

The resource brokerage application is operable to control the device and/or the resource. Additionally, the resource brokerage application is operable to control the at least one monitoring sensor.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0227">Semantic Engine</p><p id="p-0264" num="0228">The system further includes an automated semantic engine and/or translator as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref>. The translator is operable to receive data input including, but not limited to, at least one use case, at least one objective, and/or at least one signal. In one embodiment, the at least one use case is a single signal use case. In another embodiment, the at least one use case is a multiple-signal use case. Once the translator receives data input, the translator uses natural language processing (NLP), and/or similar data translation processes and techniques, to convert the data input into actionable data for the automated semantic engine.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0229">By separating the data translation process from the automated semantic engine, the system is operable to provide more processing power once the data input is sent to the automated semantic engine, reducing the overall processing strain on the system.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0230">The automated semantic engine includes a rule component, a syntax component, a logic component, a quadrature (Q) component, and/or a conditional set component. In addition, the semantic engine is operable for network communication with a prior knowledge database, an analytics engine, and/or a monitoring and capture engine. Data is initially sent to the automated semantic engine via the translator. The automated semantic engine is operable to receive data from the translator in forms including, but not limited to, audio data, text data, video data, and/or image data. In one embodiment, the automated semantic engine is operable to receive a query from the translator. The logic component and/or the rule component are operable to establish a set of system rules and/or a set of system policies, where the set of system rules and/or the set of system policies is created using the prior knowledge database.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0231">Advantageously, the automated semantic engine is operable to run autonomously using any of the aforementioned learning and/or automation techniques. This enables the system to run continuously, without requiring user interaction and/or input, resulting in a system that is constantly learning and/or refining data inputs, creating more accurate predictions, models, and/or suggested actions.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0232">Moreover, the automated semantic engine enables the system to receive queries, searches, and/or any other type of search-related function using natural language, as opposed to requiring a user and/or customer to adapt to a particular computer language. This functionality is performed using a semantic search via natural language processing (NLP). The semantic search combines traditional word searches with logical relationships and concepts.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0233">In one embodiment, the automated semantic engine uses Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) within the automated semantic engine. LSI organizes existing information within the system into structures that support high-order associations of words with text objects. These structures reflect the associative patterns found within data, permitting data retrieval based on latent semantic context in existing system data. Furthermore, LSI is operable to account for noise associated with any set of input data. This is done through LSI's ability to increase recall functionality, a constraint of traditional Boolean queries and vector space models. LSI uses automated categorization, assigning a set of input data to one or more predefined data categories contained within the prior knowledge database, where the categories are based on a conceptual similarity between the set of input data and the content of the prior knowledge database. Furthermore, LSI makes use of dynamic clustering, grouping the set of input data to data within the prior knowledge database using conceptual similarity without using example data to establish a conceptual basis for each cluster.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0234">In another embodiment, the automated semantic engine uses Latent Semantic analysis (LSA) within the automated semantic engine. LSA functionalities include, but are not limited to, occurrence matrix creation, ranking, and/or derivation. Occurrence matrix creation involves using a term-document matrix describing the occurrences of terms in a set of data. Once the occurrence matrix is created, LSA uses ranking to determine the most accurate solution given the set of data. In one embodiment, low-rank approximation is used to rank data within the occurrence matrix.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0235">In another embodiment, the automated semantic engine uses semantic fingerprinting. Semantic fingerprinting converts a set of input data into a Boolean vector and creates a semantic map using the Boolean vector. The semantic map is operable for use in any context and provides an indication of every data match for the set of input data. This enables the automated semantic engine to convert any set of input data into a semantic fingerprint, where semantic fingerprints are operable to combine with additional semantic fingerprints, providing an accurate solution given the set of input data. Semantic fingerprint functionality further includes, but is not limited to, risk analysis, document search, classifier indication, and/or classification.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0236">In yet another embodiment, the automated semantic engine uses semantic hashing. By using semantic hashing, the automated semantic engine maps a set of input data to memory addresses using a neural network, where semantically similar sets of data inputs are located at nearby addresses. The automated semantic engine is operable to create a graphical representation of the semantic hashing process using counting vectors from each set of data inputs. Thus, sets of data inputs similar to a target query can be found by accessing all of the memory addresses that differ by only a few bits from the address of the target query. This method extends the efficiency of hash-coding to approximate matching much faster than locality sensitive hashing.</p><p id="p-0273" num="0237">In one embodiment, the automated semantic engine is operable to create a semantic map. The semantic map is used to create target data at the center of the semantic map, while analyzing related data and/or data with similar characteristics to the target data. This adds a secondary layer of analysis to the automated semantic engine, providing secondary context for the target data using similar and/or alternative solutions based on the target data. The system is operable to create a visualization of the semantic map.</p><p id="p-0274" num="0238">Traditional semantic network-based search systems suffer from numerous performance issues due to the scale of an expansive semantic network. In order for the semantic functionality to be useful in locating accurate results, a system is required to store a high volume of data. In addition, such a vast network creates difficulties in processing many possible solutions to a given problem. The system of the present invention solves these limitations through the various learning techniques and/or processes incorporated within the system. When combined with the ability to function autonomously, the system is operable to process a greater amount of data than systems making use of only traditional semantic approaches.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0239">By incorporating the automated semantic engine within the system, the system has a greater understanding of potential solutions, given a provided set of data. Semantic engines are regularly associated with semantic searches or searches with meaning or searches with understanding of overall meaning of the query, thus by understanding the searcher's intent and contextual meaning of the search to generate more relevant results. Semantic engines of the present invention, along with a spectrum specific ontology (vocabulary and operational domain knowledge), help automate spectrum utilization decisions based on dynamic observations and extracted environmental awareness, and create and extend spectrum management knowledge for multiple applications.</p><p id="p-0276" num="0240">Tip and Cue Processes</p><p id="p-0277" num="0241">The system uses a set of &#x201c;tip and cue&#x201d; processes, generally referring to detection, processing, and/or providing alerts using creating actionable data from acquired RF environmental awareness information in conjunction with a specific rule set, further enhancing the optimization capabilities of the system. The specific rule set is translated into optimization objectives, including constraints associated with signal characteristics. The tip and cue processes of the present invention produce actionable data to solve a plurality of user issues and/or objectives.</p><p id="p-0278" num="0242">Tip and cue processes are performed by an awareness system. The awareness system is operable to receive input data including, but not limited to, a set of use cases, at least one objective, and/or a rule set. The input data is then analyzed by a translator component, where the translator component normalizes the input data. Once normalized, the input data is sent to a semantic engine. The semantic engine is necessary for analyzing unstructured data inputs. Thus, a semantic engine is necessary to understand data inputs and apply contextual analysis as well, resulting in a more accurate output result. This accuracy is primarily accomplished using the previously mentioned learning techniques and/or technologies.</p><p id="p-0279" num="0243">The semantic engine uses the input data to create a set of updated rules, a syntax, a logic component, a conditional data set, and/or Quadrature (Q) data. The semantic engine is operable for network communication with components including, but not limited to, a prior knowledge database, an analytics engine, and/or a monitoring and capture engine. The monitoring and capture engine operates with an RF environment and includes a customer application programming interface (API), a radio server, and/or a coverage management component. The customer API and the radio server are operable to output a set of I-phase and Q-phase (I/Q) data using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The set of I/Q data demonstrates the changes in amplitude and phase in a sine wave. The monitor and capture engine also serves as an optimization point for the system.</p><p id="p-0280" num="0244">The awareness engine operates as both a platform optimization unit and a client optimization unit. The awareness engine is operable to perform functions including, but not limited to, detection, classification, demodulation, decoding, locating, and/or signaling alarms.

If signals of the first customer interfere with signals of the second customer in violation of one or more of SLAs, the system is operable to provide an alert to the violation. Data regarding the violation is stored in at least one database within the system, which facilitates resolution of the violation. The control plane is operable to directly communicate the first customer (i.e., customer in violation of SLA) and/or at least one base station to modify parameters to resolve the violation.</p><p id="p-0285" num="0249">In one embodiment, the system is used to protect at least one critical asset.
