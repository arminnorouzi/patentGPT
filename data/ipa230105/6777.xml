Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To meet the demand for wireless data traffic having increased since deployment of 4<sup>th </sup>generation (4G) communication systems, efforts have been made to develop an improved 5<sup>th </sup>generation (5G) or pre-5G communication system. Therefore, the 5G or pre-5G communication system is also called a &#x2018;Beyond 4G Network&#x2019; or a &#x2018;Post long term evolution (LTE) System&#x2019;. The 5G communication system is considered to be implemented in higher frequency (mmWave) bands, e.g., 60 GHz bands, so as to accomplish higher data rates. To decrease propagation loss of the radio waves and increase the transmission distance, the beamforming, massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), Full Dimensional MIMO (FD-MIMO), array antenna, an analog beam forming, large scale antenna techniques are discussed in 5G communication systems. In addition, in 5G communication systems, development for system network improvement is under way based on advanced small cells, cloud Radio Access Networks (RANs), ultra-dense networks, device-to-device (D2D) communication, wireless backhaul, moving network, cooperative communication, Coordinated Multi-Points (CoMP), reception-end interference cancellation and the like. In the 5G system, Hybrid FSK and QAM Modulation (FQAM) and sliding window superposition coding (SWSC) as an advanced coding modulation (ACM), and filter bank multi carrier (FBMC), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and sparse code multiple access (SCMA) as an advanced access technology have been developed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The Internet, which is a human centered connectivity network where humans generate and consume information, is now evolving to the Internet of Things (IoT) where distributed entities, such as things, exchange and process information without human intervention. The Internet of Everything (IoE), which is a combination of the IoT technology and the Big Data processing technology through connection with a cloud server, has emerged. As technology elements, such as &#x201c;sensing technology&#x201d;, &#x201c;wired/wireless communication and network infrastructure&#x201d;, &#x201c;service interface technology&#x201d;, and &#x201c;Security technology&#x201d; have been demanded for IoT implementation, a sensor network, a Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication, Machine Type Communication (MTC), and so forth have been recently researched. Such an IoT environment may provide intelligent Internet technology services that create a new value to human life by collecting and analyzing data generated among connected things. IoT may be applied to a variety of fields including smart home, smart building, smart city, smart car or connected cars, smart grid, health care, smart appliances and advanced medical services through convergence and combination between existing Information Technology (IT) and various industrial applications.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In line with this, various attempts have been made to apply 5G communication systems to IoT networks. For example, technologies such as a sensor network, Machine Type Communication (MTC), and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication may be implemented by beamforming, MIMO, and array antennas. Application of a cloud Radio Access Network (RAN) as the above-described Big Data processing technology may also be considered to be as an example of convergence between the 5G technology and the IoT technology.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In line with this, various attempts have been made to apply 5G communication systems to IoT networks.

In addition, an HARQ feedback frequency resource may be related to a scheduled data resource.

For example, a resource for transmission of sidelink control information and a resource for HARQ feedback may be indicated in a resource pool, and if a resource for sidelink control information is identified, a corresponding HARQ feedback resource may be identified. As still another example, the HARQ feedback frequency resource may be related to a resource of a scheduled downlink control channel. For example, the base station <b>707</b> may transmit downlink control information (DCI), via downlink, to perform scheduling of transmission of sidelink control information and data information transmitted in operation <b>720</b> by UE1 <b>700</b>. UE1 <b>700</b>, which has received the DCI, may acquire frequency resource information for HARQ feedback through a time/frequency resource in which the DCI is transmitted.
