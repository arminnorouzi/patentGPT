More particularly, the invention relates to a method in which undrawn fibers having a core-sheath structure are drawn to produce a drawn conjugated fiber, and a drawn conjugated fiber produced in this method.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conjugated fibers having a core-sheath structure, formed using two kinds of resins having different properties from each other, are used in a wide range of fields. For example, a uniform non-woven fabric can be obtained from an olefin conjugated fiber by cutting the fiber into chopped fibers having a length of about 5 mm or less, and paper-making thereof. The olefin conjugated fiber is used as various filter materials or separators for batteries, because of its excellent chemical resistance. Such a conjugated fiber having a core-sheath structure is generally produced by forming undrawn fibers having a core-sheath structure by melt-spinning, and drawing the undrawn fibers.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For improving various performances of the drawn conjugated fiber having a core-sheath structure, various studies have hitherto been made (see Patent Documents 1 and 2). Patent Document 1 proposes, for example, a method for producing a drawn conjugated fiber having a high strength in a high productivity by drawing undrawn conjugated fibers having a core material of a crystalline propylene polymer and a sheath material of an olefin polymer other than the above, and drawing the undrawn conjugated fibers in pressurized saturated steam. In a conjugated fiber described in Patent Document 2, a ratio in a weight average molecular weight between a crystalline propylene polymer, which is a core material, and a olefin polymer, which is a sheath material, is adjusted to a specific range, thereby appropriately selecting a melt flow rate (MFR) of a core component and an MFR of a sheath component, which are discharged from a spinneret, and as a result, a strength reappearance to a draw ratio is improved while the drawability is secured.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, in order to further improve performances, a non-woven fabric, which is thinner, stronger and finer, is required and it is also required to make a fineness of a conjugated fiber, used for production of the fabric above, thinner. With polyester fiber, for example, some methods for making a fineness thinner are adopted in which spinning and drawing are performed, in which undrawn fibers having a sea-island structure are drawn to remove a sea component, and in which segmented undrawn fibers are drawn to perform a dividing process. On the other hand, with an olefin conjugated fiber, it is difficult to obtain undrawn fibers having a thin fineness by the method of performing the spinning and the drawing, because of its high melt tension, and thus the dividing process is mainly used to make the fineness thinner. It is also proposed to make the fineness of a conjugated fiber thinner by a melt-blowing method or an electrospinning method (see Patent Document 3).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Literatures</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0006">[Patent Document 1] JP-A No. 2002-180330</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0007">[Patent Document 2] JP-A No. 2007-107143</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0008">[Patent Document 3] JP-A No. 2009-133039</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0009">When the fineness of the olefin conjugated fiber is made thinner by the dividing process, however, the dispersibility is problematically reduced in formation of a non-woven fabric by a paper-making method because the division tends to progress in a step using a slurry. A conjugated fiber, whose fineness is made thinner by the melt-blowing method or the electrospinning method, has problems of poor fiber physical properties and a weak strength of an obtained non-woven fabric. For those reasons, in the olefin conjugated fiber, it is required to produce a conjugated fiber having a thin fineness by the method of spinning and drawing.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0010">The present invention aims mainly at providing a method for producing a drawn conjugated fiber, capable of producing a conjugated fiber having a high strength and a thin fineness, and a drawn conjugated fiber.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0011">In order to solve the problems described above, the present inventors have diligently made experiments and studies to make a fineness of an undrawn fiber thinner.

The present invention is not limited to embodiments described below.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">[Overall Structure]</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a flow chart showing a method for producing a drawn conjugated fiber according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in the method for producing a drawn conjugated fiber according to the embodiment of the present invention, a spinning step of obtaining undrawn fibers having a core-sheath structure by means of melt-spinning (Step S1), and a drawing step of drawing the undrawn fibers (Step S2) are performed. In the following explanation, a value of the melt flow rate (MFR) is a value obtained by measurement under conditions of a temperature: 230&#xb0; C. and a load: 21.18 N in accordance with JIS K 7210 A-Method, unless otherwise noted.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">[Step S1: Spinning Step]</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0033">In the spinning step, undrawn fibers are obtained by means of melt-spinning which fibers have a core-sheath structure in which a core material is a resin containing, as a main component, a crystalline propylene polymer and a sheath material is a resin containing, as a main component, an olefin polymer having a melting point lower than that of the core material, and which fibers have a fineness of 1.5 dTex or less. At that time, an MFR of the core material discharged from the spinneret is adjusted to a range of 70 to 170 g/10 minutes, and a ratio (=the core material MFR/a sheath material MFR) of the MFR of the core material discharged from the spinneret to an MFR of the sheath material discharged from the spinneret is adjusted to 1 to 2.2.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">(Core Material: Crystalline Propylene)</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0034">The crystalline propylene polymer, which is the main component of the core material, may include, for example, crystalline isotactic propylene homopolymer; ethylene-propylene random-copolymers having a low content of ethylene units; propylene block-copolymers formed of a homo part containing a propylene homopolymer and a copolymerization part containing an ethylene-propylene random-copolymer with a relatively high content of ethylene units; crystalline propylene-ethylene-&#x3b1;-olefin copolymers wherein each homo part or each copolymerization part in the propylene block-copolymer described above is obtained by copolymerization of the above components with an &#x3b1;-olefin such as butene-1, and the like. Of these, the isotactic polypropylene is preferable in terms of the drawability, the physical properties of the fiber, and the inhibition of heat shrinkage.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0035">It is preferable to add a nucleating agent to the core material (the resin containing, as the main component, the crystalline propylene polymer). The addition of the nucleating agent to the core material raises a re-crystallization temperature, because the nucleating agent itself acts as a crystal nucleus or as a nucleus-creating agent inducing crystal formation to the crystalline propylene polymer, when the melted core material is discharged from the spinneret and cooled. This can stabilize the cooling in the spinning step, and can reduce a fineness unevenness among spun fibers (undrawn fibers), a sheath to core ratio unevenness in a fiber, and an uneven coating with the sheath material in which the core material is partially exposed without coating of the sheath material.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0036">As a result, an unevenness among a number of spun fibers (undrawn fibers), discharged from the spinneret and spun, and an evenness insides thereof are decreased, and thus a draw ratio can be further increased and the drawability can be improved in the drawing step. In addition, fine crystals are readily formed because of increase of the number of crystal nuclei, and thus undrawn fibers capable of being drawn at a high ratio and a high speed can be obtained; in other ward, it is possible to previously form an inside structure which is easily drawn in the spinning step, a pre-step of the drawing step.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0037">Here, it is possible to use an inorganic nucleating agent or an organic nucleating agent as the nucleating agent which is added to the core material.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0038">Specific examples of the inorganic nucleating agent may include talk, kaolin, silica, carbon black, titanium oxide, zinc oxide, magnesium oxide, aluminum oxide, neodymium oxide, calcium sulfate, barium sulfate, and the like. Specific examples of the organic nucleating agents may include benzoic acid metal salt-based nucleating agents such as sodium benzoate and calcium benzoate; oxalic acid metal salt-based nucleating agents such as calcium oxalate; stearic acid metal salt-based nucleating agents such as magnesium stearate and calcium stearate; benzoate metal salt-based nucleating agent such as aluminum benzoate, potassium benzoate, and lithium benzoate; phosphate metal salt-based nucleating agents; and dibenzylidene sorbitol-based nucleating agents.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0039">The nucleating agent may be any of nucleating agents which are melted together with the core material and nucleating agents which are not completely melted and dispersed in the resin, when the resin containing, as the main component, the crystalline propylene polymer, which is the core material, is in a melted state, and may also be nucleating agents which are not melted and act as the nucleus. In the method for producing a drawn conjugated fiber of the present embodiment, it is preferable to use the nucleating agent which is melted together with the resin and has an affinity for the resin, and the nucleating agent which is not completely melted but is partially compatible with the resin in terms of the resin containing, as the main component, the crystalline propylene polymer.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0040">When such nucleating agent is used, the drawability in the next step can be further improved by the inside structure formed of fine crystals, while the effects of reducing the fineness (thickness) unevenness among the fibers and the core-sheath component ratio unevenness inside the fiber upon cooling of the fiber just after the spinning. The inorganic nucleating agent is not melted, and thus it is necessary to finely adjust an addition amount of the nucleating agent depending on the spinning condition and drawing condition, but the organic nucleating agent can be adapted to a wider spinning and drawing condition in a relatively small addition amount. It is preferable, accordingly, to use the organic nucleating agent for the nucleating agent, and it is more preferable to use the organic nucleus-creating agent because it is melted together with the resin and has the affinity for the resin, particularly in terms of the resin containing, as the main component, the crystalline propylene polymer.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0041">The organic nucleus-creating agent which is melted together with the resin and has the affinity for the resin may include, for example, dibenzylidene sorbitol-based nucleating agents. Specifically, it is preferable to use dibenzylidene sorbitol (DBS), monomethyl dibenzylidene sorbitol (such as 1,3:2,4-bis(p-methylbenzylidene)sorbitol (p-MDBS), dimethyl dibenzylidene sorbitol (such as 1,3:2,4-bis(3,4-dimethylbenzylidene)sorbitol (3,4-DMDBS), or the like.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0042">On the other hand, as the organic nucleating agent a part of which is compatible with the resin, nucleating agents having a relatively large organic backbone having a molecular weight of more than about 400 are preferable.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0043">Specific examples thereof may include metal salt of phosphate ester-based nucleating agents. Of various metal salt of phosphate ester-based nucleating agents, phosphoric acid-2,2&#x2032;-methylenebis(4,6-di-tert-butylphenyl)aluminum salts, and phosphoric acid-2,2&#x2032;-methylenebis(4,6-di-tert-butylphenyl) alkali metal salts are particularly preferable. In addition, as the alkali metal in the metal salt of phosphate ester-based nucleating agent, sodium, lithium and potassium are preferable.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0044">The various nucleating agents described above may be used alone, or may be used as a mixture in which the agents are mixed in an appropriate ratio considering the effects, the productivity, and the like. When the addition amount of the nucleating agent to the core material is too small, effects of fixing the fiber shape such as unevenness reductions among the fibers and in the fiber can be insufficiently obtained upon spinning cooling, and the formation of fine crystals is insufficient. On the other hand, when the addition amount of the nucleating agent to the core material is too large, the effects described above are saturated and stains on the spinneret are increased, therefore the stability in the spinning step is reduced. From those reasons, in general, the addition amount of the nucleating agent is adjusted to preferably 0.05 to 1% by mass based on the total mass of the core material, more preferably 0.1 to 0.5% by mass.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">(Sheath Material: Olefin Polymer)</heading><p id="p-0044" num="0045">The olefin polymer, which is the main component of the sheath material, may include, for example, olefin polymers such as high density, medium density or low density polyethylene, and linear low density polyethylene; copolymers of propylene and another &#x3b1;-olefin, specifically including a propylene-butene-1 random copolymer and propylene-ethylene-butene-1 random copolymer; noncrystalline propylene polymers such as soft polypropylene, poly-4-methylpentene-1, and the like. The olefin polymers may be used alone or as a mixture of two or more kinds. Of these, the high density polyethylene is particularly preferable in terms of the fiber physical properties.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="2">(MFR)</heading><p id="p-0045" num="0046">When the core material discharged from the spinneret has an MFR of less than 70 g/10 minutes, the melt tension of the melted resin is increased and it is difficult to obtain undrawn fibers having a fineness of 1.5 dTex or less. When the core material discharged from the spinneret has an MFR of more than 170 g/10 minutes, the melt tension of the melted resin is too low, and the fineness unevenness among the undrawn fibers is increased and the spinning property is apt to be remarkably lowered. The MFR of the core material discharged from the spinneret is, accordingly, adjusted to a range of 70 to 170 g/10 minutes.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0047">When the ratio (=the core material MFR/the sheath material MFR) of the MFR of the core material discharged from the spinneret to the MFR of the sheath material discharged from the spinneret is less than 1, the melt tension of the melted resin is more likely to be increased, and it is difficult to obtain undrawn fibers having a fineness of 1.5 dTex or less. When the ratio of the core material MFR to the sheath material MFR is more than 2.2, the melt tension of the melted resin is too low, and thus the fineness unevenness among the undrawn fibers is increased, the sheath-core unevenness is caused in the fiber level, and the uneven coating with the sheath material on the core material (exposure of the core material) is caused, thereby remarkably reducing the spinning property. The ratio of the MFR of the core material discharged from the spinneret to the MRF of the sheath material discharged from the spinneret is, therefore, adjusted to a range of 1 to 2.2.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0048">On the other hand, though the MFR of the sheath material discharged from the spinneret is not particularly limited, it is preferable to adjust the MFR to, for example, a range of 60 to 90 g/10 minutes, in terms of the production cost and the versatility.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0049">Here, as for the olefin polymer, which is the sheath material, it is possible to adjust the viscosity of the discharged resin during the spinning by changing the spinning temperature. On the other hand, as for the crystalline propylene, which is the core material, it is also possible to adjust the viscosity of the discharged resin during the spinning by adding at least one of an isotactic polypropylene having a high MFR (about 700 to 1550 g/10 minutes), a metallocene polypropylene, and a hydroxyamine ester, which is a radical generator or also a thermal decomposition agent, in addition to the change of the spinning temperature. It is also possible to adjust the viscosity of the discharged resin of the core material during the spinning by adding a polypropylene wax having a small molecular weight, or the like.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0050">It is also possible to adjust the MFR of the core material discharged from the spinneret in a method using a main raw material of the core material having an artificially widened molecular weight distribution, obtained by mixing two or more crystalline polypropylenes having a different MFR, or in a method using crystalline propylene having a low MFR (about 10 g/10 minutes or less). When the MFR of the core material is adjusted in the methods described above, however, undrawn fibers having a thin fineness can be obtained, but the draw ratio tends to be lowered in the subsequent drawing step. For that reason, for the core material, it is preferable to use the crystalline propylene having a high MFR (about 20 to 70 g/10 minutes) and a narrow molecular weight distribution.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0051">It is more preferable to use the resin having a high MFR and a narrow molecular weight distribution and containing, as the main component, the crystalline propylene polymer for the core material, and to add thereto the isotactic polypropylene having a high MFR and/or the metallocene polypropylene, and the hydroxyamine ester-based radical generator having the effect of reducing a molecular weight of the polypropylene resin. This allows the isotactic polypropylene having a high MFR and/or the metallocene polypropylene to be decomposed by the hydroxyamine ester-based radical generator to serve as a plasticizer, thus resulting in the improved drawability in the drawing step.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="2">[Step S2: Drawing Step]</heading><p id="p-0051" num="0052">In the drawing step, the undrawn fibers, produced in the spinning step described above, were drawn to obtain a drawn conjugated fiber having a pre-determined fineness. The drawing step may be performed separately from the spinning step, or may be performed continuously after the spinning step. In a process in which the undrawn fibers, produced in the spinning step, are collected and multiply wound to be then drawn, a standby time is created until the number of the spun fibers (the undrawn fibers) necessary in the drawing step is obtained because the spinning step and the drawing step are separately performed. When these steps are continuously performed, however, the state of the undrawn fiber to be drawn is uniform because such standby time is unnecessary. As a result, the fineness and the fiber properties of the drawn conjugated fibers are homogenized and the stability is improved in the drawing step because the maximum ratios capable of drawing are equal among the fibers compared to the case where the two steps are performed separately.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0053">It is desirable to perform the drawing step at a high temperature, whereby the drawing can be performed in a high ratio, and the drawn conjugated fiber having a thin fineness can be obtained. A contact heating drawing with a high temperature heating plate, a radiative heating drawing using far infrared rays, a heating drawing using warm water, or a heating drawing using steam can be applied to the heating drawing method in the drawing step. Of these methods, the drawing in pressurized saturated steam is preferable, because the fiber to be heated can be heated in an immediately short time. As for tow drawing, used in production of staple fiber or chopped strands, it is necessary that assemblies of undrawn fibers having a large total fineness are drawn, and thus highly pressurized saturated steam heating drawing is particularly preferable, because the inside of the tow can be heated uniformly in a short time.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0054">When the drawing is performed in pressurized saturated steam, the conditions are not particularly limited, and it is usually performed at 110&#xb0; C. or higher. When the temperature of the pressurized saturated steam is lower than 110&#xb0; C., it may sometimes be difficult to perform the drawing at a high ratio and a high speed. The higher temperature of the pressurized saturated steam is basically better so long as the olefin polymer of the sheath material is not melted. Considering the draw ratio, the drawing speed, and the economy, the preferable temperature range of the pressurized saturated steam is from 115 to 130&#xb0; C., and more preferably from 120 to 125&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0055">On the other hand, the draw ratio can be appropriately selected depending on the fineness of the undrawn fibers, and it is usually from 3.0 to 10.0 times in the total draw ratio, and preferably from 4.0 to 8.0 times. The drawing speed can be adjusted to, for example, about 40 to 150 m/minute. In particular, when the spinning step and the drawing step are continuously performed, it is preferable to adjust the speed to 1000 m/minute or more from the viewpoint of the productivity.</p><heading id="h-0018" level="2">[Drawn Conjugated Fiber]</heading><p id="p-0055" num="0056">The drawn conjugated fiber having a thin fineness is obtained by performing the spinning step and the drawing step described above. The drawn conjugated fiber has preferably a fineness of 0.3 dTex or less, and a fiber strength of 5.5 cN/dTex or more. When such fibers are used for the non-woven fabric in a battery separator, excellent properties can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0057">The core material (the polypropylene) in the drawn conjugated fiber, obtained in the method for producing a drawn conjugated fiber of the present embodiment, has a degree of crystallinity of 35% or more, measured according to a heat of fusion method at a temperature elevation rate of 30&#xb0; C./minute using a differential scanning calorimeter. A modulus of elasticity and the thermal stability of the fiber are improved by adjusting the degree of crystallinity of the core material to 35% or more. In addition, it is preferable to adjust the degree of crystallinity of the core material to 40% or more by addition of the nucleating agent described above, whereby the modulus of elasticity and the thermal stability of the drawn conjugated fiber can be further improved.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0058">The degree of crystallinity of the core material in the drawn conjugated fiber defined herein refers to a value calculated from a heat of fusion of the core component fiber, measured using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). In calculation of the degree of crystallinity, a literature data (209 J/g) of the heat of fusion in the complete crystal of the resin forming the core material is defined as a degree of crystallinity of 100%. An amount of the drawn conjugated fiber to be measured is about 8 mg, and the measurement was performed by temperature elevation scanning at a temperature elevation rate of 30&#xb0; C./minute from room temperature to 200&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0059">When the melting point of the resin is measured using a DSC, the temperature elevation rate is generally set at 10&#xb0; C./minute, but in a case where the heat of fusion of a substance in which oriented crystallization occurs such as a drawn product is measured and difference in the degree of crystallinity existing inside the fiber is obtained, if the temperature elevation rate is slow, then the crystallization proceeds during the temperature elevation, and as a result the heat of fusion, which is in a different state before the measurement, is measured. In the present embodiment, accordingly, the measurement is performed at the temperature elevation rate of 30&#xb0; C./minute, and the degree of crystallinity of the core material is calculated from the measured value.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0060">According to the method for producing a drawn conjugated fiber of the present embodiment, the MFR of the core material discharged from the spinneret and the ratio of the MFR of the core material discharged from the spinneret to the MFR of the sheath material discharged from the spinneret are adjusted to the specific ranges, and thus though the MFR of the core material discharged from the spinneret is within a relatively high range, the fineness unevenness among the undrawn fibers, the sheath-core ratio unevenness, and the uneven coating with the sheath material on the core material can be reduced, and the conjugated fiber having a thin fineness can be stably spun.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0061">In a case where the spinning is performed using a large diameter die having a lot of nozzles (that is, nozzle holes) such as 1000 holes or more, particularly 1500 holes or more, in order to increase a production efficiency, a discharge pressure is reduced if the MFR of the resin discharged from the nozzles is high, thus resulting in the occurrence of the unevenness described above in the undrawn fibers to be spun. If the undrawn fibers having the unevenness are used, the good drawability cannot be obtained in the subsequent drawing step, and thus it is necessary to lower the draw ratio for performing the stable drawing, and it is difficult to obtain the drawn conjugated fiber having a thin fineness. On the other hand, according to the method for producing a drawn conjugated fiber of the present embodiment, both of the spinning and the drawing can be stably performed, because the MFR of the core material discharged from the spinneret and the ratio of the MFR of the core material discharged from the spinneret to the MFR of the sheath material discharged from the spinneret are adjusted to the specific ranges.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0062">In a conjugated fiber described in Patent Document 2, MFRs of a core component and a sheath component, discharged from a spinneret, are appropriately selected, but the technique described in Patent Document 2 aims mainly at making a fiber strength stronger, and an MFR range of core materials discharged, described in Examples, is less than 70 g/10 minutes. For those reasons, the undrawn fiber having a thin fineness cannot be obtained in the method described in Patent Document 2, and the drawn conjugated fiber having a thin fineness and uniform cross-section cannot be produced.</p><heading id="h-0019" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0062" num="0063">The effects of the present invention are specifically explained below showing Examples of the present invention and Comparative Examples.
