disclosure provides systems, methods, apparatus, including computer programs encoded on computer storage media for orthogonal multiplexing of high efficiency (HE) and extremely high throughput (EHT) wireless traffic. Devices in a wireless local area network (WLAN) may operate under HE or EHT conditions. An access point (AP) may support both HE and EHT communications with WLAN devices. To enable substantially simultaneous downlink HE and EHT transmissions and substantially simultaneous uplink HE and EHT transmissions, the AP may support orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) of HE and EHT transmissions. For example, pre-HE and pre-EHT modulated fields, HE and EHT modulated fields, and payloads may be aligned in time for the HE and EHT transmissions. The AP may ensure orthogonality for multiplexing the HE and EHT transmissions based on the alignment. In some implementations, a trigger frame may be utilized to indicate uplink transmission alignments.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="156.38mm" wi="149.27mm" file="US20230007604A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="188.89mm" wi="130.64mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007604A1-20230105-D00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-D00002" he="153.59mm" wi="151.38mm" file="US20230007604A1-20230105-D00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-D00003" he="262.97mm" wi="151.38mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007604A1-20230105-D00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-D00004" he="167.22mm" wi="151.30mm" file="US20230007604A1-20230105-D00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-D00005" he="225.47mm" wi="152.23mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007604A1-20230105-D00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-D00006" he="238.17mm" wi="132.59mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007604A1-20230105-D00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00007" num="00007"><img id="EMI-D00007" he="159.94mm" wi="171.28mm" file="US20230007604A1-20230105-D00007.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00008" num="00008"><img id="EMI-D00008" he="213.95mm" wi="171.28mm" file="US20230007604A1-20230105-D00008.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00009" num="00009"><img id="EMI-D00009" he="198.04mm" wi="161.37mm" file="US20230007604A1-20230105-D00009.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00010" num="00010"><img id="EMI-D00010" he="258.06mm" wi="148.67mm" file="US20230007604A1-20230105-D00010.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00011" num="00011"><img id="EMI-D00011" he="229.79mm" wi="111.17mm" file="US20230007604A1-20230105-D00011.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00012" num="00012"><img id="EMI-D00012" he="241.72mm" wi="111.17mm" file="US20230007604A1-20230105-D00012.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00013" num="00013"><img id="EMI-D00013" he="175.77mm" wi="111.17mm" file="US20230007604A1-20230105-D00013.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00014" num="00014"><img id="EMI-D00014" he="223.77mm" wi="111.08mm" file="US20230007604A1-20230105-D00014.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><description id="description"><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application for patent is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser.

These systems may be multiple-access systems capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing the available system resources (such as time, frequency, and power). A wireless network, for example a wireless local area network (WLAN), such as a Wi-Fi (i.e., Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11) network may include access point (AP) that may communicate with one or more stations (STAs) or mobile devices. The AP may be coupled to a network, such as the Internet, and may enable a mobile device to communicate via the network (or communicate with other devices coupled to the access point). A wireless device may communicate with a network device bi-directionally. For example, in a WLAN, a STA may communicate with an associated AP via downlink and uplink. The downlink (or forward link) may refer to the communication link from the AP to the station, and the uplink (or reverse link) may refer to the communication link from the station to the AP.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The systems, methods and devices of this disclosure each have several innovative aspects, no single one of which is solely responsible for the desirable attributes disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure can be implemented in a method for wireless communications at an access point (AP).

However, a person having ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that the teachings herein can be applied in a multitude of different ways. The described implementations may be implemented in any device, system or network that is capable of transmitting and receiving radio frequency (RF) signals according to any of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 16.11 standards, or any of the IEEE 802.11 standards, the Bluetooth&#xae; standard, code-division multiple access (CDMA), frequency-division multiple access (FDMA), time-division multiple access (TDMA), Global System for Mobile communications (GSM), GSM/General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Enhanced Data GSM Environment (EDGE), Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA), Wideband-CDMA (W-CDMA), Evolution Data Optimized (EV-DO), 1&#xd7;EV-DO, EV-DO Rev A, EV-DO Rev B, High Speed Packet Access (HSPA), High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), High Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA), Evolved High Speed Packet Access (HSPA+), Long Term Evolution (LTE), Advanced Mobile Phone Service (AMPS), or other known signals that are used to communicate within a wireless, cellular or internet of things (IOT) network, such as a system utilizing 3G, 4G or 5G, or further implementations thereof, technology.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Techniques are disclosed for orthogonal multiplexing of high efficiency (HE) and extremely high throughput (EHT) wireless traffic. HE and EHT systems may support coverage for multiple types of mobile stations (STAs). For example, an access point (AP) in an EHT system may support coverage for HE and EHT STAs (such as HE and EHT devices). In some systems, both HE and EHT devices may coexist, and the HE and EHT devices may support orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA). In some implementations, however, the HE and EHT devices may support different system bandwidths. OFDMA may enable simultaneous transmissions to both HE and EHT devices, where OFDMA transmissions may rely on orthogonality between transmissions. The techniques disclosed in this paper enable the time alignment of analogous portions of HE and EHT transmissions such that orthogonality between the two types of transmissions may be maintained.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some implementations, a non-duplicate preamble may be either an HE or EHT preamble. To achieve orthogonality between simultaneous OFDMA HE and EHT transmissions, pre-HE-modulated and pre-EHT-modulated fields for one or more portions of a physical protocol data unit (PPDU) bandwidth may be aligned in time, and HE-modulated and EHT-modulated fields for each PPDU portion of the PPDU bandwidth may be aligned in time. In some implementations, different fields in both HE and EHT preambles may use a same symbol duration (such as a 4 &#x3bc;s orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) symbol duration). For example, a legacy short training field (L-STF), a legacy long training field (L-LTF), a legacy signal (L-SIG) field, a repeated L-SIG (RL-SIG) field, an HE signal A (SIG-A) field/EHT SIG-A, and an HE signal B (SIG-B)/EHT SIG-B may use the symbol duration. However, in some implementations, the number of HE SIG-B and EHT SIG-B symbols may differ between the different preambles (such as HE and EHT preambles). As such, there may be a possibility of that pre-HE modulated fields and pre-EHT modulated fields are misaligned based on, for example, a different number of SIG-B symbols for each preamble. To ensure time-alignment of the pre-HE and pre-EHT-modulated fields of the respective HE and EHT preambles, padding of HE SIG-B fields and EHT SIG-B fields may be used such that if a different number of SIG-B symbols are used, they appear to be the same duration.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some implementations, the HE and EHT modulated fields may be aligned in time by ensuring that each PPDU portion contains a same number of HE and EHT long training fields (LTFs) with the same durations of LTFs and guard intervals (GIs). For example, a duration of each OFDM symbol without a GI in HE LTFs may be the same as a duration of each OFDM symbol without GI in EHT LTFs, and a GI duration of HE LTFs may be the same as a GI duration of EHT LTFs. Additionally, HE and EHT short training fields (STFs) may have the same duration. The HE and EHT modulated fields may be aligned, where each PPDU portion may contain a different number of HE and EHT LTFs. In some implementations, each HE/EHT LTF and GI may have a same duration as a payload (such as data) portion. For example, a duration of each OFDM symbol without a GI in an HE data field may be the same as a duration of each OFDM symbol without a GI in an EHT data field (such as 12.8 &#x3bc;s), and a duration of a GI in the data field may be the same as a duration of a GI in the EHT data field (such as 0.8/1.6/3.2 &#x3bc;s). Similarly, a duration of each OFDM symbol without a GI in an HE LTF may be the same as a duration of each OFDM symbol without a GI in an EHT LTF (such as 12.8 &#x3bc;s), and a duration of a GI may be the same in any of an HE LTF, an EHT LTF, and an HE/EHT data field. Additionally, or alternatively, each payload also may be aligned in the PPDU portions through padding.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">For uplink OFDMA of both HE and EHT transmissions, a trigger frame may be transmitted to trigger uplink HE and EHT transmissions. In some implementations, the trigger frame may indicate to transmit an EHT preamble in addition to an HE preamble, where the HE preamble includes pre-EHT modulated fields instead of pre-HE modulated fields. Accordingly, an HE preamble PPDU portion and an EHT preamble PPDU portion may be received orthogonally. To support the orthogonality, pre-EHT modulated fields may be aligned in a trigger-based PPDU for each resource unit (RU), HE and EHT modulated fields may be aligned in the trigger-based PPDU on each RU, and payloads may be aligned in the trigger-based PPDU by padding. Additionally, the trigger frame may include a per-user field for STAs associated with each HE and EHT PPDU portion. The per-user field may allocate spatial streams for each HE and EHT device, and the per-user field may have an equal duration for each HE or EHT device (such as a client device).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Particular implementations of the subject matter described in this disclosure can be implemented to realize one or more of the following potential advantages. Specifically, the proposed techniques allow for increased potential at an AP. For example, downlink transmissions from the AP to one or more STAs may utilize different preambles (such as HE and EHT preambles) for simultaneous transmissions. Additionally, uplink transmissions from one or more STAs to the AP may be received for both HE and EHT STAs simultaneously. In some implementations, the use of higher bandwidths (such as 320 MHz) may be improved based on the multiplexing of both HE and EHT devices.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a wireless local area network (WLAN) <b>100</b> (also known as a Wi-Fi network) that supports orthogonal multiplexing of HE and EHT wireless traffic.

A distribution system (not shown) may be used to connect APs <b>105</b> in an ESS. In some implementations, the coverage area <b>110</b> of an AP <b>105</b> may be divided into sectors (also not shown). The WLAN <b>100</b> may include APs <b>105</b> of different types (such as metropolitan area, home network, etc.), with varying and overlapping coverage areas <b>110</b>. Two STAs <b>115</b> also may communicate directly via a direct wireless link <b>125</b> regardless of whether both STAs <b>115</b> are in the same coverage area <b>110</b>. Examples of direct wireless links <b>120</b> may include Wi-Fi Direct connections, Wi-Fi Tunneled Direct Link Setup (TDLS) links, and other group connections.

As such, an AP <b>105</b> may support both HE and EHT communications with respective HE and EHT STAs <b>115</b>. However, HE and EHT transmissions may not be compatible for simultaneous transmissions. For example, HE transmissions may be longer in duration than EHT transmissions. To enable simultaneous downlink HE and EHT transmissions and receiving simultaneous uplink HE and EHT transmissions, the AP <b>105</b> may support OFDMA of both HE and EHT downlink/uplink transmissions. For example, pre-HE and pre-EHT-modulated fields, HE and EHT modulated fields, and payloads for both the HE and EHT transmissions may be aligned in time. In some implementations, a trigger frame may be utilized for indicating the alignments for uplink transmissions. Accordingly, the AP <b>105</b> may ensure OFDM orthogonality for both the HE and EHT transmissions.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows example portions of a PPDU bandwidth <b>200</b> that support orthogonal multiplexing of HE and EHT wireless traffic. The PPDU bandwidth <b>200</b> may include a number N portions of a non-duplicate preamble PPDU transmission. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the PPDU bandwidth <b>200</b> may include a first non-duplicate preamble PPDU portion 1 (<b>205</b>), a second non-duplicate preamble PPDU portion N&#x2212;1 (<b>210</b>), and a third (that is, Nth) non-duplicate preamble PPDU portion N (<b>215</b>).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In an illustrative example, the PPDU bandwidth <b>200</b> may be 160 MHz.

Following the pre-HE modulated and pre-HE-modulated fields, HE-modulated and EHT-modulated fields for each PPDU portion of the PPDU bandwidth <b>200</b> may be aligned in time.

In some implementations (such as for EHT communications, as described herein), eight bits of the per-user information field <b>603</b> may be used for a spatial stream allocation subfield. That is, a spatial stream allocation subfield for EHT may have a bit width of eight bits, although these eight bits may or may not be contiguous.

For example, as represented by the three circled subfields in the example trigger frame <b>600</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, two of the one-bit subfields may be repurposed for the EHT spatial stream allocation subfield.

Thus, in combination with the six bits already configured for the EHT spatial stream allocation subfield, a total of nine bits of the per-user information field <b>603</b> may be made available for the EHT spatial stream allocation subfield. Thus, of the three one-bit subfields, any two may be combined with the six bits of the sixth subfield already configured for spatial stream allocations to indicate the EHT spatial stream allocation subfield. In some implementations, a single coding type or DCM may be assumed, for example, if the corresponding third subfield <b>615</b> or fifth subfield <b>625</b> are repurposed.

The techniques disclosed in this paper facilitate the AP to align the analogous portions of HE and EHT transmissions in time such that orthogonality between the two types of transmissions may be maintained. In this way, the AP may conserve spectral resources due to the substantially simultaneous transmissions. As such, the techniques described herein may facilitate the coexistence of, for example, different types of STAs operating according to different protocols on different system bandwidths (such as HE devices and EHT devices). This may provide for latency improvements in the wireless communications system as the AP and STAs of the system may not wait to transmit a second type of transmission after a first transmission. Further, because of the orthogonality between transmissions facilitated by the techniques described herein, the AP may reliably communicate substantially simultaneously with multiple different types of STAs without, for example, switching between different signaling protocols or formats.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0086">The transmitter <b>720</b> may transmit signals generated by other components of the device.
