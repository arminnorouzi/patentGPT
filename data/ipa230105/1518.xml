However, various weld defects may occur during a welding process.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">When, for example, steel sheets are welded together, a weld defect referred to as a crack that extends through a welded portion may occur. The weld defect has an adverse influence on airtightness and corrosion resistance of a product. Accordingly, the weld defect needs to be detected on-line by, for example, an image recognition device, and then a countermeasure, such as re-welding, needs to be taken.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, steel sheets have often been alloyed to increase the strength thereof, and narrow seem welding, typically laser welding, has been put to practical use. In such a case, a weld defect, such as a crack, that is so small that it cannot be detected by an on-line inspection method according to the related art may occur.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The weld defect may be more precisely detected off-line by, for example, a cross-section observation test, a liquid penetrant test, or a radiographic test. The cross-section observation test enables accurate detection but requires high temporal and operational costs because the welded portion needs to be cut out. The liquid penetrant test can be performed in a shorter time than the cross-section observation test, but still takes a long time. In addition, when the welded portion is formed by, for example, laser welding and has a narrow width and a large underfill region, it cannot be accurately determined whether the welded portion is defective. The radiographic test requires high-energy radiation, and it is necessary to prevent radiation leakage by using a large detection device. Therefore, it is difficult to carry out the radiographic test in a factory.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Patent Literatures 1 and 2 given below are examples of known documents that disclose methods for detecting a defect, such as a crack, in a welded portion formed by laser welding.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The technology disclosed in Patent Literature 1 utilizes the fact that the width of a heat-affected zone decreases when a weld bead has a weld crack. A threshold is set for the width of the heat-affected zone, and it is determined that defective welding has occurred if it is determined by image recognition that the width is below the threshold. The technology disclosed in Patent Literature 2 utilizes the fact that when a weld bead has a weld crack, an internal space of the crack serves as a heat insulating layer and delays cooling of the cracked portion. A temperature history is measured at a location distant from the welded portion, and it is determined that defective welding has occurred when a cooling rate is below a certain threshold.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">PTL 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2008-196866</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">PTL 2: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2008-279497</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As described above, the welded portion formed by, for example, laser welding tends to have a smaller width, and the size of the weld defect decreases as the width of the welded portion decreases. Accordingly, a normal welded portion and a welded portion having a weld crack or the like have a smaller difference in the width of the heat-affected zone or a smaller difference in temperature variation. Therefore, whether a welded portion is defective cannot be accurately determined based on the threshold for the width of the heat-affected zone as described in Patent Literature 1 or based on the threshold for the temporal variation of temperature as described in Patent Literature 2.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The disclosed embodiments have been made in light of the above-described problems, and an object of the disclosed embodiments is to provide a weld inspection apparatus capable of performing a simple and accurate on-line detection of a small weld defect in a welded portion.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The solutions to the above-described problems are as follows:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">[1] A weld inspection apparatus that detects a weld defect in a welded portion of a metal plate, the weld inspection apparatus including:</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">a liquid application head disposed over one side surface of the metal plate and capable of moving in a welding direction of the metal plate; and</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">an air jet head disposed over another side surface of the metal plate and capable of moving in the welding direction of the metal plate,</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">wherein the liquid application head includes a liquid application nozzle that projects toward the one side surface of the metal plate and applies liquid for sealing the welded portion, and</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">wherein the air jet head includes an air jet nozzle that projects toward the another side surface of the metal plate and discharges air toward the welded portion to which the liquid has been applied.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">[2] The weld inspection apparatus according to [1], wherein the liquid application head includes a camera at a location in advance of the liquid application nozzle in a moving direction, the camera capturing an image of the welded portion.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">[3] The weld inspection apparatus according to [1] or [2], wherein the air jet head includes a camera at a location in advance of the air jet nozzle in a moving direction, the camera capturing an image of the welded portion.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">[4] The weld inspection apparatus according to any one of [1] to [3], wherein the liquid application nozzle is disposed in advance of the air jet nozzle in a moving direction.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">[5] The weld inspection apparatus according to any one of [1] to [4], wherein the liquid application head includes a rear camera at a location behind the liquid application nozzle in a moving direction, the rear camera capturing an image of a bubble formed in the liquid.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effects</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to the disclosed embodiments, the weld defect is detected by utilizing the fact that bubbles are formed in the liquid applied to one side surface of the metal plate when air discharged from the another side surface of the metal plate passes through the weld defect. Thus, simple and accurate detection of the weld defect can be performed even when the weld defect is small.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In addition, on-line detection is possible because the liquid application head and the air jet head are movable in the welding direction. Accordingly, the inspection time can be greatly reduced compared with that in the case of using an off-line detection device or an off-line detection method.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating an example of a weld inspection apparatus according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a side view illustrating the example of the weld inspection apparatus according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a top view of a weld joint having a weld defect.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a sectional view of the weld joint illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> taken along line A-A.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective view of a skeletal component for an automobile, which is an example of an inspection object.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0010" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Disclosed embodiments will now be described with reference to the drawings.

Welding is generally performed in one direction, and this direction is referred to as a welding direction. The welding direction coincides with the longitudinal direction of the welded portions <b>4</b>, and also coincides with the longitudinal direction of the metal plates <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> in the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Lap welding is generally performed by laser welding, and therefore a small weld defect easily occurs.

The liquid application head <b>5</b> includes a cylindrical liquid application nozzle <b>6</b> that projects toward one side surface (front side) of the metal plates. The air jet head <b>9</b> includes a cylindrical air jet nozzle <b>10</b> that projects toward another side surface (back side) of the metal plates. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the liquid application nozzle <b>6</b> applies liquid <b>12</b> to a front surface of the metal plate <b>2</b>, and the air jet nozzle <b>10</b> discharges air <b>13</b> toward a back surface of the metal plate <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The liquid application head <b>5</b> and the air jet head <b>9</b> move in the welding direction. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the direction in which the liquid application head <b>5</b> and the air jet head <b>9</b> move is referred to as a moving direction D. The liquid application head <b>5</b> and the air jet head <b>9</b> preferably move in synchronization with each other. In such a case, the inspection time can be reduced, and there is no risk that the liquid will be evaporated due to a time lag between the application of the liquid and the movement of the air jet head and accurate detection of a crack cannot be performed.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The air jet nozzle <b>10</b> discharges air against the welded portions <b>4</b> to which the liquid has been applied by the liquid application nozzle <b>6</b>. To reliably apply the liquid before the air is discharged, the liquid application nozzle <b>6</b> is preferably disposed in advance of the air jet nozzle <b>10</b> in the moving direction.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As described in detail below, when the air <b>13</b> is discharged from the back side of each welded portion <b>4</b> to which the liquid <b>12</b> has been applied, if there is a weld defect, bubbles are found in the liquid on the front side of the welded portion <b>4</b>.

The camera <b>7</b> and the camera <b>11</b> may each be any device capable of recognizing the welded portions <b>4</b> based on, for example, brightness information of a captured image.

As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the weld defect <b>14</b> often extends entirely from a welding starting end portion S to a welding terminating end portion E.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">First, the liquid <b>12</b> for sealing the welded portion <b>4</b> is applied to the front side of the welded portion <b>4</b>. The liquid <b>12</b> may be any liquid that has a surface tension high enough to seal the front surface of the welded portion <b>4</b> and that allows bubbles to be formed when the air is discharged. The liquid <b>12</b> may be, for example, liquid containing a surface active agent or a bubble forming agent, such as a macromolecular compound, and examples thereof include known liquid used for gas leak detection.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Next, the air <b>13</b> is discharged from the back side of the metal plate <b>3</b> toward the welded portion <b>4</b> to which the liquid <b>12</b> has been applied. When the welded portion <b>4</b> has the weld defect <b>14</b> (more specifically, a crack extending entirely through the welded portion in the plate thickness direction) as in the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the air <b>13</b> passes through the weld defect <b>14</b> and reaches the front side of the metal plate <b>2</b>. Bubbles <b>15</b> are generated when the air <b>13</b> passes through the liquid <b>12</b> at the front side of the welded portion <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">When the welded portion <b>4</b> has no weld defects, for example, when the welded portion <b>4</b> has no cracks that extend entirely through the welded portion <b>4</b> in the thickness direction, the air <b>13</b> discharged from the back side of the metal plate <b>3</b> does not reach the front side of the metal plate <b>2</b>, and no bubbles <b>15</b> are formed in the liquid <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As described above, the air <b>13</b> is discharged from the back side of the welded portion <b>4</b>, and whether or not the weld defect <b>14</b> is present is determined based on whether or not the bubbles <b>15</b> are present in the liquid <b>12</b> at the front side of the welded portion <b>4</b>. Thus, whether or not a small weld defect is present can be determined by observing whether the bubbles are present, and the detection of defects is simpler and more accurate as compared to the related art. In addition, since the detection can be performed on-line, the detection can be performed in a significantly shorter time as compared to the related art. In particular, when the above-described weld inspection apparatus is applied to, for example, a welded portion of alloyed steel sheets or a welded portion formed by laser welding, even a small weld defect can be reliably detected.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Whether the weld defect <b>14</b> is present can be more accurately determined by cutting the welded portion <b>4</b> along a plane perpendicular to the welding direction and observing the cut surface with, for example, an optical microscope after the weld defect detection using the above-described weld inspection apparatus.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Preferred conditions of the weld inspection apparatus will now be described.
