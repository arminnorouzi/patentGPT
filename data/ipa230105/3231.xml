Recently, many studies have been conducted on an air discharge structure of the blower that may give the user a sense of comfort. In this regard, Korean Patent Nos. 2011-0099318, 2011-0100274, 2019-0015325, and 2019-0025443 disclose a fan or a blowing device for blowing air using a coanda effect.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A conventional blowing device has a plurality of motors individually driven for controlling a blowing intensity or a blowing direction, or it is necessary to move or rotate the blowing device itself for controlling the blowing intensity or the blowing direction. For this reason, there are problems that it is difficult to control the blowing intensity or the blowing direction effectively and step by step, or excessive power consumption.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments will be described in detail with reference to the following drawings in which like reference numerals refer to like elements, and wherein:</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a blower according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view, taken along line II-II&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a left side view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> described hereinafter;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view, taken along line IV-IV&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective view showing a state in which a damper of a blower of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> closes a front of a space;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a front view of the blower of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a plan view of the blower of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a perspective view showing a state in which a first outer surface of a first upper body of the blower of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is removed;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> to <b>12</b></figref> are views for explaining a damper assembly of the blower of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view, taken along line XIII-XIII&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view, taken along line XIV-XIV&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> and <b>16</b></figref> are views for explaining a diffused wind formed in a first state of a blower, with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> being a top view of the blower, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> a perspective view of the blower, in which diffused airflow is represented by a dotted arrow;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b> and <b>18</b></figref> are views for explaining increased wind formed in a second state of a blower, with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> being a top view of the blower, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> a perspective view of the blower, in which increased airflow is represented by a dotted arrow;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> is a perspective view of a blower according to another embodiment;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view, taken along line XX-XX&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> is a view for explaining a door assembly of a blower of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> is an enlarged view of portion A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> is a view for explaining a moving rack of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b> to <b>27</b></figref> are views for explaining that blower's doors are sequentially rotated so that a blowing intensity and/or a blowing direction of the blower is gradually adjusted.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Hereinafter, embodiments will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.
