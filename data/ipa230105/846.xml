More specifically, the invention relates to compounds which are useful as AMPA (&#x3b1;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) glutamate receptor modulators. The invention also relates to uses of the compounds and methods of treatment employing the compounds, particularly in the treatment or prevention of diseases or conditions in which potentiation of the AMPA receptor is beneficial, for example in the treatment of neurological or neuropsychiatric disease, particularly the treatment of depressive disorders, mood disorders and cognitive dysfunction associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. The invention further comprises methods for preparing the compounds and intermediates used in the preparation of the compounds.</p><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0002">Glutamate is the major mediator of excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain, and is involved in rapid point-to-point (synaptic) communication between neurons. The functions of glutamate are mediated via three types of fast acting ion channels; the kainate, AMPA and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtypes; and by the more modulatory metabotropic G-protein coupled (mGlu1-8) receptors.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0003">AMPA receptors are tetrameric comprising four subunits (GluA1-GluA4) (Traynelis et al., Glutamate receptor ion channels: structure, regulation, and function; Pharmacol. Rev. 2010, 62, 405-496). Functional AMPA receptors can be formed from homo- or hetero-tetramers. Native receptors are almost exclusively heteromeric which leads to a diversity of receptor subunit composition in the human brain.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">Studies of the X-ray structure of the membrane-bound channel show that the AMPA receptor comprises (1) an amino terminal domain (ATD), which is involved in the assembly of subunits and is the site of action for a number of molecules that modulate AMPA receptor function; (2) a ligand binding domain (LBD) including two polypeptide segments S1 and S2, which binds glutamate; (3) a transmembrane domain (TMD) containing a pore-forming ion channel; and (4) a C-terminal intracellular domain. In addition to the various subunit permutations, an additional layer of complexity is created by the existence of a number of splice variants (flip and flop variants) and sites for post-translational modification (Seeburg et al.; RNA editing of brain glutamate receptor channels: mechanism and physiology. Brain Res Brain Res Rev. 1998, 26: 217-229). RNA editing results in a positively charged arginine (R) residue replacing the genomically encoded glutamine (Q) in the M2 re-entrant loop of the GluA2 subunit, thereby restricting Ca<sup>2+ </sup>flux through the channel and essentially rendering the receptor permeable to just Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>, which is deemed crucial for adult synaptic function and plasticity (Sommer et al.; RNA editing in brain controls a determinant of ion flow in glutamate-gated channels; Cell 1991, 105: 11-19; and Seeburg et al.; Genetic manipulation of key determinants of ion flow in glutamate receptor channels in the mouse. Brain Res. 2001, 907, 233-243). Extensive structural studies have been carried out on LBD constructs (Sobolevsky et al., Nature, 2009, 482, 745-756).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">AMPA receptors are the most highly-expressed ionotropic glutamate receptors in the brain and are responsible for the majority of fast synaptic transmission. AMPA receptor mediated cell depolarization leads to calcium influx via NMDA receptors and the induction of synaptic plasticity (Derkach et al., 2007, Nat. Rev. Neurosci., 8:101-113).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">Synaptic plasticity is the cellular process that underlies learning and memory. AMPA receptors are actively trafficked into synapses in response to neuronal activation and a functional correlate of this is that they play a crucial role in long-term potentiation, the electrophysiological correlate of synaptic plasticity (Malinow et al., Annual Review of Neuroscience, 2002, 25, 103-126).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">Abnormalities in glutamatergic neurotransmissions are associated with a variety of CNS disorders and the alterations in the function of the kainate, AMPA and/or NMDA subtypes of glutamate ion channels have been explored as therapeutic targets. Of these ion channel subtypes, AMPA receptors interact very closely with NMDA receptors and together they are associated with synaptic plasticity.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">AMPA modulators can also produce effects on in vivo electrophysiological measurements such as long-term potentiation, AMPA induced currents and neuronal firing rates (Hampson et al., Psychopharmacology (Berl). 2009, 202(1-3), 355-69). The observation that AMPA receptor expression increases after learning a behavioural task (Cammarota et al., Neurobiol. Learn. Mem., 1995, 64, 257-264) or after exposure to a single fear-inducing stimulus (Liu et al., Nature neuroscience, 2010, 13(2), 223-31) further emphasizes the importance of AMPA receptors in relation to learning, memory and synaptic plasticity.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0009">In view of the critical role of AMPA receptors in the synaptic plasticity that underlies cognition, AMPA receptor modulators are expected to useful in enhancing cognitive function. AMPA receptor modulators may also be useful in the treatment of cognitive dysfunction associated with medical disorders (e.g. cognitive dysfunction associated with psychotic disorders, depressive disorders or neurodegenerative disorders). AMPA receptor modulators may be useful in the treatment of, for example, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression or anxiety, particularly in the treatment of cognitive dysfunction associated with these disorders.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">Although potentiation of AMPA receptors has been shown to promote cognition, it has also been found that AMPA potentiation by certain compounds is linked to undesirable convulsant effects and seizures (Yamada Exp. Opin. Investig. Drugs, 2000, 9, 765-777). Direct activation of AMPA receptors using receptor agonists increases the risk of overstimulation and the induction of convulsant effects. This has led to research into the development of allosteric (i.e., non-glutamate binding site) AMPA receptor potentiators as a means of enhancing neuroplasticity and thus treating various neuropsychiatric disorders (Kalivas et al., Neuropsychopharmacology, 2008; 33:2).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0011">Positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the AMPA receptor (AMPA-PAMs) stabilize the AMPA receptor in its active conformation following glutamate binding resulting in increased synaptic currents, thereby promoting synaptic transmission and plasticity (Mellor. The AMPA receptor as a therapeutic target current perspectives and emerging possibilities. Future Med. Chem. 2010, 2, 877-891; and O'Neill et al., AMPA receptor potentiators as cognitive enhancers. Idrugs, 2007, 10, 185-192). Positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) are use-dependent drugs and as such only act when endogenous glutamate is released. PAM potentiation of AMPA receptors may therefore reduce the risk of undesirable side effects associated with AMPA potentiation such as convulsions.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0012">AMPA receptor potentiation using PAMs have shown beneficial effects, including increased ligand affinity for the receptor (Arai et al., Neuroreport. 1996, 7, 221, 1-5); reduced receptor desensitization and reduced receptor deactivation (Arai et al., 2000, 58, 802-813); and facilitate the induction of LTP in vivo (Staubli et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1994, 91(1), 1158-1162). The efficacy of various AMPA receptor PAMs in pre-clinical and clinical models of psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, are described in (Morrow et al., Current Opinion in Drug Discovery and Development, 2006, 9(5), 571-579).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0013">Around 1% of the population will suffer from schizophrenia at some point in their life. Symptoms such as paranoia and/or hearing voices can be reasonably well treated by existing medications. However, known drugs have little effect on other symptoms of the disease including lack of motivation, impaired social function, and, particularly, impaired cognition. Cognitive dysfunction manifests itself as difficulties with attention, memory and problem solving and result in patients experiencing a &#x201c;brain fog&#x201d;. These largely untreated symptoms remain a huge barrier to the resumption of a fully functional, &#x201c;normal&#x201d; life for affected individuals.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0014">The recognition of the unmet clinical need in schizophrenia triggered the NIH- and FDA sponsored Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) initiative that mapped out the regulatory path for treatments for the cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS). Most therapeutic approaches to the treatment of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia have focused on the glutamate system aiming to either directly or indirectly increase NMDA receptor function (Field et al., Trends Mol. Med., 2011, 17, 689-98). Direct approaches to increasing NMDA receptor function include glycine transporter type 1 (GlyT1) inhibitors (e.g. R1678, Roche). Indirect approaches include mGluR2 positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), mGluR5 PAMs, mGluR2/3 agonists (for example pomaglumetad methionil, LY2140023 Lilly) and D-amino acid oxidase inhibitors. However, there remains a need for new therapies which improve cognitive performance in subjects with schizophrenia and other CNS conditions.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0015">Clinical studies have shown that ketamine provides rapid relief from the symptoms of depression, often in a matter of minutes. This finding has generated significant research interest, because conventional anti-depressants such as SSRI's often take weeks or even months to show anti-depressant effects. Initial studies also suggest that ketamine may have the potential to provide potent fast-acting antidepressant effects even in traditionally difficult to treat patients with severe treatment resistant depression (Berman et al.; Antidepressant effects of ketamine in depressed patients; Biol. Psychiatry. 2000, 47(4), 351-354). More recently Daly et al., JAMA Psychiatry, 2018, 75(2), 139-148) report a phase 2 study showing that intranasal administration esketamine was efficacious in patients with treatment-resistant depression and that the onset of effects were rapid and sustained. However, ketamine has several side-effects, including hallucinogenic and addictive properties, which would make abuse of the drug likely. It is therefore unlikely that ketamine will be widely adopted as a treatment for depression.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016">It has recently been found that the antidepressant effects observed with ketamine are attributable to a metabolite of ketamine, (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine, and that this metabolite acts as an AMPA receptor potentiator. In mouse models, the metabolite provides rapid anti-depressant-like effects which persist for at least three days (Zanos et al., NMDA receptor inhibition-independent antidepressant actions of a ketamine metabolite. Nature, May 4, 2016) Aleksandrova et al., (J. Psychiatry. Neurosci., 2017; 42(4), 222-229) also indicates that AMPA receptors play a key role in mediating the anti-depressant effects of ketamine and suggests that agents which enhance the function of AMPA receptors may be beneficial in the treatment of depression.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0017">Accordingly, AMPA receptor potentiators may be useful in the treatment of, for example, depressive disorder (e.g. major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) or substance/medication induced depressive disorders), anxiety or bipolar-disorders. AMPA receptor potentiators may be particularly useful in the treatment of treatment resistant depressive disorders, for example in the treatment of depression that is resistant to conventional anti-depressant therapies including, but not limited to, tricyclic antidepressants, MAOIs and/or SSRIs.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0018">S47445 is a tricyclic AMPA-PAM of the formula:</p><p id="p-0021" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="31.16mm" wi="70.10mm" file="US20230000847A1-20230105-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0022" num="0019">This compound is described to be a selective AMPA-PAM and shows pro-cognitive effects in rodent models as well as providing neuroprotective effects.

Thus, compounds of the invention intended for pharmaceutical use may be administered as crystalline or amorphous products. They may be obtained, for example, as solid plugs, powders, or films by methods such as precipitation, crystallization, freeze drying, or spray drying, or evaporative drying. Microwave or radio frequency drying may be used for this purpose.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0057">Certain compounds of the invention are capable of existing in stereoisomeric forms. It will be understood that the invention encompasses the use of all optical isomers of the compounds of the invention. Where a compound has a stereocentre, both (R) and (S) stereoisomers are contemplated by the invention, equally mixtures of stereoisomers or a racemic mixture are contemplated by the present application. Where the compound is a single stereoisomer the compounds may still contain other enantiomers as impurities. Hence a single stereoisomer does not necessarily have an enantiomeric excess (e.e.) of 100% but could have an e.e. or d.e. of about at least 85%. Enantiomerically pure forms are a particular aspect of the invention. Conventional techniques for the preparation/isolation of individual enantiomers when necessary include chiral synthesis from a suitable optically pure precursor or resolution of the racemate (or the racemate of a salt or derivative) using, for example, chiral high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0058">Chiral compounds of the invention (and chiral precursors thereof) may be obtained in enantiomerically-enriched form using chromatography, typically HPLC, on an asymmetric resin with a mobile phase consisting of a hydrocarbon, typically heptane or hexane, containing from 0 to 50% by volume of isopropanol, typically from 2% to 20%, and from 0 to 5% by volume of an alkylamine, typically 0.1% diethylamine. Concentration of the eluate affords the enriched mixture.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0059">When any racemate crystallises, crystals of two different types are possible. The first type is the racemic compound (true racemate) referred to above wherein one homogeneous form of crystal is produced containing both enantiomers in equimolar amounts. The second type is the racemic mixture or conglomerate wherein two forms of crystal are produced in equimolar amounts each comprising a single enantiomer.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0060">While both of the crystal forms present in a racemic mixture have identical physical properties, they may have different physical properties compared to the true racemate. Racemic mixtures may be separated by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art&#x2014;see, for example, &#x201c;Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds&#x201d; by E. L. Eliel and S. H. Wilen (Wiley, 1994).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0061">The present invention also includes all pharmaceutically acceptable isotopically-labelled compounds of formulae (I) to (VII) defined herein, wherein one or more atoms are replaced by atoms having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number most commonly found in nature.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0062">Examples of isotopes suitable for inclusion in the compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, such as <sup>2</sup>H and <sup>3</sup>H, carbon, such as <sup>11</sup>C, <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>14</sup>C, chlorine, such as <sup>38</sup>Cl, fluorine, such as <sup>18</sup>F, iodine, such as <sup>123</sup>I and <sup>125</sup>I, nitrogen, such as <sup>13</sup>N and <sup>15</sup>N, oxygen, such as <sup>15</sup>O, <sup>17</sup>O and <sup>18</sup>O, phosphorus, such as <sup>32</sup>P, and sulphur, such as <sup>35</sup>S.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0063">Certain isotopically-labelled compounds, for example, those incorporating a radioactive isotope, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, i.e. <sup>3</sup>H, and carbon-14, i.e. <sup>14</sup>C, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0064">Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e. <sup>2</sup>H, (D) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements, and hence may be preferred in some circumstances.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0065">Substitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as <sup>11</sup>C, <sup>18</sup>F, <sup>15</sup>O and <sup>13</sup>N, can be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0066">Isotopically-labelled compounds can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described using an appropriate isotopically-labelled reagent in place of the non-labelled reagent previously employed.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0067">Compounds of the invention may exist in a number of different tautomeric forms and references to compounds of the invention include all such forms. For the avoidance of doubt, where a compound can exist in one of several tautomeric forms, and only one is specifically described or shown, all others are nevertheless embraced by compounds of the invention.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0068">Prodrugs of the compounds of the invention are also contemplated within the scope of the invention. A prodrug is a compound which acts as a drug precursor which, upon administration to a subject, undergoes conversion by metabolic or other chemical processes to yield a compound of formulae (I) to (VII) defined herein. For example, an &#x2014;OH group may be converted to an ester or a carbamate, which upon administration to a subject will undergo conversion back to the free hydroxyl group. Examples of prodrugs and their uses are well known (e.g., Berge et al., &#x201c;Pharmaceutical Salts&#x201d;, J. Pharm. Sci. 1977, 66, 1-19). The prodrugs can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds, or by separately reacting the purified compound with a suitable esterifying agent.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0069">The terms &#x201c;treating&#x201d;, or &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; refer to any beneficial effect in the treatment or amelioration of an injury, disease, pathology or condition, including any objective or subjective parameter such as abatement; remission; diminishing of symptoms or making the injury, pathology or condition more tolerable to the patient; slowing in the rate of degeneration or decline; making the final point of degeneration less debilitating; improving a patient's physical or mental well-being. The treatment or amelioration of symptoms can be based on objective or subjective parameters; including the results of a physical examination, neuropsychiatric exams, and/or a psychiatric evaluation. The term &#x201c;treating&#x201d; and conjugations thereof, include prevention of an injury, pathology, condition, or disease.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0070">An &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; is an amount sufficient to accomplish a stated purpose (e.g. achieve the effect for which it is administered, treat a disease, reduce enzyme activity, increase enzyme activity, or reduce one or more symptoms of a disease or condition). An example of an &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; is an amount sufficient to contribute to the treatment, prevention, or reduction of a symptom or symptoms of a disease, which could also be referred to as a &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount.&#x201d; A &#x201c;reduction&#x201d; of a symptom or symptoms means decreasing of the severity or frequency of the symptom(s), or elimination of the symptom(s). A &#x201c;prophylactically effective amount&#x201d; of a drug is an amount of a drug that, when administered to a subject, will have the intended prophylactic effect, e.g., preventing or delaying the onset (or reoccurrence) of an injury, disease, pathology or condition, or reducing the likelihood of the onset (or reoccurrence) of an injury, disease, pathology, or condition, or their symptoms. The full prophylactic effect does not necessarily occur by administration of one dose, and may occur only after administration of a series of doses. Thus, a prophylactically effective amount may be administered in one or more administrations. The exact amounts will depend on the purpose of the treatment, and will be ascertainable by one skilled in the art using known techniques (see, e.g., Lieberman, <i>Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms </i>(vols. 1-3, 1992); Lloyd, <i>The Art, Science and Technology of Pharmaceutical Compounding </i>(1999); Pickar, <i>Dosage Calculations </i>(1999); and <i>Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, </i>20th Edition, 2003, Gennaro, Ed., Lippincott, Williams &#x26; Wilkins).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0071">The therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention can be initially estimated from cell culture assays. Target concentrations will be those concentrations of active compound(s) that are capable of achieving the therapeutic effect described herein, as measured using the methods described herein or known in the art.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0072">Therapeutically effective amounts for use in humans can also be determined from animal models using known methods. For example, a dose for humans can be formulated to achieve a concentration that has been found to be effective in animals. The dosage in humans can be adjusted by monitoring compound effectiveness and adjusting the dosage upwards or downwards, as described above. Adjusting the dose to achieve maximal efficacy in humans based on the methods described above and other methods is well within the capabilities of the ordinarily skilled artisan.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0073">Dosages may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient and the compound being employed. The dose administered to a patient, in the context of the present invention should be sufficient to effect a beneficial therapeutic response in the patient over time. The size of the dose also will be determined by the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse side-effects. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the practitioner. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under circumstances is reached.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0074">Dosage amounts and intervals can be adjusted individually to provide levels of the administered compound effective for the particular clinical indication being treated. This will provide a therapeutic regimen that is commensurate with the severity of the individual's disease state.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0075">A prophylactic or therapeutic treatment regimen is suitably one that does not cause substantial toxicity and yet is effective to treat the clinical symptoms demonstrated by the particular patient. This determination of a dosage regimen is generally based upon an assessment of the active compound by considering factors such as compound potency, relative bioavailability, patient body weight, presence and severity of adverse side effects, preferred mode of administration and the toxicity profile of the selected agent.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0076">Throughout the description and claims of this specification, the words &#x201c;comprise&#x201d; and &#x201c;contain&#x201d; and variations of them mean &#x201c;including but not limited to&#x201d;, and they are not intended to (and do not) exclude other moieties, additives, components, integers or steps.

An &#x201c;allosteric modulator&#x201d; is an agent is an agent which indirectly modulates the effects of an agonist or inverse agonist at a receptor. Allosteric modulators bind to a site distinct from that of the orthosteric agonist binding site. Generally allosteric modulators induce a conformational change within the protein structure of the receptor. A &#x201c;positive allosteric modulator&#x201d; (PAM) induces an amplification of the orthosteric agonist's effect, either by enhancing the binding affinity or the functional efficacy of the orthosteric agonist for the target receptor. Accordingly, the compounds of the invention are expected to potentiate the effect of AMPA receptors when endogenous glutamate is released. The compounds of the invention have little or no effect upon channel currents per se and are only able to enhance ion flux through the receptor in the presence of the endogenous glutamate ligand. Accordingly, a compound of the invention may potentiate AMPA receptors by, for example, (i) slowing the rate at which the receptor desensitizes in the continued presence of glutamate; and/or (ii) slowing the rate at which the receptor deactivates after removal of glutamate; and/or (iii) enhancing or prolonging glutamatergic synaptic currents, thereby promoting synaptic transmission and plasticity (e.g. long-term potentiation (LTP) of synapses). Preferred compounds potentiate AMPA receptor effects (e.g. enhancing cognition) without significantly corrupting spatial and temporal information.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0128">Compounds of the invention are thought to bind on the twofold axis of the GluA2 ligand binding domain (LBD) dimer which is formed by residues that act as &#x2018;hinges&#x2019; between the two structural domains of each LBD. Modulators binding at this site may act to slow receptor deactivation by stabilizing the clamshell dimer in its closed cleft glutamate bound conformation and/or slow desensitization by stabilizing the dimer interface (Ward et al., British Journal of Pharmacology, 2010, 160 181-190).</p><p id="p-0193" num="0129">Activation of the AMPA receptor by glutamate opens the pore of the ion channel permitting the inward flow of sodium, resulting in the depolarization of the neuronal membrane. This change in the intracellular charge releases the Mg<sup>2+ </sup>cation from the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor channel, permitting passage of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>through the NMDA receptor pore into the postsynaptic neurone and triggering Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signal transduction cascades, trafficking of extra-synaptic AMPA receptors and high conductance GluA1 homomers to the postsynaptic density, leading to the induction of forms of synaptic plasticity (Passafaro et al.; Subunit-specific temporal and spatial patterns of AMPA receptor exocytosis in hippocampal neurons. Nat Neurosci 2001, 4, 917-926).</p><p id="p-0194" num="0130">The potentiation of AMPA receptors by the compounds of the invention may be assessed by measuring calcium ion influx via AMPA receptors upon exposure of the receptor to glutamate in the presence of a test compound. One such assay is the calcium ion influx assay described in the Examples using cells which express human GluR2 flip (GluA2 flip) AMPA receptor subunits which form functional homotetrameric AMPA receptors. The GluA2 flip sub-units are highly expressed in cortical and sub-cortical brain tissue (Ward et al., 2010, ibid). The Examples show that the compounds of the invention are potent potentiators of AMPA receptors in the presence of the glutamate ligand.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0131">The effects of a compound of the invention in-vitro could also be determined using human inducible pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived glutamate neurons (e.g. iCell&#xae; GlutaNeurons ex. Cellular Dynamics International) using multielectrode array electrophysiology. An analogous method is described in Dage et al., (pharmacological characterisation of ligand- and voltage-gated ion channels expressed in human iPSC-derived forebrain neurons, Psychopharmacology. 2014, 231(6):1105-1124).</p><p id="p-0196" num="0132">The compounds of the invention are expected to enhance cognition. The effect on cognition can be assessed in-vivo using known models of behavioural cognition. For example, a novel object recognition (NOR) model as described in Ennaceur et al., (Behav. Brain Res. 1988, 31, 47-59). The test relies on a rat's natural tendency to explore novelty and involves two trials. In the first (T1) the rat is exposed to two identical objects for a brief period of time (3 min). After a delay (inter trial interval: ITI), the rat is placed back in the chamber with one of the familiar objects it encountered in the first phase and an additional novel object (T2). Rodents typically spend more time exploring the novel object over the familiar object, which is interpreted as reflecting the rodent's memory for the familiar object and its desire to explore a novel object. Because the task relies on the rodent's preference for novelty, it does not require any rule learning and hence no pre-training. Task difficulty can be increased by increasing the delay between T1 and T2. In a variant of this method memory loss in the rat can be induced using a pharmacological agent, for example sub-chronic phencyclidine, instead of the intertrial interval (ITI) time delay. Certain of the compounds exemplified herein have been tested in the NOR model and exhibited a minimum effective dose in the NOR test of less than 10 mg/kg, when administered orally.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0133">Suitably the compounds of the invention provide a wide therapeutic window between the desirable pro-cognitive effects and undesirable side-effects, particularly pro-convulsive effects which may result from over-activation of AMPA receptors.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0134">The potential for a compound to induce convulsive effects may be determined using a variety of models. For example, in-vitro pro-convulsant liability may be assessed using rodent neuronal electrophysiology hippocampus slices to assess potentially convulsive effects of a compound at different concentrations. The liability of a compound to induce repetitive firing being an in-vitro surrogate of convulsant activity.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0135">Potential pro-convulsant effects in-vivo may be assessed using for example a maximum electroshock threshold (MEST) test. In the MEST test, corneal application of electrical current (CC of approximately 80-70 mA, 0.1 ms duration) in the rat induces tonic and full tonic-clonic seizures. In order to assess the potential of a compound to reduce seizure threshold activity, rats are pre-treated with compound, saline vehicle, or picrotoxin as a positive control 30 min before testing. Models for assessing the convulsant effects of compounds are known and described in, for example Ward et al., J. Med. Chem. 2011, 54, 78-94, and Loscher et al., Epilepsy Res. 1991, 8: 79-84.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0136">Suitably the compound of the invention does not show any pro-convulsant activity in the MEST test at doses which are at least 50 times greater than the minimum efficacious dose in the NOR test. For example, no pro-convulsive effects are observed in the MEST test at doses which are greater than 75 times, or preferably greater than 100 times the minimum efficacious dose in the NOR test.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0137">The compounds of the invention suitably have a favourable drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic (DMPK) profile, for example low clearance, high oral bioavailability, high brain penetration and a half-life providing a reasonable duration of action following dosing of the compound.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0138">Suitably the compounds of the invention exhibit a low in-vitro intrinsic clearance (CLi) in the presence of rat, dog and/or human liver microsomes. For example, compounds of the invention preferably have a CLi of less than 100 &#x3bc;L/min/kg in rat and human microsomes. The CLi can be measured using known methods, such as those illustrated in the Examples.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0139">Human P-glycoprotein (P-gp, MDR1) is highly expressed in the blood brain barrier and poses a barrier to brain penetration for P-gp substrates.

In some embodiments a compound of the invention is for use in the treatment of a depressive disorder which has an associated anxious component or anxiety disorder. For example, the treatment of a depressive disorder described herein with an associated anxiety disorder as described herein (e.g. selected from a panic disorder, panic disorder with agoraphobia, a social phobia, a specific phobia (e.g. an animal or environmental phobia), post-traumatic distress disorder, an acute stress disorder, an obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and panic attacks).</p><p id="p-0234" num="0170">In some embodiments a compound of the invention is for use in the treatment of a mood disorder. Mood disorders are conditions in which a patient's mood changes to depression (often with associated anxiety) and/or to elation. The mood disorders may be acute or recurrent and are often triggered by stressful events or situations. Examples of mood disorders include, manic episodes (e.g. hypomania, mania with psychotic symptoms or mania without psychotic symptoms); a bipolar affective disorder (e.g. manic depression or a manic depressive illness, psychosis or reaction); a depressive episode (e.g. mild, moderate or severe depressive episode); a recurrent depressive disorder; a persistent mood disorders (e.g. cyclothymia or dysthymia); or anhedonia.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0171">Various symptoms are associated with depressive disorders and mood disorders such as MDD, for example, persistent anxious or sad feelings, feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, pessimism, worthlessness, low energy, restlessness, irritability, fatigue, loss of interest in pleasurable activities or hobbies, excessive sleeping, overeating, appetite loss, insomnia, thoughts of suicide, and suicide attempts.

Suitable in-vivo models of depression include for example the animal models described in Zanos et al 2016 ibid including the learned helplessness assay and female urine sniffing test after chronic mild stress. In human the effect of a compound on depressive or mood disorders may be assessed by, for example, an improvement in a patient's symptoms using a suitable clinical scoring or rating system such as a depression symptoms rating scale. Reference to a &#x201c;depression symptoms rating scale&#x201d; refers to any one of a number of standardized questionnaires, clinical instruments, or symptom inventories utilized to measure symptoms and symptom severity in depressive disorders. Such rating scales are often used in clinical studies to define treatment outcomes, based on changes from the study's entry point(s) to endpoint(s). Examples of depression symptoms rating scales include, but are not limited to, The Quick Inventory of Depressive-Symptomatology Self-Report (QIDS-SRi6), the 17-Item Hamilton Rating Scale of Depression (HRSDn), the 30-Item Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-C30), The Montgomery-&#x212b;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), or The Beck's Depression Scale Inventory. Such ratings scales may involve patient self-report or be clinician rated.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0173">Generally, a 50% or greater reduction in a depression ratings scale score over the course of a clinical trial (starting point to endpoint) is often considered to be a favourable response for most depression symptoms rating scales, although lower % reductions may provide a benefit and are contemplated herein. Generally, &#x201c;remission&#x201d; in clinical studies of depression refers to achieving at, or below, a particular numerical rating score on a depression symptoms rating scale (for instance, less than or equal to 7 on the HRSD17; or less than or equal to 5 on the QIDS-SRie; or less than or equal to 10 on the MADRS).</p><p id="p-0238" num="0174">In some embodiments, a compound of the invention is for use in the treatment of a depressive condition or mood disorder (e.g. as described herein), wherein the compound provides a rapid effect on the depressive condition or mood disorder.

Anxiety is a feeling of apprehension or fear that lingers due to an individual's perception of persistent and unrelenting stress. Anxiety is typically accompanied by various physical symptoms including twitching, trembling, muscle tension, headaches, sweating (e.g., night sweats), dry mouth, or difficulty swallowing. Some people also report dizziness, a rapid or irregular heart rate, shortness of breath, increased rate of respiration, fatigue, nausea, diarrhoea, or frequent need to urinate when they are anxious. Fatigue, irritable mood, sleeping difficulties, decreased concentration, sexual problems, or nightmares are also common. Some people are more sensitive to stress and are thus more likely to develop anxiety disorders. The propensity to succumb to anxiety attacks may be due to genetic predisposition or by previous (e.g. childhood) exposure to certain stresses. Anxiety may also be induced by or associated with medical conditions, for example pain, especially in patients suffering with chronic pain.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0182">Examples of anxiety disorders include separation anxiety disorder, selective mutism, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder (social phobia), panic disorder, panic attack, agoraphobia, post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder, substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder, anxiety disorder due to another medical disorder (e.g. depression), other specified anxiety disorder, or unspecified anxiety disorder. As mentioned above the anxiety disorder may be associated with or be caused by a depressive disorder.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0183">The effect of a compound if the invention in the treatment of an anxiety disorder may be assessed using a suitable anxiety symptom rating scale. Such scales are well-known and include, for example standardized questionnaires, clinical instruments, or symptom inventories utilized to measure symptoms and symptom severity in anxiety. Examples of anxiety symptoms rating scales include, but are not limited to, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety (HADS-A). Such ratings scales may involve patient self-reporting or be clinician rated.

Brain Res. 2006, 169, 263-273). Rats are trained over several weeks to press a lever contingent with a light cue for a food reward (either lever under a light, or lever not under a light). For the reversal task, rats are first given a 30 min operant training session with a constant contingency relative to the light cue. This is followed by a 5 min session called the &#x201c;initial task&#x201d;, in which the contingency is the same as for the prior operant session. After the initial task there is a 5 min &#x201c;reversal task&#x201d; in which the contingency is reversed. Responses on correct and incorrect levers in the initial and reversal task are recorded. Once performance is stable the training is stopped and a cognitive deficit is induced in the rats via sub-chronic administration of phencyclidine (PCP) followed by at least 7-days washout (as a control some rats receive saline instead of PCP). The cognitive effects of drugs can be tested with acute administration of the test drug before the reversal task, with initial and reversal sessions as above. Risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic, is used as a positive control that is known to attenuate the cognitive deficit.</p><p id="p-0498" num="0395">One of the compounds exemplified herein, &#x201c;UoS26478&#x201d; was tested acutely at doses of 3.0, 10 and 30 mg/kg (per oral, 30 min ptt) compared to risperidone (0.1 mg/kg, i.p, 60 min ptt) in sub-chronic phencyclidine (scPCP) treated rats (2 mg/kg, i.p. twice daily for seven days, followed by at least a 7-day washout period) to restore performance in the reversal learning task.</p><p id="p-0499" num="0396">Results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The data in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows mean&#xb1;s.e.m. % correct lever responses (n=9-10) and were analysed by ANOVA and post-hoc LSD test.
