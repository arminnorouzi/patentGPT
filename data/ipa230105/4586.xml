In particular, aspects of the disclosure relate to processing systems that train and apply machine learning models.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In some instances, enterprise organizations may use automated chatbots to respond to client queries. In these instances, however, a single chatbot may be configured to respond to all queries, and thus must be trained and subsequently maintained in a way that supports such widespread response capabilities. This may result in the bot being error prone and/or unable to respond to a large number of queries for which it does not have supporting information on which to base a response. Furthermore, this single bot method may result in processing inefficiencies, as it may take the bot a long period of time to access the relevant information and provide a response. Such shortcomings may limit or otherwise impact the utility of such chatbots in providing customer service.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Additionally, in some instances, chatbot query responses may be developed on a platform by platform basis. Accordingly, content changes may cause operational inefficiencies due to the process of coordinating/modifying underlying code and redeploying the modified content for a variety of platforms. This may further amplify the above described processing inefficiencies.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Furthermore, in many bot systems, a developer may programmatically implement a conversation flow within the bot systems. In these instances, however, when dialog flows are changed, codes relating to the entire development circle may require updates and redeployment. Such efforts may be further exacerbated if conversation flows are deployed in multiple channels (e.g., chat, voice, web, and/or other channels). Similar to the deficiencies described above, such methods may result in further processing and/or programming inefficiencies.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Today's chatbots further may be configured to programmatically implement conversation flows consisting of multiple questions to collect information prior to answering a user question. For example, these chatbots may provide a <b>1</b>:<b>1</b> relationship between questions and answers. Accordingly, this may result in inability of the chatbots to respond to a question if it is not properly worded, and/or may result in programming inefficiencies if new response information is added, and must be manually programmed into any corresponding responses.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Aspects of the disclosure provide effective, efficient, scalable, and convenient technical solutions that address and overcome the technical problems associated with chatbot execution.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with one or more embodiments, a computing platform comprising at least one processor, a communication interface communicatively coupled to the at least one processor, and memory may train a plurality of machine learning models, where each of the plurality of machine learning models corresponds to a chatbot. The computing platform may train an additional machine learning model, which may configure the additional machine learning model to route queries to one or more of the plurality of machine learning models based on contents of the queries. The computing platform may receive, from a client device, one or more queries. The computing platform may analyze the one or more queries using the additional machine learning model. The computing platform may route, based on the query analysis, the one or more queries to one or more of the plurality of machine learning models. The computing platform may generate, using the one or more of the plurality of machine learning models, one or more query responses. The computing platform may send, to the client device, one or more query responses and one or more commands directing the client device to display the one or more query responses, which may cause the client device to display the one or more query responses. The computing device may generate, based on the one or more queries and the one or more query responses, a customized output for a user of the client device. The computing device may send, to the client device, the customized output and one or more commands directing the client device to display the customized output, which may cause the client device to display the customized output.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In embodiments, the computing platform may receive an updated JSON object, and may update one of a plurality of machine learning models based on the updated JSON object, which might not affect the remaining models of the plurality of machine learning models. In doing so, the computing platform may generate a conversation flow from a predefined configuration JSON object. This JSON object may be updated by an administrator, through a user experience, by a business analyst, and/or by other individuals and the conversation flow may be dynamically updated in real-time to reflect any changes. In doing so, no modifications to code or deployment process may be necessary. In some instances, this may define a separate conversation flow, which may be outside the Bot systems described below. The conversation flow may be defined as content, and may be configurable rather than defined using program codes. For example, a dynamic handler flow may be created within the Bot systems described below. Accordingly, when the Bot systems understand a user intent, they will call a flow content application programming interface (API) to obtain a conversation flow configuration, and reply to a user query based on the configuration. Accordingly, if there are changes in business flow, content may change rather than requiring code modifications by developers, which may cause a hassle in product deployment. As a result, no programming skills are needed to create or update the chat/conversation flow.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In embodiments, the computing platform may generate, using the one or more of the plurality of machine learning models, a response to the query, which may include: 1) querying a content database that includes ground-truth content, 2) identifying a communication channel for which the response to the query is to be formatted, and 3) formatting the response to the query to include a version of the ground-truth content (e.g., factual data gathered from the real world in machine learning) that is formatted for the identified communication channel. The computing platform may send, to the client device, the response to the query and one or more commands directing the client device to display the response to the query, which may cause the client device to display the response to the query. The computing platform may generate analytics information based on interactions with the chatbots and may send one or more commands directing an enterprise user device to display the analytics information, which may cause the enterprise user device to display the analytics information.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In embodiments, the computing platform may analyze (e.g., parse) the query by identifying, using a first machine learning technique, a top level category corresponding to the query, and identifying, using a second machine learning technique, different than the first machine learning technique, at least one sub category corresponding to the query, where the first machine learning technique and/or the second machine learning technique may be selected based on accuracy of the corresponding machine learning technique in analyzing data corresponding to the top level category and the at least one sub category, respectively. The computing platform may route, based on the at least one sub category, the query to one or more of the plurality of machine learning models, each corresponding to a particular sub category. The computing platform may generate, using the one or more of the plurality of machine learning models, a response to the query. The computing platform may send, to the client device, the response to the query and one or more commands directing the client device to display the response to the query, which may cause the client device to display the response to the query.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an embodiment, a chatbot system configured to display a customized output comprises a plurality of machine learning models and a plurality of chatbots, each of the plurality of machine learning models corresponding to a respective chatbot of the plurality of chatbots, a computing platform comprising a processor, a non-transitory computer-readable memory communicatively coupled to the processor, and machine-readable instructions stored in the memory.

It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized, and structural and functional modifications may be made, without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">It is noted that various connections between elements are discussed in the following description. It is noted that these connections are general and, unless specified otherwise, may be direct or indirect, wired or wireless, and that the specification is not intended to be limiting in this respect.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As a brief introduction to the concepts described further below, systems and methods for using interconnected bot networks to focus on task distribution are described. For example, many bot systems today use a monolithic bot, which may be trained with a large variety of conversations to solve multiple expert tasks. This may cause poor performance in natural language processing, and it may be difficult to maintain the training data. Furthermore, this may result in a poor user experience. Accordingly, in such a system, new training data must be added to retrain the entire system, and the models must be constantly re-evaluated, all of which may impact performance of intent identification and/or classification.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Accordingly, described herein are a system/method for decentralization of a bot into a network of topic oriented bots. Each bot may be trained to fulfill user's requests on a specific topic. A network may consist of a manager bot and a pool of skilled bots. The manager bot may detect a user's intent at a high level, and may route the request to a corresponding skilled bot. The assigned bot may then further process a deeper understanding on its subject, and fulfill the user's request accordingly. By training multiple expert bots managed by a single bot manager, training data may be separated per task, and the user experience may be tailored per customer.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A bot service application programming interface (API) may accept a user's question, and may classify the question to identify a high level user intent. The service may be trained with a large dataset of utterances, which may be mapped to the high level categories. Once an intent is detected, the service may pass on to a router bot to route the request to a skilled bot. For example, a user question may be &#x201c;what is covered under collision coverage?&#x201d; In this example, the high level topic may be &#x201c;knowledge base.&#x201d; The manager bot may maintain a list of skilled bot names, mapped to the top level category, and corresponding endpoint classification APIs (e.g., &#x201c;knowledge base&#x201d; intent is mapped to &#x201c;KB&#x201d; bot name, and the endpoint for KB bot is &#x201c;directory #<b>1</b>.&#x201d; The manager bot may route the request to a corresponding endpoint to fulfill the user's request. Skilled bots may accept a user's question, and classify the details, topics, entities, and/or other information to fulfill the user's request. For example, if the user question is &#x201c;what is covered under collision coverage?,&#x201d; the classification may be coverage details, and the entity may be collision coverage.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Furthermore, many conversation systems today, such as chat and/or voice platforms, may develop answers for their customers within their specific platforms. Accordingly, when the content changes, it may be a long process to coordinate/change codes, and to redeploy the content in each platform. Accordingly, it may be advantageous to keep content as a separate component outside of engagement layers (chat, voice, Web, and/or other layers) to decrease cost, and increase time efficiency and/or effectiveness in operation, while allowing content experts to maintain/update content without impacting front end layers. More specifically, described herein are systems/methods for centralized knowledge-based content and for dynamically transforming the content into platform specific formats to display or render. Such channels may include web, mobile, chat systems, voice systems, and/or other channels.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In addition, today, many bots programmatically implement conversation flow consisting of multiple questions to collect information before answering a user's question. As a result, operational overhead when contents are changed may be significant. For example, developers must manually change codes and/or implement changes throughout an entire development circle. As a specific example, a knowledge base may contain information about multiple coverages such as collision coverage and comprehensive coverage. The knowledge base may further contain information regarding what is not involved in each type of coverage for potential display. Each type of coverage may include information such as: how much is the deductible, whether it is optional or required coverage, what is covered, and/or other information. When customers ask, for example, &#x201c;is collision coverage required,&#x201d; developers today may need to extract several entities such as coverage type, classify the user intent, and return a corresponding answer. If new content is added for collision coverage such as limitations, a developer may need to implement a new conversation flow to support a new limitation intent question, and go through an entire deployment process.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Accordingly, described herein is a knowledge base and education bot that uses multi-layered taxonomy conversation understanding to address such deficiencies. For example, content may be organized in a hierarchical structure. For example, collision coverage general information may include information such as &#x201c;a coverage that helps pay to repair or replace your car if it's damaged in an accident with another vehicle or object, such as a fence or tree.&#x201d; Then, collision coverage optional/required information may include &#x201c;if you're leasing or financing your car, collision coverage may be required by the lender. If your car is paid off, collision coverage may be optional.&#x201d; The bot may classify text and return a multiple layer category, which may include using training data with multiple classes to train the bot to identify top level categories and one or more sub-categories. For example, the bot may identify a top level category of &#x201c;information,&#x201d; based on the above query, and then may identify a sub-level category of &#x201c;is required.&#x201d; In some instances, each parent category may have a corresponding configuration file, and each sub-category may correspond to an endpoint API.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some instances, a manager bot may be used to distribute tasks to configured endpoints for further classification. In these instances, multiple endpoint URLs may allow application of different NLP and/or machine learning algorithms based on the amount of utterances and/or other information so as to achieve the most accurate performance.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> depict an illustrative computing environment for using interconnected bot networks for task distribution in accordance with one or more example embodiments.

A data bus may interconnect processor <b>111</b>, memory <b>112</b>, and communication interface <b>113</b>. Communication interface <b>113</b> may be a network interface configured to support communication between bot management platform <b>102</b> and one or more networks (e.g., network <b>101</b>, or the like). Memory <b>112</b> may include one or more program modules having instructions that when executed by processor <b>111</b> cause bot management platform <b>102</b> to perform one or more functions described herein and/or one or more databases that may store and/or otherwise maintain information which may be used by such program modules and/or processor <b>111</b>. In some instances, the one or more program modules and/or databases may be stored by and/or maintained in different memory units of bot management platform <b>102</b> and/or by different computing devices that may form and/or otherwise make up bot management platform <b>102</b>.

For example, the bot management platform <b>102</b> may build a model that moves bot conversation flow into a content-oriented component, which may allow individuals to create conversations without actually programming codes. In some instances, to do so, the bot management platform <b>102</b> may create and/or host a non-structured query language (SQL) conversation database. For example, the bot management platform <b>102</b> may maintain one or more JavaScript object notation (JSON) objects, which may be used to match responses to received queries. For example, the bot management platform <b>102</b> may host a core conversation service, which may be used by the models to retrieve a list of rules to identify user intent. This list of rules may be used to provide a query response per the methods described herein. In some instances, one or more of the JSON objects received may enable the bot management platform <b>102</b> to pre-train one or more models without the need to obtain additional training data.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">At step <b>202</b>, the bot management platform <b>102</b> may establish a first wireless data connection with the conversation data source <b>105</b>. For example, the bot management platform <b>102</b> may establish a first wireless data connection with the conversation data source <b>105</b> to link the bot management platform <b>102</b> to the conversation data source <b>105</b> (e.g., in preparation for requesting historical conversation data). In some instances, the bot management platform <b>102</b> may identify whether or not a connection is already established with the conversation data source <b>105</b>. If a connection is already established with the conversation data source <b>105</b>, the bot management platform <b>102</b> might not re-establish the connection. If a connection is not yet established with the conversation data source <b>105</b>, the bot management platform <b>102</b> may establish the first wireless data connection as described herein.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">At step <b>203</b>, the bot management platform <b>102</b> may request historical conversation data from the conversation data source <b>105</b>. For example, the bot management platform <b>102</b> may send a historical conversation data request via the communication interface <b>113</b> and while the first wireless data connection is established.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">At step <b>204</b>, the conversation data source <b>105</b> may send historical conversation data to the bot management platform <b>102</b>. For example, the conversation data source <b>105</b> may send one or more chat data logs, voice session recordings (and/or corresponding transcripts), validation information (e.g., indicating whether or not responses to queries were positively or negatively received), and/or other information. In some instances, the conversation data source <b>105</b> may send the historical conversation data to the bot management platform <b>102</b> while the first wireless data connection is established.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">At step <b>205</b>, the bot management platform <b>102</b> may receive the historical conversation data sent at step <b>204</b>. For example, the bot management platform <b>102</b> may receive the historical conversation data via the communication interface <b>113</b> and while the first wireless data connection is established. In some instances, as an alternative to or instead of collecting historical conversation data, the bot management platform <b>102</b> may collect industry knowledge, and may use this industry knowledge to create the models.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, at step <b>206</b>, the bot management platform <b>102</b> may train one or more machine learning and/or natural language processing models. For example, the bot management platform <b>102</b> may train bot management model <b>112</b><i>a </i>to parse queries, identify corresponding expert bots to respond to the queries, and route the queries accordingly. The bot management platform <b>102</b> may also train one or more expert models (e.g., first expert bot <b>112</b><i>b</i>, second expert bot <b>112</b><i>c</i>, third expert bot <b>112</b><i>d</i>, fourth expert bot <b>112</b><i>e</i>, and/or other models) to provide query responses related to particular topics (e.g., knowledge base, quotes, account help, customer services, and/or other topics). In some instances, the bot management platform <b>102</b> may train the different models using different machine learning techniques (i.e., whatever technique is best for the specific data supported by each model may be used to train that corresponding model&#x2014;based on data quantity, data type, or the like).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">At step <b>207</b>, the client device <b>103</b> may establish a connection with the bot management platform <b>102</b>.

In some instances, the client device <b>103</b> may identify whether or not a connection is already established with the bot management platform <b>102</b>. If a connection is already established with the bot management platform <b>102</b>, the client device <b>103</b> might not re-establish the connection. If a connection is not yet established with the bot management platform <b>102</b>, the client device <b>103</b> may establish the connection as described herein.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">At step <b>208</b>, the client device <b>103</b> may send a query to the bot management platform <b>102</b>. For example, the client device <b>103</b> may receive user input through a chatbot display/interface (e.g., a gesture input, voice input, text input, and/or other inputs), that may include one or more queries, and the client device <b>103</b> may send a query to the bot management platform <b>102</b> accordingly. As a particular example, the client device <b>103</b> may send a query such as &#x201c;What is covered under collision coverage?&#x201d; In some instances, the client device <b>103</b> may send the query to the bot management platform <b>102</b> while the second wireless data connection is established.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">At step <b>209</b>, the bot management platform <b>102</b> may receive the query sent at step <b>208</b>.

For example, the bot management platform <b>102</b> may use the bot management model to apply one or more machine learning and/or natural language processing techniques to identify an expert bot to which the query should be routed. For example, if the query was &#x201c;What is covered under collision coverage,&#x201d; the bot management model may identify that a knowledge base expert bot may provide the most accurate response to the query.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some instances, the bot management platform <b>102</b> may parse the query and identify multi-layer classes that may each correspond to a particular model (e.g., expert bot). For example, the bot management platform <b>102</b> may parse a query such as &#x201c;is collision coverage required.&#x201d; Rather than having a queued <b>1</b>:<b>1</b> response to this question, the bot management platform <b>102</b> may classify this text to return a multi-layered category. To do so, in some instances, the bot management platform <b>102</b> may select a first machine learning technique to apply to identify a top level category corresponding to the query (e.g., based on accuracy of the corresponding technique in analyzing data corresponding to the given category (e.g., based on a number of utterances corresponding to the query or a portion of the query being used to identify the particular category, an amount of labelled data, an amount of unlabeled data, data type, and/or other reasons)).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">By routing the queries to expert bots in this way, each expert bot may be trained more extensively on a particular subject than if a single bot was being used to cover a plurality of topics. In doing so, each given expert bot may be better configured to provide specific/accurate query responses than if a single bot were to be used. Furthermore, each expert bot may be deployed, updated, removed, and/or otherwise modified without impacting the remaining expert bots, and additionally processing speed may be increased.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some instances, in identifying an expert bot, the bot management platform <b>102</b> may identify a confidence level corresponding to the given expert bot identification. The bot management platform <b>102</b> may compare this confidence level to a confidence threshold, and may, in some instances, only route the query to the identified expert bot if the confidence level exceeds the confidence threshold (e.g., proceed to step <b>211</b>). If the bot management platform <b>102</b> identifies that the confidence level does not exceed the confidence threshold, the bot management platform <b>102</b> may proceed to step <b>219</b> to request manual assistance.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, at step <b>211</b>, the bot management platform <b>102</b> may use the technique selected at step <b>210</b> to identify a top level category.
