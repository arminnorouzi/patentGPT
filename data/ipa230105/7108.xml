Acoustic components, such as a phone receiver, a microphone, and a speaker, are generally disposed in an electronic device, and the acoustic components can implement acoustic performance of the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the related art, acoustic components are disposed in a housing of an electronic device, and the housing of the electronic device is provided with a sound guide hole. Sound information sent out by a user can be transmitted to the acoustic component through the sound guide hole, or sound information sent out by the acoustic component is transmitted to the user through an opening, so as to implement sound information exchange between the user and the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, in the foregoing solution, the housing needs to be provided with the sound guide hole for transmitting sound information. In this case, the sound guide hole damages integrity of the housing, affecting appearance consistency of the electronic device. The sound guide hole also reduces waterproof and dustproof performance of the electronic device, leading to poor safety and reliability of the electronic device.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention discloses an electronic device, to resolve problems of low appearance consistency and poor safety and reliability of the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To resolve the foregoing technical problems, the present invention is implemented as follows:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a first aspect, an embodiment of the present invention discloses an electronic device, including a housing, a first functional module, a second functional module, and a third functional module, where the third functional module is disposed in the housing, the third functional module includes an acoustic component, a sound guide channel is disposed in the housing, the second functional module and the first functional module are mounted on the housing, with an assembly gap present between the second functional module and the first functional module, and the acoustic component communicates with the assembly gap through the sound guide channel.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The technical solution used in the present invention can achieve the following beneficial effects:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In this embodiment of the present invention, the second functional module and the first functional module are mounted on the housing, with an assembly gap present between the second functional module and the first functional module, and the acoustic component communicates with the assembly gap through the sound guide channel. When a user sends out sound information, the sound information enters the housing through the assembly gap, and the assembly gap transmits the sound information to the acoustic component through the sound guide channel; or when the acoustic component sends out sound information, the sound information is transmitted to the assembly gap through the sound guide channel, and then transmitted to the user through the assembly gap, thereby implementing sound information exchange between the user and the electronic device. In this solution, an assembly gap is present after the first functional module and the second functional module are fitted together. Therefore, the assembly gap between the first functional module and the second functional module can be used to transmit sound information, so that no sound guide hole needs to be provided on the housing. This reduces openings on the housing, and improves integrity and appearance consistency of the housing, thereby guaranteeing a good appearance and texture of the housing and improving user experience. In addition, the assembly gap is narrower than the sound guide hole, which can effectively prevent ambient vapor and dust from entering the housing, thereby improving waterproof and dustproof performance of the electronic device.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">To describe the technical solutions in the embodiments of the present invention or in the background more clearly, the following briefly describes the accompanying drawings required for describing the embodiments or the background.

The third functional module may be disposed in the housing <b>100</b>. The third functional module includes an acoustic component <b>230</b>, and the acoustic component <b>230</b> may include at least one of sounding components or sound pickup components such as a microphone, a phone receiver, and a speaker. A sound guide channel <b>400</b> is disposed in the housing <b>100</b>, and the sound guide channel <b>400</b> is configured to transmit sound information. The second functional module <b>220</b> and the first functional module <b>210</b> are mounted on the housing <b>100</b>, and an assembly gap <b>221</b> is present between the second functional module <b>220</b> and the first functional module <b>210</b>, with an opening of the assembly gap <b>221</b> being exposed out of an outer surface of the electronic device. The assembly gap <b>221</b> may be configured to guide sound for the electronic device, and the acoustic component <b>230</b> communicates with the assembly gap <b>221</b> through the sound guide channel <b>400</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0027">In a specific operation process, in a case that the acoustic component <b>230</b> is a sound pickup component, when a user sends out sound, the sound enters the housing <b>100</b> through the assembly gap <b>221</b>, and the assembly gap <b>221</b> transmits the sound to the acoustic component <b>230</b> through the sound guide channel <b>400</b>. In this embodiment, the acoustic component <b>230</b> may be a microphone. In a case that the acoustic component <b>230</b> is a sounding component, when the acoustic component <b>230</b> sends out sound, the sound is transmitted to the assembly gap <b>221</b> through the sound guide channel <b>400</b>, and then transmitted to the user through the assembly gap <b>221</b>. In this embodiment, the acoustic component <b>230</b> may be a phone receiver or a speaker.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0028">Optionally, the housing <b>100</b> may include a front cover and a rear cover, where the front cover may provide a foundation for mounting a display screen of the electronic device, and the rear cover may be a battery cover of the electronic device. In a case that both the first functional module <b>210</b> and the second functional module <b>220</b> are mounted on the rear cover of the housing <b>100</b>, the first functional module <b>210</b> may be a rear-facing camera module of the electronic device, a flash lamp module, a fingerprint module, a second display module disposed on the rear cover of the housing, or the like. To better describe this embodiment, the following assumes that the first functional module <b>210</b> is a rear-facing camera module. The second functional module <b>220</b> may be a decorative part of the first functional module <b>210</b>, and therefore the assembly gap <b>221</b> is present between the rear-facing camera module, the flash lamp module, or the fingerprint module disposed on the rear and their corresponding decorative rings. Certainly, the first functional module <b>210</b> and the second functional module <b>220</b> may alternatively be other functional modules, which are not limited herein.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0029">In this embodiment of the present invention, the assembly gap <b>221</b> is present after the first functional module <b>210</b> and the second functional module <b>220</b> are fitted together. Therefore, the assembly gap <b>221</b> between the first functional module <b>210</b> and the second functional module <b>220</b> can be used to transmit sound information, so that no sound guide hole needs to be provided on the housing <b>100</b>. This reduces openings on the housing <b>100</b>, and improves integrity and appearance consistency of the housing <b>100</b>, thereby guaranteeing a good appearance and texture of the housing and improving user experience. In addition, the assembly gap <b>221</b> is narrower than the sound guide hole, which can effectively prevent ambient vapor and dust from entering the housing <b>100</b>, thereby improving waterproof and dustproof performance of the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0030">Moreover, the assembly gap <b>221</b> between the first functional module <b>210</b> and the second functional module <b>220</b> is used to transmit sound information, so that the housing <b>100</b> does not need an additionally processed sound guide hole. This optimizes a processing process of the housing <b>100</b> and simplifies processing steps of the housing <b>100</b>, thereby reducing manufacturing costs of the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0031">In an optional embodiment, the assembly gap <b>221</b> may be in an elongated strip shape. A width of the assembly gap <b>221</b> can be reduced to make the assembly gap <b>221</b> more concealed. The width is a distance between parts of the first functional module <b>210</b> and the second functional module <b>220</b> which form the assembly gap <b>221</b>. In this case, the assembly gap <b>221</b> is not easy to be seen, guaranteeing a good appearance and texture of the electronic device. An extension direction of the assembly gap <b>221</b> is a length direction of the assembly gap <b>221</b>. In this case, a length of the assembly gap <b>221</b> can be increased to increase an area of the assembly gap <b>221</b>, so as to satisfy a sound guide requirement of the acoustic component <b>230</b>. A shape and structure of the assembly gap <b>221</b> may be determined by shapes and structures of the first functional module <b>210</b> and the second functional module <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0032">In another embodiment, the assembly gap <b>221</b> may be of an arc structure. The arc structure has no corners and is much smoother than a linear structure, making the electronic device more aesthetic and further improving user experience.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0033">To further improve performance of the acoustic component <b>230</b>, in an optional embodiment, an opening is provided on an edge of a side of the second functional module <b>220</b> attached to the first functional module <b>210</b>, and the opening forms the assembly gap <b>221</b>. In this solution, part of material is removed from the edge of the side of the second functional module <b>220</b> attached to the first functional module <b>210</b>, so that the assembly gap <b>221</b> between the second functional module <b>220</b> and the first functional module <b>210</b> is larger, and the area of the assembly gap <b>221</b> is increased. In this way, the assembly gap <b>221</b> can transmit more sound information, which improves the performance of the acoustic component <b>230</b>, allowing for better sound quality of the electronic device. Optionally, the opening may be in an elongated strip shape, or may certainly be in other shapes, which is not limited herein. Certainly, an opening may alternatively be provided on an edge of a side of the first functional module <b>210</b> attached to the second functional module <b>220</b>, which can achieve the same technical effects: larger area of the assembly gap <b>221</b> allows the assembly gap <b>221</b> to transmit more sound information, thereby improving the performance of the acoustic component <b>230</b> and allowing for better sound quality of the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0034">In an optional embodiment, the first functional module <b>210</b> may include a first functional component and a module bracket. The first functional component is mounted on the module bracket, the first functional component and the module bracket are exposed out of an outer surface of the housing <b>100</b>, and the assembly gap <b>221</b> is formed between the module bracket and the second functional module <b>220</b>. In this solution, sound cannot easily affect the first functional component when being transmitted, and ambient vapor and dust cannot easily enter the first functional component, thereby improving reliability of the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0035">For example, when the first functional module <b>210</b> is a camera module, the first functional component may include a camera and other electronic components, and the module bracket provides a foundation for mounting the camera and other electronic components.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0036">In the foregoing embodiment, ambient dust and vapor can enter the housing <b>100</b> along the assembly gap <b>221</b>, which may cause the sound guide hole of the acoustic component <b>230</b> to be blocked or electronic components of the acoustic component <b>230</b> to be short-circuited, resulting in damage to the acoustic component <b>230</b> and low safety and reliability of the electronic device. To resolve the foregoing problems, in an optional embodiment, the sound guide channel <b>400</b> may include a first sound guide segment <b>410</b>, a second sound guide segment <b>420</b>, and a third sound guide segment <b>430</b> that are in sequential communication, where the first sound guide segment <b>410</b> communicates with the assembly gap <b>221</b>, the acoustic component <b>230</b> is located on an end of the third sound guide segment <b>430</b> facing away from the second sound guide segment <b>420</b>, a central axis of the first sound guide segment <b>410</b> intersects with a central axis of the second sound guide segment <b>420</b>, and the central axis of the first sound guide segment <b>410</b> is parallel to a central axis of the third sound guide segment <b>430</b>. In this solution, the sound guide channel <b>400</b> is of a bending structure, so that a side wall of each sound guide segment can stop dust and vapor. In addition, a long sound guide channel <b>400</b> allows most of the dust and vapor to settle on the side wall of each sound guide segment, so that the dust and vapor cannot easily reach a mounting position of the acoustic component <b>230</b>, and the sound guide hole of the acoustic component <b>230</b> is not easily blocked, allowing for good sound quality of the acoustic component <b>230</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0037">Optionally, an included angle between the central axis of the first sound guide segment <b>410</b> and the central axis of the second sound guide segment <b>420</b> may be 90&#xb0;. In this case, the central axis of the first sound guide segment <b>410</b> may be perpendicular to the central axis of the second sound guide segment <b>420</b>. In this case, the sound guide channel <b>400</b> has a compact structure, so that the sound guide channel <b>400</b> occupies a small space of the housing <b>100</b>. Certainly, the included angle between the central axis of the first sound guide segment <b>410</b> and the central axis of the second sound guide segment <b>420</b> may alternatively be other angles, such as 30&#xb0;, 45&#xb0;, or 60&#xb0;. A specific included angle is not limited in the present invention.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0038">In the foregoing solution, the central axis of the first sound guide segment <b>410</b> may intersect with the central axis of the second sound guide segment <b>420</b>, and the central axis of the first sound guide segment <b>410</b> may be parallel to the central axis of the third sound guide segment <b>430</b>. In this case, the second sound guide segment <b>420</b> may guide the third sound guide segment <b>430</b> to an edge position of the housing <b>100</b>, so that the acoustic component <b>230</b> is closer to the edge position of the housing <b>100</b>, thereby optimizing a structure of the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0039">In another optional embodiment, a connection channel <b>222</b> may be formed between the first functional module <b>210</b> and the second functional module <b>220</b>, the first sound guide segment <b>410</b> and the assembly gap <b>221</b> are staggered, and the first sound guide segment <b>410</b> communicates with the assembly gap <b>221</b> through the connection channel <b>222</b>. In this case, the assembly gap <b>221</b>, the connection channel <b>222</b>, and the first sound guide segment <b>410</b> form a bending structure, and a side wall of the bending structure can stop the dust and vapor. Therefore, most of the dust and vapor can be attached to the side wall of the bending structure, which can prevent the dust and vapor from entering the acoustic component <b>230</b>, so that the sound guide hole of the acoustic component <b>230</b> is not easily blocked and the electronic components of the acoustic component <b>230</b> are not easily short-circuited or damaged, further improving safety and reliability of the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0040">Optionally, when the first functional module <b>210</b> includes the first functional component and the module bracket, the connection channel <b>222</b> is formed by the module bracket and part of the second functional module <b>220</b> not exposed out of a surface of the housing <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0041">In the foregoing embodiment, the electronic device disclosed in the embodiments of the present invention may further include a main board bracket <b>510</b>, where the main board bracket <b>510</b> is configured for mounting an electronic component of the electronic device, the main board bracket <b>510</b> is disposed in the housing <b>100</b>, the first sound guide segment <b>410</b> may be provided on the first functional module <b>210</b>, the second sound guide segment <b>420</b> and the third sound guide segment <b>430</b> may be provided on the main board bracket <b>510</b>, and the first sound guide segment <b>410</b> forms an included angle with the second sound guide segment <b>420</b> and the third sound guide segment <b>430</b>. When the second sound guide segment <b>420</b> is formed by pouring, the second sound guide segment <b>420</b> is located in the inside of the main board bracket <b>510</b>, and the main board bracket <b>510</b> is difficult to demould, resulting in difficult processing and high costs of the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0042">In an optional embodiment, the electronic device disclosed in the embodiments of the present invention further includes a cover plate <b>520</b>, where the cover plate <b>520</b> may be located in the housing <b>100</b>, a first groove may be provided on a side of the main board bracket <b>510</b> facing toward the first functional module <b>210</b>, the cover plate <b>520</b> covers a notch of the first groove, and in this case, the cover plate <b>520</b> and the first groove can form the second sound guide segment <b>420</b>. One end of the cover plate <b>520</b> may be provided with a first through hole <b>521</b>, and the second sound guide segment <b>420</b> may communicate with the first sound guide segment <b>410</b> through the first through hole <b>521</b>. The third sound guide segment <b>430</b> may be provided on a bottom wall of the first groove, and the first through hole <b>521</b> and the third sound guide segment <b>430</b> are staggered.
