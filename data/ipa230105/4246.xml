So, for instance, it is possible to input the correct drug and a dosage. In the case of a syringe pump it is possible to input the syringe model and the dosage of the drug.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">CN 2 11 485 982 U and CN 2 11 485 983 U disclose medical pumps with a touch display as an input and output unit. The displays in the utility models mentioned comprise capacitive touch displays. Capacitive displays, however, have various disadvantages. On the one hand, it is not possible to operate capacitive displays with gloves or the like. Therefore, the user must take off the gloves before being able to make an input at the display. Furthermore, capacitive displays are susceptible to liquids. If (liquid) drops are present on the display surface, this may reduce the input quality of the display. Furthermore, liquid may penetrate into the display and may damage the display unit and/or electronics/a conductor plate behind the display.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The object of the disclosure thus consists in remedying the disadvantages of the state of the art and in providing a medical pump with a display which is adapted to be operated with gloves and also seals a housing from the ingress of liquid.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The disclosure relates to a medical pump, preferably a peristaltic pump or a syringe pump, for conveying a medical liquid with a pump housing and a front lid which is arranged hingedly at the pump housing and comprises a lid housing and an operating element integrated in the lid housing. The operating element comprises a resistive touch element and a separate display element arranged at a parallel distance to the touch element which jointly form a touch screen, wherein the resistive touch element and the display element are fastened to respective opposing sides of the lid housing.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The pump comprises, in other words, the front lid with the lid housing. The front lid is adapted to be folded downwards in order that a tube or a syringe may be inserted in the pump. An operating unit being an input and output unit and being integrated into the lid housing is positioned in the front lid. The operating unit has a touch screen comprising a resistive touch element and a display element (mounted there below). The display element is arranged in the interior of the lid housing and the resistive touch element is arranged at the outer side of the lid housing facing the user. The display element is arranged in an interior of the lid housing such that it is protected from external influences/environmental influences by the lid housing and the resistive touch element, wherein the touch element serves quasi as a seal. For this purpose, the touch element is preferably larger than the display element, i.e. the circumferences thereof project preferably (two-dimensionally) beyond the display element, wherein these projecting sections of the circumference are in sealing contact with the lid housing.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The display element is sensitive to external influences. Therefore, it is arranged in the interior of the lid housing, where it is protected by the touch element and by the lid housing from liquids and pollutions, such as, for instance, dust. The resistive touch element is arranged at the outside of the lid housing such that a user may perform inputs on the touch element. Due to this arrangement the display element is protected in the interior of the lid housing.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The touch element thus protects the display element. The touch element is operable by the user from the outside of the lid housing. Since the touch element is resistive, it may also be operated with gloves. Due to the resistive touch element is it at all possible to separate the display element and the touch element spatially/constructively and to mount them to/in the housing from different sides.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with a further preferred feature of the disclosure the resistive touch element extends substantially over a whole operator-facing front side of the lid housing. The resistive touch element comprises additional operating keys positioned below the film and operated through the film.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The resistive touch element extends preferably over the entire face of a front shell of the lid housing. The operating keys are preferably pressure-actuated. With the operating keys it is, for instance, possible to open the front lid, to switch the pump on and off, to interrupt a pump program, and to switch the input of the pump to a home screen, and the like. The operating keys are preferably arranged independently of the touch element. The operating keys are preferably wired with a conductor plate/printed circuit board of the display element which is independent of the touch element.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is further preferred that press-on foamed pieces are mounted to the rear wall of the front lid.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with a further preferred feature of the disclosure the touch element is glued to the front shell of the lid housing from the user-facing front side of the front lid. The touch element is, as already explained before, larger than the display face of the display element. This means that the touch element overlaps the front shell of the housing. The display element positioned behind the touch element is, through a recess clearance in a front of the front shell, visible from outside through the touch element. The touch element is consequently also larger than the recess clearance. Thus, there results a circumference face on which the touch element may be glued. The central overlapping of the recess clearance with the touch screen results in a large glue face. Due to this overlapping the touch element and/or the all-around gluing with the lid housing also ensures that no liquid/pollution may enter the interior of the housing.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with a further preferred feature of the disclosure the display element is screwed to the lid housing from the rear side. The display element is preferably screwed in the interior of the lid housing. For this purpose, the lid housing is divided into a front shell and a rear wall. The display element is screwed with the rear side of the front shell. Thus, the display element is protected by the front shell and by the touch element.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In accordance with a further preferred feature of the disclosure the touch element seals the housing from liquids and/or pollution. The touch element covers the entire face of the front shell. Since the touch element is glued with the lid housing, it is also tight with respect to liquids and dust. Thus, the touch element protects the components in the interior of the lid housing, for instance, the display element, the conductor plate, and plug connections.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In accordance with a further preferred feature of the disclosure a surface of the touch element is larger than a display face of the display element. The touch element does not only comprise the area directly above the recess clearance in the front shell, which is the visible area of the display element, but also the keys arranged next to the display field.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In accordance with a further preferred feature of the disclosure the display element is visible through a recess clearance in the lid housing, and the display element is larger than the recess clearance. The display element has a larger face than is the size of the recess clearance in the front shell of the lid housing. Thus, it is possible to compensate for manufacturing tolerances.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In accordance with a further preferred feature of the disclosure the operating unit comprises a conductor plate which is connected with electronics of the pump by a ribbon cable. The conductor plate is mounted on the display element. The conductor plate comprises a number of plug connections. A plug is the ribbon cable which connects the conductor plate with a power supply of the pump. By means of the ribbon cable the conductor plate is connected to the electronics of the pump. Thus, the conductor plate is supplied with current. Furthermore, the conductor plate is connected by the ribbon cable with a control unit of the pump. Accordingly, information may be transmitted via the ribbon cable.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In accordance with a further preferred feature of the disclosure, one or a plurality of pieces of a press-on foam are mounted on the rear wall of the front lid. The press-on foam is compressed once the front lid of the pump is closed. Once the locking of the front lid is released, the press-on foam expands and the front lid opens.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a front view of a medical peristaltic pump with a touch screen in accordance with a first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a front view of a resistive touch element.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a </i></figref>shows an isometric view of a display element.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>b </i></figref>shows a rear side of a front shell of a lid housing.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the display element.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a rear view of an operating unit with the display element.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a cross-section through the operating unit.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows the operating unit with a rear shell.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a press-on foam at the rear shell.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a lower side of the pump with a hinge plate of the operating unit.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows a front view of a medical syringe pump with a touch screen in accordance with a second embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a front view of a medical pump, preferably a peristaltic pump <b>1</b>, with a front lid <b>4</b> adapted to be folded downwards from the pump <b>1</b>.
