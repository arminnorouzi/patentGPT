Wireless access points (AP) are easily deployed, and increasingly dense APs also cause more inter-cell interference.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">How to reduce inter-cell interference and improve service quality for a user through AP coordination is a problem that needs to be considered in a next-generation wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) technology.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This application provides a method for coordinated communication and an apparatus used in coordinated communication, to implement multi-device coordinated communication. In this way, the plurality of devices in coordinated communication can freely transmit data, and flexibility of data transmission is improved.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect, a method for coordinated communication is provided. The method may be performed by a first device, or may be performed by a chip, a circuit, or a processing system configured in the first device. This is not limited in this application. For example, due to a difference in an integration level, the first device may be an entire device, or may be a part of an entire device, for example, a chip system or a processing system. This is not limited in this application. The first device may be, for example, an access point. The following describes an example in which the method is performed by a first access point (AP).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The method may include: A first access point AP obtains a transmit opportunity (TXOP); and the first AP sends an announcement message. The announcement message announces that the first AP shares the TXOP, and the announcement message includes identifier information that indicates N second AP and information that indicates a time resource for the N second AP to perform communication in the TXOP, and N is an integer greater than or equal to 1.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Optionally, that the first AP shares the TXOP may be understood as that the first AP shares the TXOP with the N second AP. That the first AP shares the TXOP or the first AP shares the TXOP with the N second AP may include: The first AP shares all of the TXOP with the N second AP, or the first AP shares a remaining part of the TXOP with the N second AP after completing data transmission.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Optionally, that the first AP shares the TXOP may also be understood as that the first AP shares a channel resource obtained by the first AP in the TXOP.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Based on the foregoing technical solution, the first AP may share the TXOP of the first AP with one or more second APs, reducing overheads caused by channel contention performed again by another AP (that is, the one or more second APs), and improving resource utilization. In addition, when the first AP shares the time resource with the N second AP, an appropriate time resource may be allocated to each second AP in advance, and each second AP may perform transmission on a time resource corresponding to each second AP. In this way, each second AP may directly send data to a station STA, so that data can be transmitted freely, transmission latency can be reduced, and flexibility of data transmission can be improved.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">With reference to the first aspect, in some implementations of the first aspect, the identifier information that indicates the N second AP includes an identifier of each second AP, or a group identifier of a group to which a second AP belongs.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Based on the foregoing technical solution, the first AP carries the identifier of the second AP or the group identifier of the group to which the second AP belongs in the announcement message, so that another AP may determine, based on whether an identifier of the another AP or a group identifier of a group to which the another AP belongs is in the announcement message, whether the another AP can share the time resource (such as the TXOP) of the first AP.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">With reference to the first aspect, in some implementations of the first aspect, the information that indicates the time resource for the N second AP to perform communication in the TXOP includes one or more of the following: duration of a time resource for each second AP to perform communication in the TXOP, start time of the time resource for each second AP to perform communication in the TXOP, and end time of the time resource for each second AP to perform communication in the TXOP.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">For example, the duration of the time resource for the second AP to perform communication in the TXOP may be duration of using a channel of the first AP by the second AP. The channel is a channel allocated by the first AP to the second AP, or a channel shared by the first AP with the second AP.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">For example, the start time of the time resource for the second AP to perform communication in the TXOP may be start time at which the second AP uses the channel of the first AP.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">For example, the end time of the time resource for the second AP to perform communication in the TXOP may be end time at which the second AP uses the channel of the first AP.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Based on the foregoing technical solution, time information of the second AP, for example, duration of a time resource that can be used by the second AP, start time of the time resource that can be used by the second AP, and end time of the time resource that can be used by the second AP, is carried in the announcement message, so that the second AP can transmit data within a time period corresponding to the second AP.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">With reference to the first aspect, in some implementations of the first aspect, the announcement message includes one or more of the following: an identifier of a link used by each second AP, an identifier of a channel used by each second AP, or sequence information of the N second AP. The sequence information of the N second AP indicates a sequence of using the channel by the N second AP.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an example, the announcement message may include sequence information of the N second AP, to indicate a sequence of sharing the TXOP by the N second AP. The N second AP may determine a sequence of sharing the TXOP based on the sequence information.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In another example, the second AP may determine a sequence of sharing the TXOP based on a sequence in which the identifiers appear.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Optionally, the sequence of sharing the TXOP by the N second AP one-to-one correspond to the identifiers of the N second AP.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">With reference to the first aspect, in some implementations of the first aspect, the N second AP include a third AP, and the method further includes: The first AP sends a first polling message to the third AP. The first polling message indicates the third AP to start to use, at first preset time, a channel resource allocated by the first AP to the third AP.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Based on the foregoing technical solution, when sharing the time resource with the N second AP, the first AP may allocate an appropriate transmission resource to each second AP in a dynamic or real-time manner based on a data transmission status of each second AP. Therefore, each second AP can perform transmission on a transmission resource allocated by the first AP. This can further improve resource utilization, and reduce resource waste.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">With reference to the first aspect, in some implementations of the first aspect, the first polling message includes duration of using, by the third AP, the channel resource allocated by the first AP to the third AP.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">With reference to the first aspect, in some implementations of the first aspect, the N second AP include a fourth AP and a fifth AP, and the method further includes: After the first AP determines that data transmission of the fourth AP is completed, the first AP sends a second polling message to the fifth AP. The second polling message indicates the fifth AP to start to use, at second preset time, a channel resource allocated by the first AP to the fifth AP</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">With reference to the first aspect, in some implementations of the first aspect, that the first AP determines that data transmission of the fourth AP is completed includes: After receiving a return message from the fourth AP, the first AP determines that data transmission of the fourth AP is completed. The return message is used to return a remaining time resource of a time resource allocated by the first AP to the fourth AP. Alternatively, the first AP receives indication information from the fourth AP, and determines, based on the indication information, that data transmission of the fourth AP is completed. The indication information indicates to return a remaining time resource of a time resource allocated by the first AP to the fourth AP.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">With reference to the first aspect, in some implementations of the first aspect, the indication information is carried in any one of the following: a more data subfield in a control field of a last data frame transmitted by the fourth AP; a more fragment subfield in a quality of service control field of a last data frame transmitted by the fourth AP; an end of service period EOSP subfield in a quality of service control field of a last data frame transmitted by the fourth AP; a duration field of a last data frame transmitted by the fourth AP; or a more trigger frame (more TF) field of a last trigger frame transmitted by the fourth AP.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to a second aspect, a method for coordinated communication is provided. The method may be performed by a first device, or may be performed by a chip, a circuit, or a processing system configured in the first device. This is not limited in this application. For example, due to a difference in an integration level, the first device may be an entire device, or may be a part of an entire device, for example, a chip system or a processing system. This is not limited in this application. The first device may be, for example, an access point, and an access point device may also be referred to as an access point. The following describes an example in which the method is performed by a first access point AP.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The method may include: A first access point AP obtains a transmit opportunity (TXOP); and the first AP sends an announcement message. The announcement message announces that the first AP shares the TXOP, and the announcement message includes indication information. The indication information indicates that N second AP can use, in a channel contention manner, a channel resource obtained by the first AP in the TXOP, and N is an integer greater than or equal to 1.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Based on the foregoing technical solution, a plurality of APs may share a time resource. For example, the first AP may send an announcement message, the announcement message carries indication information, and the indication information may indicate that the second AP may transmit data in a channel contention manner. For example, each second AP may transmit data in a channel contention manner within a time period corresponding to each second AP. Therefore, coordination between the plurality of APs can be implemented, and the second AP can directly send data to a STA after successfully contending for a channel, so that data can be transmitted freely, transmission latency can be reduced, and flexibility of data transmission can be improved. In addition, by using this solution, the first AP does not need to know a transmission requirement of the second AP, and does not need to carry identifier information of each second AP in the announcement message.

Multi-Link Communication</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">In an example, embodiments of this application may also be applied to a multi-link communication scenario. For example, the first device may be a multi-link access point device <b>1</b>, and the second device may be a multi-link access point device <b>2</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, it is assumed that the multi-link access point device <b>2</b> includes an AP <b>21</b>, an AP <b>22</b>, . . . , and an AP <b>2</b><i>n, </i>and the multi-link access point device <b>1</b> includes an AP <b>11</b>, an AP <b>12</b>, . . . , and an AP <b>1</b><i>n, </i>where n is an integer greater than or equal to 1. For example, the AP <b>21</b> may communicate with the AP <b>11</b> through a link <b>1</b>. For another example, the AP <b>22</b> may communicate with the AP <b>12</b> through a link <b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. For still another example, the AP <b>2</b><i>n </i>may communicate with the AP <b>1</b><i>n </i>through a link n in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">It should be understood that embodiments of this application are not limited to multi-link communication. Embodiment of this application may be applied to any multi-device coordination scenario, for example, a multi-AP coordination scenario or a multi-station coordination scenario.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">2. Multi-AP Coordination</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">For example, a manner of multi-AP coordination may include but is not limited to coordinated orthogonal frequency division multiple access (o OFDMA) and coordinated beamforming.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">Coordinated OFDMA is used as an example. For example, when a bandwidth is large, a plurality of APs may separately perform transmission on different channels in an OFDMA manner, and do not interfere with each other.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">Coordinated beamforming is used as an example. For example, if the plurality of APs can obtain all channel information, interference nulling may be performed on a STA in another cell during parallel transmission, to avoid generating interference.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">The foregoing manners of coordination are performed in a frequency domain and a space domain. In such manners, the plurality of APs need to be well synchronized, or channel information of a station needs to be obtained. Implementation complexity is high.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">In addition, there is another manner of coordination in terms of time. In a conventional technology, the AP may share a time resource with a relay node. Specifically, after the AP sends a data frame to the relay, the relay sends the data frame to the STA in a transmit opportunity (TXOP) of the AP directly (or after sending an acknowledgment frame), so that a process of channel contention performed again by the relay may be omitted.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">In the conventional technology, time resource sharing is limited to a relay scenario. In addition, the relay can only forward, to a corresponding STA, a data frame sent by the AP to the relay, and cannot freely send other data. In addition, the coordination manner is limited, and is not conducive to coordinated transmission performance.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">In view of this, this application provides a method to explore a manner of multi-AP coordination in a time domain. In this way, a plurality of APs in coordinated communication can flexibly use transmission resources to perform communication, improving transmission flexibility and communication efficiency. In addition, this application further provides some preparations before multi-AP coordination, so that coordination between the plurality of APs can be more appropriate, improving coordinated transmission performance.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">The following describes in detail embodiments provided in this application with reference to the accompanying drawings.
