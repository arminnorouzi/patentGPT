INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention is in the field of using computer-implemented methods for processing a plurality of process variables of a production cell comprising at least one shaping machine as a subunit of the production cell.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The at least one subunit can have a plurality of actuators and/or sensors, which define a totality of process variables in the form of all process variables that can be ascertained from the measurement values (or can be in the form of a measurement value or values themselves) for the plurality of actuators and/or sensors of the at least one subunit or in the form of a static, pre-selected subset of process variables.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the context of the present disclosure an actuator is understood to be any component of a machine that is responsible for moving and/or controlling a mechanism or system.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Usually, sensors are used to capture measurement values. In some embodiments, an actuator can be used to measure a process variable. By way of example, for an actuator in the form of an electric motor it is possible to measure the current provided to the actuator and to conclude therefrom a force (process variable) exerted by the actuator.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the prior art, all of the process variables belonging to the totality of process variables are processed by at least one processing unit during operation of the production cell.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore a problem of the prior art that the totality of process variables for a given plurality of actuators and/or sensors, which is very large, results in high demands for processing capacity (memory requirement, computing power and communication bandwidth) and the risk to overload an operator of the production cell with too much information which, although it is provided to the operator based on the totality of process variables, is not relevant for the operator to the full extent.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an object of the invention to provide an improved computer-implemented method for processing a plurality of process variables of a production cell comprising at least one shaping machine as a subunit of the production cell, using at least one processing unit, having reduced demands for processing capacity and the risk to overload an operator of the production cell with too much information.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is another object of the invention to provide a production cell in which an improved computer-implemented method for processing a plurality of process variables of a production cell comprising at least one shaping machine as a subunit of the production cell, using at least one processing unit is implemented, having reduced demands for processing capacity and a reduced risk to overload an operator of the production cell with too much information.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is yet another object of the invention to provide a computer program to implement an improved computer-implemented method for processing a plurality of process variables of a production cell comprising at least one shaping machine as a subunit of the production cell, using at least one processing unit.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is an advantage of the invention that, although the totality of process variables for a given plurality of actuators and/or sensors is very large, only selected process variables out of the totality of process variables are processed thereby lowering demands for processing capacity (with respect to memory requirement, computing power and communication bandwidth) and reducing the risk to overload an operator of the production cell with too much information which, although it could be provided based on the totality of process variables, is not relevant for the operator to the full extent.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention provides a computer-implemented method for processing a plurality of process variables of a production cell which comprises at least one shaping machine as a subunit of the production cell, the method using at least one processing unit and comprising at least the steps of:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0012">a. for at least one subunit of the production cell, the at least one subunit having a plurality of actuators and/or sensors, providing to or determining by at least one processing unit a totality of process variables which is available for processing (for the plurality of actuators and/or sensors of the at least one subunit)</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0013">b. using at least one processing unit to determine at least one subset of process variables out of the totality of process variables</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0014">c. processing, preferably during production of a production lot, those process variables which belong to the determined at least one subset of process variables</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0015">d. for those process variables which do not belong to any of the determined at least one subset of process variables, processing a selected number of process variables (preferably this number is zero or smaller than the number of the totality of process variables minus the number of process variables belonging to any of the determined at least one subset of process variables)</li></ul></p><p id="p-0013" num="0016">In accordance with the invention only the following process variables out of the totality of available process variables have to be processed:<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0017">Those process variables which belong to the at least one determined subset of process variables, these are process variables that are either judged automatically by the at least one processing unit to be of interest with respect to the criteria given below and/or have been indicated by an operator of the production cell to be of interest. Although in rare cases it might happen that, e.g., for a specific production lot, all of the process variables of the totality of process variables belong to the at least one determined subset of process variables, this will normally not be the case.</li>        <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0018">The selected number of process variables which, although they do not belong to the at least one determined subset of process variables, are nevertheless processed, e.g., for the reasons given below. Usually, it will be the case that this number is zero or smaller than the number of the totality of process variables minus the number of process variables belonging to any of the determined at least one subset of process variables.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0014" num="0019">In summary, the invention will usually have the effect that only some of the process variable of the totality of process variables, but not all of them, have to be processed by the at least one processing unit. In other words, there is a reduction of process variables to be processed compared to the totality of process variables that could be processed.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0020">Of course, it is possible that the at least one determined subset of process variables and/or the selected number of process variables which are processed although they do not belong to the at least one determined subset of process variables is different from production lot to production lot for one and the same process cell.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0021">In some embodiments the production cell comprises, in addition to the at least one shaping machine, at least one further subunit in the form of at least one of the following:<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0005"
