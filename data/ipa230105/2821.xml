With this approach, a nascent strand is synthesized, and the addition of each monomer (e.g., nucleotide) to the growing strand is detected optically and/or electronically. Because a template strand directs synthesis of the nascent strand, one can infer the sequence of the template DNA from the series of nucleotide monomers that were added to the growing strand during the synthesis. In some examples, paired-end sequencing may be used, where forward strands are sequenced and removed, and then reverse strands are constructed and sequenced.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">INTRODUCTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A first aspect disclosed herein is flow cell, comprising: a substrate; a first primer set attached to a first region on the substrate, the first primer set including an un-cleavable first primer and a cleavable second primer; and a second primer set attached to a second region on the substrate, the second primer set including a cleavable first primer and an un-cleavable second primer.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an example of the first aspect, the first region includes a material having a first functional group; and the second region includes a material having a second functional group that is different than the first functional group.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an example of the first aspect, the flow cell further comprises a gap separating the first primer set from the second primer set.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an example of the first aspect, the substrate includes depressions separated by interstitial regions; and each of the depressions includes: the first region located at a first portion; and the second region located at a second portion.

nucleic acid sequencing.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0139">Some of the flow cells include different primer sets attached to different regions of the flow cell substrate. In these examples, the primer sets may be controlled so that the cleaving (linearization) chemistry is orthogonal in the different regions. Orthogonal cleaving chemistry may be realized through identical cleavage sites that are attached to different primers in the different sets, or through different cleavage sites that are attached to different primers in the different sets. This enables a cluster of forward strands to be generated in one region of the substrate and a cluster of reverse strands to be generated in another region of the substrate. In an example, the regions are directly adjacent to one another. In another example, any space between the regions is small enough that clustering can span the two regions. With some of the flow cell configurations disclosed herein, the forward and reverse strands are spatially separate, which separates the fluorescence signals from both reads while allowing for simultaneous base calling of each read. As such, some examples of the flow cells disclosed herein enable simultaneous paired-end reads to be obtained.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0140">Other examples of the flow cells may be used to obtain simultaneous paired-end reads; or may be used to obtain sequential paired-end reads, where the forward strands are sequenced and removed, and then the reverse strands are sequenced and removed. In these other examples, a patterned resin on a flow cell support is coated with a block copolymer that undergoes directed self-assembly in depressions of the patterned resin. The patterned resin serves as a guide for the arrangement of the block copolymer. Under controlled conditions, the block copolymer self-assembles into specific domains. In some of the examples disclosed herein, the functionality of the domains is controlled to be orthogonal so that one or more domains can react with the patterned resin and one or more other domains can graft primer(s). In some examples, the functionality of a domain may be controlled to alter a characteristic of that domain. These example flow cells may be suitable for use with optical or non-optical detection methods.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Definitions</heading><p id="p-0150" num="0141">It is to be understood that terms used herein will take on their ordinary meaning in the relevant art unless specified otherwise.

The non-reacted azides of the polymer layer <b>32</b> will be reduced by the phosphine, which renders them non-functional for additional primer grafting.</p><p id="p-0417" num="0381">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref>, the method then includes depositing the second polymer layer <b>32</b>&#x2032;. The polymer layer <b>32</b>&#x2032; may be the same polymer that is used in the polymer layer <b>32</b>, or may be a different type of polymer than that used in the polymer layer <b>32</b>. In an example, each of the first polymer <b>32</b> and the second polymer <b>32</b>&#x2032; is an acrylamide copolymer, such as PAZAM. The polymer layer <b>32</b>&#x2032; may coat the interstitial regions <b>30</b> alone, or may coat at least some of the regions <b>14</b> in addition to the interstitial regions <b>30</b>. Whether the polymer layer <b>32</b>&#x2032; at least partially coats the regions <b>14</b> will depend upon the capping agent used on the polymer layer <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0418" num="0382">In this example, template polynucleotide strands, including an un-cleavable first template strand <b>40</b> and a cleavable second template strand <b>42</b>, may be formed in the region <b>14</b> using, respectively, the primers <b>18</b> or <b>18</b>&#x2032; and <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>&#x2032;. At the outset of template polynucleotide strand formation, library templates may be prepared from any nucleic acid sample (e.g., a DNA sample or an RNA sample). The nucleic acid sample may be fragmented into single-stranded, similarly sized (e.g., &#x3c;1000 bp) DNA or RNA fragments. During preparation, adapters may be added to the ends of these fragments. Through reduced cycle amplification, different motifs may be introduced in the adapters, such as sequencing binding sites, indices, and regions that are complementary to the primers <b>18</b> or <b>18</b>&#x2032; and <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>&#x2032; in the regions <b>14</b>. The final library templates include the DNA or RNA fragment and adapters at both ends. In some examples, the fragments from a single nucleic acid sample have the same adapters added thereto.</p><p id="p-0419" num="0383">A plurality of library templates may be introduced to the substrate <b>26</b>. This may involve introducing a template fluid to the flow cell. The template fluid may include a liquid carrier and the plurality of library templates. Because the substrate <b>26</b> includes an array of regions <b>14</b> in the depressions <b>28</b>, multiple library templates are hybridized, for example, to one of two types of primers <b>18</b>, <b>18</b>&#x2032; or <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>&#x2032; immobilized therein.</p><p id="p-0420" num="0384">Cluster generation may then be performed. During cluster generation, a template from the template fluid is amplified to form a cluster in at least some of the depressions <b>28</b>. In one example of cluster generation, the library templates are copied from the hybridized primers <b>18</b>, <b>18</b>&#x2032; or <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>&#x2032; by <b>3</b>&#x2032; extension using a high-fidelity DNA polymerase. The original library templates are denatured, leaving the copies immobilized in the regions <b>14</b>. Isothermal bridge amplification may be used to amplify the immobilized copies. For example, the copied templates loop over to hybridize to an adjacent, complementary primer <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>&#x2032; or <b>18</b>, <b>18</b>&#x2032;, and a polymerase copies the copied templates to form double stranded bridges, which are denatured to form two single stranded strands. These two strands loop over and hybridize to adjacent, complementary primers <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>&#x2032; or <b>18</b>, <b>18</b>&#x2032; and are extended again to form two new double stranded loops. The process is repeated on each template copy by cycles of isothermal denaturation and amplification to create dense clonal clusters. Each cluster of double stranded bridges is denatured, resulting in un-cleavable first template strands <b>40</b> attached to the un-cleavable first primers <b>18</b>, <b>18</b>&#x2032; and cleavable second template strands <b>42</b> attached to the cleavable second primers <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>&#x2032; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>D</figref>. It is to be understood that the cleavability of the primers drives the cleavability of the template strands attached thereto. Because the second template strands <b>42</b> attached to the cleavable second primers <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>&#x2032; include the cleavage site <b>22</b>, the cleavable second template strands <b>42</b> are cleavable. This example of clustering is bridge amplification, and is one example of the amplification that may be performed. It is to be understood that other amplification techniques may be used, such as the exclusion amplification (Examp) workflow (Illumina Inc.).</p><p id="p-0421" num="0385">It is to be understood that because the second polymer layer <b>32</b>&#x2032; does not have primers <b>18</b>, <b>18</b>&#x2032; or <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>&#x2032; grafted thereto, the amplification process does not extend beyond the individual depressions <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0422" num="0386">A priming fluid may then be introduced to the substrate <b>26</b>.

The process is repeated on each template copy by cycles of isothermal denaturation and amplification to create dense clonal clusters that grow out of the depressions <b>28</b> into the interstitial regions <b>30</b>.

The different shapes will aid in the functionalized support structure <b>93</b> becoming physically entrapped in the complementary shaped well capture site <b>95</b> and in the functionalized support structure <b>94</b> becoming physically entrapped in the complementary shaped well capture site <b>96</b>.</p><p id="p-0479" num="0443">In some examples, the functionalized support structures <b>93</b>, <b>94</b> may also have different capture chemistry. The capture chemistry is the chemistry that enables the structures <b>93</b>, <b>94</b> to attach to a desirable location on the substrate surface S. In some examples, the capture chemistry of the functionalized support structures <b>93</b>, <b>94</b> respectively corresponds with the capture chemistry of the capture sites <b>95</b>, <b>96</b> that is to receive the respective functionalized support structure <b>93</b>, <b>94</b>. For example, the functionalized support structure <b>93</b> and the capture site <b>95</b> may each include a member of one type of receptor-ligand binding pair, while the functionalized support structure <b>94</b> and the capture site <b>96</b> may each include a member of a different type of receptor-ligand binding pair. The different chemistries can help to endure that the functionalized support structures <b>93</b>, <b>94</b> (and the respective regions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>) are captures at desirable regions on the substrate surface S.</p><p id="p-0480" num="0444">The capture sites <b>95</b>, <b>96</b> are physically and/or chemically capable of immobilizing the respective functionalized support structure <b>93</b>, <b>94</b> on the substrate <b>26</b> (or resin <b>54</b>&#x2032; of a multi-layer substrate). The capture sites <b>95</b>, <b>96</b> may be positioned at any suitable location where it is desirable to have adjacent regions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. The position of the capture sites <b>95</b>, <b>96</b> across the substrate <b>26</b> may be uniform (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>36</b>A and <b>36</b>B</figref>) or may be non-uniform. The capture sites <b>95</b>, <b>96</b> may have any suitable shape, geometry and dimensions, which may depend, at least in part, on the configuration of the capture sites <b>95</b>, <b>96</b> (e.g., a patch, a well, a protrusion, etc.), and the type of functionalized support structure <b>93</b>, <b>94</b> that is to be captured by the capture sites <b>95</b>, <b>96</b>.</p><p id="p-0481" num="0445">In some examples, the capture sites <b>95</b>, <b>96</b> are different chemical capture agents that are applied on a portion of the substrate surface S. Any examples of the chemical capture agent disclosed herein may be used. In one example, the respective chemical capture agents may be deposited in the desirable locations using microcontact printing, or another suitable technique.</p><p id="p-0482" num="0446">In other examples, the capture sites <b>95</b>, <b>96</b> include respective wells that are defined in the surface S of the substrate <b>26</b> (or resin <b>54</b>&#x2032;). The wells may be formed using etching or imprinting depending upon the substrate (e.g., single or multi-layer) that is used. The wells may have any suitable shape and geometry, such as those set forth herein for the depressions <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0483" num="0447">In some examples, the wells do not have an additional chemical capture agent added thereto. In these examples, the opening dimensions enable the respective functionalized support structure <b>93</b>, <b>94</b> to self-assemble into the corresponding wells (e.g., based on shape). In other examples, the wells do have respective chemical capture agents added thereto.</p><p id="p-0484" num="0448">Other examples of the capture sites <b>95</b>, <b>96</b> include the well and a capture bead having a chemical capture agent on a surface thereof. The capture bead may be sized to fit into the wells. In some examples, the capture beads may be co-planar with or extend slightly above the adjacent interstitial regions <b>30</b>, <b>30</b>&#x2032; so that the functionalized support structure <b>93</b>, <b>94</b> that ultimately attaches thereto is not confined within the well. In an example, the capture bead is selected from the group consisting of silicon dioxide, a superparamagnetic material, polystyrene, and an acrylate. Any examples of the chemical capture agent disclosed herein may be used on the surface of the capture bead, and may be coated on the capture bead before it is introduced into the well. The configuration of the wells and beads of these capture sites <b>95</b>, <b>96</b> may be such that the functionalized support structure <b>93</b>, <b>94</b> (when attached) form regions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> that are adjacent to one another.</p><p id="p-0485" num="0449">The depth of the capture sites <b>95</b>, <b>96</b> well may vary depending upon whether the chemical capture agent is to be introduced thereto and whether the capture bead is to be introduced thereto. The depth may be selected at least to accommodate these materials (i.e., the material is contained within the wells). In an example, the depth of the well ranges from about 1 nm to about 5 microns.</p><p id="p-0486" num="0450">As another example, the capture sites <b>95</b>, <b>96</b> include protrusions that are defined in the substrate <b>26</b> (or in the resin <b>54</b>&#x2032;). The protrusions are three-dimensional structures that extend outward (upward) from an adjacent surface. The protrusions may be generated via etching, photolithography, imprinting, etc.</p><p id="p-0487" num="0451">While any suitable three-dimensional geometry may be used for the protrusion capture sites <b>95</b>, <b>96</b>, a geometry with an at least substantially flat top surface may be desirable.

While not shown, it is to be understood that the flow cells may have the lid bonded to at least a portion of the interstitial region <b>30</b>, <b>30</b>&#x2032;. In some examples, the lid may be bonded before or after grafting of the primer sets <b>12</b>A, <b>12</b>A&#x2032;, or <b>12</b>B, <b>12</b>B&#x2032;, or <b>12</b>C, <b>12</b>C&#x2032;, or <b>12</b>D, <b>12</b>D&#x2032;. When the lid is bonded prior to primer grafting, it is to be understood that a flow through process may be used for grafting. In the flow through process, the primer solution or mixture may be introduced into a flow channel(s) (defined between the lid and the interstitial region <b>30</b>, <b>30</b>&#x2032;) through respective input port(s) (not shown), may be maintained in the flow channel(s) for a time sufficient (i.e., an incubation period) for the primer(s) <b>18</b>, <b>18</b>&#x2032;, <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>&#x2032;, <b>19</b>, <b>19</b>&#x2032;, <b>21</b>, <b>21</b>&#x2032; to attach to the respective regions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, and then may be removed from respective output port(s) (not shown). After primer <b>18</b>, <b>18</b>&#x2032;, <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>&#x2032;, <b>19</b>, <b>19</b>&#x2032;, <b>21</b>, <b>21</b>&#x2032; attachment, the additional fluid(s) may be directed through the flow channel(s) to wash the now functionalized depressions and the flow channel(s).</p><p id="p-0494" num="0458">The lid may be positioned on the interstitial region <b>30</b> so that it defines a single flow channel or multiple, fluidically separated flow channels.</p><p id="p-0495" num="0459">The lid may be any material that is transparent to an excitation light that is directed toward the substrate <b>26</b>. As examples, the lid may be glass (e.g., borosilicate, fused silica, etc.), plastic, or the like. A commercially available example of a suitable borosilicate glass is D 263&#xae;, available from Schott North America, Inc. Commercially available examples of suitable plastic materials, namely cyclo olefin polymers, are the ZEONOR&#xae; products available from Zeon Chemicals L.P.</p><p id="p-0496" num="0460">In some examples, the lid may be integrally formed with sidewall(s) that correspond with the shape of the portion of the interstitial region <b>30</b> to which it will be bonded. For example, a recess may be etched into a transparent block to form a substantially planar (e.g., top) portion and sidewall(s) extending from the substantially planar portion. When the etched block is mounted to the interstitial region <b>30</b>, the recess may become the flow channel. In other examples, the sidewall(s) and the lid may be separate components that are coupled to each other. For example, the lid may be a substantially rectangular block having an at least substantially planar exterior surface and an at least substantially planar interior surface that defines a portion (e.g., a top portion) of the flow channel (once bonded to the portion of the interstitial region <b>30</b>). The block may be mounted onto (e.g., bonded to) the sidewall(s), which are bonded to the portion of the interstitial region <b>30</b> and form sidewall(s) of the flow channel. In this example, the sidewall(s) may include any of the materials set forth herein for the spacer layer (described below).</p><p id="p-0497" num="0461">The lid may be bonded using any suitable technique, such as laser bonding, diffusion bonding, anodic bonding, eutectic bonding, plasma activation bonding, glass frit bonding, or others methods known in the art. In an example, a spacer layer may be used to bond the lid to the portion of the interstitial region <b>30</b>. The spacer layer may be any material that will seal at least some of the interstitial regions <b>30</b> and the lid together.</p><p id="p-0498" num="0462">In one example, the spacer layer may be a radiation-absorbing material that absorbs radiation at a wavelength that is transmitted by the lid and/or the substrate <b>26</b> (or, for example, a patterned resin of the substrate <b>26</b>). The absorbed energy, in turn, forms the bond between the spacer layer and the lid and between the spacer layer and the substrate <b>26</b>. An example of this radiation-absorbing material is black KAPTON&#xae; (polyimide containing carbon black) from DuPont (USA), which absorbs at about 1064 nm. It is to be understood that polyimide could be used without the addition of carbon black, except that the wavelength would have to be altered to one that is significantly absorbed by the natural polyimide material (e.g., 480 nm). As another example, polyimide CEN JP can be bonded when irradiated with light at 532 nm. When the spacer layer is the radiation-absorbing material, the spacer layer may be positioned at an interface between the lid and the portion of the interstitial region <b>30</b> so that the spacer layer contacts the desired bonding region. Compression may be applied (e.g., approximately 100 PSI of pressure) while laser energy at a suitable wavelength is applied to the interface (i.e., the radiation-absorbing material is irradiated). The laser energy may be applied to the interface both from the top and from the bottom in order to achieve suitable bonding.</p><p id="p-0499" num="0463">In another example, the spacer layer may include a radiation-absorbing material in contact therewith. The radiation-absorbing material may be applied at the interface between the spacer layer and the lid as well as at the interface between the spacer layer and the portion of the interstitial region <b>30</b>. As an example, the spacer layer may be polyimide and the separate radiation-absorbing material may be carbon black. In this example, the separate radiation-absorbing material absorbs the laser energy that forms the bonds between the spacer layer and the lid and between the spacer layer and the portion of the interstitial region <b>30</b>. In this example, compression may be applied at the respective interfaces while laser energy at a suitable wavelength is applied to the interfaces (i.e., the radiation-absorbing material is irradiated).</p><p id="p-0500" num="0464">Simultaneous Paired-End Sequencing Method</p><p id="p-0501" num="0465">Any examples of the flow cell including the primer sets <b>12</b>A, <b>12</b>A&#x2032;, or <b>12</b>B, <b>12</b>B&#x2032;, or <b>12</b>C, <b>12</b>C&#x2032;, or <b>12</b>D, <b>12</b>D&#x2032; described herein may be used in simultaneous paired-end sequencing, where the forward and reverse strands (e.g., strands <b>40</b> and <b>44</b>) are read simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0502" num="0466">Once the clusters of un-cleavable first template strands <b>40</b> are generated in the regions <b>14</b> and the clusters of un-cleavable second template strands <b>44</b> are generated in the region <b>16</b> (described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>G</figref>), the free ends may be blocked to prevent undesirable priming. It is to be understood that the free ends of any primers that remain may also be blocked.</p><p id="p-0503" num="0467">In these methods, an incorporation mix may be added, which includes sequencing primers that are capable of respectively hybridizing to the un-cleavable first template strands <b>40</b> and the un-cleavable second template strands <b>44</b>. The extension of the sequencing primers along the respective template strands <b>40</b>, <b>44</b> is monitored to determine the sequence of nucleotides in the template strands <b>40</b>, <b>44</b>. The underlying chemical process can be polymerization (e.g., catalyzed by a polymerase enzyme) or ligation (e.g., catalyzed by a ligase enzyme). In a particular polymerase-based process, fluorescently labeled nucleotides are added to the respective sequencing primers in a template dependent fashion such that detection of the order and type of nucleotides added to the respective sequencing primers can be used to determine the sequence of the template. For example, to initiate a first sequencing by synthesis cycle, one or more labeled nucleotides, DNA polymerase, etc., may be delivered into/through the flow cell, where sequencing primer extension causes a labeled nucleotide to be incorporated into a nascent strand that is complementary to the respective template <b>40</b>, <b>44</b>. The incorporation events can be detected in tandem through an imaging event without substantial physical overlap of the fluorescent signals generated at the respective templates <b>40</b>, <b>44</b>. This allows for simultaneous base calling at the respective templates <b>40</b>, <b>44</b>. During an imaging event, an illumination system (not shown) may provide an excitation light to the flow cell, and images may be captured and analyzed. As examples, illumination may be accomplished with a laser, light emitting diode, planar waveguide, or the like.</p><p id="p-0504" num="0468">In some examples, the fluorescently labeled nucleotides can further include a reversible termination property that terminates further primer extension once a nucleotide has been added to the respective templates <b>40</b>, <b>44</b>. For example, a nucleotide analog having a reversible terminator moiety can be added to the templates <b>40</b>, <b>44</b> such that subsequent extension cannot occur until a deblocking agent is delivered to remove the moiety. Thus, for examples that use reversible termination, a deblocking reagent can be delivered to the flow cell, etc. (after detection occurs).</p><p id="p-0505" num="0469">Wash(es) may take place between the various fluid delivery steps. The sequencing cycle can then be repeated n times to extend the template by n nucleotides, thereby detecting a sequence of length n.</p><p id="p-0506" num="0470">Paired-end sequencing allows users to sequence both ends of a fragment and generate high-quality, alignable sequence data. Paired-end sequencing facilitates detection of genomic rearrangements and repetitive sequence elements, as well as gene fusions and novel transcripts. While one example paired-end sequencing method has been described in detail, it is to be understood that the flow cells described herein may be utilized with other sequencing protocol, for genotyping, or in other chemical and/or biological applications.

For example, any POSS material described herein may be a mixture of discrete POSS cages and non-discrete silsesquioxane structures and/or incompletely condensed, discrete structures, such as polymers, ladders, and the like. The partially condensed materials would therefore include epoxy R groups as described herein at some silicon vertices, but some silicon atoms would not be substituted with the R groups and could be substituted instead with OH groups. In some examples, the POSS materials comprise a mixture of various forms, such as:</p><p id="p-0526" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00024" num="00024"><img id="EMI-C00024" he="194.06mm" wi="76.28mm" file="US20230002822A1-20230105-C00024.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0527" num="0482">In some of the examples disclosed herein, at least one of R<sub>1 </sub>through R<sub>8 </sub>or R<sub>10 </sub>or R<sub>12 </sub>comprises an epoxy, and thus the POSS is referred to as an epoxy POSS. In some examples, a majority of the arms, such as the eight, ten, or twelve arms, or R groups, comprise epoxy groups. In other examples, R<sub>1 </sub>through R<sub>8 </sub>or R<sub>10 </sub>or R<sub>12 </sub>are the same, and thus each of R<sub>1 </sub>through R<sub>8 </sub>or R<sub>10 </sub>or R<sub>12 </sub>comprises an epoxy group. In still other examples, R<sub>1 </sub>through R<sub>8 </sub>or R<sub>10 </sub>or R<sub>12 </sub>are not the same, and thus at least one of R<sub>1 </sub>through R<sub>8 </sub>or R<sub>10 </sub>or R<sub>12 </sub>comprises epoxy and at least one other of R<sub>1 </sub>through R<sub>8 </sub>or R<sub>10 </sub>or R<sub>12 </sub>is a non-epoxy functional group. The non-epoxy functional group may be (a) a reactive group that is orthogonally reactive to an epoxy group (i.e., reacts under different conditions than an epoxy group), that serves as a handle for coupling the resin to an amplification primer, a polymer, or a polymerization agent; or (b) a group that adjusts the mechanical or functional properties of the resin, e.g., surface energy adjustments. In some examples, the non-epoxy functional group is selected from the group consisting of an azide/azido, a thiol, a poly(ethylene glycol), a norbornene, a tetrazine, an amino, a hydroxyl, an alkynyl, a ketone, an aldehyde, an ester group, an alkyl, an aryl, an alkoxy, and a haloalkyl. In some aspects, the non-epoxy functional group is selected to increase the surface energy of the resin. In these other examples, the ratio of epoxy groups to non-epoxy groups ranges from 7:1 to 1:7, or 9:1 to 1:9, or 11:1 to 1:11. In any of the examples, disubstituted or monosubstituted (terminal) epoxy group(s) allow the monomeric unit to polymerize into a cross-linked matrix upon initiation using ultraviolet (UV) light and an acid. In some aspects, the epoxy POSS comprises terminal epoxy groups. An example of this type of POSS is glycidyl POSS having the structure:</p><p id="p-0528" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00025" num="00025"><img id="EMI-C00025" he="67.31mm" wi="74.59mm" file="US20230002822A1-20230105-C00025.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0529" num="0483">An epoxy POSS may also be a modified epoxy POSS, that includes a controlled radical polymerization (CRP) agent and/or another functional group of interest incorporated into the resin or core or cage structure as one or more of the functional group R<sub>1 </sub>through R<sub>8 </sub>or R<sub>10 </sub>or R<sub>12</sub>.</p><p id="p-0530" num="0484">In other of the examples of the POSS-based resin disclosed herein, each of R<sub>1 </sub>through R<sub>8 </sub>or R<sub>10 </sub>or R<sub>12 </sub>comprises any non-epoxy group, such as an acrylate, methacrylate, ethylene glycol, or a short polyethylene glycol chain (up to 50 repeat units). Any non-epoxy POSS monomer that can be polymerized radically may be used.

In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>, nanoimprint lithography is used to pattern the resin <b>54</b>. After the resin <b>54</b> is deposited, it may be soft baked to remove excess solvent. A nanoimprint lithography mold or working stamp <b>56</b> is pressed against the layer of resin <b>54</b> to create an imprint on the resin <b>54</b>. In other words, the resin <b>54</b> is indented or perforated by the protrusions of the working stamp <b>56</b>. The resin <b>54</b> may be then be cured with the working stamp <b>56</b> in place. Curing may be accomplished by exposure to actinic radiation, such as visible light radiation or ultraviolet (UV) radiation, or to radiation of a wavelength ranging from about 240 nm and 380 nm when a photoresist is used; or by exposure to heat when a thermal-curable resist is used. Curing may promote polymerization and/or cross-linking. As an example, curing may include multiple stages, including a softbake (e.g., to drive off solvent(s)) and a hardbake. The softbake may take place at a lower temperature, ranging from about 50&#xb0; C. to about 150&#xb0; C. The duration of the hardbake may last from about 5 seconds to about 10 minutes at a temperature ranging from about 100&#xb0; C. to about 300&#xb0; C. Examples of devices that can be used for softbaking and/or hardbaking include a hot plate, oven, etc.</p><p id="p-0539" num="0489">After curing, the working stamp <b>56</b> is released.

Small features may be desirable because a higher cluster density may be obtained. Higher cluster density means that more bases can be read from a given unit area, which increases the genetic yield from the patterned flow cell.

After the resin <b>54</b> is deposited, it may be soft baked to remove excess solvent. A nanoimprint lithography mold or working stamp <b>56</b> is pressed against the layer of resin <b>54</b> to create an imprint on the resin <b>54</b>. In other words, the resin <b>54</b> is indented or perforated by the protrusions of the working stamp <b>56</b>. The resin <b>54</b> may be then be cured with the working stamp <b>56</b> in place. Curing may be accomplished by exposure to actinic radiation, such as visible light radiation or ultraviolet (UV) radiation, or to radiation of a wavelength ranging from about 240 nm and 380 nm when a photoresist is used; or by exposure to heat when a thermal-curable resist is used. Curing may promote polymerization and/or cross-linking. As an example, curing may include multiple stages, including a softbake (e.g., to drive off solvent(s)) and a hardbake. The softbake may take place at a lower temperature, ranging from about 50&#xb0; C. to about 150&#xb0; C. The duration of the hardbake may last from about 5 seconds to about 10 minutes at a temperature ranging from about 100&#xb0; C. to about 300&#xb0; C.

For another example, the first block <b>58</b>A may include a monomer having a block-specific functional group that able to graft a primer (e.g., <b>18</b>, <b>21</b>) and attach to the resin <b>54</b>&#x2032;, and that the second block <b>58</b>B may include a monomer that is able to adjust an interaction parameter to drive phase separation of the first and second blocks.</p><p id="p-0611" num="0561">In any examples of the block copolymer <b>58</b> disclosed herein, the primer-grafting functional group is selected from the group consisting of azide/azido, optionally substituted amino, optionally substituted alkenyl, aldehyde, optionally substituted hydrazone, optionally substituted hydrazine, carboxyl, hydroxy, optionally substituted tetrazole, optionally substituted tetrazine, nitrile oxide, nitrone, thiol, and combinations thereof. When multiple primer-grafting functional groups are included in a single block, different primers may be attached to the single block. When different primer-grafting functional groups are included in different blocks, different primers may be attached to the different blocks.</p><p id="p-0612" num="0562">The primer-grafting functional group may be capable of reacting with a functional group attached to the 5&#x2032; end of the primer. For example, a bicyclo[6.1.0] non-4-yne (BCN) terminated primer may be captured by an azide primer-grafting functional group of the block copolymer <b>58</b> via strain-promoted catalyst free click chemistry. For another example, an alkyne terminated primer may be captured by an azide primer-grafting functional group of the block copolymer <b>58</b> via copper catalyzed click chemistry.

The block <b>58</b>B&#x2032; may include primer-attaching functional groups that can attach the first primer set <b>12</b>A, <b>12</b>B, <b>12</b>C, <b>12</b>D, including primers <b>18</b>, <b>18</b>&#x2032; and <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>&#x2032;; and the block <b>58</b>A&#x2032; may include different primer-attaching functional groups that can attach the second primer set <b>12</b>A&#x2032;, <b>12</b>B&#x2032;, <b>12</b>C&#x2032;, <b>12</b>D&#x2032;, including primers <b>19</b>, <b>19</b>&#x2032; and <b>21</b>, <b>21</b>&#x2032;. In this example, block <b>58</b>B&#x2032; serves as region <b>14</b> and block <b>58</b>A&#x2032; serves as region <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0648" num="0585">The flow cells including the block copolymer <b>58</b>, <b>58</b>&#x2032; may be used in a variety of sequencing approaches or technologies, including techniques often referred to as sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS), cyclic-array sequencing, sequencing-by-ligation, pyrosequencing, and so forth. In some of these examples, since the phase separated blocks <b>58</b>A, <b>58</b>B, <b>58</b>C and attached primer(s) (un-cleavable primers <b>18</b>, <b>21</b> or <b>18</b>&#x2032;, <b>21</b>&#x2032; for sequential paired-end sequencing) or (un-cleavable/cleavable primer pairs <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> or <b>18</b>&#x2032;, <b>20</b>&#x2032; and <b>19</b>, <b>21</b> or <b>19</b>&#x2032;, <b>21</b>&#x2032; for simultaneous paired-end sequencing) are present in the depressions <b>28</b> and not on the interstitial regions <b>30</b>, amplification will be confined to the depressions <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0649" num="0586">As one example, a sequencing by synthesis (SBS) reaction may be run on a system such as the HISEQ&#x2122;, HISEQX&#x2122;, MISEQ&#x2122;, MISEQDX&#x2122;, MINISEQ&#x2122;, NOVASEQ&#x2122;, NEXTSEQDX&#x2122;, NEXTSEQ&#x2122;, or any other sequencer systems from Illumina (San Diego, Calif.). In SBS, extension of a sequencing primer along a nucleic acid template (e.g., the sequencing template) is monitored to determine the sequence of nucleotides in the template. The underlying chemical process can be polymerization (e.g., catalyzed by a polymerase enzyme) or ligation (e.g., catalyzed by a ligase enzyme). In a particular polymerase-based SBS process, fluorescently labeled nucleotides are added to the sequencing primer (thereby extending the primer) in a template dependent fashion such that detection of the order and type of nucleotides added to the sequencing primer can be used to determine the sequence of the template.</p><p id="p-0650" num="0587">For example, to initiate a first SBS cycle, one or more labeled nucleotides, DNA polymerase, etc., may be delivered into/through the flow channel, etc. that houses an array of forward or reverse strands attached to un-cleavable primers <b>18</b>, <b>21</b> or <b>18</b>&#x2032;, <b>21</b>&#x2032; (for sequential paired-end sequencing), or both forward and reverse strands attached to the un-cleavable/cleavable primer pairs <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> or <b>18</b>&#x2032;, <b>20</b>&#x2032; (for simultaneous paired-end sequencing), where sequencing primer extension causes a labeled nucleotide to be incorporated, can be detected through an imaging event. During an imaging event, an illumination system (not shown) may provide an excitation light to the functionalized depressions.</p><p id="p-0651" num="0588">In these example, the nucleotides can further include a reversible termination property that terminates further primer extension once a nucleotide has been added, and a deblocking agent can be used to continue sequencing. Wash(es) may take place between the various fluid delivery steps. The SBS cycle can then be repeated n times to extend the sequencing primer by n nucleotides, thereby detecting a sequence of length n.</p><p id="p-0652" num="0589">While SBS has been described in detail, it is to be understood that the flow cells described herein may be utilized with other sequencing protocol, for genotyping, or in other chemical and/or biological applications.</p><p id="p-0653" num="0590">To further illustrate the present disclosure, examples are given herein.
