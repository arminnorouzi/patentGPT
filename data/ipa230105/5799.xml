The frame <b>12</b> is not formed in a step shape, and the upper surface <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the frame <b>12</b> is provided with the output lead <b>20</b>. The bonding wire <b>25</b> electrically connects the electrode <b>33</b> of the semiconductor chip <b>30</b> and the output lead <b>20</b>. To secure the joint between the base substrate <b>11</b> and the frame <b>12</b> by the joining member <b>17</b>, the width D<b>1</b> is required to be a predetermined value or more according to the design rule. In contrast, the width D<b>2</b> of joint of the lateral section <b>18</b><i>a </i>to the frame <b>12</b> and output lead <b>20</b> is not required to be as large as D<b>1</b>. This is because a resin-based insulating adhesive agent can be used for the joining member <b>19</b>, whereas a conductive wax material is used for the joining member <b>17</b>. In addition, the base substrate <b>11</b> is, for instance, a metal layer, and the frame <b>12</b> is an insulator, thus the difference in coefficients of thermal expansion is likely to increase, and thermal stress tends to be applied to between the base substrate <b>11</b> and the frame <b>12</b>. According to a design rule, D<b>1</b> is 1.55 mm. H<b>1</b>, H<b>4</b>, D<b>2</b> and D<b>3</b> are, for instance, 0.5 mm, 0.8 mm, 0.6 mm and 0.3 mm.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0038">In Comparative Example 1, the semiconductor chip <b>30</b> and the output lead <b>20</b> are connected using the bonding wire <b>25</b>. Because the output impedance of the semiconductor chip <b>30</b> is very low, in Comparative Example 1, the output impedance of the output lead <b>20</b> becomes low. Therefore, it is difficult to improve the characteristics of the amplifier circuit. It is preferable that an internal matching circuit be provided between the semiconductor chip <b>30</b> and the output lead <b>20</b>. However, in order to provide an internal matching circuit in the base package, the capacitive component <b>40</b> has to be mounted on the base substrate <b>11</b>, which increases the size of the semiconductor device.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Comparative Example 2</heading><p id="p-0041" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional view of a semiconductor device according to Comparative Example 2.

The conductor pattern <b>14</b><i>b </i>is electrically connected to the base substrate <b>11</b> via the through electrode <b>16</b>. In Comparative Example 1, mounting the capacitive component <b>40</b> on the frame <b>12</b> allows the capacitive component <b>40</b> to be mounted within the package without increasing the width of the base substrate <b>11</b> in the X-direction. Providing the bonding wires <b>24</b> and <b>25</b> allows the output matching circuit <b>52</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> to be mounted within the package. Consequently, the semiconductor device can be downsized. The reason why the capacitive component <b>40</b> can be mounted on the frame <b>12</b> is that the width D<b>2</b> of joint between the lateral section <b>18</b><i>a </i>of the cover <b>18</b> and the frame <b>12</b> may be smaller than the width D<b>1</b> of joint between the frame <b>12</b> and the base substrate <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040">In the case where 3.3 GHz to 3.8 GHz amplifier circuit is used, examples of the inductance of the inductor L<b>1</b> and the capacitance of the capacitor C<b>1</b> of the output matching circuit <b>52</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> are 0.387 nH and 8 pF, respectively. When impedance matching is made mainly by the inductor L<b>1</b> and the capacitor C<b>1</b>, the inductance of the inductor L<b>2</b> is reduced to 0.15 nH. The inductance of 0.387 nH of the inductor L<b>1</b> can be achieved by setting the length of each bonding wire <b>25</b> to 1.76 mm, the number of bonding wires <b>25</b> to <b>16</b>, and the space between the bonding wires <b>25</b> to 0.25 mm. Note that the inductance is affected not only by the length of the bonding wire <b>25</b>, but also by the shape of the bonding wire <b>25</b>. The capacitance of 8 pF of the capacitor C<b>1</b> can be achieved by setting the dielectric constant of the dielectric substrate <b>41</b> to <b>250</b>, the thickness thereof to 0.25 mm, the outer shape of the dielectric substrate <b>41</b> to 3.5 mm&#xd7;0.4 mm, and the shape of the electrode <b>42</b> to 3.4 mm&#xd7;0.3 mm. To reduce the inductance of the inductor L<b>2</b>, the length of the bonding wire <b>24</b> is shortened, and the number of bonding wires is increased.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">When the distance D<b>3</b> between the semiconductor chip <b>30</b> and the frame <b>12</b> is set to the smallest value according to a design rule to downsize the semiconductor device, and the length of each bonding wire <b>25</b> is set to 1.76 mm to obtain a desired inductance as the inductor L<b>1</b>, the distance D<b>5</b> between the bonding wire <b>25</b> and the lower surface of the upper section <b>18</b><i>b </i>of the cover <b>18</b> is reduced to 0.2 mm, for instance. After the bonding wire <b>25</b> is formed, the cover <b>18</b> is joined onto the frame <b>12</b>. At this point of time, when the bonding wire <b>25</b> interferes (for instance, contacts) with the lower surface of the upper section <b>18</b><i>b</i>, the shape of the bonding wire <b>25</b> is changed.
