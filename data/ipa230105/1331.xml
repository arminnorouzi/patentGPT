The water filter (<b>1</b>) includes a filter housing (<b>2</b>), a hollow cartridge core (<b>3</b>), and a mesh filter (<b>4</b>). The water filter (<b>1</b>) can be in a working mode, in which the water flows through the water filter from its inlet port to its outlet port to the destination, and in a self-rising mode, in which the water flows through the water filter from the inlet port and then outside through a drain tap. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> depict the water filter (<b>1</b>) in a working mode and in a self-rising mode respectively.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The filter housing (<b>2</b>) includes a hollow housing (<b>21</b>), a top cover (<b>22</b>), and a drain tap (<b>23</b>). The hollow housing (<b>21</b>) has a top opening (<b>211</b>) and a drain opening (<b>212</b>) preferably at its bottom part (<b>213</b>). The top cover (<b>22</b>) has an inlet port (<b>221</b>) and an outlet port (<b>222</b>) and is designed to close the top opening of the hollow housing from above possibly by threading. The top cover (<b>22</b>) also has a one-way pressure valve (<b>223</b>) that is designed to enable air to enter into the water filter in the self-rising mode and disable that in the working mode. The drain tap (<b>23</b>) includes a rod (<b>231</b>), an opening and closing knob (<b>232</b>) that is connected to a first end (<b>2311</b>) of the rod, and an opening and closing barrier (<b>233</b>) that is connected to a second end (<b>2312</b>) of the rod.
