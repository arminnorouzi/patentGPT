For ease of explanation, an image forming apparatus newly added to the image forming system <b>1000</b> will be referred to as a new image forming apparatus <b>100</b>, and image forming apparatuses already added to the image forming system <b>1000</b> will be referred to as pre-registered image forming apparatuses <b>10</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>10</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>10</b>-<b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Each of the pre-registered image forming apparatuses <b>10</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>10</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>10</b>-<b>3</b> may transmit installation environment information and default option information set by each apparatus to the server device <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The installation environment information may include information for understanding the installation environment of the image forming apparatus such as industry information and/or place information. Such information may include a phone number, an internet protocol (IP) address, company information, department information, etc. to be used for indicating an industry or a place in which the image forming apparatus is used or located. The industry information may indicate a type of workplace (e.g., government office) using an image forming apparatus. The place information may be a location or a place in which an image forming apparatus is disposed, and in some cases, it could also mean the industry. For example, a place such as a library may indicate the industry as well.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The default option information may include an initial state that can be applied without a user's further setting among various options supported by the image forming apparatus. For example, when A4 paper is set as a default option for printing paper, it is set that a printing job is performed with A4 paper without the need for a user to change or select an option for the printing paper during a printing process.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The server device <b>200</b> may receive the installation environment information and default option information from each of the pre-registered image forming apparatuses <b>10</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>10</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>10</b>-<b>3</b>, and store the received information in a database.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The server device <b>200</b>, when receiving the installation environment information for the new image forming apparatus <b>100</b>, may generate a setting profile including information on an option value corresponding to the installation environment information, and transmit the generated setting profile to the new image forming apparatus <b>100</b>. An example configuration and operation of the server device <b>200</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The new image forming apparatus <b>100</b> may receive its own installation environment information, and provide the received installation environment information to the server device <b>200</b>. As an example, the new image forming apparatus <b>100</b> may receive information on an industry or a place from a user through a user interface window, and provide the received installation environment information on the industry or the place to the server device <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The new image forming apparatus <b>100</b>, if receiving a setting profile corresponding to the provided installation environment information, may set at least one printing option included in the received setting profile as a default operation value. An example configuration and operation of an image forming apparatus will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As described above, the image forming system <b>1000</b> according to an example may collectively change option settings based on the installation environment of the image forming apparatus <b>100</b>, and thus a user may easily set an initial option.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, it is described that the installation environment information is provided to the server device <b>200</b>, and an option value or a setting profile is provided from the server device <b>200</b>. However, in implementation, the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> may set a default option by selecting a pre-stored look-up table as an option value corresponding to an installation environment when a product is released.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a configuration of an image forming apparatus according to an example.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an image forming apparatus <b>100</b> may include a display <b>110</b>, a print engine <b>120</b>, and a processor <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The display <b>110</b> may display a user interface window for selecting various functions supported by the image forming apparatus <b>100</b>. The display <b>110</b> may be a monitor using elements such as a liquid crystal display (LCD), a cathode ray tube (CRT), a light emitting diode (LED), an organic LED (OLED), etc., and may be embodied as a touch screen which can perform the function of an operation input device as well.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The display <b>110</b> may display a user interface window for selecting an installation environment in which the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> is used. Such a user interface window may be displayed during an initial setup process of the image forming apparatus. The installation environment information may include the industry and/or place of the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> such as a pharmacy, a hospital, a library, etc., or information that can help determine the industry or place indirectly, for example, a company name, a department, a phone number, a fax number, an IP address, a main task, etc.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The display <b>110</b> may display a message for confirming the purpose of use of an image forming apparatus or interaction information provided from the server device <b>200</b>. Various examples of user interface windows that may be displayed on the display <b>110</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The print engine <b>120</b> may form an image. The print engine <b>120</b> may print a print image generated by the processor <b>130</b> on a printing medium such as printing paper. The print engine <b>120</b> may perform printing using an electrophotography method, an inkjet method, or the like. The print engine <b>120</b> may be a mono-print engine which can perform printing with a single color, or a print engine that can perform multi-color printing.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The processor <b>130</b> may control the image forming apparatus <b>100</b>. As an example, the processor <b>130</b> may confirm whether the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> performs initial booting, and if the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> performs initial booting, may perform a series of operations for performing an initial setting of options of the image forming apparatus <b>100</b>. The series of operations may be performed not only at initial booting, but also upon a request from a user.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">When it is confirmed that the option setting is necessary, the processor <b>130</b> may control the display <b>110</b> to display a user interface window for selecting the installation environment of the image forming apparatus <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">When receiving the installation environment from the user, the processor <b>130</b> may determine an option value corresponding to the selected installation environment. The determining of the option value may use information stored in a memory, or information stored in a server device (e.g., the server device <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Example operations will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The processor <b>130</b> may set the determined option value as a default option value. For example, when a user sets an installation place as a library, and the option values corresponding to the library are 2-up and A4 printing paper, the processor <b>130</b> may set 2-up as a default option with respect to the option for n-up, and A4 printing paper as a default option with respect to the option for printing paper.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As described above, the processor <b>130</b> may set a determined option value as a default option value through an option setting process method, and may not go through a firmware update process. Therefore, although the above-described setting process is performed, an additional rebooting operation may be unnecessary.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">An example configuration of an image forming apparatus has been described and explained. However, in other examples, various constituent elements may be added. An example of an image forming apparatus including other constituent elements will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a configuration of an image forming apparatus according to an example.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, an image forming apparatus <b>100</b> may include a display <b>110</b>, a print engine <b>120</b>, a processor <b>130</b>, a communication device <b>140</b>, a memory <b>150</b>, an operation input device <b>160</b>, and a scan device <b>170</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The display <b>110</b> and the print engine <b>120</b> have been described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and thus a repeated description will be omitted.
