Furthermore, the disclosure relates to the use of such articles for washing, cleaning and/or care purposes, preferably for washing, caring for or conditioning textiles, and a method for washing, caring for or conditioning textiles using such an article.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Although consumers of textile washing agents and textile care agents pay special attention to the respective product having a sufficient cleaning and/or care effect on the textiles to be washed, the demand for mono-dose washing agents, i.e. washing agents which are available in a unit dosage and are correspondingly easy to dose, is increasing at the same time. Commercial administration forms of such mono-dose washing agents are so-called &#x201c;laundry caps (capsules)&#x201d; and &#x201c;laundry sheets.&#x201d; However, these two administration forms each have different disadvantages or do not meet the requirements placed on them in different ways. Although the cleaning performance of washing agent caps is generally satisfactory, they often only partially dissolve in the washing liquor, which leads to residues of the shell material both in the washing machine and on clothing washed with the caps. Because water-soluble washing agent sheets are water-free, they are sustainable, logistically uncomplicated and, more importantly, easy to use for consumers.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition to the handling behavior of a particular washing or cleaning agent product, however, visual and olfactory aesthetics are still important criteria according to which consumers select the products and, if they like them, buy the products again. In order to be able to generate an appealing scent profile, it is first important that the respective perfume compositions are formulated in a stable manner, i.e. in particular that they remain stable even after the product has been stored fora long period of time and thus remain both perceptible and appealing in terms of odor. In addition to fragrancing the objects to be cleaned, such as dirty laundry or other textiles, but also hard surfaces, the odor profile of the product itself is also critically evaluated by the consumer, both before and during use. In particular in the case of manual cleaning, such as the manual cleaning of textile surfaces or hard surfaces, such as crockery and cutlery, a blooming fragrance profile which develops in the course of the cleaning process is perceived as pleasant.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Consequently, there is a continuing need for laundry and cleaning products which meet the aforementioned consumer requirements.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This problem is solved by the use of certain fragrance precursor substances, so-called &#x201c;precursors,&#x201d; in sheet-shaped textile washing and care agents (&#x201c;laundry sheets&#x201d;), because, as has surprisingly been found, the substrate materials are able to protect and stabilize the precursor-containing perfume compositions over a longer period of time, i.e. during product storage, for example. In addition, this combination according to the invention leads to an appealing &#x201c;blooming effect&#x201d;, i.e. a &#x201c;blooming&#x201d; (intensification) of the fragrance profile in the course of product use.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A first subject matter of the present invention is therefore a washing and/or care article for textiles, comprising a substrate and at least one perfume composition, characterized in that the substrate comprises polyvinyl alcohol and starch and the perfume composition comprises at least one free fragrance and at least one fragrance precursor compound.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a further aspect, the invention relates to the use of such a washing and/or care article for washing, cleaning and/or care purposes, preferably for washing, caring for or conditioning textiles.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a final aspect, the present invention also relates to a method for washing, caring for or conditioning textiles, characterized in that a washing and/or care article as described herein is used in at least one method step.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">These and other aspects, features, and advantages of the invention will become apparent to a person skilled in the art through the study of the following detailed description and claims. Any feature from one aspect of the invention can be used in any other aspect of the invention.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The term &#x201c;textile treatment agent&#x201d; as used herein refers to an agent which is used to treat textiles and causes a change in at least one property of the textile, selected from chemical, physical or aesthetic properties, after the treatment has ended. In the context of the present invention, the constituents of a textile treatment agent can in principle be selected and adjusted in such a way that the agent has the desired treatment properties, for example textile cleaning, care, conditioning and/or color protection properties.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the context of the present invention, the term &#x201c;conditioning&#x201d; means imparting a desired property, for example, in relation to textiles, a pleasant feel, crease resistance or low static charge. Accordingly, a &#x201c;textile conditioning composition&#x201d; as used herein is a composition which, when used in textile washing and/or care processes, is to impart a pleasant feel, wrinkle resistance or reduced static charge to the treated fabric.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The subject matter of the invention includes all conceivable textile washing and/or care methods, on a commercial scale, in the washing machine or in the case of hand washing. These include, for example, washing and cleaning methods and uses for the cleaning, care and/or conditioning, and pre- and/or post-treatment of all types of textiles, such as clothing, carpets and textile furniture surfaces.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">&#x201c;At least one&#x201d; as used herein includes, but is not limited to, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and more.

Dyes, color pigments or pearlescent components can also be added to improve the appearance.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0165">The active ingredient can be released from the microcapsules mechanically by crushing the microcapsules during the cleaning method. Other possibilities are releasing the active ingredient by changing the temperature (introduction into warm rinsing liquor), shifting the pH, and changing the electrolyte content, etc.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0166">In general, the pH of an agent can be adjusted using standard pH regulators. In various embodiments, the pH of the agents described herein is in a range from 6.5 to 12, preferably from 7.0 to 11.5, preferably greater than 7, in particular from 7.5 to 10.5. Acids and/or alkalis, preferably alkalis, are used as pH adjusters. Suitable acids are, in particular, organic acids, such as acetic acid, citric acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, adipic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid and gluconic acid, or sulfamic acid. In addition, however, the mineral acids hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and nitric acid or mixtures thereof can also be used. Suitable bases originate from the group of alkali and alkaline-earth metal hydroxides and carbonates, in particular alkali metal hydroxides, of which potassium hydroxide is preferred. The alkali source described above is particularly preferably used to adjust the pH. Even if volatile alkali, for example in the form of ammonia and/or alkanolamines, which can contain up to 9 carbon atoms in the molecule, can be used to adjust the pH, it being possible for the alkanolamine to be selected from the group consisting of mono-, di-, triethanol- and -propanolamine and mixtures thereof, volatile alkali sources of this kind, in particular ethanolamines, are preferably avoided. In various embodiments, agents described herein therefore contain less than 1.75 wt. % of alkanolamine, in particular monoethanolamine, and are very particularly preferably free thereof.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0167">In order to adjust and/or stabilize the pH, an agent can also contain one or more buffer substances (INCI buffering agents), usually in amounts from 0.001 to 5 wt. %. Buffer substances, which are also complexing agents or even chelating agents (chelators, INCI chelating agents), are preferred. Particularly preferred buffer substances are citric acid or citrates, in particular sodium and potassium citrates, for example trisodium citrate.2H<sub>2</sub>O and tripotassium citrate.H<sub>2</sub>O.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0168">The term &#x201c;leavening agent,&#x201d; as used herein, also refers to compounds known in the art as &#x201c;raising agents&#x201d;. In principle, all types of such known biological and chemical raising agent compounds are suitable. However, chemical leavening agents are preferred in the context of the present invention. Examples of such compounds include, but are not limited to, carbonates and bicarbonates, in particular carbonates and bicarbonates of alkali metals or alkaline-earth metals, and ammonium (bi)carbonate. Specific examples further include, but are not limited to, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, ammonium carbonate and potash, and mixtures thereof. It is also possible to use one or more of the aforementioned compounds from the group of carbonates or bicarbonates in combination with an acidifying agent. Suitable acidifying agents include organic and inorganic acidifying agents. Exemplary organic acidifying agents include, but are not limited to, carboxylic acids and polycarboxylic acids such as amino acids, hydroxycarboxylic acids, and hydroxydicarboxylic acids.
