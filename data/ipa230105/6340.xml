Since a material constituting the antenna needs to have excellent electrical conductivity, a laminated body in which a plastic material as a dielectric is coated with a conductor by printing, vapor deposition, or the like is used. In the related art, a conducting film such as cooper or silver has been used as the conductor. On the other hand, as the transmission and reception via networks both inside and outside a room have become widespread, antennas are installed in various places. Under these circumstances, antennas with even higher transparency have been developed so as not to spoil a landscape of an installation location.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0004">For example, PTL 1 provides a technique of providing an antenna pattern formed of a conductor mesh layer on a transparent substrate made of a polyethylene terephthalate film. PTL 2 describes a transparent conductive film in which a conducting film containing silver as a main component is laminated on a polyethylene terephthalate film.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0005">Since a loss during high frequency propagation is reduced as radio waves have higher frequency, dielectric characteristics of the dielectric are important. In particular, since a heat loss in the dielectric is proportional to a loss coefficient expressed by a product of a relative dielectric constant and a dielectric loss tangent, low dielectric characteristics are required. Since the dielectric characteristics of the plastic material as a dielectric are determined by a molecular structure of a constituent unit, a material having low dielectric characteristics and excellent adhesion to the conducting film is required for the dielectric.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0006">PTL 1: JP-A-2011-66610</p><p id="p-0012" num="0007">PTL 2: WO 2018/139402</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0008">A main object of the invention is to provide a conductive film including a conducting film and a substrate made of a polycarbonate resin material containing a polycarbonate resin, which has low dielectric characteristics and bendability, can form an antenna with low transmissionloss, and has excellent adhesion to the conducting film.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0009">A secondary object of the invention is to provide a transparent conductive film including a conducting film and a transparent substrate made of a polycarbonate resin material containing a polycarbonate resin, which has high transparency in addition to the above.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0010">As a result of intensive studies, the present inventors have found that the above objects can be achieved by using a substrate made of a polycarbonate resin material containing a polycarbonate resin having a specific structural unit.

Examples of a reaction method include an interfacial polycondensation method, a melt transesterification method, a solid phase transesterification method of a carbonate prepolymer, and a ring-opening polymerization method of a cyclic carbonate compound. In the case of interfacial polycondensation, a terminal terminator of monohydric phenols is usually used. The polycarbonate may be a branched polycarbonate obtained by polymerizing a trifunctional component, or may be a copolymerized polycarbonate obtained by copolymerizing an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid or an aromatic dicarboxylic acid, and a vinyl monomer.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0056">In a reaction using, for example, phosgene as the carbonate precursor, the reaction is usually carried out in the presence of an acid binder and a solvent. Examples of the acid binder include alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, or amine compounds such as pyridine. Examples of the solvent include halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride and chlorobenzene. In order to promote the reaction, for example, a catalyst such as a tertiary amine or a quaternary ammonium salt can also be used. At this time, the reaction temperature is usually 0&#xb0; C. to 40&#xb0; C., and the reaction time is several minutes to five hours.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0057">A transesterification reaction using, for example, a carbonic acid diester as the carbonate precursor is performed by a method of stirring while heating an aromatic dihydroxy component and the carbonic acid diester in a predetermined ratio under an inert gas atmosphere to distill off the generated alcohols or phenols. The reaction temperature varies depending on the boiling point of the generated alcohols or phenols, and is usually in a range of 120&#xb0; C. to 300&#xb0; C. In the reaction, the pressure is reduced from an initial stage, and the reaction is completed while the generated alcohols or phenols are distilled off. In order to promote the reaction, a catalyst generally used in the transesterification reaction can also be used. Examples of the carbonic acid diester to be used in the transesterification reaction include diphenyl carbonate, dinaphthyl carbonate, bis(diphenyl) carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, diethyl carbonate, and dibutyl carbonate.

In particular, in the case of the reaction using phosgene as the carbonate precursor, the monofunctional phenols are generally used as the terminal terminator for adjusting the molecular weight, and the obtained polycarbonate resin is excellent in thermal stability as compared with other polycarbonate resins because the terminal thereof is blocked by a group based on the monofunctional phenols. Specific examples of the monofunctional phenols include phenol, m-methylphenol, p-methylphenol, m-propylphenol, p-propylphenol, 1-phenylphenol, 2-phenyl, p-tert-butylphenol, p-cumylphenol, isooctylphenol, and p-long chain alkylphenol.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0059">The polycarbonate resin used in the invention can be copolymerized with an aliphatic diol if necessary.

Examples of the release agent include a fatty acid ester, a polyolefin wax (such as polyethylene wax, 1-alkene polymer, and a compound modified with a functional group-containing compound such as acid modification can also be used), a fluorine compound (such as fluorine oil represented by polyfluoroalkyl ether), a paraffin wax, and beeswax. Among these, a fatty acid ester is preferred in terms of availability, releasability, and transparency. A ratio of the other release agent to be used in combination with a silicone compound as a component B is preferably 0.005 to 0.2 parts by weight, more preferably 0.007 to 0.1 parts by weight, and still more preferably 0.01 to 0.06 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of the polycarbonate resin. When the content is less than the lower limit of the above range, an effect of improving the releasability is not clearly exerted, and when the content exceeds the upper limit, an adverse influence such as contamination to a mold during the molding is likely to occur.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0066">Among these, the fatty acid ester used as a preferred release agent will be described in more detail. The fatty acid ester is an ester of an aliphatic alcohol and an aliphatic carboxylic acid. The aliphatic alcohol may be a monohydric alcohol or a dihydric or higher polyhydric alcohol. The number of carbon atoms in the alcohol is preferably in a range of 3 to 32, and more preferably in a range of 5 to 30. Examples of the monohydric alcohol include dodecanol, tetradecanol, hexadecanol, octadecanol, eicosanol, tetracosanol, ceryl alcohol, and triacontanol. Examples of the polyhydric alcohol include pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol, tripentaerythritol, polyglycerol (triglycerol to hexaglycerol), ditrimethylolpropane, xylitol, sorbitol, and mannitol. The fatty acid ester according to the invention is more preferably a polyhydric alcohol.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0067">On the other hand, the aliphatic carboxylic acid preferably has 3 to 32 carbon atoms, and an aliphatic carboxylic acid having 10 to 22 carbon atoms is particularly preferred. Examples of the aliphatic carboxylic acid include saturated aliphatic carboxylic acids such as decanoic acid, undecanoic acid, dodecanoic acid, tridecanoic acid, tetradecanoic acid, pentadecanoic acid, hexadecanoic acid (palmitic acid), heptadecanoic acid, octadecanoic acid (stearic acid), nonadecanoic acid, icosanoic acid, and docosanoic acid (behenic acid) and unsaturated aliphatic carboxylic: acids such as palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, eicosenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and cetoleic acid. Among the above, the aliphatic carboxylic acid preferably has 14 to carbon atoms. Among these, saturated aliphatic carboxylic acids are preferred. Since the aliphatic carboxylic acids are usually produced from natural fats and oils such as animal fats and oils (beef tallow, pork tallow, and the like) and vegetable fats and oils (palm oil and the like), these aliphatic carboxylic acids are usually a mixture containing other carboxylic acid components having different carbon atoms.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0068">Therefore, the aliphatic carboxylic acid used in the invention is also produced from natural fats and oils, and is in the form of a mixture containing other carboxylic acid components. An acid value of the fatty acid ester is preferably 20 or less (substantially 0 can be taken). However, in the case of a complete ester (full ester), in order to improve the releasability, it is preferable that free fatty acids are contained, and in this regard, an acid value of the full ester is preferably in a range of 3 to 15. An iodine value of the fatty acid ester is preferably 10 or less (substantially 0 can be taken). These characteristics can be determined by a method defined in JIS K 0070.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0069">The fatty acid ester described above may be either a partial ester or a full ester, and is preferably a partial ester in terms of more favorable releasability and durability, and particularly preferably a glycerin monoester. The glycerin monoester contains a monoester of glycerin and fatty acid as a main component. Preferred examples of the fatty acid include saturated fatty acids such as stearic acid, palmitic acid, behenic acid, arachic acid, montanic acid, and lauric acid, and unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid, linoleic acid, and sorbic acid. It is particularly preferable that the glycerin monoester contains a glycerin monoester of stearic acid, behenic acid, and palmitic acid as a main component. The fatty acid is synthesized from a natural fatty acid, and is a mixture as described above. Even in such a case, a ratio of the glycerin monoester in the fatty acid ester is preferably 60% by weight or more.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0070">The partial ester is often inferior to the full ester in terms of thermal stability. In order to improve the thermal stability of the partial ester, the partial ester preferably has a sodium metal content of less than 20 ppm, more preferably less than 5 ppm, and still more preferably less than 1 ppm. The fatty acid partial ester having a sodium metal content of less than 1 ppm can be produced by producing a fatty acid partial ester by a usual method and then purifying the fatty acid partial ester by molecular distillation or the like.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0071">Specifically, for example, there is a method in which a gas component and a low-boiling component are removed by a spray nozzle degassing apparatus, then a polyhydric alcohol component such as glycerin is removed under the conditions of a distillation temperature of 120&#xb0; C. to 150&#xb0; C. and a degree of vacuum of 0.01 kPa to 0.03 kPa using a falling film distillation apparatus, and a centrifugal molecular distillation apparatus is used to obtain a high purity fatty acid partial ester as a fraction under the conditions of a distillation temperature of 1.60&#xb0; C. to 230&#xb0; C. and a degree of vacuum of 0.01 Torr to 0.2 Torr. The sodium metal can be removed as a distillation residue. By repeating molecular distillation for the obtained fraction, it is possible to further increase the purity and obtain a fatty acid partial ester having a smaller sodium metal content. It is also important to prevent mixing of a sodium metal component from an external environment by, for example, sufficiently cleaning the inside of the molecular distillation apparatus and increasing airtightness thereof using an appropriate method in advance. The fatty acid ester can be obtained from a professional (for example, Riken Vitamin Co., Ltd.).</p><heading id="h-0036" level="2">(ii) Phosphorus Stabilizer</heading><p id="p-0086" num="0072">The polycarbonate resin material used in the invention preferably further contains various phosphorus stabilizers for the main purpose of improving the thermal stability during molding.

By adjusting the rotation speed of the cooling roll, the film was taken out with a take-out roll to obtain a film having a predetermined thickness (150 &#x3bc;m).</p><p id="p-0158" num="0139">Subsequently, the film was passed through a roll hanging type heating treatment machine and subjected to a heating treatment. Rolls having a diameter of 100 mm were alternately arranged in a vertical direction in the roll hanging type heating treatment machine. A distance between an upper roll and a lower roll was set to 1.6 &#x3bc;m, and a distance between every other adjacent rolls was set to 100 mm, which was the same as the diameter of the roll. A film to be treated was prepared such that a length of the film staying in an oven in the roll hanging type heating treatment machine was about 50 m (residence time: 60 seconds). The hot air temperature of the oven in the heating treatment machine was 145&#xb0; C., and the film tension at an outlet of the oven was 3.0 kg/(thickness: 100 &#x3bc;m&#xd7;film width: 1,440 mm) (2.1 kg/s per section load). The film after exiting the oven was cooled to 60&#xb0; C. or lower in the same roll hanging type heating treatment machine, and then taken out to cool to room temperature. After the heat treatment, both end portions of the film were removed by 70 mm to obtain a film having a width of 1,300 mm.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0140">Thereafter, a copper foil having a thickness of 18 &#x3bc;m (product name CF-T9DA-SV-18, manufactured by Fukuda Metal Foil &#x26; Powder Co., Ltd.) was bonded to a corona discharge-treated polycarbonate film (transparent substrate) to prepare a transparent conductive film. Results of various evaluations are shown in Table 2.</p><heading id="h-0061" level="1">Example II-2</heading><p id="p-0160" num="0141">Into a reactor equipped with a stirrer and a distillation column, 6,510 parts (22 mol) of 1,1-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methylphenyl)cyclohexane, 4,920 parts (23 mol) of diphenyl carbonate, and 0.000005 parts of sodium hydroxide and 0.0016 parts of tetramethylammonium hydroxide as catalysts were charged and the atmosphere was substituted with nitrogen. The mixture was dissolved while being heated to 180&#xb0; C. Thereafter, the stirrer was rotated and the temperature in the reactor was kept at 220&#xb0; C. The pressure in the reactor was reduced from 101.3 kPa to 13.3 kPa over 40 minutes while distilling off the by-produced phenol. Subsequently, a transesterification reaction was carried out for 80 minutes while maintaining the pressure in the reactor at 13.3 kPa and further distilling off phenol.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0142">The pressure in the reactor was reduced from 13.3 kPa to 2 kPa in an absolute pressure, the temperature was further increased to 260&#xb0; C., and the distilled phenol was removed to the outside of the system. Further, the temperature was continuously raised and the pressure in the reactor reached 0.3 Pa or less, then the pressure was maintained and a polycondensation reaction was carried out. The final temperature in the reactor was 295&#xb0; C. The polycondensation reaction was completed when the stirrer of the reactor reached a predetermined stirring power. The polymerization reaction time in the reactor was 140 minutes. Next, in a molten state, 0.0023 parts (4&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>mol/l mol of bisphenol) of a dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid tetrabutylphosphonium salt was added as a catalyst neutralizer, the reaction was continued at 295&#xb0; C. and 10 Torr or less for 10 minutes, and the obtained polymer was sent to a vented twin-screw extruder (KTX-46 manufactured by Kobe Steel, Ltd.) with a gear pump. In the midway in the extruder, 0.1 parts by weight of a release agent: RIKESTER EW400 (pentaerythritol stearate, manufactured by Riken Vitamin Co., Ltd.), 0.05 parts by weight of a phosphorous antioxidant: hostanox P-EPQ (tetrakis(2,4-tert-butylphenyl)-4,4&#x2032;-biphenylene diphosphonite, manufactured by Clariant Japan AG.), and 0.03 parts by weight of a hindered phenol antioxidant: Irganox 1076 (3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl octadecyl propionate, manufactured by BASF) were added to 100 parts by weight of the polymer, and the mixture was melt-kneaded and extruded while removing gas at an inlet barrel temperature of 230&#xb0; C., an outlet barrel temperature of 270&#xb0; C., a polycarbonate resin outlet temperature of 285&#xb0; C., and extruded from an outlet of the twin-screw extruder into a strand shape, cooled and solidified with water, and then pelletized by a rotary cutter to obtain polycarbonate resin pellets.
