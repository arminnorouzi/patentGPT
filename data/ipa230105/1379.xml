relates, inter alia, to the use of porous crystalline solids constituted of a metal-organic framework (MOF) for the selective adsorption of aldehyde volatile organic compounds.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0002">The MOF solids of the present invention can be used for the improved purification of dry or humid air, and for the manufacture of regenerable filters for air purification, particularly leak-free regenerable air filters.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0003">The references in square brackets [X] refer to the list of references at the end of the examples.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0004">The air we breathe can be contaminated by pollutants, defined according to Article L220-2 of the French Environmental Code as &#x201c;chemical, biological or physical agents, with harmful consequences likely to endanger human health, harm biological resources and ecosystems, influence climate change, damage material property, cause excessive odour nuisance&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">Unlike outdoor air pollution, indoor air pollution remained relatively unknown until the 2000s. Yet individuals spend between 90% and 80% of their time in confined environments: housing, schools, workplaces or those intended to accommodate a public . . . . The quality of the air we breathe can have consequences on comfort and health, from simple discomfort or irritation to more dangerous and fatal consequences such as the appearance of allergies, asthma, lung cancer, poisoning, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory infections.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">Air pollution is a major global health concern, as evidenced by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDOs), detailed in Agenda 2030 and established by UN Member States. These objectives define targets to be achieved by 2030, and include the following three SDOs for air pollution: (i) Reducing mortality from air pollution; (ii) Ensuring access to clean energy in housing; and (iii) Ensuring air quality in cities. In May 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a critical assessment of air pollution: 7 million deaths each year due to exposure to ambient and domestic air pollution, or one in nine deaths worldwide caused by diseases related to air pollution. More than 90% of the world's population currently lives in areas where air pollution exceeds WHO limits.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">Ambient and domestic air pollution is one of the leading causes of premature death (all deaths before age 65) worldwide. Although ambient and domestic air pollution is most often invisible and neglected as a risk, it has devastating consequences for the health of millions of people.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">The quality of the air inside dwellings distinguishes from that of the outside air by pollutant concentrations that are generally much higher and by the presence of chemical substances that are not detected outside. For example, a gas chromatography analysis dating from 2007 identified nearly 20 VOCs in indoor air in 567 French main residences, revealing that the main volatile organic compounds are aldehydes and more particularly formaldehyde with the highest concentration, followed by aromatic compounds: toluene and xylene.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0009">Formaldehyde, also known as methanal, is a highly toxic and carcinogenic volatile organic compound (VOC). Although gaseous sources of formaldehyde emit less and less pollutant over time, the vapours of this harmful substance can take weeks and sometimes even months or years to completely disappear. In addition, formaldehyde is spontaneously emitted during any combustion phenomenon (fires, tobacco smoke, vehicle emissions in garage/parking and such) and during human activities (cooking, wood-burning stoves, vegetal waste burning).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">From a technological point of view, there are currently several technologies on the market to address the problems of indoor air pollution. French company Air-Serenity uses a technology based on the use of air treatment filter cartridges designed to remove chemical compounds, particles and micro-organisms in a single pass. More precisely, this technology uses a HEPA F7 filter to capture fine particles, adsorbent sponges to capture volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and a cold plasma for regeneration. Specifically, cold plasma is used to regenerate the &#x201c;sponge&#x201d; by reacting VOCs with ozone and radicals emitted by the plasma (to form CO<sub>2 </sub>and H<sub>2</sub>O at the end of the reaction chain). The regeneration frequency is daily. This regeneration is not perfect and probably wears out the sponge, in any case the cartridge must be replaced at least annually.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0011">To date, this technology is not available for general public use: at the end of its life it is sent back to the supplier for replacement by the consumer. In addition, several scientific studies have shown that plasma treatment rarely produces CO<sub>2 </sub>and water only; more often, it gives rise to radical species that do not react completely, and are potentially dangerous. This technology therefore presents risks.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0012">The company Beewair uses the DBD-lyse process (dielectric barrier discharge generating free radicals) to crack harmful molecules (viruses, bacteria, VOCs, etc.) in a reactor, then recompose them by mineralization into stable molecules present in the air (nitrogen, oxygen, water, etc.). The advantage is that there are no disposable cartridges; however, the technology is relatively expensive compared to a filter-based purification system, and it lacks efficiency in mineralization.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0013">There are many companies such as Austin (American company), Blueair, IQair and major brands of household appliances, whose filtration system is based on a coupling of HEPA filters of activated carbon and zeolites, with a fan to force the passage of air through these filters.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0014">The company INOVAME presents a purification technology that allows formaldehyde to be targeted, using a formulation of activated carbons and acetoacetamide [1, 2].</p><p id="p-0017" num="0015">However, existing filters suffer a number of important drawbacks. They are not very selective, and tend to saturate quickly in the presence of high humidity levels, with reduced performance over time. In addition, existing filters tend to release pollutants that are concentrated within the filter, when the concentration of the absorbate is higher than that of the pollutant in the filtered air. They also must be changed frequently and disposed of as sensitive materials at the end of their life cycle, then must be replaced by a new filter (hence with consumption of raw material).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016">Existing adsorbant materials used in air filters lack a leak-free capture capacity, (i.e. they typically release formaldehyde under normal ambient conditions). They do not offer sufficient selectivity to ensure formaldehyde capture over other VOCs (capturing other VOCs can prevent formaldehyde capture). Finally, they do not allow regeneration without damaging their structures and chemical compositions (e.g., degradation and/or removal of grafted amine within the adsorbant structure). To our knowledge, there are no regenerable/recyclable air filters/purifiers adapted for domestic use for VOC capture. Conventional filters systematically require a return to the supplier for a specific treatment: either thermal treatment (by raising the temperature to about 800&#xb0; C.), or a chemical treatment (typically at low temperature (about 100&#xb0; C.) using a solvent with a high pH).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0017">However, these methods suffer serious drawbacks in that they incur a loss of material as well as significant energy costs.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0018">Therefore, there remains a need for the development of a material and air purification system that selectively captures aldehydes, such as formaldehyde and/or acetaldehyde, and that combines the following attractive properties:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0019">filtration selectivity and high adsorption capacity (to avoid accelerated saturation phenomena)</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0020">adsorption stability under representative environmental conditions (to avoid release/leakage phenomena)</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0021">recyclability of the filter according to a protocol applicable to domestic and professional use (to avoid expensive consumables, often causing poor performance of air purifiers)</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>: lists exemplary MOFs tested for selective aldehyde adsorption within the context of the present invention, and their properties and physicochemical characteristics.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>: shows a PXRD pattern of Al-3,5-PDA prepared in Example 1.1, performed at room temperature.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>: shows nitrogen adsorption isotherm of Al-3,5-PDA prepared in Example 1.1, performed at 77K, which indicates a type I isotherm, and shows a microporous material, with a specific surface area (BET) around 1343 m<sup>2</sup>/g and pore volume of 0.49 cm<sup>3</sup>/g.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>: shows TGA curve of Al-3,5-PDA prepared in Example 1.1, showing water loss from 25&#xb0; C. to 100&#xb0; C. and the degradation of the Al-3,5-PDA from 350&#xb0; C.

The amount of water vapor present in the environment, e.g. air, increases as the temperature increases. The differences in the amount of water vapor in a parcel of air can be quite large. For example, a parcel of air that is near saturation may contain 28 grams of water per cubic meter of air at 30&#xb0; C., but only 8 grams of water per cubic meter of air at 8&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0072">Water vapor or vapour or aqueous vapor is the gaseous phase of water. It is one state of water within the hydrosphere. Under typical atmospheric conditions, water vapor is continuously generated by evaporation and removed by condensation. The vapor content of air may be measured with devices known as hygrometers. In the present invention, the amount of water vapor in the environment, e.g. air, may be from above dry air to saturation, for example from 10 to 30&#xb0; C., for example at room temperature, i.e. at a temperature between 18&#xb0; C. and 28&#xb0; C. As used herein, the term &#x201c;above normal humid environment&#x201d; refers to a humidity level of an environment, as defined above, that is above the conventionally accepted threshold for normal humid environment for human comfort. This &#x201c;normal humidity&#x201d; threshold is typically around 25-30% relative humidity (cf. Ashrae Fundamentals Handbook, SI Edition, 2001, p. 24.5. [3]). In the context of the present invention, an above normal humid environment refers to &#x3e;60% relative humidity, still preferably &#x2265;70% relative humidity, still preferably &#x2265;80% relative humidity, up to 100% relative humidity. Indoor environments such as museums, galleries, libraries, and archival collections are conventionally associated with above normal relative humidity levels around 40% RH.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0073">MOFs are constructed from bridging organic ligands, also named &#x201c;linkers&#x201d; or &#x201c;linker&#x201d; or &#x201c;spacers&#x201d; or &#x201c;spacer&#x201d; that remain intact throughout the synthesis, these ligands acting as linkers in the network of the obtained MOF structure. As used herein, the term &#x201c;ligand&#x201d; or &#x201c;linker&#x201d; or &#x201c;spacer&#x201d; refers to a ligand coordinated to at least two metals, which participates in providing distance between these metals and in forming empty spaces or pores, named also &#x201c;core&#x201d; in the MOF.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0074">As used herein, the term &#x201c;average pore size&#x201d; will be understood to refer to the MOF pore size (or pore diameter), as conventionally used in the art, as calculated by the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm method at &#x2212;196&#xb0; C. under 10<sup>5 </sup>Pa (1 bar).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0075">As used herein, the term &#x201c;water-stable MOF&#x201d; refers to those MOFs that do not exhibit structural breakdown under exposure to water. MOF water stability may be assessed by determining if a MOF structure stays stable in a water stability test. This is typically done through the comparison of the typical chemical features between post-exposure samples and pristine samples. The chemical features can be the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern and BET surface area on the basis of gas adsorption capacity, which could well suggest whether the MOF loses its crystallinity or structural porosity after the exposure to water content. Generally, MOF structures are susceptible to the attack by water molecules, which would lead to ligand displacement, phase changes, and/or structural decomposition. A water-stable MOF structure is robust enough to prevent the intrusion of water molecules into the MOF framework, and the consequent loss in crystallinity and overall porosity. See Wang et al. 2016 [31]. A MOF is thus water-stable when, after being exposed to a gaseous environment with 50% relative humidity (RH) for 24 hours at 100&#xb0; C. and atmospheric pressure, or after being placed in water at 100 C for 12 hours the MOF cristal structure (as measured by X-Ray diffraction pattern or IR spectroscopy) and average pore size (as calculated by the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm method at &#x2212;196&#xb0; C. under 105 Pa (1 bar)) remains unchanged within experimental error.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0076">As used herein, the expressions &#x201c;hydrophilic MOF&#x201d; or &#x201c;MOF with a hydrophilic core&#x201d;, and conversely &#x201c;hydrophobic MOF&#x201d; or &#x201c;MOF with a hydrophobic core&#x201d;, do not depart from the conventional meaning of these terms in the field of MOFs.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0077">The hydrophilic/hydrophobic character of a MOF is directly related to the organic ligand of a MOF. A hydrophilic MOF, will present hydrophilic ligands that are attracted to water molecules; typically, ligands with a polar group which allows creating hydrogen bonds with water or a polar solvent (ex: &#x2014;NH<sub>2</sub>; &#x2014;OH; &#x2014;NO<sub>2</sub>). In contrast, hydrophobic MOFs, will present organic ligands that are not attracted to water (ex: &#x2014;CH<sub>3</sub>). The steric hindrance around MOF metal sites that can interact with water can also increase the hydrophobicity of a material. This may involve the use of ligands functionalized with alkyl groups or by densification of the inorganic part. A vapor phase water sorption experiment allows to distinguish between MOFs with hydrophilic or hydrophobic character. A hydrophilic material will present a type I isotherm (microporous material) with massive adsorption at low partial pressure. A rather hydrophobic material will present a type V isotherm, with a significant adsorption for an intermediate partial pressure (0.2&#x3c;P/P<sub>0</sub>&#x3c;0.6), due to the capillary condensation in the pores. The extreme case of the super-hydrophobic material will show a total absence of adsorption of water, whatever the partial pressure. See reference [32] As used herein, the term &#xab;regenerable&#xbb; when used to qualify an air filter/purifier according to the invention, refers to the ability of the filter/purifier, after having reached saturation and undergone a regeneration process as described herein, to retain &#x3e;0%, preferably &#x2265;25%, more preferably &#x2265;50%, yet more preferably &#x2265;75%, most preferably &#x2265;99% of its adsorption/filtering capacity, after at least one regeneration cycle, preferably after 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, more preferably after 10 regeneration cycles or more.

For example, it may be air with 15 to 95% relative humidity. The gaseous environment may for example be air with a normal humid level for human comfort (about 25-30% relative humidity).

Preferably it may be 4 {acute over (&#x212b;)}&#x2264;D&#x3c;10 {acute over (&#x212b;)}.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0086">The pore size distribution of MOFs can be calculated from the adsorption isotherms of some gases, like nitrogen gas. The distribution does not give a single value of pore size, but the distribution of volumes associated to each pore size (pore diameter or pore width, depending on the geometry of the pore). Accordingly, the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm method (&#x2212;196&#xb0; C.) is meant to encompass the various possible pore geometries of the MOF material &#x2018;e.g., tetrahedral, octahedral). MOF usually have well defined pore sizes, and the distribution is usually narrow. Hence, the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm method (&#x2212;196&#xb0; C.) is particularly adapted to average pore size determination in MOF materials. Methods for measuring MOF average pore sizes are well documented in the literature. There are several methods to do this type of calculation and some recommendations are given for example by IUPAC (cf. Thommes et al., IUPAC Technical Report, Pure Appl. Chem., 2015, 87(9-10), 1051-1069). [24] Cf. also Rouqu&#xe9;rol, F.; Rouqu&#xe9;rol, J.; Sing, K. Adsorption by powders and porous solids; Academic Press: San Diego, 1999, which gives a much wider discussion on this topic. [4]</p><p id="p-0090" num="0087">Alternatively, maximum and limiting pore sizes may be estimated from crystallographic data by simulating the filling of the pores with gas molecules (L. Sarkisov and A. Harrison, Mol. Simul., 2011, 37, 1248-1257 [5]) that allow the calculation of average pore sizes. Briefly, from diffraction patterns (X-ray pattern is the most common), a crystal structure of the MOF may be determined. There are currently several computational methods proposed in the literature to estimate the pore size (cages and windows) and surface area from a well-defined crystal structure. These computational methods are essentially based on the simulation of the adsorption of a probe molecule on the surface of the pores. Reference [5] describes a method and reports a computer program to determine the most probable pore sizes, and hence the MOF average pore size. Regardless of the method used, if properly applied, they agree within experimental error. Nevertheless, in the context of the present invention, all values of MOF average pore size mentioned in the present document are based on the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm method (at &#x2212;196&#xb0; C.) under 105 Pa (1 bar).</p><p id="p-0091" num="0088">In each of the above aspects, the use/method may be carried out under the conventional temperature range used in the field of air filter/purification systems.

Rather, the basic groups/functions are covalently bound to the ligands making up the MOF framework. As such, the basic groups/functions present in the MOF framework are therefore more sustainable to capture aldehydes and stable upon thermal and/or solvent regeneration. Indeed, in the case of basic groups/functions bound to the metal sites of the MOF, there is a risk of removing them during water and/or thermal regeneration.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0091">Advantageously, in each of the above aspects, the regenerable filter may be leak-free with respect to aldehyde volatile organic compounds. In other words, in addition to selectively adsorb aldehydes in the presence of other VOCs and/or in humid air, the MOFs useable in the context of the present invention have the ability to retain aldehydes, such as formaldehyde and/or acetaldehyde, with maximum efficiency from the first passage of contaminated air through the filter, without releasing the aldehydes even when the filter is saturated and/or even when the temperature increases (typical working temperature envisaged is the range 10-50&#xb0; C.).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0092">As used herein, the term &#x201c;leak-free&#x201d; when referring to the regenerable filters of the invention, refers to the ability of the filter to retain 100% of the aldehyde(s) adsorbed under atmospheric pressure (1 atm, 101325 Pa) and under a working temperature in the range 10-50&#xb0; C. The later may apply even when the contaminated air flow through the filter at a space velocity &#x2264;60000 h<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. For example, in the case of formaldehyde, the leak-free adsorption capacity of an adsorbent corresponds to the amount of formaldehyde adsorbed by the adsorbent with a 100% filtering action in formaldehyde (no formaldehyde molecules are detected at the outlet of the filter cell containing the adsorbent material). In other words, the &#x201c;leak-free adsorption capacity&#x201d; of an adsorbent material corresponds to the absence of risk of aldehyde release over time. A conventional adsorbent, such as activated carbon, can release the stored pollutants, depending on the ambient conditions (temperature, humidity, aldehyde concentration in the air). In contrast, the MOF adsorbent according to the invention, such as Al-3,5-PDA, will not do so, under normal ambient conditions, until the leak-free storage capacity is exceeded. The leak-free adsorption capacity of an adsorbent can be determined using an operando cell, coupled with mass spectrometry and IR spectroscopy, such as that described in the Examples section.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0093">Metal Atoms</p><p id="p-0097" num="0094">The MOF metal may be selected from any metal that promotes water stability and that is capable of leading to a MOF whose basic part is not bound to the metal.

Short-chain aldehyde VOCs include C6-aldehydes such as hexanal, which is very much used in aromas and perfumes. Typical other short-chain aldehyde VOCs include formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, acrolein, benzaldehyde, isopental, pentanal, valeraldehyde, isovaleraldehyde, butanal and isobutyraldehyde (C4). In a typical indoor environment, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are preponderant short-chain aldehyde VOCs, with traces of propionaldehyde, acrolein (C3), benzaldehyde (C6), isopental, pentanal, valeraldehyde and isovaleraldehyde (C5), butanal and isobutyraldehyde (C4). In terms of most important aldehyde VOC concentrations present in indoor air, C1-C3 aldehyde VOCs represent the bulk of short-chain aldehyde VOCs (outside of specialty indoor spaces with specifically controlled gaseous environment where the VOC composition may differ). Therefore, the present invention is especially useful to the selective capture of short-chain aldehyde VOCs, such as C1-C3 aldehyde VOCs, over other VOCs (e.g., non-aldehyde VOCs) and water that may be present in surrounding air, even in abnormally humid gaseous environments (i.e. with above-normal relative humidity).</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">As porous materials, MOFs in general have already been used as adsorbent and/or filter materials. However, the MOFs described in this document, for the implementation of the present invention, especially the MOFs described according to the best mode, constitute a very particular selection of the MOF family. They are able to effectively and selectively remove aldehyde VOCs, preferably short-chain aldehyde VOCs as described above, at low concentrations from indoor air, even in abnormally humid gaseous environments (i.e. with above-normal relative humidity), and in the presence of other VOCs (e.g., non-aldehyde VOCs). In porous materials such as MOFs in general, the competing adsorption of water (polar molecule) typically hinders the use of generic MOFs to adsorb polar volatile organic compounds, such as aldehydes, that are present in the air in very low concentrations. The presence of water strongly influences the adsorption of polar VOCs when the concentration of VOCs to be removed is very low.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0189">The MOFs that can be used in this invention, as described in this document, especially the MOFs described according to the best mode, significantly improve the elimination/capture of aldehyde VOCs, preferably short-chain aldehyde VOCs, present in very low concentrations (both in absolute and relative pressure) even in the presence of high concentrations of water vapour. They are therefore MOFs specially designed chemically and structurally for the improved adsorption of aldehyde volatile organic compounds, even in cases when the aldehyde VOCs are present at low concentrations in humid environments (e.g. with above normal relative humidity).</p><p id="p-0191" num="0190">Thus, the MOFs used in the present invention generally have good water stability and allow selective adsorption of aldehyde volatile organic compounds, preferably short-chain aldehyde VOCs, at very low concentrations. For example, aldehyde selective adsorption may occur at aldehyde concentrations as low as 1 ppb, or even lower. In general, the MOFs useable in the context of the present invention allow selective adsorption of aldehyde volatile organic compounds present in dry or humid air (i.e., ranging from 0% to 100% relative humidity) at a concentration in the order of 1 ppb and 500 ppm, or even 1 ppb to 100 ppm, below, at, or above normal humid level for human comfort (for example below 25% relative humidity, at about 25-30% relative humidity, or &#x3e;30% relative humidity, for example &#x2265;35% relative humidity, for example &#x2265;40% relative humidity, up to 100% relative humidity). Aldehyde VOCs, especially short-chain aldehyde VOCs are selectively captures/adsorbed, meaning that the specific selection of MOFs described in this document, especially the MOFs described according to the best mode, preferentially capture/adsorb aldehyde VOCs, especially short-chain aldehyde VOCs, over other VOCs (e.g., non-aldehyde VOCs) and water that may be present in surrounding air, even in abnormally humid gaseous environments (i.e. with above-normal relative humidity).</p><p id="p-0192" num="0191">One stark advantage of the water-stable MOFs for use according to the present invention, especially the MOFs described according to the best mode, is that the captured VOCs, in particular aldehydes such as short-chain aldehyde VOCs, are not released from the MOF material, even as the temperature increases (typical working temperature envisaged is the range 10-50&#xb0; C.), and/or even as the MOF material reaches saturation. Stated otherwise, the originality of the present invention does not lie only in the selective capture of aldehydes from the surrounding dry or humid air in the presence of other pollutants, but also in the ability to nog release the adsorbed aldehydes, even when the temperature increases (within the typical working range of 10-40&#xb0; C., preferably 10-50&#xb0; C. The difference between the MOF material according to the invention and existing materials (activated carbons, zeolites) is that the &#x201c;leak-free&#x201d; storage capacity is not null and is sufficiently large for widespread use commercially. The &#x201c;no leak&#x201d; characteristics of the filter according to the present invention present a stark advantage over existing filters i.e. the ability to retain aldehydes, for example short-chain aldehyde VOCs such as formaldehyde and/or acetaldehyde, with maximum efficiency from the first passage of contaminated air through the filter, without releasing the aldehydes if the filter is saturated. These two characteristics are completely lacking in existing air filter/purification systems, notably carbon filters.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0192">In particular, the presence of other species (typically aromatic VOCs such as toluene) does not affect the absorption capacity of the MOFs useable in the context of the present invention with respect to aldehyde VOCs, nor its selectivity. This is yet another stark advantage over activated carbon-based filters/purifiers which get quickly poisoned by molecules such as toluene (See comparative tests, notably with BlueAir&#xae; brand activated carbon, and an activated carbon/acetoacetamide formulation from the Blooow&#xae; brand, detailed in the Examples).</p><p id="p-0194" num="0193">The fact that the MOFs envisaged in the context of the present invention selectively adsorb aldehydes, such as formaldehyde and/or acetaldehyde, which are polar organic compounds typically soluble in water at the concentrations that are being considered (concentrations of VOCs in air), offers yet another great advantage in that the MOFs may be regenerated by immersion in water. Optionally, a common consumer product additive, such as an alcohol, could be added to the water to improve the regeneration of the MOF.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0194">A such, in yet another aspect, the present invention provides a regenerable filter for air purification, comprising a porous water-stable Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) material comprising an average pore size &#x3c;40 {acute over (&#x212b;)}, preferably &#x3c;10 {acute over (&#x212b;)}, and a hydrophilic core formed by basic groups and hydrogen-bond accepting or donating oxygenated species in the MOF framework, wherein the basic groups are covalently bound to the MOF framework; wherein the filter may be regenerated by cleaning with water and/or a hydro alcoholic solution. The MOF may be as defined in any variant described in the present document. Particularly preferred MOFs are those described above according to the best mode (cf. sections &#x201c;Ligand best mode&#x201d; and &#x201c;MOF best mode&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0196" num="0195">In yet another aspect, the present invention provides an air purification system comprising a regenerable filter as defined above.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0196">Based on what is observed in the case of Al-3.5-PDA in terms of interaction between formaldehyde and active sites (See Examples, notably Example 7), MOFs according to the best mode described in the present disclosure are believed to be regenerable.

Such ligands are believed to have similar interactions (it has been shown that this in the case of the pyrazolate MOFs Al-3.5-PDA and DUT-67(Zr)-PZDC as well as in the case of imidazole) during the adsorption of formaldehyde with the active sites (here the N&#x2014;N&#x2014;H groups).</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197">Naturally, regeneration is conditioned on bringing sufficient energy to the system to break the interactions formed (the desorption energy is of the order of 86 KJ/mol in the case of the interaction between formaldehyde and the &#x2014;N&#x2014;NH&#x2014; groups of the pyrazole ligand). As discussed previously, the MOFs according to the best mode may be regenerated thermally and/or by washing with water and/or a hydroalcoholic solution. This is possible because in the MOFs according to the best mode, the energy brought to the system for regeneration does not significantly deteriorate the structure and active sites of the MOFs.

Removing the large excess of unreacted terephthalic acid from the powder is performed by following this purification process. First, with a glass filter whose the pore size is between 40 and 100 &#x3bc;m, the solution is filtered off twice to remove insoluble terephthalic acid from the solution.

The system allowed one of the two flows to be sent to the cell while the other flow was sent directly to the analysers to have an internal standard in the system for a precise quantification. The flow change was carried out by means of a six-way valve allowing a rapid alternation between the activation and reaction flow in order to observe the adsorption phenomenon of the sample without the disturbances that can be caused by the stabilization of the different MOF materials. Thus, in this example, the sum of the two flows (activation and reaction) were simultaneously analyzed by gas phase IR spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy. This makes it possible to check the stability of the various MOF materials at the beginning of the reaction and also to have a reference level of formaldehyde at each moment.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0250">The shaped MOF sample was previously placed under activation flow, which stabilizes the reaction flow. After stabilization, the sample was placed under reaction flow (total flow: 20 cc/min, 20% O<sub>2</sub>, +415 ppm of formaldehyde diluted in N<sub>2</sub>): this is the step of adsorption of the material.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0251">The MOF was left under reaction flow until it was completely saturated.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0252">In mass spectroscopy, the formaldehyde content is followed by the variation of mass 29 (28 and 30). During adsorption, the amount of formaldehyde present in the stream decreases, which corresponds to the decrease in mass 29 (28 and 30). Gradually, when the MOF material begins to be saturated, the amount of formaldehyde present in the reaction flow increases, as does the mass 29 (28 and 30). Finally, the quantity of formaldehyde present in the lines and the mass 29 (28 and 30) return to the initial introduction level, the material is then saturated. Variations in the amount of formaldehyde are also monitored by gas-phase FTIR spectroscopy in the elongation vibration range of the C&#x2014;H bond 2781-2778 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. During adsorption, the characteristic peak of formaldehyde initially decreases, then increases to its initial intensity. Thanks to a previously performed calibration, it is also possible to correlate the quantity of formaldehyde present in the gas phase at each moment, by considering the air of the formaldehyde peak in FTIR spectroscopy of the gas phase. The maximum adsorption capacity was determined by analysis of the mass spectrometry pattern, more specifically, by integrating the curve into the negative of mass 29 corresponding to the total amount of formaldehyde adsorbed by the sample.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0253">After saturation, the desorption step was performed. The sample was placed under activation flow (total flow: 20 cc/min, 20% O<sub>2</sub>+Ar). If the MOF material releases formaldehyde at room temperature, an increase in the base level of line 29 in mass spectroscopy and an increase in the peak characteristic of formaldehyde in infrared gas phase spectroscopy should be observed. The end of desorption is noted by a return to the initial state of mass 29 in mass spectroscopy and the characteristic peak of formaldehyde in infrared gas phase spectroscopy.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0254">Still under activation flow, desorption was studied at different temperatures representative of conditions in dwellings or representative of conditions during thermal regeneration: 23&#xb0; C., 25&#xb0; C., 30&#xb0; C., 35&#xb0; C., 45&#xb0; C., 50&#xb0; C., 75&#xb0; C., 100&#xb0; C., 150&#xb0; C., 200&#xb0; C.

area and pore volume of the adsorbent with microporosity. Nevertheless, the chemical properties of the adsorbent surface are the most important parameters. This graph, in particular, makes it possible to make the link between the hydrophilicity of the various materials and their maximum formaldehyde adsorption capacities. The hydrophobic materials used, ZIF-8, UiO-66(Zr)-2(CF<sub>3</sub>) and MIL-140B, are ineffective for the adsorption of formaldehyde, unlike more hydrophilic materials. This can be explained by the chemical properties and in particular the hydrophilic nature of formaldehyde. However, Table 1 reveals that it is not only the hydrophilicity that is at stake, as shown by the experiments carried out on MIL-160(Al), which is a very hydrophilic material and adsorbs a moderate quantity of formaldehyde.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0262">The adsorption of formaldehyde is promoted by the presence of amine groups, the performance of the materials MIL-125(Ti)&#x2014;NH<sub>2</sub>, UiO-66(Zr)&#x2014;NH<sub>2 </sub>for the adsorption of formaldehyde is at least a factor two higher than their non-functionalized samples respectively MIL-125(Ti), UiO-66(Zr). In our study, MIL-53(Al)&#x2014;NH<sub>2 </sub>presents an exception because its formaldehyde adsorption capacity is lower than MIL-53(Al), this can be explained by the fact that amine groups tend to block the structure of the material in &#x201c;very narrow pore&#x201d; conformation or pores closed by the interactions between amine groups and the infinite chains[AlOe]. of MIL-53(Al), which has the double effect of making the amine bond unavailable and making the structure narrower with insufficient pore size to accommodate formaldehyde within the pores. Because the amine groups in MIL-53(Al)&#x2014;NH<sub>2 </sub>bind to the MOF metal sites, MIL-53(Al)&#x2014;NH<sub>2 </sub>is not suitable for reducing to practice the present invention. As such, this MOF is not considered to fall within the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0263">The Lewis and Br&#xf8;nsted acid sites appear to have a major role. In Lewis' view, an acid is a species with an electron gap, which makes it likely to accept an electron doublet, in the case of MOFs they are unsaturated coordination sites (CUS: Coordinatively Unsaturated Site). In Br&#xf8;nsted's sense, an acid is a species capable of yielding a proton typically of hydroxyl groups in MOF structures. Lewis acid sites are generally obtained after thermal activation of the sample at high temperature (100-200&#xb0; C.) since the residual water must be removed to make them accessible.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0264">This Example reveals little difference between the maximum formaldehyde adsorption capacity between a thermally activated and non-thermally activated material. The relative humidity in the reaction flow is sufficiently high to transform back the Lewis acid sites generated during thermal regeneration of the sample into Br&#xf8;nsted acid sites. The Br&#xf8;nsted acid sites have a role in the adsorption of formaldehyde. More specifically, amine groups and free pyrazoles, i.e. groups not connected to the metal ions of the MOF framework, as in the case of the most efficient materials Al-3,5-PDA and DUT-67(Zr)-PZDC two materials with different structures but synthesized using the same ligand (pyrazole-3,5-dicarboxylic acid).</p><p id="p-0263" num="0265">Table 2 summarizes the adsorption capacities of selected MOF samples, which show great promise, as compared to conventional filter materials (Activated carbons).</p><p id="p-0264" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00006" num="00006"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="294pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 2</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Co-adsorption of formaldehyde and water at 23&#xb0; C., under the conditions of a flow of </entry></row><row><entry>20 cc/min composed of 20% O<sub>2</sub>, 90% RH and 415 ppm formaldehyde.

This could occur via the filling of specific sites with a high affinity for formaldehyde, interaction with pyrazole groups in the case of Al-3,5-PDA and DUT-67(Zr)-PZDC MOFs. It should also be noted that MIL-101(Cr) has a very low leak-free adsorption compared to its counterparts due to the absence of specific sites, except for Lewis acid sites which are competitively consumed by water, its rather high maximum adsorption is due to its large specific surface area (&#x3e;3000 m<sup>2</sup>/g). In addition, activated carbons have zero leak-free adsorption.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0267">Table 3 shows the release of formaldehyde by the various samples by gradually increasing the temperature from the ambient temperature.

Formaldehyde adsorption was carried out as described in the previous protocol, with the exception of thermal reactivation. Instead, the MOF pellets were placed in a flask containing 100 mL of distilled water stirred at room temperature for one night. After this operation the solids were recovered in powder form, filtered on B&#xfc;chner and dried at room temperature and pelletized again (shaped into pellets) to undergo formaldehyde adsorption. This step was repeated a second time.</p><p id="p-0274" num="0272">Table 6 shows the comparative quantities of formaldehyde adsorbed by the Al-3,5-PDA material prepared in Example 1.1 and the activated carbon of Blue Air&#xae; during the saturation/wash cycles in water. The regeneration of samples after adsorption of formaldehyde by immersion in water may be explained by the solubility of formaldehyde in water. However, after the second wash, the formaldehyde adsorption capacity decreases by about 14% and 20% in the case of Al-3,5-PDA and activated carbon respectively. These values fall within the margin of error of the experimental results of +/&#x2212;10%, however the adsorption capacities have a decreasing tendency, which could mean that the material is not completely regenerated. However, the MOF material performance in formaldehyde capture remains fundamentally intact and superior to references. Additional washing tests were carried out on 75 mg of Al-3,5-PDA with 2% PVB, using the following regeneration protocol: quenched in 500 mL of hot water (50&#xb0; C.) during 3 hours then rinsed with 2 liters of hot water (50&#xb0; C. No noticeable change in adsorption capacity (leak-free and maximum adsorption capacity of formaldehyde) was observed over 5 adsorption/regeneration cycles. This can be explained by the increase of the amount of sample used which does decrease the error on the measurements. Also the solubility of formaldehyde increases in hot water.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00010" num="00010"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 6</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Quantities of formaldehyde adsorbed during different </entry></row><row><entry>adsorption/regeneration cycles by immersion in water.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>initial </entry><entry>adsorption of</entry><entry>adsorption of</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>adsorption of </entry><entry>formaldehyde </entry><entry>formaldehyde </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>formaldehyde</entry><entry>after the 1st </entry><entry>after the 2nd </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(mmol/g)</entry><entry>wash (mmol/g)</entry><entry>wash (mmol/g)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>AI-3,5-PDA 1st</entry><entry>3.36</entry><entry>3.25</entry><entry>2.88</entry></row><row><entry>Activated carbon</entry><entry>1.94</entry><entry>1.84</entry><entry>1.55</entry></row><row><entry>Blue Air&#x2009;&#xae;</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>(comparative)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0276" num="0273">&#x201c;Real-Life&#x201d; Test with Air Filter</p><p id="p-0277" num="0274">Full-scale tests were carried out.

After being saturated with toluene and xylene, the activated carbon is no longer able to adsorb other VOCs or to be regenerated by immersion in water (Tables 8 and 9). On the other hand, the filter with Al-3,5-PDA does not adsorb aromatics, would preferentially adsorb formaldehyde from the formaldehyde and acetaldehyde mixture and seems to regenerate by immersion in water. The affinity of activated carbon for hydrophobic molecules such as aromatics may explain this behaviour. In addition, the adsorbed aromatics will probably tend to accentuate the hydrophobicity of the system and thus prevent the diffusion of water into the porosity, which probably prevents regeneration.</p><p id="p-0282" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00012" num="00012"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 8</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Quantities of toluene and xylene adsorbed on an activated </entry></row><row><entry>carbon filter and an AI-3.5-PDA filter, after &#x201c;full-scale&#x201d;

Host-guest interaction takes place trough the formation of a covalent bond between pyrazolate linker and formaldehyde; with a further stabilization via hydrogen bond, resulting in the formation of stable oxy-methyl species. Same type of interactions takes place in the case of the two MOFs that bear free accessible pyrazole groups within their pores, i.e. Al-3.5-PDA and DUT-67(Zr)-PZDC, and with imidazole species (ligand only, no MOF so far). Desorption energy, characterizing that type of interactions was estimated using Redhead method [42], and found to be in range of 86 kJ/mol, offering a sufficient stability to provide low release of formaldehyde under humid air. This is a significant improving step as compared to amino-aromatic metal carboxylate MOFs such as UiO-66(Zr)&#x2014;NH<sub>2</sub>/MIL-125(Ti)&#x2014;NH<sub>2</sub>/MIL-101(Cr)-ED, which tend to release some formaldehyde at close-to ambient temperatures due to the formation of some instable adsorbed species, and in the case of MIL-101(Cr)-ED, to be degraded by moisture.</p><p id="p-0287" num="0281">Moreover, it is also shown that the material can be regenerated at room temperature in aqueous phase, due to the complete reversibility of the interaction in the presence of liquid water while maintaining the MOF structure and active sites.</p><p id="p-0288" num="0282">7.2 Spectroscopic Characterization</p><p id="p-0289" num="0283">Samples were pressed (10<sup>2 </sup>MPa) into self-supported disks (2 cm<sup>2 </sup>area) and placed in a quartz homemade in-situ cell equipped with KBr windows for FTIR measurements during formaldehyde adsorption.

MIL-140A, MIL-140B and ZIF-8 hydrophobic MOFs exhibit relatively low adsorption capacities, with spontaneous CO<sub>2 </sub>leaks, which also indicates a higher affinity for water compared to CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0327" num="0321">Basolite F-300/Fe-BTC exhibits the best maximum amount of adsorbed CO<sub>2</sub>, however the shape of the breakthrough curve does not exhibit a leak-free domain, and is quite flatted, indicating an unfavorable or linear isotherm, or else kinetic limitations in the presence of 50% relative humidity. Several studies have focused on the description of the adsorption of water and CO<sub>2 </sub>on a variety of adsorbents. The binary CO<sub>2</sub>-water adsorption data available in the literature show very different behavior; for diluted systems, the presence of a low amount of moisture improves CO<sub>2 </sub>sorption at low partial pressures, but in the presence of higher CO<sub>2 </sub>and water concentrations, it has been shown that the water inhibits the adsorption of CO<sub>2</sub>, the second case being consistent with our experimental results.</p><p id="p-0328" num="0322">Thus, the above analyses demonstrate that the presence of CO<sub>2 </sub>during the filtration of indoor air with a relative humidity of 50% does not affect the adsorption/filtration of target VOCs such as formaldehyde in the case of MOFs suitable for that application. This contrasts sharply with traditional amine grafted porous solids that have been shown to capture well formaldehyde from air but also CO<sub>2</sub>, thus highlighting a strong competition between CO<sub>2 </sub>and formaldehyde adsorption.</p><p id="p-0329" num="0323">i) Co-Adsorption of CO<sub>2 </sub>and Formaldehyde on Al-3.5-PDA</p><p id="p-0330" num="0324">Co-adsorption of CO<sub>2 </sub>and formaldehyde on Al-3.5-PDA sample was performed as follows: (i) the material was saturated with gaseous CO<sub>2 </sub>at an equilibrium pressure of 5 mbar, (ii) formaldehyde was progressively send into the in situ cell [<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b><i>a</i></figref>)<i>b</i>)] (iii) after reaching formaldehyde saturation (full consumption of Br&#xf8;nsted acid sites) the in situ cell was let under vacuum to remove gas phase and (iv) finally some gaseous CO<sub>2 </sub>at an equilibrium pressure of 5 mbar was sanded again.</p><p id="p-0331" num="0325">Briefly, based on spectroscopic data [<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>] chemisorption of formaldehyde causes desorption of physisorbed CO<sub>2 </sub>(see decrease of the v<sub>s</sub>(CO<sub>2</sub>) band at 2340 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>[<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b><i>b</i></figref>)] with the progressive increase of all characteristic bands of oxy methyl groups [<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b><i>a</i></figref>)).
