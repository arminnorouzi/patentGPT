Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Currently, the average American generates about four and a half pounds of waste each day. From that amount, about one and a half pounds can be recycled. However, only nine percent of that waste is actually recycled. The vast majority of disposed products are often left to accumulate in landfills and/or slough off in the natural environment as litter. This increase in pollution occurs because most recycled items become contaminated when items are placed in the wrong bin and/or when a dirty food container gets unusable and are thus discarded into landfills or oceans.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Most recycle bins rely on a person to dispose of items that are known to be recyclable in the proper bin. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the waste is properly separated.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, there is a need for a recycling identification container that identifies and separates waste for proper disposal.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present general inventive concept provides a recycling identification container.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Additional features and utilities of the present general inventive concept will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the general inventive concept.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The foregoing and/or other features and utilities of the present general inventive concept may be achieved by providing a recycling identification container, including a main body, including a first section to store at least one trash item therein, a second section connected to the first section to store at least one recycle item therein, and a divider disposed between at least a portion of the first section and the second section to separate the first section from the second section, a cover unit removably connected to at least a portion of a first end of the main body to cover an interior of the main body, and an identification scanner disposed on and within at least a portion of the main body to scan properties of at least one item based on a predetermined algorithm to determine whether the at least one item is at least one of the at least one recycle item and the at least one trash item.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The main body may further include a first barrier movably disposed on at least a portion of a first end of the first section to move from closed over the first section in a first position to at least partially opened within the first section in a second position, and move from opened within the first section in the second position to closed over the first section in the first position, and a second barrier movably disposed on at least a portion of a first end of the second section to move from closed over the second section in a first position to at least partially opened within the second section in a second position, and move from opened within the second section in the second position to closed over the second section in the first position.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The cover unit may include a cover body, and a cover barrier movably disposed on at least a portion of the cover body to move from closed over an interior of the cover body in a first position to at least partially opened within the interior of the cover body in a second position, and move from opened within the interior of the cover body in the second position to closed over the interior of the cover body in the first position.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The cover unit may further include a sensor disposed within at least a portion of the cover barrier to detect movement, such that the cover barrier moves in response to the sensor detecting the movement.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The sensor may prevent the cover barrier from moving until after the identification scanner completes identifying the at least one item.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The cover barrier may display the at least one item is at least one of the at least one recycle item and the at least one trash item in response to the identification scanner completing identification of the at least one item.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The recycling identification container may further include a compactor assembly removably connected to at least a portion of a base of the first section and the second section on a second end of the main body opposite with respect to the first end to compress the at least one recycle item therein received from the second section.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The main body may further include a compactor barrier movably disposed on at least a portion of the second section to move from closed over the compactor assembly in a first position to at least partially opened within the compactor assembly in a second position, and move from opened within the compactor assembly in the second position to closed over the compactor assembly in the first position.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The compactor barrier may open in response to detecting a predetermined weight on the compactor barrier within the second section.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"
