A pixel region refers to a region corresponding to a smallest light-emitting unit (i.e., the sub-pixel) and includes a light-emitting zone and a shading zone surrounding the light-emitting zone. In processes of manufacturing the display panel, the repeat region of the mask is aligned with the pixel region of a substrate to achieve to align the mask with the substrate.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic view of an effect of a mask in the prior art. A shading zone of the mask is disposed on a middle of a pixel region. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a row width of a single sub-pixel in a 65-inch display panel with 8K resolution is 52 &#x3bc;m, and a row width of the pixel region of the mask <b>1</b> corresponding to the 65-inch display panel with the 8K resolution is also 52 &#x3bc;m; a row width of a single sub-pixel in a 85-inch display panel with 8K resolution is 72 &#x3bc;m, and a row width of the pixel region of the mask <b>2</b> corresponding to the 85-inch display panel with the 8K resolution is also 72 &#x3bc;m. If the masks with the same size are employed, when a row width of a shading zone is 28 &#x3bc;m, a row width of a single light-transmitting zone of the mask <b>1</b> is 12 &#x3bc;m, and a row width of a single light-transmitting zone of the mask <b>2</b> is 22 &#x3bc;m. During a photolithography process, the light-transmitting zones form slits, and light is diffracted through the slits. Based on a principle of light diffraction, the smaller the slits are, the wider a diffraction range of the light is.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Since the black matrix is a negative photoresist, an area which is not exposed to the light is etched to form an opening.

However, since the row width of the light-emitting zone of the single sub-pixel of the 65-inch display panel with the 8K resolution is different from the row width of the light-emitting zone of the single sub-pixel of the 85-inch display panel with the 8K resolution, the masks with different size requires to be used when an RGB color filter layer is subsequently formed.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Therefore, the conventional 8K electronic equipment at least has a technical problem that the masks with the different sizes requires to be manufactured for the display panels with the different sizes, which requires to be improved.
