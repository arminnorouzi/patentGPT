level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">An electromagnetic relay fills an arc-extinguishing gas in a sealed space. Therefore, the electromagnetic relay requires both a process of adjusting a gap for turning on and off a circuit and a process of forming the sealed space. In the above aspects, or in other aspects not mentioned, there is a need for further improvements in an electromagnetic relay and a method of manufacturing the same.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An electromagnetic relay disclosed in this specification has the following configurations. A drive unit includes a magnetizing coil which forms a magnetic field by energization, a fixed core which is placed on a side of an inner diameter of the magnetizing coil, a yoke which accommodates the magnetizing coil and the fixed core, a movable core which is movable relative to the fixed core, a shaft which is able to reciprocate in an axial direction and is fixed to the movable core and a return spring which urges the movable core in a direction away from the fixed core. A relay unit includes a frame made of an insulating material, a fixed terminal fixed to the frame, a movable element which is provided on a side opposite to the movable core with respect to the fixed terminal and is movable relative to the fixed terminal, and a contact pressure spring which urges the movable element to a side to the fixed terminal. A press-fit fixing portion which fixes the drive unit and the relay unit by press-fitting a claw portion provided on one of the yoke or the frame and a recess portion provided on the other one. A sealing member in a plate-shape is provided outside the relay unit and the drive unit. The external connection terminal is fixed to the sealing member while being inserted through a hole of the sealing member, and is joined to the fixed terminal. The inner cover is joined to the sealing member in a state in which the drive unit and the relay unit are accommodated therein, and forms a sealed space for sealing the arc-extinguishing gas inside together with the sealing member.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The electromagnetic relay is configured to be able to adjust a gap between the end of the shaft and the movable element and be able to adjust a press-fitting amount between the claw portion and the recess portion, by bringing them into a state where the movable contact of the movable element and the fixed contact of the fixed terminal come into contact with each other, and the movable component and the fixed core come into contact with each other, in a state before attaching the sealing member and the inner cover. The movable component means any of a shaft, a movable core, and a component that moves integrally with them.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to this, in the manufacturing process, the electromagnetic relay enables to adjust the gap formed between the end of the shaft and the movable element when the magnetizing coil is energized, at a state before assembling the sealing member and the inner cover to an intermediate product in which the drive unit and the relay unit are combined. Then, after adjusting the gap, the external connection terminal fixed to the sealing member and the fixed terminal are joined, the sealing member and the inner cover are joined, and the arc extinguishing gas is injected into the closed space formed by the sealing member and the inner cover. Therefore, since a potential process which may act stress on the drive unit or the relay unit after adjusting the gap between the end of the shaft and the movable element is only a joining process for the external connection terminal and the fixed terminal, it is possible to suppress changing of the gap. Therefore, the electromagnetic relay <b>1</b> is possible to reduce differences of the gap Gs for each product in a configuration in which the drive unit <b>10</b> and the relay unit <b>20</b> are accommodated in the closed space in which the arc extinguishing gas is sealed.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the case that an insulating member such as a ceramic insulator is fixed to an end of the shaft on a side to the movable element, the end of the shaft means the end of the insulating member.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The method of manufacturing an electromagnetic relay disclosed in this specification includes the following steps. First, it prepares a drive unit in which a magnetizing coil which forms a magnetic field by energization, a fixed core which is placed on a side of an inner diameter of the magnetizing coil, a yoke which accommodates the magnetizing coil and the fixed core, a movable core which is movable relative to the fixed core, a shaft which is able to reciprocate in an axial direction and is fixed to the movable core and a return spring which urges the movable core in a direction away from the fixed core are assembled. It prepares a relay unit in which a frame made of an insulating material, a fixed terminal fixed to the frame, a movable element which is provided on a side opposite to the movable core with respect to the fixed terminal and is movable relative to the fixed terminal, and a contact pressure spring which urges the movable element to a side to the fixed terminal are assembled. It fixes the drive unit and the relay unit by adjusting a press-fitting amount of the claw portion provided on one of the yoke or the frame and the recess portion provided on the other side so that a gap between the end of the shaft and the movable element is adjusted to have a predetermined size in a state where the movable contact included in the movable element and the fixed contact included in the fixed terminal are brought into contact with each other and the movable component and the fixed core are brought into contact with each other. It fixes the sealing member and the external connection terminal in a state where the external connection terminal is inserted through a hole of the sealing member in a plate shape. It joins the external connection terminal and the fixed terminal while arranging the sealing member to which the external connection terminal is fixed on an outside of the relay unit and the drive unit. It forms a sealed space inside an inner cover and the sealing member by joining the inner cover in which the drive unit and the relay unit are accommodated therein and the sealing member. It seals an arc-extinguishing gas in the sealed space formed inside the inner cover and the sealing member.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to this, the gap between the end of the shaft and the movable element is adjusted when the drive unit and the relay unit are fixed by press-fitting the claw portion provided on one of the yoke or the frame and the recess portion provided on the other side. The electromagnetic relay, which accommodates the drive unit and the relay unit in the closed space, is formed by joining the external connection terminal fixed to the sealing member and the fixed terminal, and joining the sealing member and the inner cover, after the above process. Therefore, since a process which may apply stress on the drive unit or the relay unit after adjusting the gap is only a joining process for the external connection terminal and the fixed terminal, it is possible to suppress changing of the gap. Therefore, this method of manufacturing an electromagnetic relay is possible to reduce differences of the gap Gs for each product in a configuration in which the drive unit and the relay unit are accommodated in the closed space in which the arc extinguishing gas is sealed.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A reference numeral in parentheses attached to each component or the like indicates an

element and fixed terminals and a drive unit which drives the movable element of the relay unit are accommodated in a closed space sealed with an arc extinguishing gas such as hydrogen.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The closed type electromagnetic relay described in JPH09-259728A has a configuration in which a gap is formed between a movable element of the relay unit and an end of a shaft when the magnetizing coil of the drive unit is energized. The gap works to make the end of the shaft come into contact with the movable element after increasing a kinetic energy of the shaft in response to turning off of an energization of the magnetizing coil of the drive unit. As a result, a speed separating the movable contact of the movable element from the fixed contact of the fixed terminal, i.e., hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;separating speed&#x201d; increases, and a current cutoff performance is improved. The electromagnetic relay described in Patent Literature 1 has a configuration in which a size of the gap is adjusted by a screw mechanism provided on the movable core and the shaft of the drive unit. In addition, this electromagnetic relay has a configuration in which a sealed space for sealing the arc extinguishing gas is formed by joining a sealing container which accommodates the fixed terminals and the movable element, a bottomed cylindrical portion which accommodates the fixed core and the movable core, and a plurality of joining members arranged between the sealing container and the bottomed cylindrical portion.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">However, in the manufacturing process, the electromagnetic relay described in JPH09-259728A requires a process for joining the plurality of members for forming the closed space by, e.g., welding process after adjusting the gap between the end of the shaft and the movable element by the screw mechanism. Therefore, in the case that heat of the welding process is conducted to the drive unit or the relay unit, the gap may vary for each product.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">It is an object of this disclosure in this specification, in view of the above points, to provide an electromagnetic relay and a method for manufacturing the electromagnetic relay which is capable of reducing differences of gaps formed between an end of a shaft and a movable element when a magnetizing coil is energized in a configuration in which a drive unit and a relay unit are accommodated in a sealed space in which an arc extinguishing gas is sealed.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Embodiments of the present disclosure are described herein with reference to the drawings.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0042" num="0041">A first embodiment is described below.

Therefore, the first fixed terminal <b>221</b> and the second fixed terminal <b>222</b> are electrically separated, and the electromagnetic relay <b>1</b> is turned in an off state.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, when the electromagnetic relay <b>1</b> is turned on, the magnetizing coil <b>11</b> is energized.

Then, as the movable core <b>14</b> moves, the shaft <b>15</b> and the ceramic insulator <b>18</b> fixed to the end thereof also move to a side to the fixed core <b>12</b>. Therefore, due to the elastic force of the contact pressure spring <b>24</b>, the movable element <b>23</b> moves to a side to the fixed terminal <b>22</b>, the first movable contact <b>281</b> and the first fixed contact <b>271</b> come into contact with each other, and the second movable contact <b>282</b> and the second fixed contact <b>272</b> come into contact with each other.
