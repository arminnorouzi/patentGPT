Furthermore, a computer program product and a computer-readable storage medium are also provided herein. In particular, embodiments herein relate to handling a communication session.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In a typical wireless communication network, user equipment (UE), also known as wireless communication devices, mobile stations, stations (STA) and/or wireless devices, communicate via a Radio Access Network (RAN) to one or more core networks belonging to different network operators. The RAN covers a geographical area which is divided into areas or cell areas, with each area or cell area being served by a radio network node, e.g., a Wi-Fi access point or a Radio Base Station (RBS), which in some networks may also be called, for example, a NodeB, eNodeB or a gNodeB. The area or cell area is a geographical area where radio coverage is provided by the radio network node. The radio network node communicates over an air interface operating on radio frequencies with the UE within range of the radio network node.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) is a third generation telecommunication network, which evolved from the second generation (2G) Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). The UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) is essentially a RAN using Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) and/or High Speed Packet Access (HSPA) for user equipment. In a forum known as the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), telecommunications suppliers propose and agree upon standards for third generation networks and UTRAN specifically, and investigate enhanced data rate and radio capacity. In some RANs, e.g. as in UMTS, several radio network nodes may be connected, e.g., by landlines or microwave, to a controller node, such as a Radio Network Controller (RNC) or a Base Station Controller (BSC), which supervises and coordinates various activities of the plural radio network nodes connected thereto. The RNCs are typically connected to one or more core networks.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Specifications for the Evolved Packet System (EPS) have been completed within the 3GPP and this work continues in the coming 3GPP releases. The EPS comprises the Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN), also known as the Long Term Evolution (LTE) radio access network, and the Evolved Packet Core (EPC), also known as System Architecture Evolution (SAE) core network. E-UTRAN/LTE is a variant of a 3GPP radio access technology wherein the radio network nodes are directly connected to the EPC core network rather than to RNCs. In general, in E-UTRAN/LTE the functions of an RNC are distributed between the radio network nodes, e.g. eNodeBs in LTE, and the core network. As such, the RAN of an EPS has an essentially &#x201c;flat&#x201d; architecture comprising radio network nodes connected directly to one or more core networks, i.e. they are not connected to RNCs.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">With the emerging 5G technologies such as New Radio (NR), the use of very many transmit- and receive-antenna elements is of great interest as it makes it possible to utilize beamforming, such as transmit-side and receive-side beamforming. Transmit-side beamforming means that the transmitter can amplify the transmitted signals in a selected direction or directions, while suppressing the transmitted signals in other directions. Similarly, on the receive-side, a receiver can amplify signals from a selected direction or directions, while suppressing unwanted signals from other directions.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Today there is a tight coupling between services a customer of a user equipment (UE) can use and the operator serving the UE. In the web domain, usage of offered services is more flexible, i.e. the services are not tied to specific suppliers. Prior-art solutions are based on a strict service level agreement (SLA) between the operator and the customer. This means that the customer may only be able to use services that are part of a subscription of the customer. It also means that if one party of a communication has a richer set of services, it will not make any difference to the communication between two parties as long as the other party has a more limited set of services. The service execution possibility is based on a least common denominator principle, which means that if a user A has a video communication service as part of the subscription, but a user B has not, video communication will not work between the users, even if it is supported by user B's communication network.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An object of embodiments herein is to provide a mechanism that handles communication in a more efficient manner.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an aspect the object is achieved by providing a method performed by a first network node for handling a communication session.

The SDP is a descriptor indicating media type, e.g. a format for describing streaming media communications parameters and is used for describing multimedia communication sessions for the purposes of session announcement, session invitation, and parameter negotiation. The SDP does not deliver any media by itself but is used between endpoints for negotiation of media type, format, and/or associated properties. The communication session request may further comprise a capability indicator. The capability indicator enables specific call routing and increases probability that the data channel-enabled call ends up in a data channel-capable device, in case the terminating wireless device, e.g. second wireless device <b>14</b>, has several wireless devices associated with the same number. The capability indicator may comprise data regarding capability of the first wireless device <b>10</b> such as general support of a IMS data channel logic. The communication session request may further comprise an application identifier for identifying an application (i.e. the service) of the second wireless device <b>14</b> to be associated with the established IMS data channel. The application identifier enables the first network node <b>12</b> and the second wireless device <b>14</b> to understand what services are supported.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0043">Action <b>302</b>. The first network node <b>12</b> then sets up the data channel between the first network node <b>12</b> and the second wireless device <b>14</b>. This may be based on the received information from the different wireless devices during communication setup. The setup of the data channel, i.e. the establishment and characteristics for the data channel, may be negotiated according an offer/answer model, using SDP, which may include a media-type m-line to specify use of a WebRTC data channel, connection points c-line, and attribute a-lines to outline any detailed characteristics.
