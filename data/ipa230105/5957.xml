The memory cell array includes, for example, word lines stacked on a source layer, a channel body extending through the word lines, and a memory cell provided between each word line and the channel body. Moreover, for example, an interconnection layer including a source line and a bit line is provided on a side of the word lines opposite to a source layer. Then, the channel body is electrically connected to the source layer and the bit line. In addition, the source layer is electrically connected to the source line by a conductive body provided through the word lines. Thus, a NAND string that includes memory cells is provided along the channel body.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">In a manufacturing process of the memory cell array, a memory film and a channel body are formed in a memory hole that extends through the word lines to the source layer. The memory film includes a charge storage portion between the word line and the cannel body, which serves as the memory cell. The memory film is also an insulation film which electrically insulates the word line and the channel body, and thus, a process of selectively removing the memory film at the bottom of the memory hole is necessary to electrically connect the channel body and the source layer. In some cases, the channel body and the source layer are formed together, and the source layer that is formed under the word lines is covered with the memory film. In such a case, a process of selectively removing the memory film is also required to electrically connect the source layer and the source interconnection via the conductive body. Such a process may become more difficult as the miniaturization of the memory cell array progresses. That is, a process margin for selectively removing the memory film becomes smaller, and the small margin may generate unintentional over-etching in other portions. Hence, a non-volatile memory device and a manufacturing method thereof are required, which provides a large process margin for selectively removing the memory film.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view showing a non-volatile memory device according to a first embodiment;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic view showing another cross section of the non-volatile memory device according to the first embodiment;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A to <b>11</b></figref> are schematic cross-sectional views showing a manufacturing process of the non-volatile memory device according to the first embodiment;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> to <b>16</b></figref> are schematic cross-sectional views showing a manufacturing process of a non-volatile memory device according to a variation of the first embodiment; and</p><p id="p-0011" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b> to <b>21</b></figref> are schematic cross-sectional views showing a manufacturing process of a non-volatile memory device according to a second embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0010">According to an embodiment, a non-volatile memory device includes a first conductive layer, electrodes, an interconnection layer and at least one semiconductor layer.

Then, the tungsten film is etched by using a dry etching method to remove a portion provided on the insulation film <b>29</b>, leaving a portion thereof embedded in the slit <b>121</b>. Thus, the metal film <b>150</b> is formed in the slit <b>121</b>. In addition, the metal film <b>150</b> may have a two-layer structure which includes a barrier metal layer of a titanium nitride (TiN), for example, and tungsten layer, wherein the barrier layer is in contact with the inner surface of the slit <b>121</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">Then, the interconnection layer <b>50</b> is formed on the insulation film <b>29</b> to complete the non-volatile memory device <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057">The semiconductor film <b>130</b> has a first part, a second part and a third part. The first part of the semiconductor film <b>130</b> is embedded in the memory hole <b>123</b>, and serves as the channel body <b>30</b>. The second part of the semiconductor film <b>130</b> is embedded in the space <b>103</b><i>x </i>formed by removing the sacrificial layer <b>103</b>, and serves as the source layer <b>10</b>. The third part of the semiconductor film <b>130</b> is embedded in the slit <b>105</b>, and serves as a first portion <b>61</b> of the conductive body <b>60</b>. The metal film <b>150</b> embedded in the slit <b>121</b> is a second portion <b>63</b> of the conductive body <b>60</b>. A silicided portion <b>130</b><i>s </i>may be preferably interposed between the first portion and the second portion <b>63</b> to reduce a contact resistance therebetween.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">In the embodiment, the first portion <b>61</b> of the conductive body <b>60</b> is in contact with the source layer <b>10</b>, and enlarges the process margin for removing the memory film <b>40</b> as follows. Thus, it may become possible to improve a manufacturing yield by suppressing, for example, an open failure between the source layer <b>10</b> and the source line <b>53</b> or a short circuit failure between the control gate <b>20</b> and the source line <b>53</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059">In the process step shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the first portion <b>61</b> is formed by etching the memory film <b>40</b>, the semiconductor film <b>130</b>, and the core <b>140</b>. In this step, the first portion <b>61</b> is formed with variation in the upper end position thereof due to unevenness of an etching amount, and such a variation may reduce the process margin. For example, an upper end of the first portion <b>61</b> is set downward by over-etching the semiconductor film <b>130</b>. Further, while removing the memory film <b>40</b> that covers an inner surface of the slit <b>121</b>, the insulation film <b>23</b> may also be etched, and an upper surface of the insulation film <b>23</b> is set downward between the back gate layer <b>17</b> and the selection gate <b>70</b>, facilitating the over-etching of the semiconductor film <b>130</b>. As a result, the upper end position of the first portion <b>61</b> is varied depending on the etching condition.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">The upper end of the first portion <b>61</b> is preferably positioned at a level between the back gate layer <b>17</b> and the selection gate <b>70</b> in the Z-direction, for example. Thus, a thickness of the insulation film <b>23</b> in the Z-direction may be set to absorb the variation width of the upper end position of the first portion <b>61</b>. Thereby, it becomes possible to enlarge the process margin for etching the memory film <b>40</b>, the semiconductor film <b>130</b> and the core <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">Then, a method of manufacturing the non-volatile memory device <b>1</b> according to a variation of the first embodiment will be described referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> to <b>16</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> to <b>16</b></figref> are a schematic cross-sectional views which show another method for manufacturing the non-volatile memory device <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">For example, after etching the memory film <b>40</b>, the semiconductor film <b>130</b>, and the core <b>140</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, an insulation film <b>125</b> is formed to cover the inner surface of the slit <b>121</b> and the insulation film <b>29</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">The insulation film <b>125</b> is, for example, a silicon oxide film formed using a plasma CVD method.
