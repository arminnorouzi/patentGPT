Normally, the free radicals in body have a small generation amount and can be removed in time by an antioxidant system. However, when the body receives strong external stimulation, such as microorganism invasion, disease, stay up, environmental pollutant stimulation, ultraviolet irradiation, ionizing radiation, etc., the free radicals cannot be removed in time and the body can be attacked by the free radicals to generate oxidative damage.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Based on the above phenomena, it is necessary to reasonably utilize an exogenous superoxide dismutase (SOD) at a proper time to block the invasion of the free radicals to human body, which is very important for maintaining health. However, there are four major bottleneck problems in a use aspect of the superoxide dismutase at present: firstly, the superoxide dismutase does not have enough high activity and cannot be added as a terminal product; secondly, the superoxide dismutase does not have good stability and the activity of the superoxide dismutase is certain when just added into the terminal product, gradually reduced along with the time lapse of links such as storage, transportation and the like, and free of activity when reaching hands of consumers; thirdly, the superoxide dismutase cannot be supplied in a manner of liquid, all provided in a freeze-dried powder form at present on the market, and is extremely inconvenient for quantitative redissolution in a use process; and fourthly, the superoxide dismutase is a biological macromolecule, has subunits with molecular weight of 20,000 or more, does not have good cell permeability, and is not easily absorbed by cells and used for removing superoxide free radicals in the cells.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, there is a need to overcome the above disadvantages.

The cell membrane is composed of a bilayer of phospholipids, such that non-fat-soluble substances, polypeptides and protein biological macromolecules cannot enter the cell freely. Due to the barrier function of the cell membrane, many medicinal biologically active macromolecules in vitro cannot enter the cell. It was analyzed that the superoxide dismutase did not have a transmembrane signal region and thus had extremely low transmembrane capability; the present disclosure needed to develop a superoxide dismutase with a transmembrane capability.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0094">Recently, it is found that a class of short peptides, namely CPPs, are capable of spontaneously crossing the cell membranes and carrying biological macromolecules into cells, and have a relatively strong transmembrane capability; the CPPs are a class of short peptides composed of tens of amino acids, can deliver biologically active substances into cells to exert biological activity and produce therapeutic effects, do not cause permanent damage to cell membranes, and are non-irritating, such that the CPPs are used as a highly favored new drug delivery vehicle. A CPP sequence YGRKKRRQRRR (SEQ ID NO: 10), that was a trans-activating transcriptional activator, with a transmembrane capability on an HIV-1 peptide segment was coupled with the superoxide dismutase for expression to enable the superoxide dismutase to have the transmembrane capability.

After the sun exposure, the mice in the repair group were quickly applied with 200 &#x3bc;l of the superoxide dismutase with the activity of 300 U/mL, while the mice in the control group were not applied with the product. After the operation was repeated for 3 days, the solar dermatitis occurred in the control group, while the skin of the mice in the repair group had no abnormalities. It could be seen that the product could effectively repair the solar dermatitis caused by the ultraviolet radiation.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-sequence-list-doc id="SEQLST-1"><sequence-list file="US20230002818A1-20230105-S00001.XML" carriers="internal-electronic" seq-file-type="ST.25"/></us-sequence-list-doc><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
