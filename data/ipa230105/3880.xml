In order to measure and analyze the vibrations of objects, previous methods have involved either installing a meter on the object to be measured or detecting ultrasonic sound waves emitted from the object that are otherwise unheard (e.g., due to ultrasonic waves being outside the audible domain).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">On-object meters are often implemented using accelerometers, which detect gravitational forces (e.g., redistribution of weight, shock, falling, etc.). These on-object meters must be mounted on the device to be measured, because the accelerometer detects gravitational forces as applied to the accelerometer (e.g., if the object moves, the accelerometer will only move, and thus report such movement, if it is attached to the object). Because such meters need to be mounted on objects to measure the same, the meters are subject to substantial wear, varying temperatures, contaminants, moving parts, and other volatile environments. Accordingly, such devices require frequent replacement, repair, and/or configuration.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Additionally, it is often difficult to report the measurements acquired by on-object meters, especially meters that are positioned on moving parts (e.g., a motor). Thus, the on-device meter has to wirelessly transmit data, be wired in such a way to avoid severing the wired connection, and/or be removed for such reporting purposes. Any wireless devices and/or complex wiring is also subject to the substantial wear, varying temperatures, contaminants, moving parts, and other volatile environments as the meters themselves.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The detection of ultrasonic sound waves emitted from objects often involves a probe attached to an audio producing device (e.g., headphones, speakers, etc.) to convert inaudible sound waves into audible sound. However, often the only way to receive a precise reading requires the probe to be in direct contact with the object and in the same orientation as the emitted ultrasonic waves. Further, ultrasonic sound waves emitted from the object merely provide an association between a particular audible sound with a particular operation. Such probing devices do not provide a high level of detail regarding the characteristics of a vibrating object (e.g., the converted ultrasonic sound waves do not establish a vibration frequency, displacement, phase, etc.).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Additionally, ultrasonic waves are subject to noise (e.g., interference) from other related or unrelated sound waves. Therefore, the sound converted by the probe and audio producing devices is often not even a true representation of only the ultrasonic sound waves emitted from the object. The comparison of the level of a desired signal to the level of background noise is called the signal to noise ratio (&#x201c;SNR&#x201d;) and is often expressed in decibels (e.g., dB). A high SNR (e.g., greater than 0 dB) indicates more signal than noise, while a low SNR (e.g., less than 0 dB) indicates more noise than signal. To obtain a higher SNR, filters are used to remove noise or other unwanted signals. Noise can affect the amplitude, frequency, and/or phase of a signal and specific filters are required to correct each type of unwanted artifact. When probing for sound waves emitted from objects, it is often difficult to distinguish noise from signal, and therefore, difficult to determine what filtering arrangement to use.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The example methods and apparatus of the present disclosure, in contrast, provide off-device measurement using ultrasonic transducers (e.g., transmitters, receivers, transceivers, etc.) to measure variances in the distance between the ultrasonic transducers and the object to be measured to determine vibration characteristics of the object. The example methods and apparatus generate ultrasonic waves with particular known characteristics (e.g., frequency) to measure variances in distance of an oscillating object, which provide higher levels of detail than the conversion of ultrasonic sound waves emitted from objects into the audible and/or visual domains.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref> are diagrams illustrating an example environment <b>100</b> including an example controller <b>102</b> in communication with an example ultrasonic transducer <b>104</b>. In the illustrated example, the example ultrasonic transducer <b>104</b> is a transceiver that is capable of sending and receiving ultrasonic waves. The example ultrasonic transducer <b>104</b> converts electrical signals (e.g., voltage, current, etc.) to ultrasonic waves when electrical signals are applied to a piezoelectric sensor within the example ultrasonic transducer <b>104</b>. The electrical signals cause the piezoelectric sensor to oscillate and emit ultrasonic waves. This process is reversed when the example ultrasonic transducer <b>104</b> receives ultrasonic waves. The received ultrasonic waves cause the piezoelectric sensor to oscillate and generate electrical signals. In some examples, transmission and reception of ultrasonic waves (e.g., sampling) may interfere with each other (e.g., oscillation due to transmission is still occurring when ultrasonic waves are received, oscillation due to reception is still occurring when ultrasonic waves are transmitted, etc.) The example methods and apparatus disclosed herein compensate for such interferences by transmitting phase shifted ultrasonic waves at lower frequencies when the ultrasonic transducer <b>104</b> is oscillating from a previous transmission and/or reception of ultrasonic waves. In the illustrated example, the example ultrasonic transducer <b>104</b> creates ultrasonic waves with a frequency of 400 kilohertz (&#x201c;kHz&#x201d;). Additionally and/or alternatively, ultrasonic waves having different frequencies may be used (e.g., 40 kHz, 100 kHz, etc.).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the example ultrasonic transducer <b>104</b> sends example ultrasonic waves <b>106</b> towards an example object <b>108</b> to obtain a first distance measurement of the example object <b>108</b>. The example ultrasonic waves <b>106</b> travel from the example ultrasonic transducer <b>104</b> through a medium, such as, for example, the air, towards the example object <b>108</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the example ultrasonic transducer <b>104</b> may send ultrasonic waves through other mediums, such as liquids. The example ultrasonic waves <b>106</b> reflect off the example object <b>108</b> and travel back towards the example ultrasonic transducer <b>104</b>. The example controller <b>102</b> controls when the example ultrasonic transducer <b>104</b> sends the example ultrasonic waves <b>106</b>, recognizes when the example ultrasonic transducer <b>104</b> receives an echo of the example ultrasonic waves <b>106</b> (e.g., the example ultrasonic waves <b>106</b> returning from reflecting off an object, such as the example object <b>108</b>), and determines the time between the sending and the receiving of the ultrasonic waves <b>106</b> (e.g., time of flight). The example controller <b>102</b> determines the distance between the example transducer <b>104</b> and the example object <b>108</b> based on the time of flight of the example ultrasonic waves <b>106</b> and the speed of sound (e.g., 343 meters per second (m/s)). In the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the example controller <b>102</b> determines that the example object <b>108</b> is a first distance <b>110</b> away from the example ultrasonic transducer <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the example ultrasonic transducer <b>104</b> sends example ultrasonic waves <b>112</b> towards the example object <b>108</b> to obtain a second distance measurement of the example object <b>108</b>. In the illustrated example, the example controller <b>102</b> determines that the example object <b>108</b> is a second distance <b>114</b> away from the example ultrasonic transducer <b>104</b>. The example controller <b>102</b> further determines that the second distance <b>114</b> is greater than the first distance <b>110</b> by a third distance <b>116</b>.

In such examples, the difference between the example second distance <b>114</b> and the example first distance <b>110</b> (e.g., the example third distance <b>116</b>) is the actual amplitude of the example object <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">While the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref> illustrate one ultrasonic transducer, other numbers of ultrasonic transducers, ultrasonic transmitters, and/or ultrasonic receivers may be used in replace of or in conjunction with the example ultrasonic transducer <b>104</b>.

In some examples, ultrasonic wave characteristics are affected by temperature, local atmospheric variations, air conditioning, humidity, air density, etc. The example methods and apparatus compensate for such variances. In such examples, the example controller <b>102</b> embodies or in communication with a temperature sensor to provide start and stop signals proportional to the temperature sensed.

For example, the example pulse generator <b>300</b> triggers a burst of pulses (e.g., three) that instruct the example ultrasonic transducer to send the same number of ultrasonic waves (e.g., three) towards the example object <b>108</b>. The example pulse generator <b>300</b> can trigger any number of pulses within a burst as necessary to obtain accurate readings of the example object <b>108</b>. Additionally, the example pulse generator <b>300</b> controls the frequency at which each burst of pulses is sent (e.g., the sampling frequency fs). In the illustrated example, the example pulse generator <b>300</b> samples at a frequency fs of 120 Hz. Additionally or alternatively, the example pulse generator <b>300</b> may sample at alternate frequencies (e.g., 60 Hz, 240 Hz, etc.). To detect the frequency at which an object is vibrating, the example pulse generator <b>300</b> samples at a frequency at least twice as fast as the example object <b>108</b> is suspected to be vibrating (e.g., sampling frequency of 120 Hz for an object vibrating at 60 Hz).

For example, each pulse sent by the example ultrasonic transducer <b>104</b> returns information regarding the distance of the example object <b>108</b> at a particular point in time (e.g., a sample point). The example waveform generator <b>302</b> utilizes a plurality of distance data at different sample points (e.g., points in time) to generate a waveform representing the vibration of the example object <b>108</b>. According to Fourier series, the example waveform generator <b>302</b> can define the waveform as a summation of sine and/or cosine waves, which simplifies analysis of the waveform. In some examples, storing all data corresponding to each sample point may lead to memory overflow, overwriting data, loss of data, or other consequences. Therefore, the example waveform generator <b>302</b> generates the waveform based on successive uniform sampling of the data acquired by the example ultrasonic transducer <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Example waveforms that the example waveform generator <b>302</b> creates include waveforms in the sample domain (e.g., distance (y-axis) measured by each pulse (x-axis)), the frequency domain (e.g., normalized amplitude (y-axis) by frequency (x-axis) (e.g., fast Fourier transform of the sample domain)), phase domain (e.g., phase (y-axis) by time (x-axis)), or the time domain (e.g., distance (y-axis) by time (x-axis), velocity (y-axis) by time (x-axis), acceleration (y-axis) by time (x-axis), etc.). Initially, the example waveform generator <b>302</b> creates a vibration displacement waveform in the sample domain (e.g., distance (x-axis) by each pulse (x-axis)).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The highest frequency waveform that the example waveform generator <b>302</b> can create is based the Nyquist frequency. The Nyquist frequency is half of the sampling frequency fs in a discrete signal processing system. To reconstruct an original waveform with a frequency f the Nyquist frequency (e.g., fs/2) has to be greater than the absolute value of the waveform frequency f (e.g., fs/2&#x3e;|f|). Otherwise, an alias waveform will be created instead of the original waveform. Aliasing is to be avoided, as incorrect vibration characteristics may be recorded if an alias waveform is constructed instead of the original waveform.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The example filter <b>304</b> receives the created waveform from the example waveform generator <b>302</b>. In the illustrated example, the example filter <b>304</b> applies one or more filters to the created waveform to resolve ultrasonic signals from noise. In some examples, the example filter <b>304</b> applies a bandpass filter to the generated waveform to keep certain frequencies (e.g., within a passband) and exclude other frequencies. An example bandpass filter is a resistor-inductor-capacitor (RLC) circuit. Alternatively, combining a high pass filter (e.g., a capacitor connected to a load and a resister in parallel) to exclude low frequencies and a low pass filter (e.g., a resister connected to a load and capacitor in parallel) to exclude high frequencies achieves the same result of a bandpass filter. For example, a bandpass filter centered at 400 kHz applied to the created waveform would keep data related to the example ultrasonic transducer <b>104</b>, which operates at 400 kHz, while removing other frequencies, such as 4 kHz, which may be background noise that would otherwise disrupt data from the example ultrasonic transducer <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some examples, the example filter <b>304</b> applies a Hilbert transform FIR filter to the generated waveform to shift the phase of the generated waveform.

In the illustrated example, the example filter <b>304</b> distinguishes the original waveform from aliases by applying both a bandpass filter and a Hilbert transform FIR filter to modulate the amplitude and phase of the signal received by the example ultrasonic transducer <b>104</b>.

To envelope the generated waveform, the example waveform analyzer <b>306</b> inputs the bandpass filtered waveform through an envelope detector circuit (e.g., a diode connected to a capacitor, a resistor, and a load in parallel). The envelope effectively outlines at least one of an upper or lower bound of the waveform to generalize the amplitude of the waveform. As discussed herein, the example methods and apparatus utilize an upper bounded envelope, however, the example disclosed methods and apparatus may alternatively use a lower bounded envelope without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The waveform analyzer <b>306</b> determines a first time wherein the enveloped amplitude is greater than half of the maximum enveloped amplitude. The waveform analyzer <b>306</b> further identifies a plurality of sample points (e.g., <b>10</b>) of the waveform that surround the first time. The waveform analyzer <b>306</b> performs linear regression on the plurality of sample points (e.g., determining the best fitting line amongst the plurality of sample points) in the phase domain (e.g., phase by time) and identifies a zero crossing nearest to the first time. From the nearest zero crossing, the example waveform analyzer <b>306</b> identifies the portion of the waveform to analyze for accurate distance measurement of the example object <b>108</b>. In the illustrated example, the example waveform analyzer <b>306</b> identifies displacement of the example object <b>108</b> with 100 micrometer (e.g., &#x3bc;m) precision.
