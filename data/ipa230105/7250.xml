Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">AOMedia Video 1 (AV1) is an open video coding format designed for video transmissions over the Internet and was developed as a successor to VP9 by the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia), a consortium founded in 2015 that includes semiconductor firms, video on demand providers, video content producers, software development companies and web browser vendors. Many of the components of the AV1 project were sourced from previous research efforts by Alliance members. Individual contributors started experimental technology platforms years before: Xiph's/Mozilla's Daala already published code in 2010, Google's experimental VP9 evolution project VP10 was announced on Sep. 12, 2014, and Cisco's Thor was published on Aug. 11, 2015. Building on the codebase of VP9, AV1 incorporates additional techniques, several of which were developed in these experimental formats. The first version 0.1.0 of the AV1 reference codec was published on Apr. 7, 2016. The Alliance announced the release of the AV1 bitstream specification on Mar. 28, 2018, along with a reference, software-based encoder and decoder. On Jun. 25, 2018, a validated version 1.0.0 of the specification was released, and on Jan. 8, 2019 a validated version 1.0.0 with Errata <b>1</b> of the specification was released. The AV1 bitstream specification includes a reference video codec.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> represents a simplified block diagram <b>1000</b> of aspects of block partitioning with VP9 which uses a 4-way partition tree starting from the 64&#xd7;64 level at block <b>1002</b> of block <b>1001</b> down to a 4&#xd7;4 level, with some additional restrictions for blocks 8&#xd7;8 and below at level <b>1003</b>. Note that partitions designated as R may be referred to as recursive in that a same partition tree may be repeated at a lower scale until reaching a lowest 4&#xd7;4 level according to exemplary embodiments.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref> represents a simplified block diagram <b>1010</b> of aspects of block partitioning with AV1 which not only expands such partition-tree to a 10-way structure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref> at level <b>1004</b>, but also increases a largest size (referred to as superblock in VP9/AV1 parlance) to start from 128&#xd7;128 at block <b>1021</b> of block <b>1020</b>. Note that levels <b>1004</b> include 4:1/1:4 rectangular partitions that did not exist in VP9 as described above, and none of the rectangular partitions can be further subdivided according to exemplary embodiments. In addition, AV1 adds more flexibility to the use of partitions below an 8&#xd7;8 level, as, for example, in a sense that 2&#xd7;2 chroma inter prediction becomes possible thereby on certain cases.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to embodiments with HEVC, a coding tree unit (CTU) is split into coding units (CUs) by using a quadtree structure denoted as coding tree to adapt to various local characteristics. The decision on whether to code a picture area using inter-picture (temporal) or intra-picture (spatial) prediction is made at the CU level. Each CU can be further split into one, two or four prediction units (PUs) according to the PU splitting type. Inside one PU, the same prediction process is applied and the relevant information is transmitted to the decoder on a PU basis. After obtaining the residual block by applying the prediction process based on the PU splitting type, a CU can be partitioned into transform units (TUs) according to another quadtree structure like the coding tree for the CU. One of key features of the HEVC structure is that it has the multiple partition conceptions including CU, PU, and TU. In HEVC, a CU or a TU can only be square shape, while a PU may be square or rectangular shape for an inter predicted block. In HEVC, one coding block may be further split into four square sub-blocks, and transform is performed on each sub-block, i.e., TU. Each TU can be further split recursively (using quadtree split) into smaller TUs, which is called Residual Quad-Tree (RQT).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">At picture boundary, HEVC employs implicit quad-tree split so that a block will keep quad-tree splitting until the size fits the picture boundary.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref> represents a simplified block diagram <b>1100</b> VVC with respect to a Multi-type-tree (MTT) structure <b>1101</b> that is included, which is a combination of the illustrated a quadtree (QT) with nested binary trees (BT) and triple-/ternary trees (TT). A CTU or CU is first partitioned recursively by a QT into square shaped blocks. Each QT leaf may then be further partitioned by a BT or TT, where BT and TT splits can be applied recursively and interleaved but no further QT partitioning can be applied. In all relevant proposals, the TT splits a rectangular block vertically or horizontally into three blocks using a 1:2:1 ratio (thus avoiding non-power-of-two widths and heights). For partition emulation prevention, additional split constraints are typically imposed on the MTT, as shown in the simplified diagram <b>1102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>, QT-BT-TT block partitioning in VVC, with respect to blocks <b>1103</b> (quad), <b>1104</b> (binary, JEM), and <b>1105</b> (ternary) to avoid duplicated partitions (e.g. prohibiting a vertical/horizontal binary split on the middle partition resulting from a vertical/horizontal ternary split). Further limitations may be set to the maximum depth of the BT and TT.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">VP9 supports 8 directional modes corresponding to angles from 45 to 207 degrees. To exploit more varieties of spatial redundancy in directional textures, in AV1, directional intra modes are extended to an angle set with finer granularity. The original 8 angles are slightly changed and made as nominal angles, and these 8 nominal angles are named as V_PRED <b>1401</b>, H_PRED <b>1402</b>, D45_PRED <b>1403</b>, D135_PRED <b>1404</b>, D113_PRED <b>1405</b>, D157_PRED <b>1406</b>, D203_PRED <b>1407</b>, and D67_PRED <b>1408</b>, which is illustrated in the simplified diagram <b>1400</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> with respect to intra prediction modes in AVI and more specifically to direction intra prediction in AVI. For each nominal angle, there may be 7 finer angles according to embodiments, so AV1 has 56 directional angles in total. The prediction angle is presented by a nominal intra angle plus an angle delta, which is &#x2212;3&#x2dc;3 multiplies the step size of 3 degrees. In AV1, 8 nominal modes together with 5 non-angular smooth modes are firstly signaled, then if current mode is angular mode, an index is further signaled to indicate the angle delta to the corresponding nominal angle. To implement directional prediction modes in AV1 via a generic way, all the 56 directional intra prediction mode in AV1 are implemented with a unified directional predictor that projects each pixel to a reference sub-pixel location and interpolates the reference pixel by a 2-tap bilinear filter.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In AV1, there are 5 non-directional smooth intra prediction modes, which are DC, PAETH, SMOOTH, SMOOTH_V, and SMOOTH_H. For DC prediction, the average of left and above neighboring samples is used as the predictor of the block to be predicted. For PAETH predictor, top, left and top-left reference samples are firstly fetched, and then the value which is closest to (top+left&#x2212;topleft) is set as the predictor for the pixel to be predicted. With the simplified block diagram <b>1500</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> with respect to non-directional smooth intra predictors in AVI there is illustrated positions of top, left, and top-left samples for one pixel in a current block. For SMOOTH, SMOOTH_V, and SMOOTH_H modes, there is prediction of the block using quadratic interpolation in vertical or horizontal directions, or by the average both directions.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">To capture decaying spatial correlation with references on the edges, FILTER INTRA modes are designed for luma blocks. Five filter intra modes are defined for AV1, each represented by a set of eight 7-tap filters reflecting correlation between pixels in a 4&#xd7;2 patch and 7 neighbors adjacent to it. In other words, the weighting factors for 7-tap filter are position dependent. Take an 8&#xd7;8 block for example, it is split into 8 4&#xd7;2 patches, which is shown with respect to simplified block diagram <b>1600</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> with respect to recursive-filtering-based intra predictor features. These patches are indicated by B0, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, and B7 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>. For each patch, its 7 neighbors, indicated by R0&#x2dc;R7, are used to predict the pixels in current patch. For patch B0, all the neighbors are already reconstructed. But for other patches, not all the neighbors are reconstructed, then the predicted values of immediate neighbors are used as the reference. For example, all the neighbors of patch B7 are not reconstructed, so the prediction samples of neighbors (i.e., B5 and B6) are used instead according to embodiments.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Chroma from Luma (CfL) is a chroma-only intra predictor that models chroma pixels as a linear function of coincident reconstructed luma pixels. The CfL prediction is expressed as follows:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>CfL(&#x3b1;)=&#x3b1;&#xd7;<i>L</i><sup>AC</sup>+DC&#x2003;&#x2003;(Eq. 1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0015" num="0000">Wherein L<sup>AC </sup>denotes the AC contribution of luma component, &#x3b1; denotes the parameter of the linear model, and DC denotes the DC contribution of the chroma component. To be specific, the reconstructed luma pixels are subsampled into the chroma resolution, and then the average value is subtracted to form the AC contribution. To approximate chroma AC component from the AC contribution, instead of requiring the decoder to calculate the scaling parameters as in some prior art, AV1 CfL determines the parameter a based on the original chroma pixels and signals them in the bitstream. This reduces decoder complexity and yields more precise predictions. As for the DC contribution of the chroma component, it is computed using intra DC mode, which is sufficient for most chroma content and has mature fast implementations.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0013">Multi-line intra prediction was proposed to use more reference lines for intra prediction, and encoder decides and signals which reference line is used to generate the intra predictor. The reference line index is signaled before intra prediction modes, and only the most probable modes are allowed in case a nonzero reference line index is signaled. As shown in the simplified diagram <b>1700</b> with respect to multiline intra prediction modes shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, an example of 4 reference lines (reference line 0 (<b>1711</b>), reference line 1 (<b>1712</b>), reference line 2 (<b>1713</b>), and reference line 3 (<b>1714</b>)) is depicted, where each reference line is composed of four segments, i.e., Segment A (<b>1701</b>), Segment B (<b>1702</b>), Segment C (<b>1703</b>), Segment D (<b>1704</b>). In addition, the reconstructed samples in different reference lines are filled with different patterns in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> for ease of understanding, and multiline intra prediction mode may be also called Multiple Reference Line Prediction (MRLP) mode.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0014">With L-type partitions, more fully described herein (for example with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> among other Figures herein), one or more neighboring reconstructed samples may be also available from any of a right side and/or a bottom side, which may not be fully compatible with intra prediction schemes using top and left reference samples for performing prediction. Further, with L-type partitions, the neighboring reference samples may no longer form a straight line, such that harmonization between Multiple Reference Line Prediction (MRLP) and L-type partitions may need to be addressed to make both MRLP and L-type partition functioning at a same time.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0015">Therefore, there is a desire for a technical solution to such problems.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0016">There is included a method and apparatus comprising memory configured to store computer program code and a hardware processor or processors configured to access the computer program code and operate as instructed by the computer program code.

Each terminal <b>101</b> and <b>104</b> also may receive the coded video data transmitted by the other terminal, may decode the coded data and may display the recovered video data at a local display device.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0060">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the terminals <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> may be illustrated as servers, personal computers and smart phones but the principles of the present disclosure are not so limited. Embodiments of the present disclosure find application with laptop computers, tablet computers, media players and/or dedicated video conferencing equipment. The network <b>105</b> represents any number of networks that convey coded video data among the terminals <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b> and <b>104</b>, including for example wireline and/or wireless communication networks.

The disclosed subject matter can be equally applicable to other video enabled applications, including, for example, video conferencing, digital TV, storing of compressed video on digital media including CD, DVD, memory stick and the like, and so on.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0062">A streaming system may include a capture subsystem <b>203</b>, that can include a video source <b>201</b>, for example a digital camera, creating, for example, an uncompressed video sample stream <b>213</b>. That sample stream <b>213</b> may be emphasized as a high data volume when compared to encoded video bitstreams and can be processed by an encoder <b>202</b> coupled to the camera <b>201</b>. The encoder <b>202</b> can include hardware, software, or a combination thereof to enable or implement aspects of the disclosed subject matter as described in more detail below. The encoded video bitstream <b>204</b>, which may be emphasized as a lower data volume when compared to the sample stream, can be stored on a streaming server <b>205</b> for future use. One or more streaming clients <b>212</b> and <b>207</b> can access the streaming server <b>205</b> to retrieve copies <b>208</b> and <b>206</b> of the encoded video bitstream <b>204</b>. A client <b>212</b> can include a video decoder <b>211</b> which decodes the incoming copy of the encoded video bitstream <b>208</b> and creates an outgoing video sample stream <b>210</b> that can be rendered on a display <b>209</b> or other rendering device (not depicted). In some streaming systems, the video bitstreams <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> and <b>208</b> can be encoded according to certain video coding/compression standards. Examples of those standards are noted above and described further herein.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> may be a functional block diagram of a video decoder <b>300</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0064">A receiver <b>302</b> may receive one or more codec video sequences to be decoded by the decoder <b>300</b>; in the same or another embodiment, one coded video sequence at a time, where the decoding of each coded video sequence is independent from other coded video sequences. The coded video sequence may be received from a channel <b>301</b>, which may be a hardware/software link to a storage device which stores the encoded video data. The receiver <b>302</b> may receive the encoded video data with other data, for example, coded audio data and/or ancillary data streams, that may be forwarded to their respective using entities (not depicted). The receiver <b>302</b> may separate the coded video sequence from the other data. To combat network jitter, a buffer memory <b>303</b> may be coupled in between receiver <b>302</b> and entropy decoder/parser <b>304</b> (&#x201c;parser&#x201d; henceforth). When receiver <b>302</b> is receiving data from a store/forward device of sufficient bandwidth and controllability, or from an isosychronous network, the buffer <b>303</b> may not be needed, or can be small. For use on best effort packet networks such as the Internet, the buffer <b>303</b> may be required, can be comparatively large and can advantageously of adaptive size.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0065">The video decoder <b>300</b> may include a parser <b>304</b> to reconstruct symbols <b>313</b> from the entropy coded video sequence. Categories of those symbols include information used to manage operation of the decoder <b>300</b>, and potentially information to control a rendering device such as a display <b>312</b> that is not an integral part of the decoder but can be coupled to it. The control information for the rendering device(s) may be in the form of Supplementary Enhancement Information (SEI messages) or Video Usability Information (VUI) parameter set fragments (not depicted). The parser <b>304</b> may parse/entropy-decode the coded video sequence received. The coding of the coded video sequence can be in accordance with a video coding technology or standard, and can follow principles well known to a person skilled in the art, including variable length coding, Huffman coding, arithmetic coding with or without context sensitivity, and so forth. The parser <b>304</b> may extract from the coded video sequence, a set of subgroup parameters for at least one of the subgroups of pixels in the video decoder, based upon at least one parameters corresponding to the group. Subgroups can include Groups of Pictures (GOPs), pictures, tiles, slices, macroblocks, Coding Units (CUs), blocks, Transform Units (TUs), Prediction Units (PUs) and so forth. The entropy decoder/parser may also extract from the coded video sequence information such as transform coefficients, quantizer parameter values, motion vectors, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0066">The parser <b>304</b> may perform entropy decoding/parsing operation on the video sequence received from the buffer <b>303</b>, so to create symbols <b>313</b>. The parser <b>304</b> may receive encoded data, and selectively decode particular symbols <b>313</b>. Further, the parser <b>304</b> may determine whether the particular symbols <b>313</b> are to be provided to a Motion Compensation Prediction unit <b>306</b>, a scaler/inverse transform unit <b>305</b>, an Intra Prediction Unit <b>307</b>, or a loop filter <b>311</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0067">Reconstruction of the symbols <b>313</b> can involve multiple different units depending on the type of the coded video picture or parts thereof (such as: inter and intra picture, inter and intra block), and other factors. Which units are involved, and how, can be controlled by the subgroup control information that was parsed from the coded video sequence by the parser <b>304</b>. The flow of such subgroup control information between the parser <b>304</b> and the multiple units below is not depicted for clarity.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0068">Beyond the functional blocks already mentioned, decoder <b>300</b> can be conceptually subdivided into a number of functional units as described below. In a practical implementation operating under commercial constraints, many of these units interact closely with each other and can, at least partly, be integrated into each other. However, for the purpose of describing the disclosed subject matter, the conceptual subdivision into the functional units below is appropriate.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0069">A first unit is the scaler/inverse transform unit <b>305</b>. The scaler/inverse transform unit <b>305</b> receives quantized transform coefficient as well as control information, including which transform to use, block size, quantization factor, quantization scaling matrices, etc. as symbol(s) <b>313</b> from the parser <b>304</b>. It can output blocks comprising sample values, that can be input into aggregator <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0070">In some cases, the output samples of the scaler/inverse transform <b>305</b> can pertain to an intra coded block; that is: a block that is not using predictive information from previously reconstructed pictures, but can use predictive information from previously reconstructed parts of the current picture. Such predictive information can be provided by an intra picture prediction unit <b>307</b>. In some cases, the intra picture prediction unit <b>307</b> generates a block of the same size and shape of the block under reconstruction, using surrounding already reconstructed information fetched from the current (partly reconstructed) picture <b>309</b>. The aggregator <b>310</b>, in some cases, adds, on a per sample basis, the prediction information the intra prediction unit <b>307</b> has generated to the output sample information as provided by the scaler/inverse transform unit <b>305</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0071">In other cases, the output samples of the scaler/inverse transform unit <b>305</b> can pertain to an inter coded, and potentially motion compensated block. In such a case, a Motion Compensation Prediction unit <b>306</b> can access reference picture memory <b>308</b> to fetch samples used for prediction. After motion compensating the fetched samples in accordance with the symbols <b>313</b> pertaining to the block, these samples can be added by the aggregator <b>310</b> to the output of the scaler/inverse transform unit (in this case called the residual samples or residual signal) so to generate output sample information. The addresses within the reference picture memory form where the motion compensation unit fetches prediction samples can be controlled by motion vectors, available to the motion compensation unit in the form of symbols <b>313</b> that can have, for example X, Y, and reference picture components. Motion compensation also can include interpolation of sample values as fetched from the reference picture memory when sub-sample exact motion vectors are in use, motion vector prediction mechanisms, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0072">The output samples of the aggregator <b>310</b> can be subject to various loop filtering techniques in the loop filter unit <b>311</b>. Video compression technologies can include in-loop filter technologies that are controlled by parameters included in the coded video bitstream and made available to the loop filter unit <b>311</b> as symbols <b>313</b> from the parser <b>304</b>, but can also be responsive to meta-information obtained during the decoding of previous (in decoding order) parts of the coded picture or coded video sequence, as well as responsive to previously reconstructed and loop-filtered sample values.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0073">The output of the loop filter unit <b>311</b> can be a sample stream that can be output to the render device <b>312</b> as well as stored in the reference picture memory <b>557</b> for use in future inter-picture prediction.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0074">Certain coded pictures, once fully reconstructed, can be used as reference pictures for future prediction. Once a coded picture is fully reconstructed and the coded picture has been identified as a reference picture (by, for example, parser <b>304</b>), the current reference picture <b>309</b> can become part of the reference picture buffer <b>308</b>, and a fresh current picture memory can be reallocated before commencing the reconstruction of the following coded picture.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0075">The video decoder <b>300</b> may perform decoding operations according to a predetermined video compression technology that may be documented in a standard, such as ITU-T Rec. H.265. The coded video sequence may conform to a syntax specified by the video compression technology or standard being used, in the sense that it adheres to the syntax of the video compression technology or standard, as specified in the video compression technology document or standard and specifically in the profiles document therein. Also necessary for compliance can be that the complexity of the coded video sequence is within bounds as defined by the level of the video compression technology or standard. In some cases, levels restrict the maximum picture size, maximum frame rate, maximum reconstruction sample rate (measured in, for example megasamples per second), maximum reference picture size, and so on.

If a sample coordinate is projected to a vertical side of the RSC, samples along the vertical like directions (e.g., r0 and r1) are used to generate a prediction sample value.

An example is shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, where LP (partition 1) is reconstructed before RP (partition 0), and therefore the samples (as indicated by shaded blocks) form an RSC and may be used for intra prediction of RP (partition 0).</p><p id="p-0136" num="0123">According to exemplary embodiments, when doing the Planar mode (defined in HEVC and VVC) or SMOOTH, SMOOTH-H, SMOOTH-V modes (defined in AV1), if the right or bottom samples are reconstructed, these reconstructed samples can be used directly in the 4-tap interpolation in Planar (or SMOOTH, SMOOTH-H, SMOOTH-V) mode instead of extrapolating the right and bottom samples by the top and left reconstructed samples, and when doing a DC mode, not only the above and left neighboring reconstructed samples, all the samples available in an RSC, which may include right and bottom reconstructed samples, can be used for generating the DC predictor.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0124">Further, with the DC mode, not only the above and left neighboring reconstructed samples, all the samples except bottom-left and top-right available in the RSC, which may include right and bottom reconstructed samples, can be used for generating the DC predictor.

In one embodiment, when both left and right samples are reconstructed before the current block, the bi-directional prediction modes, which utilize weighted sum of left and right samples along a horizontal-like prediction direction to generate the predictor, are employed to replace the horizontal-like prediction. Thereby, in a bi-directional prediction mode, there may be generated a predictor for a current block in the rectangular shaped partition 0 of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> by utilizing a weighted sum of first and second portions of the shaded reference sample chain where the first and second portions are respectively from the right and left of, and are non-neighboring sides to, the current block and the reference sample chain, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>, surrounds the current block at at least three sides: a left side, a top side, and a right side as understood from the orientations illustrated by the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>.

According to exemplary embodiments, such mapping of samples from RSC to the top and left column is done along the intra prediction direction. Alternatively, such mapping of samples from RSC to the top and left column is done using a 2-tap bi-linear filter or a 4-tap cubic filter or the nearest integer sample. Further alternatively, all the samples in the RSC may mapped to a top row, an example is shown in the diagram <b>2500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0129">For example, with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>, embodiments may map all samples in the RSC to the top row, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>, when it is determined that the intra prediction direction is vertical like, or when it is determined that the intra prediction direction is horizontal like</p><p id="p-0143" num="0130">Alternatives are also comprised by exemplary embodiments such as that all samples in the RSC may be mapped to a left column, or, for example, all samples in the RSC may be mapped to a left top column only when it is determined that the intra prediction direction is horizontal like.
