Online gaming platform <b>105</b> may be configured to host (and/or execute instances of) the one or more (online) games. Online gaming platform <b>105</b> may be operated, hosted, and/or owned by one or more stakeholders of online gaming platform <b>105</b>. For example, a platform operator (and/or another stakeholder) may sell in-game digital resources (e.g., characters, weapons, virtual items, etc.) to players <b>123</b> of online gaming platform <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to the game and to online gaming platform <b>105</b>, in some implementations, individual players may own individual (in-game) virtual items, and exchange these items with (or to) other individual players. Due to an exchange, ownership rights of a virtual item may transition from an original owner to a new owner (even if there may, in some implementations, be one or more intermediary and/or temporary owners during the process of performing the exchange). In some implementations, digital resources may be associated with other rights than ownership rights, such as, by way of non-limiting example, distribution rights.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some implementations, distribution rights of digital resources may reflect rights held by the individual ones of the players to receive certain distributions of benefits upon exchanges involving particular digital resources. That is, the individual players may own/hold rights to particular digital resources that guarantee them benefits upon (future) exchanges involving those digital resources regardless of whether the individual players owns/hold the ownership rights for those digital resources. In some implementations, the distribution gains may result from a particular action or activity (such as, e.g., a sale of a particular digital resource), e.g., within the online gaming platform <b>105</b>, of a particular digital resource. As used herein, a distribution gain resulting from a particular action or activity may include one or more of a portion of the proceeds of the particular action or activity, a fee related to the particular action or activity, a minimum payment triggered by the occurrence of the particular action or activity (or a set of particular actions or activities), and/or another arrangement for payment and/or compensation, including but not limited to combinations of fixed fees, minimum fees, percentages of sales, percentages of profits, and/or other arrangements. The term &#x201c;portion&#x201d; does not imply or require a percentage or ratio, but rather is intended to signify that beneficiaries (i.e., the players that hold the distribution rights) may receive something of value and/or use. The distribution gains may include one or more virtual currencies such as virtual tokens, virtual stars, virtual points, virtual real-world currencies (e.g., US Dollars), and/or other gains that are based on the particular digital resources.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some implementations, the digital resources may include virtual items that are not fungible and that may be usable within an online gaming platform <b>105</b>. In some implementations, the digital resources may represent (three-dimensional) in-game player-controllable characters that can interact with other (in-game) virtual items within online gaming platform <b>105</b>. By way of non-limiting example, digital resources may represent virtual items. In some implementations, virtual items may include one or more of weapons, toys, characters, abilities, skills, tools, pets, clothing, vehicles, game levels, missions, assignments, chapters, tasks, mini-games, restricted areas within a virtual space, restricted modes of gameplay, access rights within an online game, and/or other virtual items. In some implementations, virtual items may refer to any item or object within online gaming platform <b>105</b> for which a player may use, own, sell, trade, destroy, and/or otherwise effectuate a change of ownership (including exchanging virtual items and/or other assets through challenges). As used herein, a digital resource is fungible if it is functionally and/or physically indistinguishable from another digital resource. For example, a payment token such as a Bitcoin is a fungible digital resource. A digital resource may be non-fungible if it is unique, or one-of-a-kind. For example, a specific individual CryptoKitty&#x2122; may be a non-fungible digital resource. A digital resource may be semi-fungible if there is a set of a limited number of similar but distinguishable digital resources. For example, a limited-edition Blanko&#x2122; or another in-game character may be a semi-fungible digital resource. For example, one of a limited number of 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional in-game virtual items may be a semi-fungible digital resource. For example, a digital ticket to a show, concert, exhibition, and/or other event may be a semi-fungible digital resource. For example, a piece of art or jewelry (e.g., as a virtual item or as representing a physical item) may be a semi-fungible digital resource. As used herein, semi-fungible digital resources are considered as &#x201c;not fungible&#x201d; or non-fungible digital resources.

In some implementations, blockchain <b>117</b><i>a </i>and blockchain <b>117</b><i>b </i>may be maintained by distributed computing platforms (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In some implementations, a distributed computing platform may be implemented by a set of client computing platforms and/or servers (including, for example, one or more registry servers <b>111</b>). The distributed computing platform may support a virtual machine (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The distributed computing platform and/or the virtual machine may form a runtime environment for smart contracts and/or other executable code. A distributed computing platform may include electronic storage configured to store part or all of blockchain <b>117</b><i>a</i>.

In some implementations, the virtual machine may be a decentralized virtual machine.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some implementations, at least one of the permanent registries implemented by registry servers <b>111</b> is a private permissioned permanent registry. A permanent registry may be configured to record information. The recorded information may pertain to unique digital articles that are associated with in-game player-controllable characters that are configured to be used in the instance of the game. The recorded information may include ownership of the unique digital articles. Implementing the in-game actions in the instance of the game may include, for at least some of the in-game actions implemented in the instance of the game, effectuating modifications to the recorded information pertaining to the unique digital article. For example, ownership rights and/or other rights may be modified. In some implementations, a unique digital article may be removed from one permanent registry and added or recorded on another permanent registry. In some implementations, at least one of the permanent registries implemented by registry servers <b>111</b> is a public decentralized ledger. For example, the public decentralized ledger may be configured to be part of either EOSIO mainnet, Ethereum mainnet, Ethereum 1.5, Ethereum 2.0, a derivative of Ethereum 2.0 that is configured to perform transactions of Ether (ETH) between accounts, or a derivative of EOSIO that is configured to perform transactions of EOS between different accounts.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Elements of blockchain <b>117</b><i>a </i>or another permanent registry may be grouped together in units that are referred to as blocks. For example, an individual block may include one or more assets (or resources) and one or more transactions. For example, an individual block may be linked to one or more other individual blocks. Individual blocks may be linked or chained together to form a structure of blocks and/or a hierarchy of blocks, such as, e.g., a chain of blocks.

The instruction components may include one or more of transaction component <b>134</b>, receipt component <b>136</b>, and/or other instruction components. In some implementations, an individual registry server may be dedicated to a particular node of a permanent registry. Typically, different nodes are included in (or implemented by, or hosted by) different servers or different computer systems to increase the safety and security of transactions on a blockchain. The consensus protocol used for a particular blockchain will be harder to falsify or circumvent when the different nodes are in different geographical locations, on different types of computing platforms, and/or otherwise distributed and diverse. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, blockchain <b>117</b><i>a </i>may include a unique digital article <b>15</b> (by way of non-limiting example, unique digital article <b>15</b> may be associated with a player-controllable in-game character, as depicted, and unique digital article <b>15</b> may have been recorded on blockchain <b>117</b><i>a</i>, as depicted).

In some implementations, one or more permanent registries implemented by registry servers <b>111</b> may be private and/or permissioned. In some implementations, one or more permanent registries implemented by registry servers <b>111</b> may be append-only. In some implementations, one or more permanent registries implemented by registry servers <b>111</b> may be decentralized and/or distributed. In some implementations, existing blocks of one or more permanent registries implemented by registry servers <b>111</b> can substantially not be altered or deleted, unless multiple copies are altered. This is unlikely to happen provided that the multiple copies stored on different computing platforms, e.g., in different geographical locations. Permanent registries may be replicated on multiple computing platforms, preferably in multiple different geographical locations. Additionally, individual blocks may be linked together in a manner that prevents tampering, such as, e.g., using a hash chain and/or digital signatures. In particular, hash values may be generated using fixed-output-length one-way hashing functions that take variable-length input, and may be effectively impossible (or, at least, computationally infeasible) to reverse. As such, a hashing function may provide one-way encryption. By way of non-limiting example, the hashing function may be SHA-256, BLAKE2, SHAKE256, and/or another hashing function. Contents of individual blocks, transactions, and/or assets may be digitally signed in a manner that proves integrity and/or prevents tampering, e.g., by providing authentication, as well as non-repudiation.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As described herein, the utility or usage of a unique digital article may be different for or on different permanent registries. The administration for a set or population of unique digital articles may be different for or on different permanent registries, hence the term &#x201c;blockchain-specific&#x201d;. For example, the same unique digital article may have a first utility while recorded on a first blockchain, but not while recorded on a second blockchain. Conversely, the same unique digital article may have a second utility while recorded on the second blockchain, but not while recorded on first blockchain.

For example, presentation component <b>133</b> may facilitate presentation of an individual user interface <b>125</b> to an individual player. Individual user interface <b>125</b> may be configured to receive player input from the individual player. In some implementations, individual user interface <b>125</b> may enable the individual player to perform some or all of the following: enter and/or select a particular unique digital article (e.g., from the account inventory associated with the individual player), enter and/or select a first price (listed) in a first currency, enter and/or select a second price (listed) in a second currency, enter and/or select a duration for this particular listing, initiate transmission and/or publication of listing information, and/or other tasks. For example, the first currency may be a fiat currency, such as US dollar, Euro, Japanese yen, etc. For example, the second currency may be different from the first currency. In some implementations, the second currency may be a decentralized currency, such as Bitcoin, Ether, Ripple (XRP), etc. The listing information (of this particular listing) may correspond to the player input received from the individual player. Publication of the listing information may present the particular unique digital article for sale at either the first price or the second price. In some implementations, one or both of the first price and the second price are (manually) entered by the individual player. The first price and second price do not have to be linked and/or otherwise connected by any particular or official exchange rate. Instead, for example, the individual player may decide to list the particular unique digital article for $150 US dollar and for 0.1 Ether (by entering both amounts individually and separately in individual user interface <b>125</b>). For the duration of this listing, unless modified by the individual player, a buyer can either buy the particular unique digital article for $150, or buy the particular unique digital article for 0.1 Ether, without regard for the current exchange rate, or fluctuations in the exchange rate.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some implementations, presentations by presentation component <b>133</b> may be performed jointly (or at least in some cooperative manner) with one or both of game component <b>108</b> and/or interaction component <b>110</b>.

In some implementations, the received user input (from prospective buyers) may include a selection of either the first price or the second price as included in the presented listing information. Responsive to receiving player input that includes a selection of either the first price or the second price, presentation component <b>133</b> may be configured to present a (new and/or additional) user interface and/or (graphical) user interface elements (within a previously presented user interface) to a particular player (e.g., a prospective buyer) depicting and/or representing one or more sets of settlement options. For example, responsive to the selection of the first price, a first set of one or more settlement options may be presented that include at least the first currency. However, this first set of settlement options may include additional currencies. In some implementations, this first set of settlement options need not be limited to fiat currencies (but could, e.g., include Amazon Points). For example, assume the first price is listed in US dollars. In some cases, the first set of settlement options available to the prospective buyer may include US dollars, Canadian dollars, and Euros. In another example, for a first price listed in US dollars, the first set of settlement options available to the prospective buyer may include US dollars, Euros, Bitcoin, and Tether (USDT). In some implementations, the specific first set of settlement options available to the prospective buyer may depend on the different kinds of currencies currently owned by the prospective buyer. In some implementations, the specific first set of settlement options available to the prospective buyer may depend on the different kinds of currencies currently linked (e.g., through online wallets, linked bank accounts, and/or other linked financial accounts) by the prospective buyer. In some implementations, the specific first set of settlement options available to a player may be configurable by the player.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">For example, responsive to the selection, by the prospective buyer, of the second price, a second set of one or more settlement options may be presented that include at least the second currency. However, this second set of settlement options may include additional currencies. In some implementations, this second set of settlement options need not be limited to decentralized currencies. For example, assume the second price is listed in Ether. In some cases, the second set of settlement options available to the prospective buyer may include Bitcoin and Ether. In another example, for a second price listed in Ether, the second set of settlement options available to the prospective buyer may include Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Tether (USDT), and Euro. In some implementations, the specific second of set of settlement options available to the prospective buyer may depend on the different kinds of currencies currently owned by the prospective buyer. In some implementations, the specific second set of settlement options available to the prospective buyer may depend on the different kinds of currencies currently linked (e.g., through online wallets, linked bank accounts, and/or other linked financial accounts) by the prospective buyer. In some implementations, the available settlement options may depend on which particular decentralized currency is used to list the second price. By way of non-limiting example, for a second price in Ether, the second set of settlement options may include one or more ERC20 token coins. However, for a second price in XRP, no ERC20 token coins may be available as option. In some implementations, the specific second set of settlement options available to a player may be configurable by the player.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Presentation component <b>133</b> may be configured to receive player input (e.g., from a particular user interface (or from user interface elements) that has/have been presented to a prospective buyer).

In some implementations, registry-analysis component <b>120</b> may be configured to determine whether one or more unique digital articles are recorded as being owned by one or more particular players and/or accounts. For example, registry-analysis component <b>120</b> may determine whether a first unique digital article is currently recorded on a private permissioned permanent registry. In some implementations, registry-analysis component <b>120</b> may be configured to analyze recordations and other transactions on one or more permanent registries, e.g., by retrieving recorded information from the one or more permanent registries and analyzing whether any of the recorded transactions pertain to a particular unique digital article, or a set of unique digital articles. In some implementations, determinations by registry-analysis component <b>120</b> may be performed responsive to particular actions or results from other components of system <b>100</b>, including but not limited to listing component <b>116</b>. In some implementations, registry-analysis component <b>120</b> may be configured to determine whether ownership of a particular unique digital article (or other digital resource that is not fungible) has ever been recorded on a public permanent registry. For example, actions by other components of system <b>100</b>, including but not limited to distribution component <b>124</b>, may be responsive to determinations by registry-analysis component <b>120</b>. In some implementations, a unique digital article may only be transferred from a first player to a second player if the first player is the registered owner of the unique digital article.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Notification component <b>122</b> may be configured to notify players. For example, notification component <b>122</b> may notify players in response to action requests, reward requests, and/or other requests. In some implementations, a player may be notified responsive to a requested manner of usage of a particular unique digital article (as requested through an action request) not being permitted or performed. In some implementations, actions by notification component <b>122</b> may be performed responsive to particular actions, results, determinations, or decisions from other components of system <b>100</b>, including but not limited to listing component <b>116</b> and/or registry-analysis component <b>120</b>. For example, notification component <b>122</b> may respond to a particular action request (by a particular player, and pertaining to a particular unique digital article) with a particular response such that, responsive to the particular manner of usage, as requested in the particular action request, being grouped under a particular type of unique digital article usage, and further responsive to determining the particular permanent registry on which the particular unique digital article has been recorded is a public permanent registry, the particular response notifies the particular player that the particular player is not permitted to use the particular unique digital article according to the particular action request. For example, players may be notified if a reward has been adjusted and/or modified, or could have been adjusted and/or modified.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Reward component <b>131</b> may be configured to determine eligibility for unique digital articles, other digital resources that are not fungible, and/or players <b>123</b> to receive one or more of information, access to in-game content, access to game-specific communication channels, certificates, (participation) rewards, (attendance) awards, prizes, distribution gains, and/or virtual items. In some implementations, reward component <b>131</b> may be configured to receive reward requests to provide one or more of information, access to in-game content, access to game-specific communication channels, certificates, rewards, awards, prizes, distribution gains, and/or virtual items to players <b>123</b> and/or particular unique digital articles. In some implementations, these types of determinations or (reward) requests may be based on and/or responsive to actions by other components of system <b>100</b>, including but not limited to registry-analysis component <b>120</b>. In some implementations, online gaming platform <b>105</b> may determine a particular player is eligible to receive one or more rewards or awards. In some implementations, online gaming platform <b>105</b> may provide reward requests for one or more rewards or awards. For example, responsive to a player accomplishing a predetermined milestone in the instance of the game, a reward request may be provided to reward component <b>131</b>, e.g., by online gaming platform <b>105</b>.

Distributions by distribution component <b>124</b> may be adjusted, e.g., by adjustment component <b>126</b>. In some implementations, distributions may be responsive to (eligibility) determinations by reward component <b>131</b>. In some implementations, distributions may be based on and/or responsive to actions by other components of system <b>100</b>, including but not limited to registry-analysis component <b>120</b>. For example, online gaming platform <b>105</b> may determine a particular player is eligible to receive one or more rewards or awards. Distribution component <b>124</b> may distribute the one or more rewards or awards in accordance with the determined eligibility. For example, a reward may be a participation reward. For example, an award may be an attendance award. For example, a certificate may be a certificate of completion or accomplishment, which may be specific to actions within the instance of the game. For example, a prize may be for effort, time, and/or resources spent, specifically in the instance of the game. For example, particular unique digital articles may be associated with distribution rights, and the particular player who owns those distribution rights may receive distribution gains in accordance with those distribution rights.
