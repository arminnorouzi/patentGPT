The primary non-etched region may include the first substrate <b>200</b> in the outer region PR, the first substrate <b>200</b> and the second substrate <b>300</b> in a second protruding region PTR<b>2</b>, the second substrate <b>300</b> of a 1-1 protruding region PTR<b>11</b> (referring to a 1-1-1 protruding region), the first substrate <b>200</b> and the second substrate <b>300</b> of a third protruding region PTR<b>3</b>, and the first substrate <b>200</b> and the second substrate <b>300</b> of a fourth protruding region PTR<b>4</b>. The masking operation may be performed by disposing a masking member M in the primary non-etched region. The masking member M may be formed in an envelope shape with an open end and installed in a form of a cover so as to cover a portion in which the primary non-etched region is formed. As another example, the masking member M may be configured in a film form and may be pasted over from one surface to the other surface. An acid-resistant adhesive tape (not shown) may be installed on an edge of the masking member M so as to easily attach the masking member M to the outer surface of the display device, and when the masking member M is configured in the film form and pasted over, the masking member M may be configured to prevent penetration of an etchant by attaching the pasted both ends with an acid-resistant adhesive tape or by thermal fusion. The masking member M itself may be formed of an adhesive tape.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Subsequently, a primary etching is performed. The primary etching may be wet etching. As another example, the primary etching may be dry etching. In the primary etching, an etchant may be applied to or sprayed on the display device, and the configuration of the display device may be etched except for the primary non-etched region. Therefore, except for the first substrate <b>200</b> of the outer region PR, the first substrate <b>200</b> and the second substrate <b>300</b> of the second protruding region PTR<b>2</b>,the second substrate <b>300</b> of the 1-1 protruding region PTR<b>11</b> (referring to the 1-1-1 protruding region), the first substrate <b>200</b> and the second substrate <b>300</b> of the third protruding region PTR<b>3</b>, and the first substrate <b>200</b> and the second substrate <b>300</b> of the fourth protruding region PTR<b>4</b> that are included in the primary non-etched region, the display device may be etched so that the overall thickness thereof can be reduced. That is, a thickness of the primary non-etched region can be maintained by the masking member M, and the thickness of the primary non-etched region can be reduced overall.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Subsequently, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref>, a secondary non-etched region of the display device is masked. The secondary non-etched region may include the first substrate <b>200</b> of the outer region PR, the first substrate <b>200</b> and the second substrate <b>300</b> of the second protruding region PTR<b>2</b>, the first substrate <b>200</b> and the second substrate <b>300</b> of the 1-1 protruding region PTR<b>11</b> (including the 1-1-1 protruding region and the 1-1-2 protruding region), the first substrate <b>200</b> and the second substrate <b>300</b> of the third protruding region PTR<b>3</b>, and the first substrate <b>200</b> and the second substrate <b>300</b> of the fourth protruding region PTR<b>4</b>. The masking operation may be performed by disposing the masking member M in the secondary non-etched region. The masking member M may be formed in an envelope shape with an open end and installed in a form of a cover so as to cover a portion in which the secondary non-etched region is formed. As another example, the masking member M may be configured in a film form and may be pasted over from one surface to the other surface. An acid-resistant adhesive tape (not shown) may be installed on an edge of the masking member M so as to easily attach the masking member M to the outer surface of the display device, and when the masking member M is configured in the film form and pasted over, the masking member M may be configured to prevent penetration of the etchant by attaching the pasted both ends with an acid-resistant adhesive tape or by thermal fusion. The masking member M itself may be formed of an adhesive tape.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Subsequently, a secondary etching is performed. The secondary etching may be wet etching. As another example, the second etching may be dry etching. In the secondary etching, an etchant may be applied to or sprayed on the display device, and the configuration of the display device may be etched except for the secondary non-etched region. Therefore, except for the first substrate <b>200</b> of the outer region PR, the first substrate <b>200</b> and the second substrate <b>300</b> of the second protruding region PTR<b>2</b>, the second substrate <b>300</b> and the first substrate <b>200</b> of the 1-1 protruding region PTR<b>11</b> (including the 1-1-1 protruding region and the 1-1-2 protruding region), the first substrate <b>200</b> and the second substrate <b>300</b> of the third protruding region PTR<b>3</b>, and the first substrate <b>200</b> and the second substrate <b>300</b> of the fourth protruding region PTR<b>4</b> that are included in the secondary non-etched region, the display device may be etched so that the overall thickness thereof can be reduced. That is, a thickness of the secondary non-etched region can be maintained by the masking member M, and the thickness of the secondary non-etched region can be reduced overall.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">As described above, the masking member M may mask the outer region PR, the driving connecting film <b>410</b>, and the driving circuit board <b>420</b> of the display device <b>10</b> to prevent the driving connecting film <b>410</b> and the driving circuit board <b>420</b> from being damaged by the etchant. Further, the masking member M may also mask an upper surface of the second substrate <b>300</b> disposed in the 1-1-1 protruding region. When the masking member does not mask the second substrate <b>300</b> disposed in the 1-1 protruding region PTR<b>11</b>, there can be a risk that the driving connection film <b>410</b> and the driving circuit board <b>420</b> are damaged by the etchant applied to the 1-1 protruding region PTR<b>11</b>. However, the 1-1-2 protruding region other than the 1-1-1 protruding region is not masked and thus is etched, thereby reducing bending stress when the display device <b>10</b> is curved. Furthermore, the bending stress when the display device <b>10</b> is curved can be reduced by not masking the 1-2 protruding region PTR<b>12</b> positioned between the plurality of 1-1 protruding regions PTR<b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Embodiments of the present invention have been described with reference to the accompanying drawings, but it will be understood by those of skill in the art that various changes in form and details may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as set forth in the following claims.
