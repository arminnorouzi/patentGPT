Such electric control units cooperate with each other using various communication schemes rather than operate individually (independently) for complex function implementation and stability. As complexity increases, errors and failures of the electric control units frequently occur in a field after a development step and mass production. To minimize field claims, many quality evaluators participate in extracting and resolving quality problems in the vehicle development step in advance. In addition, a system that may maximize a work efficiency to reduce a man hour (M/H) that is invested in extracting, resolving, and managing the quality problems in the development step is being continuously developed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Numerous problems are extracted during a prototype and pilot vehicle development process. The extracted problems are registered and managed in a computerized system to prevent the same problem from occurring in a next vehicle model as well as to manage a problem improving history of a corresponding vehicle model. When the registration and the management off the problem are done by a single or a small number of people, it requires serious M/H consumption. When a problem is found in an evaluation target vehicle, the evaluator performs the problem registration in a following order:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0005">{circle around (1)} Find an issue in the vehicle from which the problem is found;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0006">{circle around (2)} Write down the problem on a notebook or a phone notepad;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0007">{circle around (3)} After moving to an office, register a content written on the notepad in a &#x2018;quality problem history management computerized system&#x2019;; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0008">{circle around (4)} Manage a history of the registered problem (perform update when an overall status, such as an improvement method, a schedule, and the like, changes).</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0006" num="0009">When a simple evaluation is being conducted in a situation in which the vehicle is stopped, there is no problem in performing the processes from {circle around (1)} to {circle around (4)}. However, when a travel evaluation is conducted by the evaluator alone, because the evaluator is not able to remember all problems that occurred during a long travel time, there is a high probability of omission of the problem.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0010">In addition, a time may also be delayed to write down the problem when two hands of the evaluator are not free because the evaluator is handling another evaluation equipment even when the evaluation is conducted in the situation in which the vehicle is stopped.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008"

The microphone <b>120</b> may collect sound, convert the sound into an electrical signal, and output the electric signal. The microphone <b>120</b> may receive a voice signal (that is, an analog signal) uttered by the user (e.g., an evaluator) and convert the voice signal into digital voice data. Various noise removal algorithms for removing noise that is input together during the process of receiving the voice signal may be implemented in the microphone <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0041">The memory device <b>130</b> may store information necessary for driving the mobile device <b>100</b>, for example, setting information and the like. The memory device <b>130</b> may be a storage medium (a non-transitory storage medium) that stores instructions executed by the processing device <b>170</b>. The memory device <b>130</b> may include a flash memory, a hard disk, a solid state disk (SSD), a secure digital card (SD card), a random access memory (RAM), a static random access memory (SRAM), a read only memory (ROM), a programmable read only memory (PROM), an electrically erasable and programmable ROM (EEPROM), an erasable and programmable ROM (EPROM), an embedded multimedia card (eMMC), and/or universal flash storage (UFS).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0042">The power supply <b>140</b> may supply power required to drive the mobile device <b>100</b>.

When there is no input signal for a preset time, the processing device <b>170</b> switches an operation mode of the mobile device <b>100</b> from an active state to an inactive state (e.g., a sleep mode or a standby state) and maintains the inactive state, so that power consumption of the mobile device <b>100</b> may be minimized. The processing device <b>170</b> may switch the operation mode of the mobile device <b>100</b> from the inactive state to the active state when the input signal is received.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0047">The processing device <b>170</b> may receive a call signal in the standby state. The processing device <b>170</b> may receive a call word uttered by the user through the microphone <b>120</b> as the call signal. The call word may be set in advance by the user. In addition, the processing device <b>170</b> may receive the call signal generated from a specific button to which a call function is assigned.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0048">When the call signal is received, the processing device <b>170</b> may determine whether a database (hereinafter, a DB) category to which a quality problem is registered is preset.
