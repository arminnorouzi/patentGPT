end="lead"?><heading id="h-0010" level="1">EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Hereinafter, the present invention will be described by way of non-limiting exemplary embodiments; however, the following embodiments do not necessarily limit the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. In addition, all the combinations of features described in the following embodiments need not be essential to the solving means of the invention.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram showing a functional configuration example of an operation determination device according to the exemplary embodiment. According to the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an operation determination device <b>100</b> includes a simulator <b>110</b>, a determination unit <b>120</b>, and a module <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The operation determination device <b>100</b> is configured to produce an operation plan for carriage machinery. For example, the operation determination device <b>100</b> may output the information representing a diagram such as an example of an operation pattern of carriage machinery. In particular, the operation determination device <b>100</b> is configured to acquire and output an operation plan of carriage machinery in order to improve a quantitative evaluation status of carriage targets to be carried by carriage machinery.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A transportation system may include carriage machinery and its platform. Herein, the transportation system is a generic term collectively integrating carrier devices and facilities for operating carrier devices. Herein, the operation of carriage machinery may cause carriage machinery to operate according to some plans.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The following description refers to an exemplary case of acquiring an operation plan of carriage machinery in order to improve a stationary status of carriage targets to be carried by carriage machinery at its platform. In this connection, a subject to be improved by an operation plan produced by the operation determination device <b>100</b> is not necessarily limited to a stationary status of carriage targets at a platform. For example, the operation determination device <b>100</b> may acquire an operation plan of carriage machinery to improve the speed of the carrier device. Herein, an improvement in speed of carriage machinery can be achieved by reducing time needed to carry objects by increasing speed of carriage machinery.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The following description exemplarily refers to a vehicle as carriage machinery subjected to the operation determination device <b>100</b> and people as carriage targets. In particular, the following description exemplarily refers to railway vehicles as carriage machinery subjected to the operation determination device <b>100</b>. In this case, a transportation system will be referred to as a railway system. Herein, the railway system is a generic term collectively integrating railway vehicles and facilities for operating railway vehicles. In this connection, a railway vehicle can be operated as a train interconnecting two or more vehicles together or a single vehicle which may operate alone.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">When people are carried by carriage machinery, persons as carriage targets would be users of carriage machinery. Hereinafter, users of carriage machinery will be simply referred to as users.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In this connection, carriage machinery subjected to the operation determination device <b>100</b> may carry objects such as articles rather than persons. In this case, a client who requests carrying objects serving as carriage targets may correspond to a user. Carriage machinery may represent carriers, belt conveyors, or pipelines configured to carry products and materials in production plants, warehouses, or the like. A platform may represent a storage place such as a tank which can store products and materials. Accordingly, a stationary status may represent an amount of products and materials stored in each storage place or a ratio of an amount of products and materials to a capacity of each storage place.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the case of a production plant, for example, a stationary status may represent an amount of works in process before being processed in a certain manufacturing process or an amount of works in process which has been completed in one manufacturing process but which has not been carried to the next manufacturing process.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">When the operation determination device <b>100</b> is intended for carriage targets such as persons to be carried by carriage machinery, the carrier device is not necessarily limited to a railway vehicle. For example, the carrier device may be an aircraft, a seacraft, a taxi, a truck, a bus or other transportation vehicles.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the above, a stationary status of carriage targets may indicate a status of carriage targets which stay at the same place without moving to other places. In the case of a railway system as a transportation system, a stationary status of carriage targets may refer to a condition in which a user stays at a railway station or a platform or in which a user waits for a railway vehicle at a platform.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">A shorter stationary time would be preferable for passengers who aim to travel via carriage machinery. In this connection, it is possible for the operation determination device <b>100</b> to produce an operation plan considering users' convenience via carriage machinery when improving a stationary status.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the case of a carriage target as an object, it is preferable for a user that the object be transported speedily. In the case of a production plant or a warehouse, a reduction may occur in a production status or a shipping status due to carriage targets being piled up for a long time in a production plant or a warehouse. In this case, it is possible for the operation determination device <b>100</b> to produce an operation plan considering users' convenience via carriage machinery when improving a stationary status. Therefore, it is preferable to reduce a stationary time.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The operation determination device <b>100</b> may control an operation of carriage machinery based on the operation plan produced thereby. Alternatively, the operation determination device <b>100</b> may output an operation plan to an external device such as a control device of a transportation system such that the external device can control an operation of carriage machinery based on the operation plan. For example, the operation determination device <b>100</b> may instruct or control carriage machinery to operate according to an operation plan produced thereby. Alternatively, the operation determination device <b>100</b> may control signals of a transportation system such that carriage machinery be controlled according to an operation plan produced thereby.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Alternatively, a manager of a transportation system may draft his/her operation plan to be applied to the transportation system with reference to an operation plan produced by the operation determination device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The simulator <b>110</b> is configured to simulate an operation of carriage machinery. To simulate an operation of carriage machinery, the simulator <b>110</b> may simulate an operation over the entirety of a transportation system in addition to an operation of carriage machinery. To simulate an operation of a railway vehicle, for example, the simulator <b>110</b> needs to simulate operations of points, crossings, and signals; hence, the simulator <b>110</b> should simulate the operations.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In addition, the simulator <b>110</b> is configured to simulate dynamic/static states of carriage targets. In the case of a railway system as a transportation system, the simulator <b>110</b> should simulate entry/exit of passengers on a platform of a railway station, embarking/disembarking of passengers on railway vehicles, and transportation of passengers via railway vehicles.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The determination unit <b>120</b> is configured to determine an operation plan of carriage machinery using the simulator <b>110</b> to improve a stationary status of carriage targets on a platform. It is possible to determine an operation plan of carriage machinery when improving a stationary status of carriage targets on a platform since the determination unit <b>120</b> evaluates a stationary status of carriage targets on a platform in association with simulation of the simulator <b>110</b> configured to simulate an operation of carriage machinery. In this connection, the determination unit <b>120</b> may correspond to an example of a determination means.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The following description refers to an exemplary case of producing an operation plan of a carrier vehicle when the determination unit <b>120</b> improves a stationary status of carriage targets on a platform via reinforcement learning using rewards relating to a stationary status of carriage targets. When the operation determination device <b>100</b> handles carriage machinery as railway vehicles, it is possible for the determination unit <b>120</b> to use rewards which will be highly evaluated due to a smaller number of users, serving as carriage targets, who may stay on a platform of a railway station.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The determination unit <b>120</b> may use various types of rewards which can quantitatively evaluate a congestion of passengers.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">For example, the determination unit <b>120</b> may calculate a stationary quantity of passengers as a total number of passengers staying on platforms in all the railway stations during stationary times of passengers on platforms of railway stations. Subsequently, the determination unit <b>120</b> may perform reinforcement using rewards which are highly evaluated due to a smaller stationary quantity of passengers.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Alternatively, the determination unit <b>120</b> may calculate a stationary quantity of passengers by totaling the number of passengers staying on a platform for each railway station with respect to all the railway stations. Subsequently, the determination unit <b>120</b> may perform reinforcement learning using rewards which will be highly evaluated due to a smaller stationary quantity of passengers.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The determination unit <b>120</b> is configured to learn setting values input to the module <b>130</b> via reinforcement learning. Herein, learning setting values input to the module <b>130</b> means learning which values to be set and input to the module <b>130</b> according to the status of a transportation system.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A larger number of action patterns in reinforcement learning may cause sparse opportunities to make an evaluation of individual patterns using rewards, which would be regarded as a factor in impeding the progress of learning. When the operation determination device <b>100</b> handles a single entire route of a railway system, it is necessary to consider a large number of operating targets such as railway points, crossings, and signals. When operations of operating targets are directly used as actions in reinforcement learning, it is necessary to consider an enormous number of action patterns, which would be regarded as a factor in impeding the progress of learning. In other words, this may cause an incapacity of performing reinforcement learning efficiently.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">For this reason, the operation determination device <b>100</b> should automate an operation of an operating target using the module <b>130</b> to some extent. This may reduce the number of action patterns in reinforcement learning, thus facilitating learning with ease.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, the module <b>130</b> is configured to set a plurality of parameter values, representing operations executable in part of a transportation system, based on a plurality of input values the number of which is smaller than the number of parameters. Herein, parameters are input parameters for simulation models. The module <b>130</b> or the determination unit <b>120</b> inputs to the simulator <b>110</b> a plurality of parameter values representing an operation subjected to simulation.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the case of a transportation system as a railway system, it is possible to provide the module <b>130</b> for each station and to automate a certain operation for each station to some extent. The determination unit <b>120</b> may instruct the module <b>130</b> to determine whether or not a railway vehicle may loop back at a station allowing for loopback of a railway vehicle. In this case, the module <b>130</b> sets parameter values which can be set at the station based on an instruction as to whether or not to loop back a railway vehicle and a status of the railway vehicle to enter into the station. For example, the module <b>130</b> sets parameter values representing operations of points and signals at the station.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The module <b>130</b> may set parameter values in a rule-based manner. For example, an engineer may manually set prescribed rules as a rule basis with respect to the operation determination device <b>100</b>. The module <b>130</b> selects a rule according to the status of a railway system subjected to simulation, thus setting parameter values representing an operation induced by the selected rule.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">When the module <b>130</b> sets operations with respect to facilities of a station, it is possible to use the status of a railway station when selecting rules, e.g., the status of operating targets such as points and signals at the station and the status of a railway vehicle entering into the station such as the position and the speed of a railway vehicle.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Alternatively, the module <b>130</b> may learn how to set parameters via reinforcement learning. In this case, it is possible to assume that the module <b>130</b> may perform reinforcement learning using rewards differently than rewards used in the determination unit <b>120</b>. For example, it is possible to use rewards which will be highly evaluated upon obtaining results as instructed by input values from the determination unit <b>120</b> in the case of a straight or loopback travel of a railway vehicle.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The aforementioned reinforcement learning may achieve efficient processing by simulating part of a transportation system, e.g., by simulating a railway vehicle and part of a station to be operated by the module <b>130</b> in a railway station.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Alternatively, the module <b>130</b> may learn how to set parameter values via machine learning other than reinforcement learning. For example, the module <b>130</b> may learn how to set parameter values according to genetic algorithms.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The module <b>130</b> may set parameter values responsive to input values from the determination unit <b>120</b> based on constraints used for an operation of a transportation system. For example, the module <b>130</b> may set parameter values according to railway-operation rules and other operation restrictions due to rules of security facilities. For example, the module <b>130</b> may further set parameter values representing operations of railway points according to constraints in which branching directions of points should be limited according to the status of signals.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to an instruction as to whether or not to loop back a railway vehicle at a station and a status of the railway vehicle entering into the station, the module <b>130</b> may determine settings of points and signals via simulation based on constraints relating to settings of signals at the station and other constraints relating to settings of points at the station.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">As an example of constraints relating to settings of signals, it is possible to mention restriction conditions in which a local signal will be turned to a blue signal after a railway vehicle enters into a closed section just before a station yard.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As an example of constraints relating to settings of points, it is possible to mention constraints in which a railway vehicle in an attempt to run straightly may enter a first platform while a railway vehicle in an attempt to loop back at a station may enter a second platform.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the above, the processing of the determination unit <b>120</b> has been described by way of an example to realize the operation of the determination unit <b>120</b> via reinforcement learning; however, the operation determination device <b>100</b> can be realized via mixed integer programming. For example, the operation determination device <b>100</b> may process a problem of an objective function to minimize a quantitative evaluation status of stationary carriage targets under constraints relating to crews who may operate railway vehicles, the number of railway vehicles, and the number of stations according to mixed integer programming or the like, thus calculating parameter values and creating an operation plan based on the calculated parameter values. That is, a methodology of realizing the determination unit <b>120</b> is not necessarily limited to the aforementioned examples.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing an example of data flows in the simulator <b>110</b>. In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the simulator <b>110</b> includes an operation simulator <b>111</b>, a people-flow simulator <b>112</b>, and an entry/exit simulator <b>113</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The operation simulator <b>111</b> is configured to simulate an operation of carriage machinery.
