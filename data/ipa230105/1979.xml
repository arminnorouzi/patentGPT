num="0025">The steering wheel <b>10</b> is disposed facing the driver's seat in the cabin of a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The steering shaft <b>20</b> is a rotating shaft with one end attached to the steering wheel <b>10</b>, and transmits the rotational movement of the steering wheel <b>10</b> to a rack and pinion mechanism configured to convert the rotational motion into translational motion in the vehicle width direction.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The intermediate shaft <b>21</b> and the pinion shaft <b>22</b> are coupled to the end of the steering shaft <b>20</b> on the opposite side from the steering wheel <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Universal joints (Cardan joints) <b>23</b> and <b>24</b>, which can transmit rotation while the shafts are inclined to each other, are provided respectively between the steering shaft <b>20</b> and the intermediate shaft <b>21</b> and between the intermediate shaft <b>21</b> and the pinion shaft <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">On the leading end of the pinion shaft <b>22</b>, a pinion gear configured to mesh with a rack gear <b>31</b> of the rack <b>30</b> and thereby drive the rack <b>30</b> is formed.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The rack <b>30</b> is a columnar member disposed such that the longitudinal direction (axial direction) thereof lies in the vehicle width direction.</p><p

id="p-0037" num="0036">The rack housing <b>40</b> is a substantially cylindrical member that houses and supports the rack <b>30</b> to allow relative displacement of the rack <b>30</b> in the vehicle

the vehicle is a MacPherson strut, for example, the kingpin axis is a virtual axis joining the bearing center of a strut top mount to the center of the ball joint coupling the lower part of the housing <b>60</b> with a transverse link (lower arm).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The housing <b>60</b> revolves about the kingpin axis in response to being pushed or pulled in the vehicle width
