Each lighting fixture has its own particular bracket that must be used to mount the lighting fixture to the pole. This results in a large inventory in brackets which is expensive to maintain.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition to light, lighting sources and the electrical components used to drive the lighting sources generate heat during operation. This heat must be managed to allow for proper operation of the lighting fixture and maximum life of the lighting source and the electrical components.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some embodiments of the invention provide a lighting fixture that can include a pole, a lighting source, and a driver. The pole can be hollow and has a first end and a second end opposite the first end. The lighting source can be mounted to the first end of the pole. The driver can be mounted within the pole at the second end. Electrical wiring can be provided within the pole extending between the lighting source and the driver.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Other embodiments of the invention provide a pole lighting fixture that can include a lighting source and a driver. The driver can be mounted remotely from the lighting source within the pole lighting fixture.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Some embodiments of the invention provide a lighting system for installation on a hollow pole with a top end and a bottom end. The lighting system can include a lighting source, a driver, and electrical wiring. The lighting source can be mounted to the top end of the hollow pole.
