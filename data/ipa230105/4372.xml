In the latter case, the software update system <b>1</b> may include the vehicles <b>10</b> of the same vehicle type or the vehicles <b>10</b> of two or more vehicle types.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The distribution server <b>20</b> (an example of the information processing device and the external device) distributes various data used in the vehicle <b>10</b> to the vehicle <b>10</b>. Specifically, the distribution server <b>20</b> distributes software update data to the vehicle <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">For example, the distribution server <b>20</b> is an on-premise server or a cloud server installed in a monitoring center, or the like, that provides centralized monitoring of the states of the vehicles <b>10</b>. For example, the distribution server <b>20</b> may also be an edge server installed in an area where the vehicles <b>10</b> mainly travel (for example, the area where the vehicles <b>10</b> are legally registered). In this case, two or more distribution servers <b>20</b> may be provided for all the vehicles <b>10</b> included in the software update system <b>1</b>. The same may apply to the analysis server <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As described above, the distribution server <b>20</b> is communicably connected to the vehicle <b>10</b> via the predetermined communication line.

This enables the user terminal <b>40</b> to receive control signals and information signals transmitted from the distribution server <b>20</b>, and to make the user of the vehicle <b>10</b> notice the information included in the signals through a display or a speaker. In response to an input from the user, the user terminal <b>40</b> can also transmit control signals and information signals appropriate to the content of the input to the distribution server so as to inform the request of the user corresponding to the content of the input made by the user to the distribution server <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Hardware Configuration of Software Update System</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Now, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> in addition to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the hardware configuration of the software update system <b>1</b> will be described.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Hardware Configuration of Vehicle</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example of the hardware configuration of the vehicle <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the vehicle <b>10</b> includes the communication device <b>11</b>, the gateway ECU <b>12</b>, the ECU <b>13</b>, a sensor <b>15</b>, an input device <b>17</b>, a display device <b>18</b>, and the central ECU <b>19</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The communication device <b>11</b> communicates with the outside of the vehicle <b>10</b> through a predetermined communication line. For example, the communication device <b>11</b> is a mobile communication module capable of connecting to a mobile communication network that is terminated by a base station to communicate with the outside. Specifically, the communication device <b>11</b> may be a data communication module (DCM). The communication device <b>11</b> is communicably connected to the gateway ECU <b>12</b>, the ECU <b>13</b>, the central ECU <b>19</b>, and the like, via a communication line inside the vehicle <b>10</b>. For example, the communication line inside the vehicle <b>10</b> is a one-to-one communication line or an in-vehicle network. Examples of the in-vehicle network include a controller area network (CAN), a local interconnect network (LIN), FlexRay, and an in-vehicle Ethernet. The communication device <b>11</b> may transmit given signals to the outside in response to commands (requests) from the gateway ECU <b>12</b>, for example. The signals received by the communication device <b>11</b> from the outside are also taken into the gateway ECU <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The gateway ECU <b>12</b> functions as a gateway between the communication line outside the vehicle <b>10</b> and the communication line inside the vehicle <b>10</b> (e.g., in-vehicle network).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The functions of the gateway ECU <b>12</b> may be implemented by any hardware, or by a combination of any hardware and software. For example, the gateway ECU <b>12</b> may have a hardware configuration similar to that of the central ECU <b>19</b> as will be described later. The gateway ECU <b>12</b> may implement various functions by loading programs installed on an auxiliary storage device into a memory device and executing the programs on a central processing unit (CPU). The same may also apply to the ECU <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">For example, the gateway ECU <b>12</b> uses a known method to authenticate that the signal received by the communication device <b>11</b> from the outside is a signal that is transmitted from a regular transmission source and that is untampered. The regular transmission source means a transmission source that is registered as a transmission source in advance (e.g., distribution server <b>20</b>, analysis server <b>30</b>, etc.), or a transmission source that is authenticated in advance through mutual communication. The gateway ECU <b>12</b> transmits only the data of a successfully authenticated signal, among the signals received by the communication device <b>11</b>, to predetermined in-vehicle devices (e.g., ECU <b>13</b>, central ECU <b>19</b>, etc.) via the communication line inside the vehicle <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">For example, the gateway ECU <b>12</b> generates signals including the contents such as predetermined information and commands (requests), as requested by various devices of the vehicle <b>10</b>, and transmits the signals through the communication device <b>11</b> to given destinations (e.g., distribution server <b>20</b> or analysis server <b>30</b>).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">One or more ECUs <b>13</b> are mounted on the vehicle <b>10</b>. The ECUs <b>13</b> perform control relating to various functions of the vehicle <b>10</b>.

The predetermined travel condition under which the virtual simulation of the vehicle <b>10</b> is performed is variable depending on the content of the software update. The effect prediction unit <b>304</b> predicts the effect of the software update based on the result of the virtual simulation using the virtual vehicle model corresponding to the vehicle <b>10</b> after the software update. For example, the effect prediction unit <b>304</b> predicts the effect of the software update by comparing vehicle data that is acquired in an actual vehicle <b>10</b> and uploaded from the vehicle <b>10</b> and the data resulting from virtual simulation corresponding to vehicle data on the vehicle <b>10</b> after update. As a result, the effect prediction unit <b>304</b> can predict the effect of the software update in a relatively simple method on the premise that the existing vehicle data on the vehicle <b>10</b> stored in the analysis server <b>30</b> is the data on the state of the vehicle <b>10</b> before update. The effect prediction unit <b>304</b> may also predict the effect of the software update by comparing the results of virtual simulation using the virtual vehicle models corresponding to the vehicle <b>10</b> before and after software update. In this case, the effect prediction unit <b>304</b> causes the simulator unit <b>303</b> to perform a virtual simulation using the virtual vehicle model corresponding to the vehicle <b>10</b> after update and a virtual simulation using the virtual vehicle model corresponding to the vehicle <b>10</b> before update, under the same conditions. Accordingly, the effect prediction unit <b>304</b> can approximately match the travel conditions or other conditions that are prerequisites of the data to be compared. Therefore, the effect prediction unit <b>304</b> can predict the effect with a higher accuracy.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">The effect prediction unit <b>304</b> may predict the presence or absence of the effect depending on, for example, whether or not an index value improved by software update exceeds a predetermined criterion. The effect prediction unit <b>304</b> may also predict the degree of the effect based on an index value improved by the software update.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">The effect prediction unit <b>304</b> may also choose a method of predicting the effect depending on the content of the software update. Specifically, at the time of predicting the effect obtained by software update, the effect prediction unit <b>304</b> may determine whether or not to perform a virtual simulation based on the virtual vehicle model corresponding to the vehicle <b>10</b> in accordance with the content of the software update. Whether or not to perform the virtual simulation may be prescribed in advance for each piece of the update data, and be determined automatically in accordance with the prescribed content. Whether or not to perform the virtual simulation may be determined using table information or the like, based on the content of the updated data and items of the effect obtained by the software update or the like.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">The effect prediction unit <b>304</b> may also predict the degree of effect in consideration of a period of time that the user uses the vehicle <b>10</b> in the future, for example. The effect prediction unit <b>304</b> may predict the period of time that the user uses the vehicle <b>10</b> in the future with reference to data such as the timing of registering the vehicle <b>10</b> as a new car and the timing of the latest vehicle inspection. For example, in the case where the user is planning to replace the current vehicle <b>10</b> at a relatively close time, the user can be benefited from execution of software update for only a short time, and therefore the effect of the software update may substantially be reduced. Specifically, the effect prediction unit <b>304</b> may set such that as the period of time the user uses the vehicle <b>10</b> in the future is shorter, a criterion for determining that the software update is effective or a criterion for prescribing the degree of the effect is relatively higher. The effect prediction unit <b>304</b> may also predict that the software update is not effective when the period of time that the user uses the vehicle <b>10</b> in the future is less than a predetermined criterion.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">Functional Configuration of User Terminal</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the user terminal <b>40</b> includes a notification unit <b>401</b> as a functional unit.

This allows the user of the vehicle <b>10</b> to be aware of the presence of software update of the vehicle <b>10</b> at the timing when the user is not using the vehicle <b>10</b>.

As a result, the rotation speed of the motor such as an engine or a motor generator is maintained at relatively low speeds. This results in a relatively low energy consumption in the vehicle <b>10</b>, so that fuel efficiency and electric power efficiency are improved. Therefore, the effect prediction unit <b>304</b> can predict that the software update has the effect of reducing energy consumption or that the degree of the effect is relatively high.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">For example, consider the case where the user of the vehicle <b>10</b> relatively frequently uses an operating point <b>504</b> that is in the same vehicle speed range as the operating point <b>503</b> and that is lower in required drive force than the operating point <b>503</b>.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, the control logics for shift change of the transmission before and after the update are the same. Therefore, the time charts <b>701</b>, <b>702</b> and the time charts <b>801</b>, <b>802</b>, which correspond to the control logic, are identical.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, in this example, the control logic for the shift change of the transmission is updated so as to reduce the time (shifting time) from the start of shift change (upshift) (the start of reducing the release pressure command value) to the end of shift change (the end of increasing the engagement pressure command value).</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">In the time chart <b>703</b>, a changing speed (rate of change over time) in rotation speed of the motor (engine) due to the shift change of the transmission is relatively high due to the update of the control logic.

Therefore, in the case of the other vehicle <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the effect prediction unit <b>304</b> can predict that the software update has no effect of improving the shifting speed or that the degree of the effect is relatively low.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">Here, it may be considered that the effect by updating the control logic differs depending on the vehicles <b>10</b> that are mounted with the transmission having the same specifications due to, for example, the influence of viscosity of the lubricants used in the transmission. For example, when commercial lubricants that are more viscous than the lubricants that are filled at shipment from factory are used in the transmission, it may be difficult for the user to sense the improved shifting speed. It may also be considered that the effect of updating the control logic differs depending on the vehicles <b>10</b> that are mounted with the transmission having the same specifications due to, for example, variations in the manufacturing of clutch pack clearance of the transmission. For example, when the clutch pack clearance of the transmission is close to a lower limit within manufacturing tolerances, it may be more difficult for the user to sense the improvement in the shifting speed than when the clutch pack clearance is close to an upper limit. It may also be considered that the effect of updating the control logic differs depending on the vehicles <b>10</b> that are mounted with the transmission having the same specifications due to, for example, the influence of the accumulated number of shifting in the transmission. For example, when the accumulated number of shifting after the vehicle <b>10</b> is shipped from factory or after the transmission is replaced with a new product is relatively small, the clutch pack clearance of the transmission may be relatively smaller than when the accumulated number of shifting is large, which may make it difficult for the user to sense the improved shifting speed. It may also be considered that the effect of updating the control logic differs depending on the vehicles <b>10</b> that are mounted with the transmission having the same specifications due to, for example, the influence of an air leak in solenoid valves that engage and release the clutch and brake of the transmission. For example, when the air leak in the solenoid valves of the transmission is relatively small, the shifting speed is relatively higher than when the air leak is relatively large. Hence, it may be difficult for the user to sense the improved shifting speed even when the control logic is updated. It may also be considered that the effect of updating the control logic differs depending on the vehicles <b>10</b> that are mounted with the transmission having the same specifications due to, for example, the influence of temperature environments where the vehicle <b>10</b> is used. For example, when the vehicle <b>10</b> is used in so-called cold climate where the temperature is very low, the lubricating oil has a higher viscosity than when the vehicle <b>10</b> is used in relatively high temperatures.
