Specifically, the feed assembly <b>10</b> includes a mounting frame <b>18</b> that is pivotably coupled to the boom <b>14</b> and moveable relative thereto via one or more boom actuators <b>22</b> (e.g., hydraulic cylinders, rotary motors, etc.). In general, the mining machine is positioned within a mine and the boom <b>14</b> supports the feed assembly <b>10</b> to be positioned in a desired orientation adjacent a rock face <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, the screen handling system includes a stinger assembly <b>34</b> that is capable of engaging and maneuvering a support member (e.g., a screen <b>30</b> &#x2014; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) against the rock face <b>26</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the stinger assembly <b>34</b> includes a stinger pad <b>38</b> having an aperture <b>42</b>, a finger gripper <b>46</b> that may engage (e.g., hook around a portion of) the mesh screen (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), and a stinger block <b>50</b> that supports the finger gripper cylinder <b>46</b> for movement. Specifically, the finger gripper <b>46</b> is moveable along a stinger axis <b>54</b> between a retracted position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>), in which the finger gripper cylinder <b>46</b> does not extend beyond a front face <b>58</b> of the stinger pad <b>38</b>, and an extended position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), in which the finger gripper cylinder <b>46</b> extends beyond the front face <b>58</b> of the stinger pad <b>38</b> through the aperture <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the gripper <b>46</b> is part of an actuator subassembly <b>48</b>. The gripper <b>46</b> is driven hydraulically between the retracted and the extended position. The gripper <b>46</b> includes a main body <b>62</b> that is at least partially supported within a bore <b>64</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of the stinger block <b>50</b>, a head <b>66</b>, and a neck <b>70</b> positioned between the main body <b>62</b> and the head <b>66</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the head <b>66</b> has a convex or conical profile to facilitate movement of the head <b>66</b> through a wire segment of the screen <b>30</b> and subsequent gripping of the screen <b>30</b> via the head <b>66</b>. The neck <b>70</b> has a reduced-diameter relative to the head <b>66</b>, thereby allowing a portion of the head <b>66</b> (e.g., an outer periphery of the head <b>66</b>) to engage and hold the mesh screen <b>30</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the portion of the head <b>66</b> includes a shoulder <b>72</b> having a plurality of hooks <b>74</b> that extend rearwardly from the head <b>66</b> in a direction parallel to the stinger axis <b>54</b>. Each hook <b>74</b> is configured to hook around a portion of the screen <b>30</b>. The finger gripper <b>46</b> is moved to the extended position, enabling the head <b>66</b> to extend through and engage the screen <b>30</b>. The finger gripper <b>46</b> may then be retracted along the stinger axis <b>54</b> until the portion of the screen <b>30</b> is secured between the head <b>66</b> of the finger gripper <b>46</b> and the front face <b>58</b> of the stinger pad <b>38</b>. The head <b>66</b> protrudes beyond the front face <b>58</b> of the stringer pad <b>38</b> while the screen <b>30</b> is secured due to a mechanical interference with the screen <b>30</b> lodged in the neck <b>70</b>. The screen <b>30</b> may be maneuvered into a desired position and orientation relative to the rock face <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the stinger assembly <b>34</b> further includes a drive mechanism (e.g., hydraulic slew drive <b>78</b>). The hydraulic slew drive mechanism <b>78</b> is supported by the stinger block <b>50</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) and includes a housing <b>82</b>, a worm wheel <b>86</b> disposed within the housing <b>82</b>, and a threaded shaft or worm gear <b>90</b> that engages and drives the worm wheel <b>86</b> for rotation about the stinger axis <b>54</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the worm gear <b>90</b> includes helical teeth <b>92</b> that engage corresponding helical teeth <b>94</b> of the worm wheel <b>86</b>. A gear ratio between the worm gear <b>90</b> and the worm wheel <b>86</b> determines a rotational output of a hydraulic motor <b>98</b> to the worm wheel <b>86</b>. The worm gear <b>90</b> is driven by the hydraulic motor <b>98</b> about a motor axis <b>102</b> that is perpendicular to the stinger axis <b>54</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the stinger pad <b>38</b> is coupled to the worm wheel <b>82</b> (e.g., via bolts <b>89</b>) for co-rotation therewith.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The slew drive mechanism <b>78</b> permits the worm wheel <b>82</b> (and therefore the stinger pad <b>38</b>) to be continuously and completely rotated about the stinger axis <b>54</b> and may be rotated to any number of positions or orientations. Stated another way, the worm gear <b>86</b> can drive the worm wheel <b>82</b> (and therefore the stinger pad <b>38</b>) through virtually infinite rotations. Since the screen <b>30</b> is forcibly held against the stinger pad <b>38</b> by the finger gripper <b>46</b>, the screen <b>30</b> rotates with the stinger pad <b>38</b> and can be precisely oriented and/or positioned relative to the rock face <b>26</b>. When the hydraulic motor <b>98</b> is deactivated, the stinger pad <b>38</b> immediately stops rotating due to a fixed gear ratio between the worm wheel <b>86</b> and the worm gear <b>90</b> even though the screen may exert a reaction torque (e.g., due to rotational inertia) on the stinger pad <b>38</b> when stopped abruptly. In addition, the slew drive mechanism <b>78</b> provides a compact drive mechanism that permits the stinger assembly to have a shorter length than conventional screen handling devices. The compact length reduces the amount of weight that is supported in a cantilevered manner by the boom <b>14</b>, thereby also reducing the counterweight needed to maintain balance for the feed assembly <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, the stinger assembly <b>34</b> is supported on the feed assembly <b>10</b> that is capable of extending and retracting the stinger assembly <b>34</b> along the stinger axis <b>54</b> relative to the mounting frame <b>18</b>. Specifically, a first rail system <b>110</b> couples the feed assembly <b>10</b> for translation relative to the mounting frame <b>18</b>. A feed actuator (e.g. a hydraulic cylinder <b>114</b>) is coupled between the mounting frame <b>18</b> and the feed assembly <b>10</b>, and is actuatable to move the feed assembly <b>10</b> along the first rail system <b>110</b> between a first position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) and a second position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>). In the first position, the stinger assembly <b>34</b> may be spaced away from the rock face <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The feed actuator <b>114</b> can actuate the feed assembly <b>10</b> toward the second position at which the stinger assembly <b>34</b> is positioned adjacent the rock face <b>26</b>. Placing the stinger assembly <b>34</b> against the mine face <b>26</b> (sometimes referred to as &#x201c;stinging the face&#x201d;), the feed assembly <b>10</b> is held stable against the rock face <b>26</b> to inhibit the screen handling system from moving relative to the rock face <b>26</b> during a drilling and bolting operation.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, the feed assembly <b>10</b> further includes a drill feed <b>118</b>, consumable <b>122</b> (e.g., a drill bit, resin cartridge, bolt, etc.), and a second rail system <b>126</b> that supports the drill feed <b>118</b> for translational movement along drill axis <b>130</b>. In some embodiments, the drill feed <b>118</b> rotationally drives (e.g., via a motor) and advances a drill bit <b>122</b> into the rock face <b>26</b> as the drill feed <b>118</b> translates along the second rail system <b>126</b>. A hydraulic actuator, belt drive, or some other linear actuator moves the drill feed <b>118</b> along the second rail system <b>126</b>. In some embodiments, the feed assembly <b>10</b> further includes a cable handler <b>134</b> that facilitates gathering and guiding drill feed cables (not shown) as the drill feed <b>118</b> translates. Once a hole is formed in the rock face <b>26</b>, the drill bit <b>122</b> can be removed from the drill feed <b>118</b> and a resin cartridge and/or rock bolt (not shown) may subsequently be coupled to and driven by the drill feed <b>118</b> through the mesh screen <b>30</b> and into the rock face <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Although the screen handler system is illustrated and described above with respect to a feed assembly, in other embodiments, a similar screen handler system may be supported on a bolting assembly <b>1106</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. The bolting assembly <b>1106</b> may include a stinger assembly <b>34</b> with the hydraulic slew drive mechanism <b>78</b>, the drill feed <b>118</b>, and the rock drill <b>122</b>. Furthermore, the bolting assembly <b>1106</b> may include a carousel <b>1136</b> for holding various tools used during the drilling and bolting operation.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Although the disclosure has been described in detail with reference to certain preferred embodiments, variations and modifications exist within the scope and spirit of one or more independent aspects of the disclosure as described.
