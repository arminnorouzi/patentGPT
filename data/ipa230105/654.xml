Additionally, a significant portion of patients presenting with drop foot often have other comorbidities that may require a customized version of an ankle foot orthoses (&#x201c;AFO&#x201d;) to appropriately treat the condition. The primary reasons for why a patient may need a custom AFO device are: (1) frontal plane instability; (2) plantar flexion contracture; (3) size/weight/activity restrictions; and/or (4) anatomical causes. However, receiving a custom made AFO device can be challenging for several reasons and options for dynamic treatment are limited. These main challenges include: (1) design complexity in building a custom device; (2) the large amount of time that it takes to build a custom AFO device; and (3) the cost and difficulty in getting approval for reimbursement by an insurance company. Additionally, clinicians are often limited in material options, oftentimes choosing a thermoplastic design over, for example, carbon fiber due to the complexity of fabrication which often leads to suboptimal treatment. Historically, custom made AFO devices have been produced in individual clinics, however in recent years, these fabrications have been largely transferred to custom fabrication centers which leads to issues of longer lead times to fit the patient, higher costs associated with shipping casts and braces back and forth, as well as a lack of communication between the patient and the fabricators of the AFO device resulting in, inter alia, increased fitting issues.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, there remains a salient need for an orthotic device that addresses the foregoing problems by providing a dynamic carbon fiber device that can be easily custom made to a patient's model or measurements and physical limitations in a clinical setting that can be manufactured in short amount of time while the patient waits for the AFO to be customized. Ideally, such AFO devices can be made during a single clinical visit while providing the dynamic properties and low strength to weight ratio of carbon fiber that has been traditionally difficult to achieve. Finally, such AFO devices will be cost effective to manufacture, while addressing the challenges of multiplanar stability, fit, plantar flexion contracture and variable level of support in all planes of movement.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure satisfies the foregoing needs by providing, inter alia, an AFO device that address some or all of the foregoing deficiencies as well as methods of their manufacture and methods of their use.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, an ankle foot orthosis (AFO) is disclosed.

Finally, it would be readily understood to one of ordinary skill given the contents of the present disclosure that the soft goods illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>13</b>C</figref> may be utilized in combination with the AFO's shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>3</b>I</figref>, and/or alternatively from the inner boots <b>140</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>G-<b>1</b>I, <b>1</b>K-<b>1</b>P, <b>1</b>S, <b>1</b>T, <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref> and <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>I. These and other variants would be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill given the contents of the present disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Exemplary Ankle Foot Support Structures</heading><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, one exemplary ankle foot orthoses (AFO) <b>100</b> is shown and described in detail. As discussed herein, the terms posterior, anterior, lateral and medial are used to describe the positioning of certain features of the AFO devices <b>100</b> described herein. The use of these terms is synonymous with the use of those terms with respect to the anatomy of the wearer and would be understood as such given the contents of the present disclosure. The AFO <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is also known as a posterior AFO in that the strut assembly <b>120</b> illustrated in, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is designed to exit the foot plate <b>104</b> near the hind foot of the wearer of the AFO <b>100</b> where the strut <b>102</b> spirals around the ankle of the wearer and extends upward posterior to the wearer's lower leg. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the strut <b>102</b> exits on the lateral side of the foot plate <b>104</b>, although it would be appreciated that alternative variants may exit on the medial side of the foot plate <b>104</b>. Such a variant would be dependent upon the physical condition of the wearer that the AFO <b>100</b> is intended for. The AFO <b>100</b> may also consist of an inner boot assembly <b>140</b>, a spiral support strap assembly <b>160</b> (also known as a so-called &#x201c;helix band&#x201d;), and a calf piece assembly <b>180</b>.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B-<b>1</b>E</figref>, various features of the strut assembly <b>120</b> are shown and described in detail. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the strut assembly <b>120</b> may include a strut <b>102</b> that may be manufactured from carbon fiber material and a foot plate <b>104</b> that may also be constructed from carbon fiber. The trimmable toe area <b>108</b> of the foot plate <b>104</b> may be made from, for example, fiber glass. One beneficial function for the trimmable toe area <b>108</b> is to allow for the trimming of the foot plate assembly <b>110</b> to enable the foot plate assembly <b>110</b> to accommodate a variety of differing foot sizes. The formable layer <b>106</b> of the strut assembly <b>120</b> may be manufactured from, for example, a thermoplastic material or other formable or moldable materials which enables for trimming (again to accommodate a wide variety of differing anatomies) as well as the ability for this formable layer <b>106</b> to be molded around the foot of a wearer thereby providing for additional support to the wearer (as shown in, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the formable layer <b>106</b> may be positioned underneath the foot plate <b>104</b>, although it would be readily appreciated that the formable layer <b>106</b> may be positioned above the foot plate <b>104</b> in some implementations. The formable layer <b>106</b> may be modified into a variety of shapes to capture more (or less) foot area for a given wearer of the AFO <b>100</b> as one beneficial function of the AFO <b>100</b> is to enable a single design (or a limited subset of designs) to accommodate a wide variety of user anatomies.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Referring now <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>C and <b>1</b>D</figref>, the strut assembly <b>120</b> may be manufactured using a variety of different methodologies. The foot plate <b>104</b> may also include a recess <b>174</b> to accommodate the strap (<b>154</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>H</figref>) that is used to secure the inner boot <b>142</b> to the strut assembly <b>120</b>. For example, in one exemplary methodology, the foot plate <b>104</b>, the trimmable toe area <b>108</b>, and the formable layer <b>106</b> may be assembled into a double-sided tool where resins are added, and heat and pressure are applied. See also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>V</figref>. Such a manufacturing methodology may be advantageous in that the entire foot plate assembly <b>110</b> for the strut assembly <b>120</b> may be manufactured in a single step. Such a methodology enables for precise tolerances to be maintained on the bonding and layering of, for example, the carbon fiber, thermoplastic and fiberglass materials. As but another non-limiting manufacturing methodology, the foot plate <b>104</b> and trimmable toe area <b>108</b> may be pressed (and/or bonded) together in a first processing step. The formable layer <b>106</b> may then be over molded over the top, over the bottom, and/or on the edges of the foot plate <b>104</b>/trimmable toe area <b>108</b> layers and/or around the entire foot plate <b>104</b> or a combination of the foregoing techniques. See also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>W</figref>. In some implementations, attachment geometries may be added to the foot plate <b>104</b> and/or trimmable toe area <b>108</b> to ensure that the formable layer <b>106</b> adheres properly during over molding thereby creating the final foot plate assembly <b>110</b>. For example, the foot plate <b>104</b> may include a lip on the edge of the foot plate <b>104</b> and/or holes located throughout the foot plate <b>104</b> which allows the formable layer <b>106</b> to strongly bond around the foot plate <b>104</b>. In some implementations, the formable layer <b>106</b> may be separately molded from other portions of the foot plate assembly <b>110</b> and glued or otherwise attached to the foot plate assembly <b>110</b>. Other manufacturing methodologies may be envisioned given the contents of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Regardless of the specific manufacturing methodology chosen, such methodologies enable the foot plate <b>104</b> to be universal (or near universal) to a variety of different anatomies, while the formable <b>106</b> and trimmable toe area <b>108</b> layers may accommodate a wide variety of users and can be adjusted for a particular anatomy outside of a traditional manufacturing setting. Such methodologies enable quick, easy and consistent adjustments to be made as compared with a custom carbon fiber AFO that needs to be produced in a manufacturing setting. In other words, the AFO <b>100</b> of the present disclosure may be much more efficient to produce for a particular wearer as compared with a carbon fiber footplate that must be molded into shape based on a particular user's anatomy. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref> illustrates the formable layer <b>106</b> being molded post-production so that this formable layer <b>106</b> can be shaped around a user's foot.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F</figref>, an exploded view of an exemplary calf piece assembly <b>180</b> is shown and described in detail. As shown, the calf piece assembly <b>180</b> includes a calf strap <b>186</b> with a rotary tensioning mechanism that helps secure the calf piece assembly <b>180</b> around the calf of a wearer of the AFO <b>100</b>. In some implementations, the calf strap <b>186</b> may include strapping with, for example, hook and loop fasteners such that the calf strap <b>186</b> may be tightened around, for example, a D-ring located on the calf shell <b>182</b>. The calf piece assembly <b>180</b> may also include a calf shell <b>182</b> and a liner <b>184</b>. The calf piece assembly <b>180</b> may be secured to the strut <b>102</b> via, for example, the use of one or more threaded bolts <b>188</b> and one or more nuts <b>190</b> or other attachment mechanisms. The calf piece assembly <b>180</b> may also include a head/nut cover <b>192</b> for covering a portion of the strut <b>102</b> and, for example, the nut <b>190</b>/bolt <b>188</b> which attaches the calf piece assembly <b>180</b> to the strut <b>102</b>. A removable cap <b>187</b> may also cover a keyhole <b>170</b> located on the back of the calf piece assembly <b>180</b>. The keyhole <b>170</b> may serve as an attachment point for the spiral strap (<b>164</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>K</figref>). When the spiral strap is not being used, the removable cap <b>187</b> may remain in place on the calf shell <b>182</b>. However, when the spiral strap is being used, the removable cap <b>187</b> may be removed from the calf shell <b>182</b> exposing the keyhole <b>170</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In some implementations, the calf shell <b>182</b> may be manufactured from a heat-formable thermoplastic that is over-molded around a cold formable material such as, for example, aluminum. In such an implementation, the calf piece assembly <b>180</b> may be adjustable in circumference enabling the calf piece assembly <b>180</b> to fit a wide variety of anatomies making the calf piece assembly <b>180</b> universal in nature. In such an implementation, the areas around the keyholes <b>194</b> and the portion of the calf piece assembly <b>180</b> that interfaces with the strut <b>102</b> may be non-deformable in nature, especially in implementations in which the calf piece assembly <b>180</b> (and in particular, the calf shell <b>182</b>) are heated in order to mold the calf piece assembly <b>180</b> into shape in order to adapt to a specific anatomy for the wearer. In some implementations, the calf piece assembly <b>180</b> can be molded into shape without requiring the application of heat. For example, an aluminum stay may be over molded with a flexible polymer. In such an implementation, an aluminum stay (or bending irons) can be bent to shape using, for example, the hands of a certified clinician without necessarily requiring the application of heat to the calf shell <b>182</b>.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In some implementations, the liner <b>184</b> may include a thermoplastic layer that is disposed inside of the liner <b>184</b> which can be bent to shape using, for example, heat. The thermoplastic layer may be placed in the middle of the back of the liner <b>184</b> which allows the liner <b>184</b> to be customizable to accommodate a wide variety of differing anatomies. The liner <b>184</b> may also be utilized as a guide when shaping the thermoplastic (and/or cold formable materials) located in the calf piece <b>182</b>. The calf piece <b>182</b> may also be manufactured from a high temperature thermoplastic that is over molded with a lower temperature thermoplastic in areas that need to be formed. For example, the main body portion <b>183</b> of the calf piece <b>182</b> (as well as areas surrounding the key holes <b>194</b> in some implementations) may be primarily formed from a high temperature thermoplastic, while other portions of the calf piece <b>182</b> such as the wing portions <b>185</b> of the calf piece <b>182</b> may be primarily manufactured from a thermoplastic. Such an implementation may enable the calf piece assembly <b>180</b> to be formed to accommodate a wide variety of user anatomies using, for example, heat for the shaping of the calf piece <b>182</b>. The liner <b>184</b> may be attached to the calf shell <b>182</b> using, for example, hook and loop fasteners, magnets on the liner <b>184</b> and/or shell <b>182</b>, snap fits, and/or injection molded hooks that are permanently molded into the calf shell <b>182</b> or snapped into the calf shell <b>182</b> after forming the calf piece assembly <b>180</b>. Other attachment methodologies may be utilized as well with the primary goal being the alignment of the liner <b>184</b> to the calf shell <b>182</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F</figref> also illustrates a calf shell <b>182</b> that is designed in a generic relatively flat shape so that a clinician can mold the calf shell <b>182</b> to fit a variety of anatomical shapes as described elsewhere herein.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>G-<b>1</b>I</figref>, an implementation of the inner boot assembly <b>140</b> is shown and described in detail. The inner boot assembly <b>140</b> may consist of an inner boot <b>142</b> as well as a dorsum strap <b>150</b>. The inner boot <b>142</b> may consist of a thermoformable polymer in some implementations. For example, the inner boot <b>142</b> may be constructed from polyethylene or a co-polymer polypropylene which has moderate rigidity, excellent formability, and good stress crack resistance. Direct attachment of straps, such as the dorsum strap <b>150</b>, to the inner boot <b>142</b> involves the utilization of slots <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>147</b> on the inner boot <b>142</b>. Plugs manufactured from, for example, silicone or other suitable materials may be inserted into the slots <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>147</b> during heat forming of the inner boot <b>142</b> to prevent the distortion of these slots <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>147</b> during the heat forming process.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">The inner boot <b>142</b> may be attachable to the foot plate <b>104</b> via, for example, the formable layer <b>106</b> located on the foot plate <b>104</b>. Other methodologies may include the use of hook and loop fasteners, rivets or snap fit mechanisms, the molding of a thin strap onto the foot plate <b>104</b> (or inner boot <b>142</b>) and/or a moldable foot plate with a mechanism to lock down the strap/inner boot, thereby resulting in the anchoring of the inner boot <b>142</b> to the foot plate <b>104</b>. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>R through <b>1</b>T</figref>, one such attachment methodology is illustrated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>R</figref> illustrates an attachment point <b>173</b> for the strap <b>175</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>S</figref>. The attachment point <b>173</b> may allow the strap <b>175</b> to be attached to the foot plate <b>104</b> using an adhesive, hook and loop fasteners, screws, snap fit features, and/or other means of attachment. The strap <b>175</b> may then be routed around the edge of the foot plate <b>104</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>S</figref>, where it is anchored to the inner boot <b>142</b> at anchor point <b>177</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>T</figref> at the posterior plantar surface of the inner boot <b>142</b>.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In some implementations, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>H</figref>, the inner boot <b>142</b> may also include a posterior slot <b>156</b>. The back strap (<b>154</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>H</figref>) may be secured to the interior bottom surface of the inner boot <b>142</b> (e.g., near the hind foot region for the wearer of the inner boot <b>142</b>). The back strap (<b>154</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>H</figref>) may be secured to the inner boot <b>142</b> using, for example, a pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA), rivets, bolts, sewing and other types of attachment mechanisms for securing the back strap (<b>154</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>H</figref>) to the inner boot <b>142</b>. The back strap (<b>154</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>H</figref>) may be threaded through the posterior slot <b>156</b> and around the posterior portion of the foot plate <b>104</b>. The back strap (<b>154</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>H</figref>) may be trimmed to length so that the end of the back strap <b>154</b> fits within the recess <b>174</b> of the foot plate <b>104</b>. The back strap (<b>154</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>H</figref>) may be secured to the underside of the foot plate <b>104</b> using PSA, rivets, bolts, sewing and other types of attachment mechanisms for securing the back strap (<b>154</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>H</figref>) to the foot plate <b>104</b>. The length of the back strap (<b>154</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>H</figref>) may be adjustable to enable, for example, a heel wedge or other lifting components to be inserted between the inner boot <b>142</b> and the foot plate <b>104</b>. The use of a heel wedge or other lifting components may be dependent upon the specific requirements for the wearer of the AFO <b>100</b>. The underside of the inner boot <b>142</b> may also include an attachment point <b>158</b> at an anterior portion of the inner boot <b>142</b>. The purpose of this attachment point <b>158</b> is to secure the inner boot <b>142</b> to the foot plate <b>104</b> and to ensure the inner boot <b>142</b> is in correct alignment. This alignment of the inner boot <b>142</b> within the AFO <b>100</b> may be critical dependent upon a given patient's anatomy and needs and will also ensure that the inner boot <b>142</b> does not shift when worn by the patient.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">As perhaps best viewed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>H</figref>, the inner boot <b>142</b> may include a plurality of slots <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>147</b>. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>H</figref>, the inner boot <b>142</b> may include a pair of dorsum strap slots <b>144</b>, a pair of mid-foot/fore foot strap slots <b>146</b>, and a pair of calcaneus strap slots <b>147</b>. The mid-foot/fore foot strap slots <b>146</b> and calcaneus strap slots <b>147</b> are oriented such that the longest dimension for these slots <b>146</b>, <b>147</b> runs generally parallel with the bottom plane of the inner boot <b>142</b>, while the dorsum strap slots <b>144</b> are oriented at an angle with respect to the bottom plane of the inner boot <b>142</b>. This angle may be between 0&#xb0; and 90&#xb0;, may be between 30&#xb0; and 60&#xb0;, or may be approximately 45&#xb0;. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>I</figref>, the dorsum strap <b>150</b> is threaded through one of the dorsum strap slots <b>144</b> such that the stopper <b>152</b> on the dorsum strap <b>150</b> is situated on the interior surface of the inner boot <b>142</b>. As a brief aside, and in some implementations, the dorsum strap <b>150</b> may consist of two layers of webbing material. When the two layers of webbing material are routed into the stopper <b>152</b>, one layer will protrude upwards into the stopper <b>152</b>, while the other layer will protrude downwards into the stopper <b>152</b>. The stopper <b>152</b> itself may be manufactured using a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) that is molded around the two layers of webbing for the dorsum strap <b>150</b>. In some implementations, a single layer of webbing may be utilized in a similar fashion by having portions of the webbing protrude upwards into the stopper <b>152</b>, while other portions of the webbing may protrude downwards into the stopper <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In some implementations, the stopper <b>152</b> may be positioned within a cavity feature located around the dorsum strap slots <b>144</b> to reduce the amount that the stopper <b>152</b> protrudes into the interior of the inner boot <b>142</b>. The dorsum strap <b>150</b> is then routed over the top of the inner boot <b>142</b> where it is routed through the opposing dorsum strap slot <b>144</b>. After being routed through the opposing dorsum strap slot <b>144</b>, the dorsum strap <b>150</b> may be tightened around the foot of the wearer of the inner boot <b>142</b> using, for example, hook and loop fasteners although other fastening mechanisms such as buttons, hooks and the like may be utilized in alternative variants.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In some implementations, the respective stoppers <b>162</b> located on the spiral strap <b>164</b> and the calcaneus strap <b>165</b> may be constructed and function similar to the stopper <b>152</b> located on the dorsum strap <b>150</b> as described supra. However, in some implementations, the calcaneus strap <b>165</b> and the spiral strap <b>164</b> enter from the exterior of the calcaneus strap slot <b>146</b> and the mid-foot/fore foot strap slot <b>147</b>, respectively such that the respective stoppers <b>162</b> are positioned on the exterior surface of the inner boot <b>142</b>. In some implementations, the positioning of the straps <b>164</b>, <b>165</b> may be reversed such that the spiral strap <b>164</b> and the calcaneus strap <b>165</b> enter from the exterior of the calcaneus strap slot <b>147</b> and the mid-foot/fore foot strap slot <b>146</b>, respectively. In some implementations, the spiral strap <b>164</b> may be longer than the calcaneus strap <b>165</b>. In such an implementation, the spiral strap <b>164</b> may be routed between the inner boot <b>142</b> and the calf piece assembly <b>180</b>, while the calcaneus strap <b>165</b> may be routed between the inner boot <b>142</b> and the spiral strap <b>164</b>.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">The spiral strap <b>164</b> and the calcaneus strap <b>165</b> may enter the inner boot <b>142</b> on either or both of the medial side <b>141</b> and the lateral side <b>143</b>. For example, the calcaneus strap slot <b>147</b> and the mid-foot/fore foot strap slot <b>146</b> enable the spiral strap <b>164</b> and the calcaneus strap <b>165</b> to be located in left and/or right orientations for the wearer of the AFO <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>M</figref>, the spiral strap <b>164</b> and the calcaneus strap <b>165</b> are then routed between the foot of the wearer of the AFO <b>100</b> and the interior of the inner boot <b>142</b>. Accordingly, both the spiral strap <b>164</b> and the calcaneus strap <b>165</b> are routed around the underside of the wearer of the AFO's <b>100</b> foot. Cavities around the perimeter of the calcaneus strap slot <b>147</b> and the mid-foot/fore foot strap slot <b>146</b> may reduce the profile of the stoppers <b>162</b> located on the spiral strap <b>164</b> and the calcaneus strap <b>165</b>, so as to enable the AFO <b>100</b> to more comfortably be received within a shoe. In some implementations, the spiral strap <b>164</b> and the calcaneus strap <b>165</b> may be routed external to the inner boot (i.e., around and/or under the inner boot <b>142</b>). These straps may all be trimmable to accommodate a variety of anatomical sizes for the patient's wearing these AFOs <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>J</figref> illustrates one implementation of the spiral strap <b>164</b> that includes a stopper <b>162</b> that is configured to be received within either (or both) of the slots <b>146</b>, <b>147</b> located on the inner boot <b>142</b>. In some implementations, the stopper <b>162</b> is attached using a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) bonding technique onto the spiral strap <b>164</b> as disclosed supra, although other attachment mechanisms such as compression molding, gluing, sewing, riveting, and the like may be utilized in addition to, or alternatively than the aforementioned TPU bonding technique. The spiral strap <b>164</b> may include an adjustable strap hook <b>166</b> at an opposing end of the support strap <b>164</b> in the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>J</figref>.

One primary purpose of the dorsum strap <b>150</b> is to keep the heel of the wearer planted inside of the inner boot <b>142</b> and prevent the foot of the wearer from moving inside of the inner boot <b>142</b>. Having slots <b>146</b>, <b>147</b> located on both sides of the inner boot <b>142</b> allow for the spiral strap <b>164</b> and/or the calcaneus strap <b>165</b> to be positioned to address varus and/or valgus deformities. In some implementations, the dorsum slot <b>147</b> is positioned at an approximately 45&#xb0; angle with respect to the bottom of the inner boot <b>142</b> and allows for the dorsum strap <b>150</b> to provide stability to maintain the calcaneus in place in the inner boot <b>142</b>.

By placing the strap <b>164</b> between the foot of the wearer and the inner boot <b>142</b>, the strap is able to properly capture the arch of the foot of the wearer. In some implementations, the strapping configuration may be reversed so that the spiral strap <b>164</b> enters the lateral side <b>143</b> of the inner boot <b>142</b>, crosses underneath the foot of the wearer and attaches to the inner boot <b>142</b> on the medial side <b>141</b>. In some implementations, both strapping configurations (i.e., one strap <b>164</b> entering the medial side <b>141</b> and another strap <b>164</b> entering the lateral side <b>143</b>) may be utilized.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>M</figref> illustrates another variant to the strapping configuration similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>L</figref>.

Similar to that described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>L</figref>, the calcaneus strap <b>165</b> may enter from the medial side <b>141</b> as shown, may enter from the lateral side <b>143</b> or may include two calcaneus straps <b>165</b> with one entering from the lateral side <b>143</b> and one entering from the medial side <b>141</b>. Additionally, while the spiral strap <b>164</b> and the calcaneus strap <b>165</b> are illustrated being routed internal to the inner boot <b>142</b>, it would be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill given the contents of the present disclosure that these straps <b>164</b>, <b>165</b> may be routed external to the inner boot <b>142</b> in some implementations.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>N and <b>1</b>O</figref> illustrate the strapping configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>M</figref> from a lateral and medial perspective, respectively. Note in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>O</figref> that the spiral strap <b>164</b> and the calcaneus strap <b>165</b> avoid the ankle of the wearer to reduce abrasion and improve comfort for the wearer. Additionally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>N</figref> illustrates how the calcaneus strap <b>165</b> attaches around the calcaneus of the wearer, while the spiral strap <b>164</b> can attach directly opposite of the arch or may be attached closer to the metatarsals to create three solid points of pressure leverage to the foot of the wearer. As but one non-limiting example, when the ankle pronates, the fifth ray shifts upwards and by attaching the spiral strap <b>164</b> around the fifth ray, the spiral strap <b>164</b> will dynamically pull the fifth ray downwards at the same time the spiral strap <b>164</b> pulls the arch of the foot upwards. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>N and <b>1</b>O</figref>, these two straps <b>164</b>/<b>165</b> are shown entering the medial side of the foot and attaching to the inner boot <b>142</b> on the lateral side of the foot (i.e., configured for a pronated position), though these configurations may be reversed (i.e., enter laterally and connect medially to control a supinated position) or combined in some implementations (i.e., to control both pronated and supinated positions). These and other strapping configurations would be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill given the contents of the present disclosure. Pads may be added in some implementations and may be adjusted and formed to the patient's anatomy in combination with the spiral strap <b>164</b> and the calcaneus strap <b>165</b>. These pads may be manufactured from, for example, foam and/or a thermoplastic and are placed in a strategic area to create the three points of pressure from all planes in the foot to correct the foot from a pronounced position into a neutral position. In other words, the spiral strap <b>164</b> and the calcaneus strap <b>165</b> in combination with the pads <b>167</b> create the most effective loading condition, while minimizing points of abrasion along the foot of the wearer. These and other strapping configurations would be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill given the contents of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>X-<b>1</b></figref> illustrates a condition in which the foot pronates, and the heel falls out laterally.

While primarily discussed in the context of the AFO <b>100</b> shown and described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>X-<b>6</b></figref>, it would be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill given the contents of the present disclosure that certain ones of the following steps of the process may be utilized in combination with the ankle foot support structures also illustrated with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>3</b>I</figref>. The following discussion is also primarily described with a certified orthopedic professional being able to perform the following steps in a clinical setting (as opposed to a manufacturing setting), although it would be readily apparent that alternative individuals or settings may be utilized in alternative variants. Moreover, while embodiments described herein our primarily described in the context of formable polymers that may be activated using, for example, heat and/or formable stays, it would be readily appreciated by one of ordinary skill given the contents of the present disclosure that the methodologies described herein are not so limited. For example, many of the parts described herein could be readily manufactured using three-dimensional (3D) printing technologies. As such, the anatomy for a given wearer of AFO <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> may be determined using 3D scanners where the measurements taken may in turn be used to 3D print, for example, the inner boot <b>142</b> and/or the formable layer <b>106</b> of the foot plate <b>104</b>. These and other variants would be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill given the contents of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">One exemplary methodology for the customization of an AFO is shown in FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>Q, a clinician may have the patient position their leg at an angle of approximately 90 degrees between the patient's thigh and the patient's lower leg. At step <b>402</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, the clinician may mark the mid belly of the patient's calf which will mark the position of the top of the calf piece assembly <b>180</b> for optimal alignment of the AFO <b>100</b>. The strut may then be trimmed in accordance with the determined correct calf height in some implementations (i.e., in variants in which a given strut is designed to accommodate larger disparities in anatomy between users of the AFO <b>100</b>). The clinician may also mark bony prominences on the patient where pads may be placed on the patient to provide relief prior to casting the lower leg of the patient. At step <b>404</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, the clinician may then take a cast of the patient's lower leg and ensure that sufficient casting material has been placed around the foot and calf area of the patient. As the cast hardens, the clinician may adjust and correct the patient's foot in the cast to ensure proper alignment. This adjustment and correction may be critical to ensure that the cast is taken correctly to ensure the AFO <b>100</b> functions as intended. As the cast sets, the clinician may place the casted leg onto the frame of the AFO <b>100</b> at step <b>406</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>. The strut <b>102</b> and foot plate <b>104</b> of the AFO <b>100</b> may act as a casting board and ensure the foot and leg are casted in the correct position, although in some variants a separate casting board may be utilized. In some implementations, a heel wedge may be placed under the strut during the casting process to accommodate the shoes of the patient or otherwise at the clinician's discretion for other anatomical reasons.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In some implementations, and as shown at step <b>424</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>L</figref>, a certified orthopedic professional may have the patient put their foot and insole on tracing paper, where their foot is traced. Various metatarsal and calcaneus locations will also be marked and labeled on the tracing paper. As shown at step <b>426</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>M</figref>, the tracing performed above may be cut from the sheet of tracing paper. The cut tracing will be applied to the surface of the foot plate <b>104</b> and the foot plate <b>104</b> will next be trimmed. The trimming of the foot plate may be accomplished using standard scissors or other cutting tools.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In some implementations, after the cast material sets, the cast may be removed from the patient's leg. For example, the cast may be divided into two (or more) pieces. After removal, the cast is placed back together and the cast is reinforced using, for example, staples, tape and/or other fastening means in order to hold the removed cast together. This cast may then be subsequently used as a patient model and various ones of the AFO components may be molded around this taken cast.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">With the cast removed from the patient's leg, the inner boot <b>142</b> may be placed around the foot of the cast at step <b>428</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>N</figref>. The inner boot <b>142</b> walls may be marked to indicate where the inner boot <b>142</b> may be trimmed to fit the patient's anatomy and treatment needs. The inner boot side <b>142</b> walls are then trimmed in accordance with the markings that have been placed onto the inner boot <b>142</b> walls. At step <b>408</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>, heat is then applied to the inner boot using, for example, a heat gun and pressure is then applied to the heated inner boot <b>142</b> using, for example, the hands of the clinician to mold the inner boot <b>142</b> to the patient's cast. The inner boot <b>142</b> may also be heated in an oven, hot water, or other suitable heating methods. The foot plate portion of the inner boot may also be trimmed to match the patient's shoe insole and/or based on the patient's treatment needs. The trimmed portions of the inner boot <b>142</b> are then smoothed using, for example, a sanding block, rotary tool, or other suitable tools available to the clinician.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">At step <b>410</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref>, the molded inner boot <b>142</b> and cast are then placed onto the AFO footplate <b>104</b>. The clinician may then mark the first and fifth metatarsal heads, the outline of the patient's foot and any other areas that will be formed around the patient's anatomy for treatment. The clinician may also draw the size and shape for the metatarsal supports at the front of the footplate. The size and shape of the calcaneus portion of the cast may also be drawn onto the back of the footplate. The footplate may then be trimmed in accordance with these markings and the trimmed footplate is then heated with, for example, a heat gun to mold the footplate around the inner boot <b>142</b> that has been placed onto the cast. The trimmed edges of the footplate may then be smoothed using, for example, a sanding block, rotary tool, or other suitable tools available to the clinician.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">At step <b>412</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>F</figref>, the calf cuff may then be fabricated to match the anatomy of the patient. For example, based on the patient's calf circumference measurement, the calf cuff (in its flattened state) may be trimmed and smoothed using, for example, a sanding block, rotary tool, or other suitable tools available to the clinician. The calf cuff may then be slid onto the strut and slid to the appropriate marking that was marked that corresponds to the mid belly of the patient's calf that was previously placed onto the cast. The calf cuff is then secured to the strut using, for example, the aforementioned fastening mechanism with the calf cuff placed at the appropriate height. The calf cuff is then heated using, for example, a heat gun and the calf cuff is then molded around the cast. The calf strap is then attached to the calf cuff and subsequently tightened around the cast to hold the calf cuff in place. The excess calf strap is then trimmed to remove excess material so that the calf strap properly conforms to the patient's cast. The calf strap is then loosened and then re-fastened to ensure appropriate adjustments have been made. The AFO is subsequently removed from the cast. At step <b>414</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>G</figref>, subsequent to AFO removal from the cast, the liner(s) are attached to the inside of the calf cuff ensuring that all edges of the calf cuff are sufficiently padded for patient comfort. The liner(s) may be repositioned by moving the attachment points between the calf cuff and liner(s) as needed to ensure proper alignment. At steps <b>430</b> and <b>432</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>O and <b>4</b>Q</figref>, a clinician may also use elastic bands or wrapping to hold components to the cast during the forming process. They may heat and form the inner boot, the foot plate and the calf cuff first and then remove the cast and trim and smooth all edges.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">At step <b>416</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>H</figref>, the inner boot <b>142</b> may then be attached to the foot plate <b>104</b> of the AFO <b>100</b>. Webbing may be fed through the inner boot slots towards the posterior portion of the inner boot. The webbing may then be routed around the posterior end of the foot plate <b>104</b> and secured to the underside of the footplate using, for example, hook and loop fasteners, a pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA), or other suitable attachment means. If necessary, the strap that secures the inner boot to the footplate may be trimmed as necessary to accommodate the size of the patient's foot or to accommodate the addition of a heel wedge to the assembly. With the inner boot attached to the AFO, the AFO may then be placed onto the cast and the inner boot is aligned to the footplate based on the patient's anatomy and treatment needs using the aforementioned fastening mechanisms.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">At step <b>418</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>I</figref>, the dorsum strap may then be attached to the inner boot by placing the dorsum strap through the slot located on the inner boot so that, for example, the stopper (e.g., TPU edge) of the dorsum strap is located on the inside surface of the inner boot. The dorsum strap may then be tightened around the patient's cast and excess strap material on the dorsum strap may then be trimmed. A tab cover may be placed over the trimmed edge of the dorsum strap to assist the patient with donning and doffing of the AFO <b>100</b>. For example, the tab cover may be attached to the dorsum strap using hook and loop fasteners, adhesives, sewing, or other suitable attachment mechanisms.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">At step <b>420</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>J</figref>, the spiral strap <b>164</b> and/or calcaneus strap <b>165</b> may then be fed through the slots <b>146</b>/<b>147</b> on the inner boot <b>142</b> and then tightened. Excess material on the spiral strap <b>164</b> and/or calcaneus strap may then be trimmed, and a tab cover may be applied to cover the trimmed edges. The tab covers may also assist the patient with donning and doffing of the AFO <b>100</b>.
