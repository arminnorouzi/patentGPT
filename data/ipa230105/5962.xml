The driving circuit film <b>100</b> includes a flexible substrate <b>110</b>, a gate driving circuit <b>120</b>, and a source driver <b>130</b>. The gate driving circuit <b>120</b> and the source driver <b>130</b> are both disposed on the flexible substrate <b>110</b>. For example, the flexible substrate <b>110</b> is a film formed by Polyimide (PI). The gate driving circuit <b>120</b> includes Low Temperature Poly-silicon Thin-Film Transistor (LTPS-TFT) or Oxide Thin-Film Transistor.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">A driving circuit (not shown) of the gate driving circuit <b>120</b> is directly formed on the flexible substrate <b>110</b> through a deposition process, and the gate driving circuit <b>120</b> is not an integrated circuit (IC). The gate driving circuit <b>120</b> is not bonded to the display panel <b>200</b> with electrical connection elements (e.g., conductive bumps or solder balls) through soldering. The source driver <b>130</b> is an integrated circuit. The source driver <b>130</b> is electrically connected to the flexible substrate <b>110</b> through electrical connection elements.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Specifically, by using the LTPS-TFT as an example, the manufacturing process of the gate driving circuit <b>120</b> may start by supporting the flexible substrate <b>110</b> temporarily with a carrier. Depositing a barrier layer on the flexible substrate <b>110</b> to avoid damage from laser light in the subsequent laser process. Continuously, the amorphous silicon (a-Si) material is deposited on the barrier layer, and the amorphous silicon material is transformed to the poly-silicon material through laser at low temperature. Lastly, the flexible substrate <b>110</b> is separated from the carrier through laser. In other words, design of the driving circuit film <b>100</b> of the present disclosure combines a thin film transistor and a driver on the same flexible substrate <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In a conventional chip on film (COF) process, a gate driver and a source driver are bonded on a flexible printed circuit board (FPC) through electrical connection element. However, it is difficult to reduce circuit pitch in a COF process, and therefore the circuit line precision of the driver boned on the flexible printed circuit board is limited.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In other words, the present disclosure can replace the conventional chip on film process by directly forming the gate driving circuit <b>120</b> on the flexible substrate <b>110</b>. Since the process precision of the LTPS-TFT or the oxide TFT is higher, the circuit pitch of the gate driving circuit <b>120</b> is more precise. The interval between the electrical connection elements of the source driver <b>130</b> disposed on the flexible substrate <b>110</b> (e.g., interval between the bumps) can be reduced to about 10 um. Therefore, design of the driving circuit film <b>100</b> have advantages like volume reduction, weight reduction and folding freely.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a top view of a display device <b>10</b> according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. The display device <b>10</b> includes a display panel <b>200</b> and the driving circuit film <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The display panel <b>200</b> includes a display region DR and a periphery region PR. The periphery region PR surrounds the display region DR. The periphery region PR of the display panel <b>200</b> includes a frame <b>210</b>. The frame <b>210</b> are formed by four borders <b>210</b><i>a</i>-<b>210</b><i>d</i>. The flexible substrate <b>110</b> of the driving circuit film <b>100</b> has a first side <b>112</b>. The first side <b>112</b> of the driving circuit film <b>100</b> is configured to be bonded at the border <b>210</b><i>a </i>at the right-hand side of the display panel <b>200</b>. In other words, the gate driving circuit <b>120</b> and the source driver <b>130</b> are located at the same side of the display panel <b>200</b>. In addition, the gate driving circuit <b>120</b> and the source driver <b>130</b> are both located outside the periphery region PR of the display panel <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The display device <b>10</b> of the present embodiment can be Electro-Phoretic Display (EPD). In other embodiment, the display device can be reflective display such as Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) or Organic Electrical Luminescence (OLED).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a chip on glass (COG) process, the gate driver and a source driver are bonded on the glass in the periphery region through conductive adhesive. Therefore, the gate driver and the source driver need to be electrically connected with the conductive pads on the glass backplate through conductive connection elements (e.g., conductive bumps). Space in the periphery region for disposing the gate driver and the source driver are required in the chip on glass process. Accordingly, compared to the conventional chip on glass process, the gate driving circuit <b>120</b> and the source driver <b>130</b> are located on the flexible substrate <b>110</b> but not the frame <b>210</b> of the periphery region PR of the display panel <b>200</b>. Therefore, the width T<b>1</b> of the border <b>210</b><i>a </i>of the display panel <b>200</b> can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a partial top view of the display region DR of the display device according to one embodiment of the present disclosure.

The display region DR of the display panel <b>200</b> includes a pixel array formed by multiple signal lines. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a scan line <b>220</b>, a data line <b>230</b>, and a selection line <b>240</b> are used as example. The data line <b>230</b> and the selection line <b>240</b> extend along the first direction D<b>1</b>, and the scan line <b>220</b> extends along the second direction D<b>2</b>. The second direction D<b>2</b> is perpendicular to the first direction D<b>1</b>. In the present embodiment, the selection line <b>240</b> is electrically connected with the scan line <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the present embodiment, the selection line <b>240</b> is electrically connected with the gate driving circuit <b>120</b>, and the data line <b>230</b> is electrically connected with the source driver <b>130</b>. The scan line <b>220</b> extending along the second direction D<b>2</b> is electrically connected to the gate driving circuit <b>120</b> through selection line <b>240</b>. In other words, the signal transferred along the second direction D<b>2</b> can be transferred along the first direction D<b>1</b> through the selection line <b>240</b>. Therefore, such circuit design can make the gate driving circuit <b>120</b> and the source driver <b>130</b> be disposed at the same side of the display panel <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The circuit design shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is T-wire TFT array design. In other embodiment, the data line <b>230</b> can be electrically connected to the source driver <b>130</b> through the selection line <b>240</b>. That is, the T-wire TFT array design can be achieved by electrically connecting the data line <b>230</b> and the selection line extending along the second direction D<b>2</b>. As such, the signal transferred along the first direction D<b>1</b> can be transferred along the second direction D<b>2</b> through the selection line extending along the second direction D<b>2</b>. Under this condition, the driving circuit film <b>100</b> can be bonded to the border <b>210</b><i>b </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of the periphery region PR. In other words, those configurations are available as long as the circuits electrically connected with the gate driving circuit <b>120</b> and the source driver <b>130</b> extend along the same direction to make the gate driving circuit <b>120</b> and the source driver <b>130</b> be disposed at the same side of the periphery region PR of the display panel <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in the present embodiment, the border <b>210</b><i>b </i>at the bottom of the display panel <b>10</b> has a width T<b>2</b>, the border <b>210</b><i>c </i>at the left-hand side of the display panel <b>10</b> has a width T<b>3</b>, and the border <b>210</b><i>d </i>at the right-hand side of the display panel <b>10</b> has a width T<b>4</b>. Since the gate driving circuit <b>120</b> and the source driver <b>130</b> are disposed at the border <b>210</b><i>a </i>of the display panel <b>200</b>, the widths T<b>2</b>-T<b>4</b> are reduced. For example, the widths T<b>2</b>&#x2dc;T<b>4</b> of the border <b>210</b><i>b</i>, the border <b>210</b><i>c</i>, and the border <b>210</b><i>d </i>are about 1 mm to 5 mm. In addition, only the space for disposing the driving circuit film <b>100</b> is required, and there is no space for disposing the gate driving circuit <b>120</b> and the source driver <b>130</b>. Therefore, the width T<b>1</b> of the border <b>210</b><i>d </i>at the right-hand side can be reduced to a range of 4 mm to 6 mm as well.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As described above, the display panel <b>200</b> can have four narrow borders by combining the driving circuit film <b>100</b> and the T-wire TFT array design. In addition, the driving circuit film <b>100</b> can have advantages such as precise circuit pitch which can achieved in COG process, volume reduction, weight reduction and folding freely which can achieved in COF process.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an enlarged view of the region A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The region A is illustrated the enlarged view of the gate driving circuit <b>120</b> and the source driver <b>130</b> of the driving circuit film <b>100</b>. In the present embodiment, the gate driving circuit <b>120</b> of the driving circuit film <b>100</b> has multiple sections that are separated from each other.

The data line <b>230</b> passes through the channel <b>122</b> and is connected to the source driver <b>130</b> from the left-side of the gate driving circuit <b>120</b>. As described above, since the gate driving circuit <b>120</b> can be directly formed on the flexible substrate <b>110</b> through a TFT process, the exposure and develop process for forming the channel <b>122</b> can be combined in the process of forming the gate driving circuit <b>120</b>.
