Furthermore, the cavity <b>102</b> comprises a first portion <b>102</b><i>a </i>shaped in order to receive at least one strip <b>13</b> and preferably a plurality of strips <b>13</b>, and a second portion <b>102</b><i>b </i>shaped in order to at least partly accommodate the dispensing member <b>12</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the first portion <b>102</b><i>a </i>of the cavity and the second portion <b>102</b><i>b </i>of the cavity <b>102</b> are connected by an inclined intermediate portion <b>102</b><i>c, </i>the second portion <b>102</b><i>b </i>of the cavity <b>102</b> being deeper than the first portion <b>102</b><i>a </i>with respect to an axis D-D substantially perpendicular to the bottom <b>103</b> of the cavity <b>102</b>. In other words, the part of the bottom <b>103</b> of the cavity <b>102</b> at the level of the second portion <b>102</b><i>b </i>is offset downward, that is to say away from the upper face of the cartridge <b>10</b>, along the axis D-D substantially perpendicular to the bottom <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Advantageously, the inclined intermediate portion has a slope of between 25&#xb0; and 35&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Moreover, as may be seen particularly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the cartridge <b>10</b> comprises a first engagement orifice <b>104</b><i>a </i>formed on a first end of the cartridge and intended to cooperate with the first tongue <b>112</b><i>a </i>of the cover <b>11</b>. The cartridge <b>10</b> also comprises a second engagement orifice <b>104</b><i>b </i>on a second end of the cartridge, opposite the first end, which is intended to cooperate with the second tongue <b>112</b><i>b </i>of the cover <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">According to the invention, the cartridge <b>10</b> may comprise lateral indentations <b>106</b> which are formed symmetrically on either side of the cartridge and are configured in order to allow it to be held in position in the tool for picking up the strips.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Furthermore, the cartridge <b>10</b> comprises at least one retaining tab <b>105</b> positioned at one end of the cavity <b>102</b> of the cartridge <b>10</b>. The retaining tab <b>105</b> is formed on the first portion <b>102</b><i>a </i>of the cavity <b>102</b>. The retaining tab <b>105</b> is configured in order to prevent the strips from leaving the cavity <b>102</b>. The retaining tab <b>105</b> also makes it possible to facilitate gripping at the middle of the strip by an instrument, as may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. The retaining tab <b>105</b> holds the second end <b>132</b> of the strips <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The dispensing member <b>12</b> is illustrated particularly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> to <b>9</b></figref>. The dispensing member is configured in order to cooperate with the cartridge <b>10</b>, said dispensing member <b>12</b> being at least partially accommodated in a second portion <b>102</b><i>b </i>of the cavity <b>102</b> of the cartridge <b>10</b>, as illustrated particularly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">As may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, the dispensing member <b>12</b> comprises a protruding part <b>121</b> having a contact surface <b>122</b> shaped in order to cover at least a first end <b>131</b> of each strip <b>13</b>, the contact surface <b>122</b> facing toward the bottom <b>103</b> of the cavity <b>102</b> of the cartridge <b>10</b> and overhanging the inclined intermediate portion <b>102</b><i>c. </i></p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Furthermore, the dispensing member <b>12</b> comprises a second part <b>123</b> which is widened with respect to the protruding part <b>121</b>. More particularly, the protruding part <b>121</b> extends radially or laterally (depending on the shape of the second part) with respect to the second part <b>123</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Furthermore, the dispensing member has a front-to-rear cross section of substantially triangular shape along the longitudinal axis, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. This shape makes it possible to promote tilting of the dispensing member <b>12</b> forward, that is to say toward the protruding part <b>121</b>. Specifically, as may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, the second part <b>123</b> of the dispensing member <b>12</b> has a bearing surface <b>125</b> followed by a shoulder, followed by a plane surface substantially parallel to the bearing surface <b>125</b>. An inclined portion <b>124</b> connects the plane surface to the protruding part <b>121</b> of the dispensing member <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The object of the invention is, in particular, to facilitate individual gripping of the strips stored together in the same container. For this purpose, the dispensing member <b>12</b> is configured in order to be mobile in rotation between:</p><p id="p-0075" num="0000">a resting position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, in which the protruding part <b>121</b> extends at a distance from the inclined intermediate portion <b>102</b><i>c, </i>and<br/>an operating position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b></figref>, in which the protruding part <b>121</b> converges toward the inclined intermediate portion <b>102</b><i>c </i>so that the first end <b>131</b> of each strip <b>13</b> is at least pressed against the inclined intermediate portion <b>102</b><i>c, </i>and is preferably pinched between the protruding part <b>121</b> and the inclined intermediate portion <b>102</b><i>c. </i></p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">As may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the strips <b>13</b> are covered on a first end <b>131</b> by the protruding part <b>121</b> of the dispensing member <b>12</b>. During the tilting/rotation of the dispensing member <b>12</b>, in the operating position, the protruding part <b>121</b> bears on the end <b>131</b> of the strips against the inclined intermediate portion <b>102</b><i>c </i>of the cartridge, thereby causing tilting of the strips as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. When the pressure exerted on the dispensing member is manually released, the retaining tab <b>105</b> is no longer capable of retaining the second end <b>132</b> of the strips <b>13</b>, which thus allows individual manual gripping of said strips <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">Moreover, when the pressure exerted on the dispensing member is less strong than a standard manual pressure, the retaining tab <b>105</b> retains the second end <b>132</b> of the strips <b>13</b>, causing the strips <b>13</b> to curve as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, which allows gripping by an instrument <b>200</b> of the automatic type, for example by suction of the center of the strip <b>13</b>. Furthermore, this curvature makes it possible to create a friction movement between the gripped strip and the strip located directly below, which could be adhesively bonded, and to separate them.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">In both cases, the full tilting or curvature of the strips allows detachment of the strips from one another and makes it possible to grip a single strip at a time, irrespective of the instrument used. This furthermore makes it possible to ensure that the strip located below remains in place in the cartridge and does not turn over.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, a manual instrument or the hand of an operator may be used, while in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> an automatic instrument (suction cup or any other gripping system) may be used.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">Of course, the invention is not limited to the embodiments described and represented in the appended figures. Modifications remain possible, particularly in terms of the construction of the various elements or by substitution of technical equivalents, without thereby departing from the protective scope of the invention.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
