of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method for regulating heat treatment derived from the in-situ collection of information, and application thereof, which belongs to the field of material hot working, and specifically, to the field of online detection and control of material heat treatment.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A material or workpiece is heat-treated to form the desired microstructure to satisfy the set requirements for performance. Process parameters of heat treatment, such as heating temperature, soaking time and temperature changing rate, affect the microstructure and properties of the material remarkably. In production, these process parameters are generally optimized and regulated, resulting in the desired microstructure and properties of the heat-treated workpiece. Conventionally, before production, heat treatment is carried out at different temperatures, different soaking times, and different temperature changing rates, and then property examination and microstructure observation are carried out at room temperature. If the microstructure and properties do not satisfy the target demands, it is necessary to adjust the process parameters and re-perform the heat treatment repeatedly, so as to get close to the target results of heat treatment through continuous optimization of the process parameters. It is not feasible to directly detect the extents or states of heat treatment during the process and control it.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">At present, the detection methods related to heat treatment all have problems of being ex-situ, non-continuous, inaccurate, complex, requiring a large amount of experiment, and high cost. Patent CN109536859A disclosed a method for detection of solid solution quenching effect of 7075 aluminum alloy. The time for heat treatment was determined through detection of electrical conductivity changes of samples at different solid solution temperatures and soaking time. The electrical conductivity was measured after quenching rather than in-situ during the heat treatment. It was means that multiple groups of subsequent experiments are required to obtain a curve showing the relationship between the electrical conductivity and the heating temperature and between the conductivity and the soaking time, which resulted in the experimental steps cumbersome. In the paper &#x201c;Research on Method of Quick Detection of Homogenization Effect of Round Aluminum Alloy Ingot&#x201d;, the electrical conductivity and hardness of homogenized alloy 6A01, 6005A and 7B05 etc ingots from multiple heating batches were measured by using a conductivity meter and a hardness tester at room temperature, and the microstructure was observed by using a metallographic microscope and a scanning electron microscope for relevant verification. However, the detection is ex-situ and non-continuous. In the patent CN108193101 A, the optimal aging process of four Al&#x2014;Mg&#x2014;Cu alloys was determined based on microhardness. The samples were collected at a large time interval leads to the inaccurate peak aging time and greatly fluctuant hardness data, which is easily affected by accidental factors.

However, the properties were measured at room temperature, the test results were easily affected by sampling factors, and there were discrete points present in the property curve which deviate from or even go against the regular pattern. This method required a large amount of experiment and was not online.

Information is collected when the heat treatment process reaches a set temperature. The electrical information is collected by a four-point probes method. The specific parameters (such as length of the electrical information collection region, constant current, and electrical information type) are adjusted according to the test piece.
