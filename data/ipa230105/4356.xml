Both the PRNG and the TRNG can be used to generate high-entropy random numbers. The PRNG can only generate random sequences having a limited length, while the TRNG can generate random numbers by extracting inherent randomness of some circuits with special structures, so that the length of the random sequence generated by the TRNG is not limited. At present, in many important fields, such as encryption (to ensure the security of a large amount of information in high-speed communication), simulation (randomly selecting a large number of possible situations for simulation), and artificial intelligence, there is a great demand for random numbers, and the requirements for the randomness of these random numbers are also very high. In this case, the TRNG is difficult to be replaced by the PRNG, and the TRNG has broad application prospects.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">At least one embodiment of the present disclosure provides a method for generating a random number, comprising: performing n writing operations on at least one analog resistive random access memory, where each of the n writing operations comprises applying at least one writing operation pulse to change a conductance value of an operated analog resistive access memory;

Apparently, the described embodiments are just a part but not all of the embodiments of the present disclosure.

The first type is the TRNG based on a transistor circuit, such as TRNG based on latch structure metastable state and TRNG based on ring oscillator; the second type is the TRNG based on new memory, such as TRNG based on magnetic memory and TRNG based on resistive random access memory. The first type of TRNG usually needs many additional calibration circuits to ensure the effective work of TRNG, so the first type of TRNG has a large area cost; in the second type of TRNG, the TRNG based on magnetic memory usually uses complex material system, so it is difficult to manufacture the TRNG based on magnetic memory. In contrast, the TRNG based on resistive random access memory in the second type of TRNG has a circuit design that is highly similar to the memory module, and the material system of the TRNG based on resistive random access memory is compatible with micro-nano process technology, so the TRNG based on resistive random access memory can better overcome the above shortcomings.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The TRNG based on resistive random access memory generates random numbers based on the inherent randomness of the resistive random access memory. At present, the TRNG based on resistive random access memory is implemented into two technical solutions, and the two technical solutions generate random numbers respectively by using the read noise characteristics and switching characteristics of the resistive random access memory. In the first solution, the resistance values read out by the resistive random access memory have the characteristics of random jitter under thermal noise interference, the resistance values read out at two different moments are compared, and random numbers are generated based on the comparison results. The second technical solution utilizes the volatile characteristic of the resistive random access memory, that is, the characteristic that the resistive random access memory will automatically switch back to the &#x201c;off&#x201d; state after a period of time after being adjusted to the &#x201c;on&#x201d; state, to generate the random numbers by recording the time when the resistive random access memory is maintained in the &#x201c;on&#x201d; state. However, the TRNG based on the read noise characteristics of the resistive random access memory has high requirements for the precision of the read circuit and has uncertainty in the behavior of the read noise, and the generated random numbers need to be modified at the back end (for example, von Neumann correction, multiple XOR, etc.), so the reliability and output randomness of the TRNG based on the read noise characteristics of the resistive random access memory need to be further improved. The TRNG based on the switching characteristics of the resistive random access memory needs to wait for the resistive random access memory to spontaneously complete the state switching, and therefore, has the problems of slow speed (for example, the throughput is usually in the order of 1 kbit/sec&#x2dc;10 kbit/sec) and the insufficient erasable times (for example, the erasable times are usually in the order of 10<sup>6</sup>-10<sup>7</sup>) of the resistive random access memory itself.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In summary, the existing TRNG based on resistive random access memory cannot have the two very important characteristics of high speed and high reliability.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">At least one embodiment of the present disclosure provides a method for generating a random number, which includes: performing n writing operations on at least one analog resistive random access memory, in which each of the n writing operations includes applying at least one writing operation pulse to change a conductance value of an operated analog resistive access memory; and generating a random number based on n writing operation pulse numbers respectively corresponding to the n writing operations, in which n is a positive integer.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">At least one embodiment of the present disclosure further provides a random number generator corresponding to the above method for generating the random number.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The method for generating a random number and the random number generator provided by the embodiments of the present disclosure generate a random number based on analog characteristics of the writing operations of the analog resistive random access memory, and the generated random number does not need to be modified at the back end. In at least one example, the throughput of generating the random number by a single analog resistive random access memory can reach 1 Mbit/sec, and the erasable times of the analog resistive random access memory can reach the order of 10<sup>11</sup>, in these cases, the method for generating a random number and the random number generator provided by the embodiments of the present disclosure make up for the deficiencies of the above-mentioned method of generating random numbers based on the read noise characteristics and switching characteristics of the resistive random access memory, and have both high speed and high reliability.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Embodiments and examples thereof of the present disclosure are described in detail below in combination with the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a structural schematic diagram of an analog resistive random access memory provided by at least one embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the analog resistive random access memory adopts a 1T1R structure as an example, that is, the analog resistive random access memory includes a transistor M<b>1</b> and a resistive component R<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">It should be noted that the transistors used in the embodiments of the present disclosure can be thin-film transistors or field-effect transistors (for example, MOS field-effect transistors) or other switching devices with the same characteristics, and the source electrode and the drain electrode of the adopted transistor can be symmetrical in structure, so there is no difference between the source electrode and the drain electrode of the adopted transistor in structure. In the embodiments of the present disclosure, in order to distinguish the two electrodes of a transistor other than the gate electrode, it is directly described that one electrode is a first electrode and the other electrode is a second electrode.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The embodiments of the present disclosure does not limit the type of the adopted transistor, for example, in a case where the transistor M<b>1</b> adopts an N-type transistor, a gate electrode of the transistor M<b>1</b> is connected to a word line end WL, for example, when the word line end WL inputs a high level, the transistor M<b>1</b> is turned on; a first electrode of the transistor M<b>1</b> may be a source electrode and is configured to be connected to a source line end SL, for example, the transistor M<b>1</b> can receive a reset pulse through the source line end SL; a second electrode of transistor M<b>1</b> may be a drain electrode and is configured to be connected to a second electrode (e.g., negative electrode) of the resistive component R<b>1</b>, and a first electrode (e.g., positive electrode) of the resistive component R<b>1</b> is connected to a bit line end BL. For example, the resistive component R<b>1</b> can receive a set pulse through the bit line end BL. For example, in a case where the transistor M<b>1</b> adopts a P-type transistor, a gate electrode of the transistor M<b>1</b> is connected to a word line end WL, for example, when the word line end WL inputs a low level, the transistor M<b>1</b> is turned on; a first electrode of the transistor M<b>1</b> may be a source electrode and is configured to be connected to a source line end SL, for example, the transistor M<b>1</b> can receive a set pulse through the source line end SL; a second electrode of the transistor M<b>1</b> may be a drain electrode and is configured to be connected to a second electrode (e.g., negative electrode) of the resistive component R<b>1</b>, and a first electrode (e.g., positive electrode) of the resistive component R<b>1</b> is connected to a bit line end BL, for example, the resistive component R<b>1</b> can receive a reset pulse through the bit line end BL. It should be noted that in the case where the N-type transistor is used, when the bit line end BL receives the set pulse, the source line end SL is grounded, and when the source line end SL receives the reset pulse, the bit line end BL is grounded. It should be noted that in the case where the P-type transistor is used, when the bit line end BL receives the reset pulse, the source line end SL is connected to a power supply voltage, and when the source line end SL receives the set pulse, the bit line end BL is connected to the power supply voltage. It should be noted that the structure of the resistive random access memory may also be implemented as other structures, and the embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited in this aspect. The following embodiments are illustrated by taking the transistor M<b>1</b> adopting the N-type transistor as an example.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Writing operations such as set operations and/or reset operations can be implemented by applying writing operation pulses to the analog resistive random access memory to change the conductance value of the analog resistive random access memory. The function of the word line end WL is to apply a corresponding voltage to the gate electrode of the transistor M<b>1</b>, thus controlling the transistor M<b>1</b> to be turned on or turned off. When performing a writing operation on an analog resistive random access memory, such as performing a set operation or a reset operation, the transistor M<b>1</b> needs to be turned on first, that is, a turn-on voltage needs to be applied to the gate electrode of the transistor M<b>1</b> through the word line end WL. After the transistor M<b>1</b> is turned on, for example, the source line end SL can be controlled to be grounded, and a set pulse is applied to the bit line end BL as a writing operation pulse to increase the conductance value of the analog resistive random access memory. For another example, the bit line end BL can be controlled to be grounded, and a reset pulse is applied to the source line end SL as a writing operation pulse to reduce the conductance value of the analog resistive random access memory.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">It should be noted that, in the embodiments of the present disclosure, the writing operation of applying at least one set pulse to the analog resistive random access memory to increase the conductance value of the analog resistive random access memory is called as a set operation, and the writing operation of applying at least one reset pulse to the analog resistive random access memory to reduce the conductance value of the analog resistive random access memory is called as a reset operation. The following embodiments are the same as those described herein, and similar portions will not be repeated again.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">It should also be noted that, in the embodiments of the present disclosure, the at least one writing operation pulse applied in the same writing operation that is performed on the analog resistive random access memory is the same, which is exemplary and not a limitation of the present disclosure. Moreover, in the embodiments of the present disclosure, the writing operation pulses applied in different writing operations that is performed on the analog resistive random access memory are the same, which is exemplary and not a limitation of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the present disclosure, the analog resistive random access memory refers to a resistive random access memory whose conductance value can continuously change, and the analog characteristic refers to the characteristic that the conductance value can continuously change. The following embodiments are the same as those described herein, and similar portions will not be repeated again. During the writing operation, the conductance value of the analog resistive random access memory gradually changes under the action of the writing operation pulse. For example, conductance values of some analog resistive random access memory can be gradually increased from 0.1 &#x3bc;S (micro Siemens) to 10 &#x3bc;S under the action of the writing operation pulse. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a change process of the conductance value of an analog resistive random access memory under the action of pulses provided by at least one embodiment of the present disclosure. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, under the action of 200 identical set pulses, the conductance value of the analog resistive random access memory is gradually increased (that is, the SET process in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), and under the action of 200 identical reset pulses, the conductance value of the analog resistive random access memory is gradually decreased (that is, the RESET process in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In a case where a writing operation is performed on the analog resistive random access memory, under the action of the same writing operation pulse, the change amount of the conductance value of the analog resistive random access memory is uncertain and random. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, for 200 identical set pulses, the conductance value of the analog resistive random access memory has different increase amounts, and for 200 identical reset pulses, the conductance value of the analog resistive random access memory also has different decrease amounts. Therefore, the number of writing operation pulses required for the analog resistive random access memory to achieve a specific writing operation (that is, the conductance value of the analog resistive random access memory is adjusted from a specific initial value to a specific target value) is uncertain and random. It should be noted that the increase amount and decrease amount may also be negative.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates the statistical distribution of writing pulse numbers of an analog resistive random access memory provided by at least one embodiment of the present disclosure, the abscissa is the pulse number, and the ordinate is the probability of corresponding pulse number to achieve the writing operation. The pulse is a rectangular pulse with a pulse width of 50 ns (nanoseconds), a duty cycle of 50%, and an amplitude of 1.9V (volts). The writing operation includes a set operation that makes the conductance value of the analog resistive random access memory increase gradually from a conductance value less than 10 &#x3bc;S (micro Siemens) to a conductance value greater than 20 &#x3bc;S, and includes a reset operation that makes the conductance value of the analog resistive random access memory decrease gradually from a conductance value greater than 20 &#x3bc;S to a conductance value less than 10 &#x3bc;S. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the statistical distribution of the pulse number in 20480 cycles (the process of completing a set operation and a reset operation is defined as one cycle). It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> that in the 20480 cycles, the possibility of the pulse number being 5 (that is, in a single cycle, the sum of the pulse number in the set operation and the pulse number in the reset operation is 5) is the largest. It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> that the pulse number required for the analog resistive random access memory to achieve a writing operation is random. Therefore, the randomness of the pulse number required for the analog resistive random access memory to achieve a writing operation can be used to implement a true random number generator.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">At least one embodiment of the present disclosure provides a method for generating a random number, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flow diagram of the method for generating a random number. The method for generating a random number can be implemented by means of software, hardware, firmware, or any combination thereof. The method for generating a random number provided by the embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the method for generating a random number includes a step S<b>100</b> and a step S<b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Step S<b>100</b>: performing n writing operations on at least one analog resistive random access memory, in which each of the n writing operations includes applying at least one writing operation pulse to change a conductance value of an operated analog resistive access memory.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Step S<b>200</b>: generating the random number based on n writing operation pulse numbers corresponding to the n writing operations.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">For example, n is a positive integer, and the random number is a true random number.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">It should be noted that the random number may be a random number in a binary form (that is, the random number is a binary number composed of 0 and 1), or be a random number in other forms, such as a random number in a quaternary form, a decimal form, a hexadecimal form, or other forms. In the embodiments of the present disclosure, in order to describe the technical solutions of the present disclosure more clearly, the random number refers to the random number in a binary form, which is exemplary and not a limitation of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">According to the total number of digits of the random number that needs to be generated and the specific manner in which the random number is generated based on each writing operation pulse number, n can be determined. For example, a random number with a length of 12 bits needs to be generated, and a modulo 2 value (that is, 0 or 1, the 0 or 1 can be used to represent the Odevity of the writing operation pulse number) of each writing operation pulse number can be used to generate the random number, that is, 1 bit of the random number can be generated based on each writing operation pulse number, and n may be a positive integer greater than or equal to 12. For example, a random number with a length of 12 bits needs to be generated, and a modulo 4 value (that is, 0, 1, 2, or 3) of each writing operation pulse number is used to generate the random number. For example, each modulo 4 value can be represented by a 2-bit binary number, that is, 2 bits of the random number can be generated based on each writing operation pulse number, in this case, n may be a positive integer greater than or equal to 6. It should be noted that the total number of digits of the random number that needs to be generated depends on the actual situation, which is not limited in the embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The process of generating the random number will be described in detail below.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">For the step S<b>100</b>, in each writing operation, a writing operation pulse is applied to at least one analog resistive random access memory, so that the conductance value of the operated analog resistive random access memory gradually changes, and the number of the applied writing operation pulses is recorded. In different embodiments, the above method can be performed on the same analog resistive random access memory, or on different analog resistive random access memories. For the latter case, for example, a part of the n writing operations is performed on one analog resistive random access memory, and the other part of the n writing operations is performed on another analog resistive random access memory. In different examples, the writing operation may include only a set operation, or include only a reset operation, or include both a set operation and a reset operation. In a case where the writing operation is a set operation, the writing operation pulse is a set pulse, in this case, the set pulse is applied to the operated analog resistive random access memory, so that the conductance value of the operated analog resistive random access memory is gradually increased; and in a case where the writing operation is a reset operation, the writing operation pulse is a reset pulse, in this case, the reset pulse is applied to the operated analog resistive random access memory, so that the conductance value of the operated analog resistive random access memory is gradually decreased.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">For example, the writing operation pulse is a rectangular pulse with a pulse width of 50 ns, a duty cycle of 50%, and an amplitude of 2v. The specific parameters of the writing operation pulse can be determined according to the characteristics of the specific analog resistive random access memory, and the embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited in this aspect.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">For example, under the action of the set pulse, the conductance value of the operated analog resistive random access memory is gradually increased from a first initial conductance value to a first target conductance value. For example, the first initial conductance value is less than 10 &#x3bc;S, and the first target conductance value is greater than 20 &#x3bc;S. For example, under the action of the reset pulse, the conductance value of the operated analog resistive random access memory is gradually decreased from a second initial conductance value to a second target conductance value, for example, the second initial conductance value is greater than 20 &#x3bc;S, and the second target conductance value is less than 10 &#x3bc;S. For example, under the action of the set pulse, the conductance value of the operated analog resistive random access memory is gradually increased from a third initial conductance value to a third target conductance value, and then, under the action of the reset pulse, the conductance value of the operated resistive random access memory is gradually decreased from the third target conductance value to a fourth target conductance value.
