Soundbars are often used in home audio and media applications, but may also be used in vehicles such as cars, off-road vehicles, and boats to improve the quality of audio. Soundbars typically include both tweeters and woofers and thus provide a cost-effective, all-in-one solution for creating a surround sound experience without requiring multiple separate speakers.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Soundbars can be installed in a vehicle behind the rear seats, in the trunk, under the seat, and even on top of the vehicle. Behind the rear seats, a soundbar may be mounted to a roll bar or another cross member on a roll cage frame, for example. Soundbars must be mounted appropriately to maintain safety thresholds for crash impacts, so as not to encroach upon head space for rear seat passengers. However, in order to meet these safety standards and remain sufficiently spaced from the rear seat headrests and passengers, previous soundbar mounting structures designed to clamp around the roll bar or roll cage may undesirably contact the hard top of a vehicle or deform and stretch a soft top of the vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one or more embodiments, a mounting kit for installing a soundbar in a vehicle is provided, the vehicle having a roll cage including a cross member and a first pillar and a second pillar connected to opposite ends of the cross member.

The head <b>132</b> may have a flat square or rectangular configuration and is sized to be received within the track <b>128</b>, such as at the bottom side <b>126</b>, and retained within and slidable along the track <b>128</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The mounting kit <b>108</b> further includes a tube <b>136</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>6</b> and <b>9</b></figref>. The tube <b>136</b> may comprise a hollow, elongated body <b>138</b> with a square or rectangular cross-section, but is not limited to this configuration. The tube <b>136</b> includes end portions <b>140</b> which may have a greater thickness compared with the body <b>138</b> for reinforced strength.

The chambers <b>148</b> may also have a reinforced, greater thickness compared with the body <b>138</b>. A chamber aperture <b>152</b> is located on a bottom surface <b>154</b> of the tube <b>136</b> aligned with each chamber <b>148</b> and sized to receive the shank <b>134</b> of the bolt <b>130</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A, <b>12</b>B, <b>13</b>A, <b>13</b>B, and <b>14</b></figref> illustrate securing the bolts <b>130</b> to the tube <b>136</b> and the soundbar <b>100</b> to the assembled bolts <b>130</b> and tube <b>136</b>. With the shank <b>134</b> of each bolt <b>130</b> received in each chamber aperture <b>152</b>, a lock washer <b>156</b> may optionally be placed on the shank <b>134</b> and then an adjustment cap <b>158</b> may be received on the shank <b>134</b>. The adjustment cap <b>158</b> may be generally disk-shaped can be tightened on the shank <b>134</b> by engaging the adjustment cap <b>158</b> through the window <b>150</b> and rotating the adjustment cap <b>158</b>, such as with an Allen wrench (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>). The head <b>132</b> of each bolt <b>130</b> can then be inserted into the tracks <b>128</b> on the housing <b>116</b> of the soundbar <b>100</b>. For example, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A and <b>13</b>B</figref>, the heads <b>132</b> may be inserted into the tracks <b>128</b> at the bottom side <b>126</b> of the housing <b>116</b> and slid along the tracks <b>128</b> to the top side <b>122</b> of the housing <b>116</b>. The adjustment caps <b>158</b> may be further tightened once the soundbar <b>100</b> is assembled on the tube <b>136</b>. Once mounted to the tube <b>136</b>, a stop member (not shown) may be inserted in each track <b>128</b> to prevent the bolt <b>130</b> from disengaging from the track <b>128</b> and thus prevent accidental disengagement of the soundbar <b>100</b> from the tube <b>136</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> illustrates an end of the soundbar <b>100</b> optionally additionally secured to the tube <b>136</b> with a retention wire <b>159</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The tube <b>136</b> may include a notch <b>160</b> formed in the bottom surface <b>154</b> of the body <b>138</b>.

The notch <b>160</b> is arranged to receive the speaker wires <b>162</b> from the rear side <b>124</b> of the soundbar <b>100</b> so that the speaker wires <b>162</b> have a space to pass under the tube <b>136</b>. The notch <b>160</b> allows the soundbar <b>100</b> to rotate when desired without impinging the speaker wires <b>162</b>, such that the soundbar <b>100</b> may rotate freely through a large angular excursion (e.g., 180 degrees) while the soundbar <b>100</b> is assembled to the tube <b>136</b> without requiring disassembly. The accommodation of the speaker wires <b>162</b> by the notch <b>160</b> also allows for close positioning of the soundbar <b>100</b> to the tube <b>136</b>. Without the notch <b>160</b>, it might be necessary to space the soundbar <b>100</b> farther downward from the tube <b>136</b> to provide space for the speaker wires <b>162</b>, which could impede rear occupant head space.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The mounting kit <b>108</b> further includes a first bracket <b>164</b> and a second bracket <b>166</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> depicts first and second brackets <b>164</b>, <b>166</b> for the exemplary first vehicle <b>104</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> depicts first and second brackets <b>164</b>, <b>166</b> for the exemplary second vehicle <b>106</b>.
