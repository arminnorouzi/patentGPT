In particular, the present invention relates to the use of prey mites from the genus <i>Czenspinskia </i>for the mass rearing of predatory mites and for controlling a pest in a crop.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Predatory mites are traditionally used in the broad field of agricultural pest management. A wide range of predatory mite species have been suggested or commercialized for the biological control of phytophagous pest mites and insect pests such as whiteflies and thrips.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Lately, the major arthropod pest species have mainly been controlled by chemical agents, i.e. pesticides. Nowadays, many of the new pesticides made available on the market are more selective and less hazardous than the older compounds. However, even the newest pesticides present several major problems, i.e. the development of resistance in target pest species; the dwindling supply of useful, registered insecticides and acaricides; the deposition of undesirable residues; the detrimental effect on non-target species resulting in secondary pest outbreaks; the phytotoxic reactions induced in treated plants. It is therefore becoming increasingly clear that solely relying on chemical control will not be the solution to the problem of agricultural pest management. For this reason, many farmers and gardeners are exploring and adopting methods to reduce pesticide use.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One alternative to the use of chemical agents is biological control. Biological control is the intentional manipulation of populations of living beneficial organisms (natural enemies) in order to limit population of pests. Natural enemies of mites for instance include predators, parasitic insects, nematodes, and pathogens. Indeed, virtually all pests have natural enemies and appropriate management of such natural enemies can effectively control many pests.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The objective of biological control is not to eradicate pests, but to maintain them at tolerable levels at which they cause no appreciable damage. As such, biological control can be effective, economical and safe.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Since many years, predatory mite populations have been used in order to control pests. In particular, primarily phytoseiid predatory mites are currently used to control pests such as phytophagous mites, thrips and whiteflies. For example, <i>Neoseiulus cucumeris </i>(Oudemans) is commercially used for the control of thrips larvae and spider mites. Other predatory mites species, particularly mesostigmatid and prostigmatid species, receive particular attention in the context of biological pest control, and some are already commercialized.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is therefore a growing interest for the development of effective mass rearing systems to produce predatory mite populations on commercially-relevant scales, and this for an acceptable price. Currently, commercial rearing systems use living preys in a culture maintained on a carrier to rear predatory mites. For example, WO2006/071107 and WO2013/103295 disclose a mite composition comprising a population of individuals of a predatory mite species, a prey mite population as a food source for the predatory mite individuals and a carrier. The compositions according to these prior art documents are suitable for rearing mite species and for the biological control of pests. Mass rearing systems for predatory mites depend heavily on the availability of suitable prey for the predators. Considering their role in rearing of predatory mites, the commercial relevance of rearing prey mites is increasing.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">WO2006/057552, WO2008/015393, WO2008/104807 and WO2007/075081 demonstrate the potential of Astigmatid mites to be used as prey mites in mass-rearing of predatory mites. However, until now, only a few Astigmatid prey mite species are used in mass rearing methods, i.e. <i>Tyrophagus putrescentiae </i>(Schrank), <i>Thyreophagus entomophagous </i>(Laboulb&#xe9;ne &#x26; Robin) and <i>Carpoglyphus lactis </i>L.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Identifying new prey mites for use in biological pest control, which are at the same time economical and easy to breed remains a challenge. Most mites that are preyed upon by predatory mites in nature have subsequently been found not to be suitable for mass-rearing of these predatory mites, for example because they do not reach sufficiently high densities or have defense mechanisms against predatory mites (see e.g. Massaro, M., Martin, J.

The carrier will usually act as a three-dimensional matrix wherein the prey mite population and predatory mite population can move around, hide, develop and prey or be preyed upon.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0025">The genus <i>Czenspinskia </i>has a wide distribution and mites can be readily isolated from nature for use in the present invention. A preferred species is <i>Czenspinskia transversostriata</i>, also known as <i>Calvolia transversostriata </i>or <i>Czenspinskia lordi. </i></p><p id="p-0021" num="0026">Inventors surprisingly observed that a mite composition according to the invention shows better results in terms of efficiency. It was observed that the mites from the genus <i>Czenspinskia </i>of the prey mite population are more easily killed and more readily eaten by the predatory mite population than the conventionally used astigmatid prey mites. An additional advantage is that all life stages of the <i>Czenspinskia </i>prey mites are being killed readily, whereas larger life stages, such as adults, from other astigmatids are not killed at all or killed at a much lower rate. In addition, it was observed that even at high densities, the prey mite population disturbs the predatory mite population less than the prey mites used in the prior art for mass rearing mites. Although not wishing to be bound by theory, it appears that the <i>Czenspinskia </i>mites produce repellent volatiles to a much lower degree, compared to prior art prey mites. This may cause the <i>Czenspinskia </i>prey mites to have a lower disturbing effect on the predatory mite population. Accordingly, individuals from the predatory mite population may grow faster and therefore mature more quickly which allows for a higher rate of reproduction. Such a higher reproductive rate results in a faster increase in the number of individuals in the predatory mite population. This advantage is beneficial for the rearing of predatory mites and the production of compositions comprising such, as well as for the control of a pest in a crop. It is to be noted that the prey mite population used in the invention may also comprise (or consist of) a population of dead prey mites. The observation that the prey mites of the invention are more readily eaten than the prey mites of the prior art, also applies to dead <i>Czenspinskia </i>mites in comparison to dead prior art prey mites. The use of a prey mite population comprising dead prey mites provides the benefit that predatory mites require less energy for killing and consuming the prey mites. <i>Czenspinskia </i>prey mites have been found to be particularly useful for rearing phytoseiid predatory mites species, such as Amblyseius swirskii, at least as potent as the most commonly used &#x2018;golden standard&#x2019; <i>Carpoglyphus lactis </i>L.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0027">Furthermore, <i>Czenspinskia</i>, and especially <i>Czenspinskia transversostriata</i>, has a worldwide distribution. Given the wide distribution in nature, the mite compositions of the invention can furthermore be safely utilized worldwide without a risk to introduce non-native, invasive species. In addition, in contrast to several prey mites that have been used in the prior art for mass rearing of predatory mites, <i>Czenspinskia </i>is neither a storage nor plant pest. As such, it does not pose a potential risk for the environment and the end users. The prey mites of the invention therefore also provide a safer solution for mass rearing of predatory mites.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0028">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the prey mites are <i>Czenspinskia transversostriata </i>(Oudemans) mites.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0029">Preferably, the <i>Czenspinskia </i>mites according to the invention do not cause plant damage. The skilled person is well aware how to select <i>Czenspinskia </i>mites that do not cause significant plant damage. In addition, the absence of causing significant plant damage is easily determined, e.g. by incubating a plant with the <i>Czenspinskia </i>of choice and determining if the plant is damaged after a few days. In a particular embodiment, the prey mites according to the invention include mites from the genus of the <i>Czenspinskia. </i></p><p id="p-0025" num="0030">Advantageously, the composition according to the invention comprises a food source for the predatory and/or prey mite populations. In a particular embodiment, the composition of the invention comprises a food source for said prey mite population. In another embodiment, the food source comprises wheat germ, pollen, or fungus, such as <i>Saccharomyces cerevisae</i>. As is known to the skilled person, a carrier can be selected that acts both as a carrier and as a food source, for example wheat germ.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0031">Advantageously, as explained herein before, the composition according to the invention may further comprise a fungus. Better efficiency results were observed when fungi are added to the composition according to the invention. In fact, the prey mite population feeds on fungi. Thus, the active addition of fungi in the composition according to the invention makes it possible to improve the growth and therefore to accelerate the reproduction maturity of <i>Czenspinskia </i>mites, which will lead to a faster increase of <i>Czenspinskia </i>individuals of the prey mite population. In addition, it has been observed that the active addition of beneficial fungi stabilizes the rearing cultures and further suppresses the growth of unwanted fungal contaminations. Accordingly, the active addition of fungi in the composition according to the invention will indirectly enhance the rearing of predator mite population, their large-scale production and the distribution of the composition according to the invention at larger volumes but will also show better effects on pest control on crops. In a preferred embodiment, the fungus is a yeast, preferably a <i>Saccharomycetes</i>, such as from the genus <i>Saccharomyces</i>. In a preferred embodiment, the fungus is <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. A supplemental food source as used herein refers to a food source that is present in addition to the prey mite population. Supplemental food sources are sometimes used in predatory mite rearing as a food source that is more cost-effective than prey mites. It is often observed that several predatory mites can use supplemental foods for obtaining additional energy, but also require the presence of prey mites for survival, development and reproduction. A major drawback of the use of a supplemental food source is that it is prone to fungal contamination. By combining a supplemental food source with the prey mites of the invention, this drawback is suppressed. Examples of preferred supplemental foods are natural food sources (such as pollen or dead mites) and artificial foods (W&#xe4;ckers et al. (2005) Plant-provided food for carnivorous insects: a protective mutualism and its applications 356p; Morales-Ramos et al. (2014) Mass production of beneficial organisms 742p; Cohen (2015) Insect diets. Science and Technology, Second edition, 473p) Supplemental food sources for the rearing of predatory mites are well-known to the skilled person.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0032">As mentioned herein before, the carrier can be any solid material, which is suitable to provide a carrier surface to the individuals. In a preferred embodiment, the carrier is a mixture of solid carrier elements. Preferably, the carrier is a substantially homogeneous mixture of solid carrier elements. While the solid carrier elements may have a variety of sizes, a substantially homogeneous mixture refers to the variety of sizes being substantially homogeneously distributed amongst the carrier.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0033">The average longest axis of the solid carrier elements is typically between 1.0 and 20.0 mm, more in particular between 2.0 and 12.0 mm, preferably between 3.0 and 9.0 mm. In another particular embodiment, the carrier is a mixture of solid carrier elements with a similar size. In a further embodiment, 90% of the solid carrier elements have a longest axis in the range of 0.1 times to 10.0 times the average longest axis of the mixture of solid carrier elements, in particular in the range of 0.2 and 5.0 times, more in particular in the range of 0.5 and 2.0 times. As will be understood from the disclosures herein, two or more different types of carrier elements may be used and mixed. In such case, the size distribution refers to the size distribution per type of carrier elements. Preferably the carrier provides a porous medium, which allows exchanges of metabolic gases and heat produced by the mite populations. Examples of suitable carriers are non-photosynthetic plant material, such as (wheat) bran, buckwheat husks, rice husks, saw dust, corn cob grits, etcetera, or inorganic material, such as vermiculite. Advantageously, said carrier comprises grains of a grass species or any part thereof, such as germ or bran. Preferably, said carrier does not comprise living, green plant material, such as leaves or stems of plants. In a particular embodiment, the carrier comprises non-photosynthetic plant material. Particularly preferred is a carrier selected from vermiculite, wheat bran, millet chaff, rice husks and buckwheat husks.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0034">Preferably, said carrier comprises carrier elements with an average longest axis of between 1.0 and 20.0 mm, in particular between 3.0 and 9.0 mm. The carrier material may provide shelter for the prey mites and predatory mites, reducing stress conditions and cannibalism. During mass rearing, the carrier allows for the generation of a three-dimensional rearing matrix and may provide a food source for the prey mites. During storage and distribution for biological control, the carrier acts as a bulking agent and allows for a more homogeneous distribution of the predatory mites in the crops.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0035">Advantageously, the number of individuals of the predatory mite population relative to the number of individuals of the prey mite population is from about 1:1 to 1:500, such as about 1:10 to 1:250, and preferably between 1:25 and 1:150.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0036">High densities of prey mites and predatory mites can be reached thanks to the present invention.

The invention will now be further described with reference to the following examples, which show non-limiting embodiments of different aspects of the invention.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example 1: Oviposition Rate of <i>Amblyseius swirskii </i>on Different Prey Mites.</heading><p id="p-0045" num="0069">This first example was conducted to evaluate the nutritional quality of a <i>Czenspinskia </i>prey mite as compared to a standard used astigmatid prey mite for a phytoseiid predatory mite. More specifically, the oviposition rate of the predatory mite <i>Amblyseius swirskii </i>Athias-Henriot (Acari: Mesostigmata: Phytoseiidae) was tested on the <i>Czenspinskia </i>prey mite <i>Czenspinskia transversostriata </i>(Oudemans) (Acari: Astigmata: Winterschmidtiidae) as compared to a carpoglyphid prey mite, namely <i>Carpoglyphus lactis </i>L. (CL) (Acari: Astigmata: Carpoglyphidae) such as disclosed for <i>A. swirskii </i>rearing in WO2006/071107.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0070">Prey mites were cultured on a medium containing bran, wheat germ and yeast in plastic containers (8&#xd7;5,7 cm) with a ventilated lid. The containers were maintained at a temperature of 22&#xb1;1&#xb0; C. and a relative humidity of 85&#xb1;5%.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0071">A single gravid female <i>A. swirskii </i>was transferred from mass-rearing facilities onto a black PVC arena (2&#xd7;4 cm) placed on a layer of wet cotton. The edges of the arena were covered with tissue paper to prevent mites from escaping. A black piece of plastic (1&#xd7;1 cm) with cotton threads was added to provide shelter and oviposition substrates. Prey mites were provided ad libitum. The number of eggs deposited by each female was counted daily during 4 consecutive days. The oviposition rate of the first day was omitted from analysis to limit the effect of the diet prior to the experiment (Sabelis 1990). The sum of the amount of eggs laid during day 2, 3 and 4 were compared with GLM model with Poisson distribution. Contrasts among treatments were assessed by stepwise model simplification through aggregation of nonsignificant factor levels (Crawley 2013). All analyses were performed using the statistical software R 3.10 (RDevelopment Core Team 2012).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0072">The results demonstrate that <i>A. swirskii </i>is able to reproduce on the <i>Czenspinskia </i>prey mite <i>C. transversostriata</i>. The oviposition rate observed for <i>Czenspinskia </i>was higher than for <i>A. swirskii</i>, although it did not reach statistical significance in this experiment in the egg laying rate between missed stages of either prey species ((GLM, X<sub>2</sub>=0.91167, d.f.=1, p=0.3397) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Similar amounts of eggs were laid when grown on <i>C. transversostriata </i>prey mites or <i>C. lactis </i>prey mites. In conclusion, <i>Czenspinskia </i>mites are a suitable prey mite population for the commercial rearing of predatory mites, such as <i>A. swirskii. </i></p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example 2: Capture Success Rate of <i>A. swirskii </i>When Provided Adult Stages of Different Prey Mites.</heading><p id="p-0049" num="0073">Previous studies have reported that adult stages of most astigmatid prey mites are more difficultly subdued and consumed than eggs and larvae of these mites. In the present example, the capture success rate was assessed for the adult stages of the <i>Czenspinskia </i>prey mite <i>C. transversostriata</i>, and the carpoglyphid prey mite <i>C. lactis. </i></p><p id="p-0050" num="0074">Predatory and prey mites were reared as described in example <b>1</b>. Female <i>A. swirskii </i>were starved for <b>16</b><i>h </i>prior to start of the experiment by transferring them to a black PVC plate without any food source. After 16 h, a single female <i>A. swirskii </i>was transferred to a black PVC arena as described in experiment 1. Prior to the introduction of the <i>A. swirskii </i>female, 25 adults of the two prey mites were transferred to the experimental arena. After introduction of the predator, observations were done for 5 minutes or until a successful attack (i.e. killing and feeding on the prey). If a female did not succeed in killing prey within 5 minutes, this was recorded as unsuccessful. For each treatment, 10 replicates were set up. Data were compared among treatments with a GLM model with binomial distribution. All statistical analyses were done using the computer software R version 3.1.0 (R Core Team 2014).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0075">When adult <i>Czenspinskia </i>females were provided, a high proportion of the prey individuals were subdued as compared to the carpoglyphid species where none of the prey mites were successfully subdued (GLM, <sub>X</sub>2=4.6911, d.f.=1, p=0.0303).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0076">From the results presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, it is clear that <i>A. swirskii </i>females are able to kill and consume much more of the adults of the <i>Czenspinskia </i>prey mite <i>C. transversostriata </i>as compared to the conventionally used astigmatid prey mite species. Thus, for <i>Czenspinskia </i>prey mites, adult stages are more easily subdued and killed, making it a more suitable prey.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
