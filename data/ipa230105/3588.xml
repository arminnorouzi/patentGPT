The includes the following steps.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0048">S<b>101</b>: obtaining first temperature data of a temperature sensor and second temperature data of a temperature controller in a preset time period.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0049">This step is intended to obtain the first temperature data and the second temperature data. A connection mode between the temperature sensor and the temperature controller is not specifically limited herein, and generally a wireless connection may be used, including but not limited to, wireless communication technologies such as Bluetooth, infrared, or zigbee, or wireless communication standards. Certainly, a wired connection may also be used to facilitate direct wired transmission of the first temperature data of the temperature sensor.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0050">A type and model of the temperature sensor are not limited herein. It should be noted that the temperature sensor may be a sensor including a temperature detection function, for example, a temperature and humidity sensor can also be used in this embodiment of the application. In other words, any sensor capable of measuring the first temperature data can be regarded as the temperature sensor in the application.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0051">In addition, the second temperature data of the temperature controller in this embodiment refers to a temperature detected by the temperature controller. Because different temperature controllers have different structures, the temperature controller includes at least one built-in temperature sensor, and when the temperature controller includes a plurality of built-in temperature sensors, the second temperature data obtained in this step is a unique output temperature obtained through corresponding calculation of temperature data of each built-in temperature sensor in the preset time period; or the second temperature data is a set of temperature data of each built-in temperature sensor in the preset time period. How the temperature controller obtains the second temperature data is not specifically limited herein, and a preset formula or temperature model maybe used to calculate the temperature detected by each built-in temperature sensor, so as to obtain the second temperature data.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0052">Preferably, the temperature controller in this embodiment may be connected to a Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system, and the HVAC system is controlled according to the second temperature data provided by the temperature controller and a set temperature control strategy, to perform indoor temperature control. For example, in this embodiment of the application, calibration is performed, by using the solution of this embodiment of the application, on a real-time temperature provided by the temperature controller, to obtain a target detected temperature of the temperature controller, which is then used in combination with a target temperature control strategy set by a user, to control the HVAC system to perform the indoor temperature control.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0053">In this embodiment, the preset time period is not specifically limited, and duration of the time period may be set by those skilled in the art according to an actual temperature measurement requirement. For example, under a condition that no significant temperature change occurs in an environment to be measured, long duration, such as <b>5</b> min, may be chosen. Under a condition that a significant temperature change occurs in an environment to be measured, such as a relatively great temperature change caused by a temperature control operation such as cooling or heating, the duration of the preset time period may be chosen to be shorter, such as 5 s, 30 s, or 1 min. The preset time period may be a historical time period closest to a current time.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0054">S<b>102</b>: determining whether the first temperature data and the second temperature data meet a temperature equilibrium condition; if so, entering S<b>103</b>; or if not, entering S<b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0055">Step S<b>102</b> is an optional step.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0056">This step is intended to determine temperature equilibrium on a current external environment under first temperature data and the second temperature data obtained. The temperature equilibrium condition means that a difference in the temperature of an environment where the temperature sensor and the temperature controller are located is small and the temperature is relatively balanced. How to determine whether the temperature equilibrium condition is met is not specifically limited herein, and any determining method capable of feeding back a degree of dispersion of temperature data can be used, including but not limited to, data such as a variance and a standard deviation. Preferably, this embodiment provides a process for determining on a temperature equilibrium condition based on a variance.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0057">Step <b>1</b>: calculating a first variance corresponding to the first temperature data and a second variance corresponding to the second temperature data.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0058">Step <b>2</b>: determining whether the first variance and the second variance are both less than a preset threshold variance; if so, entering step <b>3</b>; or if not, entering step <b>4</b>. The determining step is also an optional step.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0059">Step <b>3</b>: determining that the first temperature data and the second temperature data meet a temperature equilibrium condition.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0060">Step <b>4</b>: determining that the first temperature data and the second temperature data do not meet a temperature equilibrium condition.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0061">Step <b>4</b> is specifically for a case where the first variance and the second variance are both not less than the preset threshold variance, or only one of the first variance and the second variance is less than the preset threshold variance and the other one is not less than the preset threshold variance.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0062">Under a condition that the second temperature data is a unique output temperature of the temperature controller at a specific time, one second variance is calculated; under a condition that the second temperature data is a set of temperature data of a plurality of built-in temperature sensors, second variances corresponding to the built-in temperature sensors may be calculated respectively, that is, one temperature sensor corresponds to one second variance, which is not limited herein. The determining that the temperature equilibrium condition is met may indicate: a case where the first variance and the second variances are all less than the preset threshold variance.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0063">The preset threshold variance is not specifically limited herein, and may be set by those skilled in the art, for example, may be set to 0.03, that is, the first variance and the second variance being both less than 0.03 indicates that temperature fluctuation is relatively small; and in this case, the external environment may be considered to meet the temperature equilibrium condition. Under a condition that at least one of the first variance and the second variance is greater than 0.03, the temperature equilibrium condition is considered to be not met. Certainly, 0.03 is merely a specific preset threshold variance value provided in this embodiment, and those skilled in the art may also set different precision of the preset threshold variance according to a scenario and environment to which the temperature detection is applied, for example, 0.04, 0.02, or even 0.1 all may be used, which is not exhaustively limited herein.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0064">S<b>103</b>: calibrating real-time temperature data of the temperature controller according to the first temperature data.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0065">Under a condition that the temperature equilibrium condition is met, the first temperature data of the temperature sensor may be directly used, as target temperature data after calibration by the temperature controller, to calibrate the real-time temperature data of the temperature controller. It should be noted that the calibration usually means calibrating current or subsequent real-time temperature data obtained by the temperature controller. How to use the temperature data of the temperature sensor to calibrate the real-time temperature data of the temperature controller is not specifically limited herein.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0066">In a possible solution, temperature data acquired by the temperature sensor in real time may be directly used as the target temperature data after calibration of the temperature controller at the same time, so that a corresponding temperature control instruction is sent according to the real-time temperature data.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0067">Alternatively, in another possible solution, an average of temperature data acquired by the temperature sensor at a specific time and temperature data of the temperature controller at the same time is used as the target temperature data after calibration of the temperature controller at the time.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0068">Alternatively, in another possible solution, a difference, ratio, or the like between the first temperature data and the second temperature data is used as a parameter to calibrate, in a correction manner, subsequent real-time temperature data of the temperature controller.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0069">Alternatively, in another possible solution, under a condition that the temperature controller includes two or more built-in temperature sensors, the real-time temperature data in this step may include temperature data detected by the built-in temperature sensors. Correspondingly, when the real-time temperature data is calibrated by using the first temperature data, calibration may be performed after a unique output temperature is obtained through corresponding calculation of temperature data detected by the plurality of built-in temperature sensors, or calibration may also be performed by using a preset calibration formula.
