Electric aircraft <b>100</b> may include a vertical takeoff and landing aircraft (eVTOL). As used herein, a vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft is an electrically powered aircraft that can take off and land vertically; eVTOL aircraft may be capable of hovering. In order without limitation to optimize power and energy necessary to propel an eVTOL or to increase maneuverability, the eVTOL may be capable of rotor-based cruising flight, rotor-based takeoff, rotor-based landing, fixed-wing cruising flight, airplane-style takeoff, airplane-style landing, and/or any combination thereof. Rotor-based flight, as described herein, is where the aircraft generated lift and propulsion by way of one or more powered rotors coupled with an engine, such as a &#x201c;quad copter,&#x201d; helicopter, or other vehicle that maintains its lift primarily using downward thrusting propulsors. Fixed-wing flight, as described herein, flight using wings and/or foils that generate life caused by an aircraft's forward airspeed and the shape of the wings and/or foils, such as in airplane-style flight.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a number of aerodynamic forces may act upon electric aircraft <b>100</b> during flight. Forces acting on an electric aircraft <b>100</b> during flight may include, without limitation, thrust, a forward force produced by a propulsor of electric aircraft <b>100</b>, which may act parallel to a longitudinal axis of the aircraft. Another force acting upon electric aircraft <b>100</b> may include, without limitation, drag, defined as a rearward retarding force which is caused by disruption of airflow by any protruding surface of electric aircraft <b>100</b> such as, without limitation, a wing, rotor, and/or fuselage. Drag may oppose thrust and act rearward parallel to relative wind. A further force acting upon electric aircraft <b>100</b> may include, without limitation, weight, which may include a combined load of the electric aircraft <b>100</b> itself, crew, baggage, and/or fuel. Weight may pull electric aircraft <b>100</b> downward due to the force of gravity. An additional force acting on electric aircraft <b>100</b> may include, without limitation, lift, which may act to oppose the downward force of weight and may be produced by a dynamic effect of air acting on an airfoil and/or downward thrust from a propulsor of the electric aircraft. Lift generated by an airfoil may depend on speed of airflow, density of air, total area of the airfoil and/or a segment thereof, and/or an angle of attack between air and the airfoil. In a non-limiting example, electric aircraft <b>100</b> may be designed to be as lightweight as possible. Reducing weight of an aircraft and designing to reduce a number of components may optimize weight. To save energy, it may be useful to reduce weight of components of an electric aircraft <b>100</b>, including without limitation propulsors and/or propulsion assemblies.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, electric aircraft <b>100</b> may include at least a vertical propulsor <b>104</b> and at least a forward propulsor <b>108</b>.

At least a forward propulsor may propel an aircraft forward for fixed-wing and/or &#x201c;airplane&#x201d;-style flight, takeoff, and/or landing, and/or may propel the aircraft forward or backward on the ground. At least a vertical propulsor <b>104</b> and at least a forward propulsor <b>108</b> includes a thrust element. At least a thrust element may include any device or component that converts the mechanical energy of a motor, for instance in the form of rotational motion of a shaft, into thrust in a fluid medium. At least a thrust element may include, without limitation, a device using moving or rotating foils, including without limitation one or more rotors, an airscrew or propeller, a set of airscrews or propellers such as contrarotating propellers, a moving or flapping wing, or the like.
