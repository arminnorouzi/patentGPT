end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Data providers often have data assets that are cumbersome to share. A data asset may be data that is of interest to another entity. For example, a large online retail company may have a data set that includes the purchasing habits of millions of customers over the last ten years. This data set may be large. If the online retailer wishes to share all or a portion of this data with another entity, the online retailer may need to use old and slow methods to transfer the data, such as a file-transfer-protocol (FTP), or even copying the data onto physical media and mailing the physical media to the other entity. This has several disadvantages. First, it is slow. Copying terabytes or petabytes of data can take days. Second, once the data is delivered, the sharer cannot control what happens to the data. The recipient can alter the data, make copies, or share it with other parties. Third, the only entities that would be interested in accessing such a large data set in such a manner are large corporations that can afford the complex logistics of transferring and processing the data as well as the high price of such a cumbersome data transfer. Thus, smaller entities (e.g., &#x201c;mom and pop&#x201d; shops) or even smaller, nimbler cloud-focused startups are often priced out of accessing this data, even though the data may be valuable to their businesses. This may be because raw data assets are generally too unpolished and full of potentially sensitive data to just outright sell to other companies. Data cleaning, de-identification, aggregation, joining, and other forms of data enrichment need to be performed by the owner of data before it is shareable with another party. This is time-consuming and expensive. Finally, it is difficult to share data assets with many entities because traditional data sharing methods do not allow scalable sharing for the reasons mentioned above. Traditional sharing methods also introduce latency and delays in terms of all parties having access to the most recently-updated data.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A private data exchange may allow data providers to more easily and securely share their data assets with other entities. A private data exchange can be under the data provider's brand, and the data provider may control who can gain access to it. The private data exchange may be for internal use only, or may also be opened to customers, partners, suppliers, or others. The data provider may control what data assets are listed as well as control who has access to which sets of data. This allows for a seamless way to discover and share data both within a data provider's organization and with its business partners.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The private data exchange may be facilitated by a cloud computing service such as SNOWFLAKE, and allows data providers to offer data assets directly from their own online domain (e.g., website) in a private online marketplace with their own branding. The private data exchange may provide a centralized, managed hub for an entity to list internally or externally-shared data assets, inspire data collaboration, and also to maintain data governance and to audit access. With the private data exchange, data providers may be able to share data without copying it between companies. Data providers may invite other entities to view their data listings, control which data listings appear in their private online marketplace, control who can access data listings and how others can interact with the data assets connected to the listings. This may be thought of as a &#x201c;walled garden&#x201d; marketplace, in which visitors to the garden must be approved and access to certain listings may be limited.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As an example, Company A may be a consumer data company that has collected and analyzed the consumption habits of millions of individuals in several different categories. Their data sets may include data in the following categories: online shopping, video streaming, electricity consumption, automobile usage, internet usage, clothing purchases, mobile application purchases, club memberships, and online subscription services. Company A may desire to offer these data sets (or subsets or derived products of these data sets) to other entities. For example, a new clothing brand may wish to access data sets related to consumer clothing purchases and online shopping habits. Company A may support a page on its website that is or functions substantially similar to a private data exchange, where a data consumer (e.g., the new clothing brand) may browse, explore, discover, access and potentially purchase data sets directly from Company A. Further, Company A may control: who can enter the private data exchange, the entities that may view a particular listing, the actions that an entity may take with respect to a listing (e.g., view only), and any other suitable action. In addition, a data provider may combine its own data with other data sets from, e.g., a public data exchange, and create new listings using the combined data.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">A private data exchange may be an appropriate place to discover, assemble, clean, and enrich data to make it more monetizable. A large company on a private data exchange may assemble data from across its divisions and departments, which could become valuable to another company. In addition, participants in a private ecosystem data exchange may work together to join their datasets together to jointly create a useful data product that any one of them alone would not be able to produce. Once these joined datasets are created, they may be listed on a public or private data exchange.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The systems and methods described herein provide a flexible and scalable data warehouse using a new data processing platform. In some embodiments, the described systems and methods leverage a cloud infrastructure that supports cloud-based storage resources, computing resources, and the like. Example cloud-based storage resources offer significant storage capacity available on-demand at a low cost. Further, these cloud-based storage resources may be fault-tolerant and highly scalable, which can be costly to achieve in private data storage systems. Example cloud-based computing resources are available on-demand and may be priced based on actual usage levels of the resources. Typically, the cloud infrastructure is dynamically deployed, reconfigured, and decommissioned in a rapid manner.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the described systems and methods, a data storage system utilizes an SQL (Structured Query Language)-based relational database. However, these systems and methods are applicable to any type of database, and any type of data storage and retrieval platform, using any data storage architecture and using any language to store and retrieve data within the data storage and retrieval platform. The systems and methods described herein further provide a multi-tenant system that supports isolation of computing resources and data between different customers/clients and between different users within the same customer/client.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a block diagram of an example computing environment <b>100</b> in which the systems and methods disclosed herein may be implemented. In particular, a cloud computing platform <b>110</b> may be implemented, such as AMAZON WEB SERVICES&#x2122; (AWS), MICROSOFT AZURE&#x2122;, GOOGLE CLOUD&#x2122;, or the like. As known in the art, a cloud computing platform <b>110</b> provides computing resources and storage resources that may be acquired (purchased) or leased and configured to execute applications and store data.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The cloud computing platform <b>110</b> may host a cloud computing service <b>112</b> that facilitates storage of data on the cloud computing platform <b>110</b> (e.g. data management and access) and analysis functions (e.g., SQL queries, analysis), as well as other computation capabilities (e.g., secure data sharing between users of the cloud computing platform <b>110</b>). The cloud computing platform <b>110</b> may include a three-tier architecture: data storage <b>140</b>, query processing <b>130</b>, and cloud services <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Data storage <b>140</b> may facilitate the storing of data on the cloud computing platform <b>110</b> in one or more cloud databases <b>141</b>. Data storage <b>140</b> may use a storage service such as AMAZON S3 to store data and query results on the cloud computing platform <b>110</b>. In particular embodiments, to load data into the cloud computing platform <b>110</b>, data tables may be horizontally partitioned into large, immutable files which may be analogous to blocks or pages in a traditional database system. Within each file, the values of each attribute or column are grouped together and compressed using a scheme sometimes referred to as hybrid columnar. Each table has a header which, among other metadata, contains the offsets of each column within the file.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In addition to storing table data, data storage <b>140</b> facilitates the storage of temp data generated by query operations (e.g., joins), as well as the data contained in large query results. This may allow the system to compute large queries without out-of-memory or out-of-disk errors. Storing query results this way may simplify query processing as it removes the need for server-side cursors found in traditional database systems.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Query processing <b>130</b> may handle query execution within elastic clusters of virtual machines, referred to herein as virtual warehouses or data warehouses. Thus, query processing <b>130</b> may include one or more virtual warehouses <b>131</b>, which may also be referred to herein as data warehouses. The virtual warehouses <b>131</b> may be one or more virtual machines operating on the cloud computing platform <b>110</b>. The virtual warehouses <b>131</b> may be compute resources that may be created, destroyed, or resized at any point, on demand. This functionality may create an &#x201c;elastic&#x201d; virtual warehouse that expands, contracts, or shuts down according to the user's needs. Expanding a virtual warehouse involves generating one or more compute nodes <b>132</b> to a virtual warehouse <b>131</b>. Contracting a virtual warehouse involves removing one or more compute nodes <b>132</b> from a virtual warehouse <b>131</b>. More compute nodes <b>132</b> may lead to faster compute times. For example, a data load which takes fifteen hours on a system with four nodes might take only two hours with thirty-two nodes.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Cloud services <b>120</b> may be a collection of services that coordinate activities across the cloud computing service <b>112</b>. These services tie together all of the different components of the cloud computing service <b>112</b> in order to process user requests, from login to query dispatch. Cloud services <b>120</b> may operate on compute instances provisioned by the cloud computing service <b>112</b> from the cloud computing platform <b>110</b>. Cloud services <b>120</b> may include a collection of services that manage virtual warehouses, queries, transactions, data exchanges, and the metadata associated with such services, such as database schemas, access control information, encryption keys, and usage statistics. Cloud services <b>120</b> may include, but not be limited to, authentication engine <b>121</b>, infrastructure manager <b>122</b>, optimizer <b>123</b>, exchange manager <b>124</b>, security <b>125</b> engine, and metadata storage <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example virtual warehouse <b>131</b>. The exchange manager <b>124</b> may facilitate the sharing of data between data providers and data consumers, using, for example, a private data exchange. For example, cloud computing service <b>112</b> may manage the storage and access of a database <b>108</b>. The database <b>108</b> may include various instances of user data <b>150</b> for different users, e.g. different enterprises or individuals. The user data may include a user database <b>152</b> of data stored and accessed by that user. The user database <b>152</b> may be subject to access controls such that only the owner of the data is allowed to change and access the user database <b>152</b> upon authenticating with the cloud computing service <b>112</b>. For example, data may be encrypted such that it can only be decrypted using decryption information possessed by the owner of the data. Using the exchange manager <b>124</b>, specific data from a user database <b>152</b> that is subject to these access controls may be shared with other users in a controlled manner according to the methods disclosed herein. In particular, a user may specify shares <b>154</b> that may be shared in a public or private data exchange in an uncontrolled manner or shared with specific other users in a controlled manner as described above. A &#x201c;share&#x201d; encapsulates all of the information required to share data in a database. A share may include at least three pieces of information: (1) privileges that grant access to the database(s) and the schema containing the objects to share, (2) the privileges that grant access to the specific objects (e.g., tables, secure views, and secure UDFs), and (3) the consumer accounts with which the database and its objects are shared. When data is shared, no data is copied or transferred between users. Sharing is accomplished through the cloud services <b>120</b> of cloud computing service <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Sharing data may be performed when a data provider creates a share of a database in the data provider's account and grants access to particular objects (e.g., tables, secure views, and secure user-defined functions (UDFs)). Then a read-only database may be created using the information provided in the share. Access to this database may be controlled by the data provider.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Shared data may then be used to process SQL queries, possibly including joins, aggregations, or other analysis. In some instances, a data provider may define a share such that &#x201c;secure joins&#x201d; are permitted to be performed with respect to the shared data. A secure join may be performed such that analysis may be performed with respect to shared data but the actual shared data is not accessible by the data consumer (e.g., recipient of the share). A secure join may be performed as described in U.S. application Ser. No. 16/368,339, filed Mar. 18, 2019.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">User devices <b>101</b>-<b>104</b>, such as laptop computers, desktop computers, mobile phones, tablet computers, cloud-hosted computers, cloud-hosted serverless processes, or other computing processes or devices may be used to access the virtual warehouse <b>131</b> or cloud service <b>120</b> by way of a network <b>105</b>, such as the Internet or a private network.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the description below, actions are ascribed to users, particularly consumers and providers. Such actions shall be understood to be performed with respect to devices <b>101</b>-<b>104</b> operated by such users. For example, notification to a user may be understood to be a notification transmitted to devices <b>101</b>-<b>104</b>, an input or instruction from a user may be understood to be received by way of the user's devices <b>101</b>-<b>104</b>, and interaction with an interface by a user shall be understood to be interaction with the interface on the user's devices <b>101</b>-<b>104</b>. In addition, database operations (joining, aggregating, analysis, etc.) ascribed to a user (consumer or provider) shall be understood to include performing such actions by the cloud computing service <b>112</b> in response to an instruction from that user.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic block diagram of data that may be used to implement a public or private data exchange in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The exchange manager <b>124</b> may operate with respect to some or all of the illustrated exchange data <b>200</b>, which may be stored on the platform executing the exchange manager <b>124</b> (e.g., the cloud computing platform <b>110</b>) or at some other location. The exchange data <b>200</b> may include a plurality of listings <b>202</b> describing data that is shared by a first user (&#x201c;the provider&#x201d;). The listings <b>202</b> may be listings in a private data exchange or in a public data exchange. The access controls, management, and governance of the listings may be similar for both a public data exchange and a private data exchange. A listing <b>202</b> may include metadata <b>204</b> describing the shared data. A listing <b>202</b> may include metadata <b>204</b> describing the shared data. The metadata <b>204</b> may include some or all of the following information: an identifier of the sharer of the shared data, a URL associated with the sharer, a name of the share, a name of tables, a category to which the shared data belongs, an update frequency of the shared data, a catalog of the tables, a number of columns and a number of rows in each table, as well as name and descriptions of the columns. The metadata <b>204</b> may also include examples to aid a user in using the data. Such examples may include sample tables or views that include a sample of rows and columns of an example table, example queries that may be run against the tables and/or possibly the results thereof, example views of an example table, example visualizations (e.g., graphs, dashboards) based on a table's data. Other information included in the metadata <b>204</b> may be metadata for use by business intelligence tools, text description of data contained in the table, keywords associated with the table to facilitate searching, bloom filters or other full text indices of the data in certain columns, a link (e.g., URL) to documentation related to the shared data, and a refresh interval indicating how frequently the shared data is updated (or an indication that the shared data is updated continuously) along with the date the data was last updated.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The listing <b>202</b> may include access controls <b>206</b>, which may be configurable to any suitable access configuration. For example, access controls <b>206</b> may indicate that the shared data is available to any member of the private exchange without restriction (an &#x201c;any share&#x201d; as used elsewhere herein). The access controls <b>206</b> may specify a class of users (members of a particular group or organization) that are allowed to access the data and/or see the listing. The access controls <b>206</b> may specify that a &#x201c;point-to-point&#x201d; share (see discussion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) in which users may request access but are only allowed access upon approval of the provider. The access controls <b>206</b> may specify a set of user identifiers of users that are excluded from being able to access the data referenced by the listing <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Note that some listings <b>202</b> may be discoverable by users without further authentication or access permissions whereas actual accesses are only permitted after a subsequent authentication step (see discussion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>6</b></figref>). The access controls <b>206</b> may specify that a listing <b>202</b> is only discoverable by specific users or classes of users.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Note also that a default function for listings <b>202</b> is that the data referenced by the share is not exportable or copyable by the consumer. Alternatively, the access controls <b>206</b> may specify that this operation is not permitted. For example, access controls <b>206</b> may specify that secure operations (secure joins and secure functions as discussed below) may be performed with respect to the shared data such that viewing and exporting of the shared data is not permitted.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, once a user is authenticated with respect to a listing <b>202</b>, a reference to that user (e.g., user identifier of the user's account with the virtual warehouse <b>131</b>) is added to the access controls <b>206</b> such that the user will subsequently be able to access the data referenced by the listing <b>202</b> without further authentication.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The listing <b>202</b> may define one or more filters <b>208</b>. For example, the filters <b>208</b> may define specific identity data <b>214</b> of users that may view references to the listing <b>202</b> when browsing the catalog <b>220</b>. The filters <b>208</b> may define a class of users (users of a certain profession, users associated with a particular company or organization, users within a particular geographical area or country) that may view references to the listing <b>202</b> when browsing the catalog <b>220</b>. In this manner, a private exchange may be implemented by the exchange manager <b>124</b> using the same components. In some embodiments, an excluded user that is excluded from accessing a listing <b>202</b>, i.e. adding the listing <b>202</b> to the consumed shares <b>156</b> of the excluded user, may still be permitted to view a representation of the listing when browsing the catalog <b>220</b> and may further be permitted to request access to the listing <b>202</b> as discussed below. Requests to access a listing by such excluded users and other users may be listed in an interface presented to the provider of the listing <b>202</b>. The provider of the listing <b>202</b> may then view demand for access to the listing and choose to expand the filters <b>208</b> to permit access to excluded users or classes of excluded users (e.g., users in excluded geographic regions or countries).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Filters <b>208</b> may further define what data may be viewed by a user. In particular, filters <b>208</b> may indicate that a user that selects a listing <b>202</b> to add to the consumed shares <b>156</b> of the user is permitted to access the data referenced by the listing but only a filtered version that only includes data associated with the identity data <b>214</b> of that user, associated with that user's organization, or specific to some other classification of the user. In some embodiments, a private exchange is by invitation: users invited by a provider to view listings <b>202</b> of a private exchange are enabled to do by the exchange manager <b>124</b> upon communicating acceptance of an invitation received from the provider.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, a listing <b>202</b> may be addressed to a single user. Accordingly, a reference to the listing <b>202</b> may be added to a set of &#x201c;pending shares&#x201d; that is viewable by the user. The listing <b>202</b> may then be added to a group of shares of the user upon the user communicating approval to the exchange manager <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The listing <b>202</b> may further include usage data <b>210</b>. For example, the cloud computing service <b>112</b> may implement a credit system in which credits are purchased by a user and are consumed each time a user runs a query, stores data, or uses other services implemented by the cloud computing service <b>112</b>. Accordingly, usage data <b>210</b> may record an amount of credits consumed by accessing the shared data. Usage data <b>210</b> may include other data such as a number of queries, a number of aggregations of each type of a plurality of types performed against the shared data, or other usage statistics. In some embodiments, usage data for a listing <b>202</b> or multiple listings <b>202</b> of a user is provided to the user in the form of a shared database, i.e. a reference to a database including the usage data is added by the exchange manager <b>124</b> to the consumed shares of the user.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The listing <b>202</b> may also include a heat map <b>211</b>, which may represent the geographical locations in which users have clicked on that particular listing. The cloud computing service <b>112</b> may use the heat map to make replication decisions or other decisions with the listing. For example, a private data exchange may display a listing that contains weather data for Georgia, USA. The heat map <b>211</b> may indicate that many users in California are selecting the listing to learn more about the weather in Georgia. In view of this information, the cloud computing service <b>112</b> may replicate the listing and make it available in a database whose servers are physically located in the western United States, so that consumers in California may have access to the data. In some embodiments, an entity may store its data on servers located in the western United States. A particular listing may be very popular to consumers. The cloud computing service <b>112</b> may replicate that data and store it in servers located in the eastern United States, so that consumers in the Midwest and on the East Coast may also have access to that data.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The listing <b>202</b> may also include one or more tags <b>213</b>. The tags <b>213</b> may facilitate simpler sharing of data contained in one or more listings. As an example, a large company may have a human resources (HR) listing containing HR data for its internal employees on a private data exchange. The HR data may contain ten types of HR data (e.g., employee number, selected health insurance, current retirement plan, job title, etc.). The HR listing may be accessible to 100 people in the company (e.g., everyone in the HR department). Management of the HR department may wish to add an eleventh type of HR data (e.g., an employee stock option plan). Instead of manually adding this to the HR listing and granting each of the 100 people access to this new data, management may simply apply an HR tag to the new data set and that can be used to categorize the data as HR data, list it along with the HR listing, and grant access to the 100 people to view the new data set.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The listing <b>202</b> may also include version metadata <b>215</b>. Version metadata <b>215</b> may provide a way to track how the datasets are changed. This may assist in ensuring that the data that is being viewed by one entity is not changed prematurely. For example, if a company has an original data set and then releases an updated version of that data set, the updates could interfere with another user's processing of that data set, because the update could have different formatting, new columns, and other changes that may be incompatible with the current processing mechanism of the recipient user. To remedy this, the cloud computing service <b>112</b> may track version updates using version metadata <b>215</b>. The cloud computing service <b>112</b> may ensure that each data consumer accesses the same version of the data until they accept an updated version that will not interfere with current processing of the data set.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The exchange data <b>200</b> may further include user records <b>212</b>. The user record <b>212</b> may include data identifying the user associated with the user record <b>212</b>, e.g. an identifier (e.g., warehouse identifier) of a user having user data <b>130</b> in service database <b>158</b> and managed by the virtual warehouse <b>131</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The user record <b>212</b> may list shares associated with the user, e.g., reference listings <b>154</b> created by the user. The user record <b>212</b> may list shares consumed by the user, e.g., reference listings <b>202</b> created by another user and that have been associated to the account of the user according to the methods described herein. For example, a listing <b>202</b> may have an identifier that will be used to reference it in the shares or consumed shares of a user record <b>212</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The exchange data <b>200</b> may further include a catalog <b>220</b>. The catalog <b>220</b> may include a listing of all available listings <b>202</b> and may include an index of data from the metadata <b>204</b> to facilitate browsing and searching according to the methods described herein. In some embodiments, listings <b>202</b> are stored in the catalog in the form of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) objects.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Note that where there a multiple instances of the virtual warehouse <b>131</b> on different cloud computing platforms, the catalog <b>220</b> of one instance of the virtual warehouse <b>131</b> may store listings or references to listings from other instances on one or more other cloud computing platforms <b>110</b>. Accordingly, each listing <b>202</b> may be globally unique (e.g., be assigned a globally unique identifier across all of the instances of the virtual warehouse <b>131</b>). For example, the instances of the virtual warehouses <b>131</b> may synchronize their copies of the catalog <b>220</b> such that each copy indicates the listings <b>202</b> available from all instances of the virtual warehouse <b>131</b>. In some instances, a provider of a listing <b>202</b> may specify that it is to be available on only on specified one or more computing platforms <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments, the catalog <b>220</b> is made available on the Internet such that it is searchable by a search engine such as BING or GOOGLE. The catalog may be subject to a search engine optimization (SEO) algorithm to promote its visibility. Potential consumers may therefore browse the catalog <b>220</b> from any web browser. The exchange manager <b>124</b> may expose uniform resource locators (URLs) linked to each listing <b>202</b>. This web page underlying each URL may be searchable can be shared outside of any interface implemented by the exchange manager <b>124</b>. For example, the provider of a listing <b>202</b> may publish the URLs for its listings <b>202</b> in order to promote usage of its listing <b>202</b> and its brand.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates various components <b>300</b>-<b>310</b> that may be included in the exchange manager <b>124</b>. A creation module <b>300</b> may provide an interface for creating listings <b>202</b>. For example, a web page interface enables a user on one or more devices <b>101</b>-<b>104</b> to select data, e.g. a specific table in user data <b>150</b> of the user, for sharing and enter values defining some or all of the metadata <b>204</b>, access controls <b>206</b>, and filters <b>208</b>. In some embodiments, creation may be performed by a user by way of SQL commands in an SQL interpreter executing on the cloud computing platform <b>110</b> and accessed by way of a webpage interface on a user device <b>101</b>-<b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">A validation module <b>302</b> may validate information provided by a provider when attempting to create a listing <b>202</b>. Note that in some embodiments the actions ascribed to the validation module <b>302</b> may be performed by a human reviewing the information provided by the provider. In other embodiments, these actions are performed automatically. The validation module <b>302</b> may perform, or facilitate performing by a human operator of various functions. These functions may include verifying that the metadata <b>204</b> is consistent with the shared data to which it references, verifying that the shared data referenced by metadata <b>204</b> is not pirated data, personal identification information (PII), personal health information (PHI) or other data for which sharing is undesirable or illegal. The validation module <b>302</b> may also facilitate the verification that the data has been updated within a threshold period of time (e.g., within the last twenty-four hours). The validation module <b>302</b> may also facilitate verifying that the data is not static or not available from other static public sources. The validation module <b>302</b> may also facilitate verifying that the data is more than merely a sample (e.g., that the data is sufficiently complete to be useful). For example, geographically limited data may be undesirable whereas an aggregation of data that is not otherwise limited may still be of use.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The exchange manager <b>124</b> may include a search module <b>304</b>. The search module <b>304</b> may implement a webpage interface that is accessible by a user on one or more user devices <b>101</b>-<b>104</b> in order to invoke searches for search strings with respect to the metadata in the catalog <b>220</b>, receive responses to searches, and select references to listings <b>202</b> in search results for adding to the consumed shares <b>156</b> of the user record <b>212</b> of the user performing the search. In some embodiments, searches may be performed by a user by way of SQL commands in an SQL interpreter executing on the cloud computing platform <b>110</b> and accessed by way of a webpage interface on user devices <b>101</b>-<b>104</b>. For example, searching for shares may be performed by way of SQL queries against the catalog <b>220</b> within the SQL engine <b>310</b> discussed below.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The search module <b>304</b> may further implement a recommendation algorithm. For example, the recommendation algorithm could recommend other listing <b>202</b> for a user based on other listings in the user's consumed shares <b>156</b> or formerly in the user's consumed shares. Recommendations could be based on logical similarity: one source of weather data leads to a recommendation for a second source of weather data. Recommendations could be based on dissimilarity: one listing is for data in one domain (geographic area, technical field, etc.) results in a listing for a different domain to facilitate complete coverage by the user's analysis (different geographic area, related technical field, etc.).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The exchange manager <b>124</b> may include an access management module <b>306</b>. As described above, a user may add a listing <b>202</b>. This may require authentication with respect to the provider of the listing <b>202</b>. Once a listing <b>202</b> is added to the consumed shares <b>156</b> of the user record <b>212</b> of a user, the user may be either (a) required to authenticate each time the data referenced by the listing <b>202</b> is accessed or (b) be automatically authenticated and allowed to access the data once the listing <b>202</b> is added. The access management module <b>306</b> may manage automatic authentication for subsequent access of data in the consumed shares <b>156</b> of a user in order to provide seamless access of the shared data as if it was part of the user data <b>150</b> of that user. To that end, the access management module <b>306</b> may access controls <b>206</b> of the listing <b>202</b>, certificates, tokens, or other authentication material in order to authenticate the user when performing accesses to shared data.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The exchange manager <b>124</b> may include a joining module <b>308</b>. The joining module <b>308</b> manages the integration of shared data referenced by consumed shares <b>156</b> of a user with one another, i.e. shared data from different providers, and with a user database <b>152</b> of data owned by the user. In particular, the joining module <b>308</b> may manage the execution of queries and other computation functions with respect to these various sources of data such that their access is transparent to the user. The joining module <b>308</b> may further manage the access of data to enforce restrictions on shared data, e.g. such that analysis may be performed and the results of the analysis displayed without exposing the underlying data to the consumer of the data where this restriction is indicated by the access controls <b>206</b> of a listing <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The exchange manager <b>124</b> may further include a standard query language (SQL) engine <b>310</b> that is programmed to receive queries from a user and execute the query with respect to data referenced by the query, which may include consumed shares <b>156</b> of the user and the user database <b>152</b> owned by the user. The SQL engine <b>310</b> may perform any query processing functionality known in the art. The SQL engine <b>310</b> may additionally or alternatively include any other database management tool or data analysis tool known in the art.

The consumer <b>404</b> and provider <b>402</b> may then interact to one or both of (a) authenticate (login) <b>424</b> the consumer <b>404</b> with respect to the provider <b>402</b> and (b) process <b>424</b> payment for access of the data referenced by the listing <b>202</b>. This interaction may be according to any approach to logging in or authenticating or known in the art. Likewise, any approach for processing payment between parties may be implemented. In some embodiments, the data warehouse module may provide a rebate to the provider <b>402</b> due to credits consumed by the consumer <b>404</b> when accessing the shared data of the provider. Credits may be units of usage purchased by a user that are then consumed in response to the services of the virtual warehouse <b>131</b> used by the consumer <b>404</b>, e.g. queries and other analytics performed on data hosted by the virtual warehouse <b>131</b>. The interaction may be directly between devices <b>126</b> of the consumer <b>404</b> and provider <b>402</b> or may be performed by way of the exchange manager <b>124</b>. In some embodiments, the exchange manager <b>124</b> authenticates the consumer <b>404</b> using the access control information <b>206</b> such that interaction with the provider <b>402</b> is not needed.

For example, the exchange manager <b>124</b> may present an interface to the cloud service <b>120</b> on the devices <b>101</b>-<b>104</b> of the consumer <b>404</b>. The consumer <b>404</b> inputs authentication information (username and password, certificate, token, etc.) into the interface and this information is forwarded to the authentication engine <b>121</b> of the cloud service <b>120</b>. The authentication information processes the authentication information and, if the information corresponds to a user account, notifies the exchange manager <b>124</b> that the consumer <b>404</b> is authenticated with respect to that user account. The exchange manager <b>124</b> may then identify the user data <b>150</b> for that user account and create a database referencing it.

Step <b>608</b> may be performed by the virtual warehouse <b>131</b> in response to the request form the consumer <b>404</b> to do so.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Note that the result of the join may be either (a) a new database that is a result of the join or (b) a joined database view that defines a join of the shared data and the user data.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">The result from step <b>608</b> (joining, aggregating, analyzing, etc.) may alternatively be added to the original share performed at step <b>606</b>, <b>608</b>, e.g. a view (materialized or non-materialized) defining the operations performed at step <b>608</b>.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Steps <b>608</b>-<b>612</b> may also be performed by the virtual warehouse <b>131</b> in response to a request from the consumer <b>404</b> or provider <b>402</b> to do so independently from the request made at step <b>602</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Note that in many instances there are many consumers <b>404</b> that attempt to perform bi-directional shares with respect to the provider <b>402</b> and these consumers <b>404</b> may seek bi-directional shares with respect to their user data that may be in many different formats (schemas) that may be different from a schema used by the shared data of the provider <b>402</b>. Accordingly, step <b>608</b> may include a transformation step. The transformation step maps a source schema of the user's data to a target schema of the shared data. The transformation may be a static transformation provided by a human operator. The transformation may be according to an algorithm that maps column labels of the source schema to corresponding column labels of the target schema. The algorithm may include a machine learning or artificial intelligence model that is trained to perform the transformation. For example, a plurality of training data entries may be specified by human annotators that each include as an input a source schema and as an output include a mapping between the source schema and the target schema. These entries may then be used to train a machine learning or artificial intelligence algorithm to output a mapping to a target schema for a given input source schema.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Data added to the shares consumed by the consumer <b>404</b> and provider <b>402</b> may then be operated on by the consumer <b>404</b> and provider <b>402</b>, respectively, such as by executing queries against the data, aggregating the data, analyzing the data, or performing any other actions described herein as being performed with respect to shares added to the consumed shares <b>156</b> of a user.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In particular embodiments, a data provider may improve its relationship with business partners by enabling the secure interchange of data in a bi-directional manner, as discussed above. Traditional methods of bi-directional data sharing have been challenging to accomplish, and only very limited sets of data are shared via APIs, FTP, or file transfer between companies. And this often comes at great cost, expense, data latency, and even some security risk.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">A data provider may instead host a private data exchange, and invite their customers and partners to participate in the exchange. Customers and partners may access data in secure views, for example, and they may also push data in the other direction as well. This could be to share data back to the host, but also to potentially list data so that other participants of the ecosystem can securely share it as well. Data from a public data exchange, other private exchanges, or from other external sources may also be included.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Every large company depends on other companies, and on its customers. Bidirectionally sharing data not only from the company to and from these parties, but also between these external parties themselves, can allow rich, collaborative data ecosystems to develop where groups of companies can work together around data. They can securely discover, combine, and enrich data assets to help service a common customer, or to form new partnerships amongst themselves. Some of these relationships may even lead to opportunities to sell data, secure views of or functions across data to other participants of a walled garden ecosystem.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the approach to sharing and consuming data as described herein enables enrichment of data and return of that enriched data to the exchange. For example, provider A may request <b>702</b> sharing of data (share 1) with the exchange in the same manner as for other methods described herein. The exchange manager <b>124</b> verifies, validates, and adds <b>704</b> share 1 to the catalog <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">A second provider B may then browse the catalog <b>220</b> and add <b>706</b> share 1 to its consumed shares <b>156</b>. Provider B may perform <b>708</b> operations on the shared data such as joining it with other data, performing aggregations, and/or performing other analysis with respect to share 1, resulting in modified data (share 2). Provider B may then request <b>710</b> sharing of share 2 with the exchange as described herein. Note that the joining of step <b>708</b> may include joining any number of databases, such as any number of shares based on any number of listings by any number of other users. Accordingly, iterations of steps <b>702</b>-<b>710</b> by many users may be viewed as a hierarchy in which a large number of listings <b>202</b> of multiple users are narrowed down to a smaller number of listings <b>202</b> based on the data from the larger number of listings <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">The exchange manager <b>124</b> verifies, validates, and adds <b>712</b> share 2 to the catalog <b>220</b>. This process may be repeated <b>714</b> with respect to share 2, as provider A, provider B, or a different provider adds share 2, generates modified data based on it, and adds the result back to the catalog in the same manner. In this manner, a rich ecosystem of data and analysis may be made available to users. The shares according to the method <b>700</b> may be any shares, point-to-point shares, private exchange shares, or bi-directional exchange shares according to the methods disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Note that there is a possibility that provider may perform steps <b>708</b> and <b>710</b> with respect to a listing <b>202</b> that is based on a listing <b>202</b>. For example, listing L1 of provider A is used by provider B to create listing L2, which is used by provider C to create listing L3, which is used by provider A to define listing L1. Such a flow could include any number of steps. This may be undesirable in some cases such that modification of listing L1 to reference L3 is not permitted in view L3 being derived from L1. In other instances, such a loop is permitted provided there is a time delay in when the data referenced by each listing is refreshed. For example, L1 may reference L3 provided L3 will not be refreshed until some time after L1 is refreshed and therefore the circular reference will not result in continuous updating of L1 and L3 ad infinitum. Non-looping flows are also contemplated by this disclosure, such that listing L1 is not influenced by other providers' use of listing L1</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">The listing created at step <b>712</b> (Share 2) may either (a) include copies of the data from Share 1 remaining after step <b>708</b> and as modified according to step <b>708</b> or (b) include a view referencing Share 1 (e.g., a database created based on the listing <b>202</b> for Share 1 according to the methods disclosed herein) and defining the operations performed at step <b>708</b> without including actual data from Share 1 or derived from Share 1. Accordingly, a hierarchy as described above may be a hierarchy of views that either reference one or both of listing <b>202</b> that are views created according to the method <b>700</b> or listing <b>202</b> of data from one or more providers according to any of the methods disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In the methods disclosed herein approaches are disclosed for creating shares (listings <b>202</b>) and for adding shares. In a like manner, a consumer <b>404</b> may instruct the exchange manager <b>124</b> to remove added shares. A provider <b>402</b> may instruct the exchange manager <b>124</b> to cease sharing certain listings <b>202</b>. In some embodiments, this may be accompanied by actions to avoid disrupting consumers <b>404</b> of those listings <b>202</b>. Such as by notifying these consumers <b>404</b> and ceasing to share the listings <b>202</b> only after a specified time period after the notification or after all consumers <b>404</b> have removed references to the listings <b>202</b> from their consumed shares <b>156</b>.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Use Cases</heading><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In a first use case a company implements a private exchange according to the methods described above. In particular, listing <b>202</b> of the company are viewable only by consumers <b>404</b> that are associated (employees, management, investors, etc.) with the company. Likewise, adding of listing <b>202</b> is permitted only for those associated with the company. When adding a listing <b>202</b> to the consumed shares <b>156</b>, it may be filtered based on the identity of the consumer that adds it, i.e. data that is relevant to the consumer's role within the company.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">In a second use case, a provider <b>402</b> creates a reader or reader/writer account for a consumer <b>404</b> that is not yet a user of the virtual warehouse <b>131</b>. The account may be associated with the account data of the consumer (see consumer map of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> discussed above). The consumer <b>404</b> may then log on to that account and then access the provider's listings to access the consumer's data <b>404</b> that is managed by the provider <b>402</b> (see, e.g. discussion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">In a fifth use case a consumer <b>404</b> adds shares that are private (e.g., accessible due to the identity of the consumer <b>404</b> according to the methods described above) and shares that are public. These may then be joined by the consumer <b>404</b> and used to process queries.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">In a sixth use case, a listing <b>202</b> may be shared based on a subscription (e.g., monthly) or be accessed based on per-query pricing, or a credit uplift multiplier. Accordingly, the exchange manager <b>124</b> may manage processing of payment and access such that the consumer <b>404</b> is allowed to access the data subject to the pricing model (subscription, per query, etc.).</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In a seventh use case, the exchange manager <b>124</b> implements secure functions and secure machine learning models (both training and scoring) that may be used to process private data such that the consumer <b>404</b> is allowed to use the result of the function or machine learning model but does not have access to the raw data processed by the function or machine learning model itself. Likewise, the consumer of the shared data is not allowed to export the shared data. The consumer is nonetheless allowed to perform analytical functions with respect to the shared data. For example, the following secure function may be implemented to enable viewing of customer shopping data in a secure manner:</p><p id="p-0121" num="0000">create or replace secure function<br/>UDF_DEMO.PUBLIC.get_market_basket(input_item_sk number(38))<br/>returns table (input_item NUMBER(38,0), basket_item_sk NUMBER(38,0),<br/>num_baskets NUMBER(38,0))<br/>as<br/>&#x2018;select input_item_sk, ss_item_sk_basket_Item, count(distinct<br/>ss_ticket_number) baskets<br/>from udf_demo.public.sales<br/>where ss_ticket_number in (select ss_ticket_number from udf_demo.public.sales where<br/>ss_item_sk=input_item_sk)<br/>group by ss_item_sk<br/>order by 3 desc, 2&#x2019;;</p><p id="p-0122" num="0120">In an eighth use case, the exchange manager <b>124</b> may provide usage statistics of a listing <b>202</b> by one or more consumers <b>404</b> to the provider <b>402</b> of the listing, e.g. queries, credits used, tables scanned, tables hit, etc.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0121">In a ninth use case, the systems and methods disclosed herein are used for industry-specific applications.

The first user shares data regarding a marketing campaign to the second user, such as campaign metadata, current user events (session start/end for specific users, purchases for specific users, etc.). This may be accomplished using the bi-directional sharing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. This data may be joined (customer list+customer events from first user) in order to obtain a better understanding about events for a specific user or groups of users. As noted above, this exchange of data may be performed without creating copies or transferring data&#x2014;each user accesses the same copy of the shared data.

A data provider <b>810</b> may upload one or more data sets <b>820</b> in cloud storage using a cloud computing service <b>112</b>. These data sets may then become viewable by one or more data consumers <b>101</b>-<b>104</b>. The data provider <b>810</b> may be able to control, monitor, and increase the security of its data using the cloud computing service <b>112</b> using the methods and systems discussed herein. In particular embodiments, the data provider <b>810</b> may implement a private data exchange on its own online domain using the functionality, methods, and systems provided by cloud computing service <b>112</b>. Data providers <b>810</b> may be any provider of data, such as retail companies, government agencies, polling agencies, non-profit organizations, etc. The data consumers <b>101</b>-<b>104</b> may be internal to the data provider <b>810</b> or external to the data provider <b>810</b>. A data consumer that is internal to the data provider may be an employee of the data provider. The data provider may be a bike-share company, which provides bicycles for a daily, monthly, annual, or trip-based fee. The bike share company may gather data about its users, such as basic demographic information as well as ride information, including date of ride, time of ride, and duration of ride. This information may be available to employees of the bike share company via the cloud computing service <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">The interaction between a data provider <b>810</b>, private data exchange <b>812</b> (as implemented by cloud computing service <b>112</b>), and a data consumer may be as follows. The data provider may create one or more listings <b>811</b> using data sets <b>820</b>. The listings may be for any suitable data. For example, a consumer data company may create a listing called &#x201c;video streaming&#x201d; that contains data related to the video streaming habits of a large number of users. The data provider may set listing policies <b>821</b> related to who may view the listing <b>811</b>, who may access the data in the listing <b>811</b>, or any other suitable policy. Such listing policies are discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The data provider <b>810</b> may then submit to the private exchange <b>812</b> at step <b>813</b>. The private data exchange <b>812</b> may be embedded inside a web domain of the data provider <b>810</b>. For example, if the web domain of the consumer data company is www.entityA.com, the private data exchange may be found at www.entityA.com/privatedataexchange. The private data exchange <b>812</b> may receive the listing and approve it at step <b>814</b> if the listing complies with one or more rules as determined by the cloud computing service <b>112</b>. The private data exchange <b>812</b> may then set up access controls at <b>815</b> at least in part according to the listing policies what were set in step <b>821</b>. The private data exchange <b>812</b> may then invite members at step <b>816</b>. The members may be data consumers <b>801</b>. The data consumers <b>801</b> may accept the invitation at step <b>817</b> and then may begin consuming the data at <b>818</b>. The type of data consumption may depend on the access controls that were established at <b>815</b>. For example, the data consumer may be able to read the data only or share the data. As another example, a data consumer may be able to do any combination of the above read, or share operations on the data, subject to the access controls. In general, data sharing does not involve altering shared data.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">In some embodiments, a data consumer <b>801</b> may independently access the private data exchange <b>812</b>, either by directly navigating to the private data exchange <b>812</b> in a browser, or by clicking on an advertisement for the private data exchange <b>812</b>, or by any other suitable mechanism. A private data exchange may also be rendered via custom or other code by accessing listing and other information via an API. If the data consumer <b>801</b> wishes to access the data within a listing and the listing is not already universally available or the data consumer <b>801</b> does not already have access, the data consumer <b>801</b> may need to request access at step <b>820</b>. The data provider may approve or deny the request at <b>822</b>. If approved, the private data exchange may grant access to the listing at <b>823</b>. The user may then begin consuming the data as discussed above.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">In particular embodiments, one or more data exchange administrator accounts may be designated by the cloud computing service <b>112</b>. The data exchange administrator may manage members of the private data exchange by designating members as data providers <b>810</b> or data consumers <b>801</b>. The data exchange administrator may be able to control listing visibility by selecting which members can see a given listing. The data exchange administrator may also have other functions such as approving listings before they are published on the private data exchange, track usage of each of the listings, or any other suitable administrative function. In some embodiments, the data provider and the data exchange administrator are part of the same entity; in some embodiments, they are separate entities. The provider may create listings, may test sample queries on the data underlying a listing, may set listing access, grant access to listing requests, and track usage of each of the listings and the data underlying the listings. A data consumer <b>801</b> may visit a private data exchange and browse visible listings which may appear as tiles. To consume the data underlying a listing, the consumer may either immediately access the data, or may request access to the data.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is an example private data exchange <b>900</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Private data exchange <b>900</b> may be what a data consumer sees when she navigates to the private data exchange on the web. For example, the data consumer may enter www.entityA.com/privatedataexchange in her browser. As discussed herein, &#x201c;Entity A Data Exchange&#x201d; may be a private data exchange that is facilitated by the cloud computing service <b>112</b> and is embedded into Entity A's own web domain or into an application, or may be accessed via an API. Private data exchange <b>900</b> may include several listings for different data sets, for example listings A-L. The listing A-L may also be referred to herein as a data catalog, which may allow visitors to the private data exchange to view all the available listings in the private data exchange. These listings may be placed by an administrator internal to Entity A. Providing a data catalog in this manner may serve to combine the benefits of crowdsourced content, data quality, and the right level of centralized control and coordination that can overcome the challenges that have slowed the adoption of other approaches to enterprise data cataloging (e.g., indexing and crawling systems). It allows users across an enterprise to contribute data, use data from other groups, and join data together to create enriched data products, for both internal use as well as potentially for external monetization.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">As an example and not by way of limitation, Entity A may be a consumer data company that has collected and analyzed the consuming habits of millions of individuals in several different categories. Their data sets may include data in the following categories: online shopping, video streaming, electricity consumption, automobile usage, internet usage, clothing purchases, mobile application purchases, club memberships, and online subscription services. Each of these data sets may correspond to different listings. For example, Listing A may be for online shopping data, Listing B may be for video streaming data, Listing C may be for electricity consumption data, and so on. Note that the data may be anonymized so that individual identities are not revealed. The listings located below line <b>915</b> may correspond to third-party listings that entity A may allow on its private data exchange. Such listings may be generated by other data providers and may be subject to approval by Entity A before being added to the private data exchange <b>900</b>. A data consumer may click on and view any of the listings subject to various access controls and policies as discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">In particular embodiments, a data provider may invite members to access its private data exchange, as discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. One class of members may be the physical and digital supply chain suppliers of the data provider. For example, a data provider may share data with suppliers on its inventory levels or consumption of things provided by the suppliers, so they can better meet the needs of the data provider. In addition, digital data providers may provide data directly into its private data exchange, to make it immediately usable and joinable to the internal enterprise data, saving costs for both parties on transmitting, storing, and loading the data.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">Some companies such as hedge funds and marketing agencies bring in data from many external sources. Some hedge funds evaluate hundreds of potential data sets per year. A private data exchange may be used to not only connect with data that has already been purchased, but can also be used to evaluate new data assets. For example, a hedge fund could have potential data suppliers list their data on their private exchange, and the fund could explore and &#x201c;shop&#x201d; for data in a private data store where they are the only customer. Such an internal data store could also &#x201c;tunnel&#x201d; in data assets from a public Data Exchange (e.g., the SNOWFLAKE public Data Exchange), as discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">As another example, an existing provider of marketing data to a company could list some additional datasets that their customer could use via their private exchange on a trial basis, and if the customer finds them useful, the supplier can immediately provide full access through the same exchange. These arrangements can bring much greater depth of data, bi-directional and much fresher data, and greater trust and transparency to relationships between suppliers of data and physical goods and their customers.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example secure view of shared data from a private data exchange. When a data consumer <b>1020</b> wishes to access data in a listing (e.g., Listing H), the cloud computing service <b>112</b> may facilitate access via a secure view of shared data <b>1010</b>. The secure view of shared data <b>1010</b> may include metadata <b>1015</b> that includes the metadata and access controls discussed herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. This may allow data providers to share data without exposing the underlying tables or internal details. This makes the data more private and secure. With a secure view of shared data <b>1010</b>, the view definition and details are only visible to authorized users.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">In a private data exchange, data may be shared both within the same entity and between different entities. Additionally, the data sharing may be one-way, two-way, or multi-way. In one embodiment, his can lead to up to five main use-cases for sharing data: two-way inter-entity, two-way intra-entity, one-way inter-entity, one-way intra-entity, and multi-way multi-entity. An example of two-way inter-entity data sharing may be data sharing from portfolio companies to a parent company and between portfolio companies. An example of two-way intra entity data sharing may be data sharing from the headquarters of a large company to the different business units within that company, and also data sharing from the business units to headquarters. An example of one-way inter-entity data sharing may be a large data provider (e.g., a national weather service) that shares data with lots of different entities, but does not receive data from those entities. An example of one-way intra-entity may be a large company that provides data to its respective business units but does not receive data from those business units. In particular embodiments, data may be shared as &#x201c;point-to-point shares&#x201d; of specific data, or as &#x201c;any-shares.&#x201d; A point-to-point share of specific data may include a private data exchange share between a parent company and specific portfolio companies. An any-share may include a private data exchange share from a parent company to a broad group of data consumers on a public or within a private exchange.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">In particular embodiments, the cloud computing service <b>112</b> may generate a private data exchange for an entity who is the owner of the data to be shared on the private data exchange. The cloud computing service <b>112</b> may designate one or more administrators of the private data exchange. These administrators may have control over the access rights of the private data exchange with regard to other users. For example, an administrator may be able to add another user account to the private data exchange and designate that account as a data provider, data consumer, exchange administrator, or a combination of these.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">In particular embodiments, the exchange administrator may control viewing and access rights to the private data exchange. Viewing rights may include a list of entities that may view the listing in the private data exchange. Access rights may include a list of entities that may access the data after selecting a particular listing. For example, a company may publish private data exchange <b>900</b> and may include several listings, Listing A through Listing L. Each of these listings may include their own individual viewing and access rights. For example, Listing A may include a first list of entities that have rights to view the listing on the private data exchange <b>900</b> and a second list of entities that have rights to access the listing. Viewing a listing may simply be to see that the listing exists on the private data exchange. Accessing a listing may be to select the listing and access the underlying data for that listing. Access may include both viewing the underlying data, manipulating that data, or both. Controlling viewing rights may be useful for data providers who do not want some users to even know that a certain listing exists on the private data exchange. Thus, when a user who does not have viewing rights to a particular listing visits the private data exchange, that user will not even see the listing on the exchange. In particular embodiments, the above discussed viewing and access rights may be provisioned via an application program interface (API). The exchange catalog may be queries and updated via the API. This may allow a data provider to show listings on its own application or website to anyone who visits. When a user wants to access or request access to data, the user may then create an account with the cloud computing service <b>112</b> and obtain access. In some embodiments, a URL may be called with a user requests access to data within a listing. This may allow for integration with external request approval workflows. For example, if a user makes an access request, an external request approval workflow of the data provider may be accessed and activated. The external request approval workflow may then operate normally to perform an external request approval process. In some embodiments, a listing may be unlisted, which means that the listing exists but is not visible on the data exchange. To access an unlisted listing, a consumer may input a global URL into the browser. This may require a unique URL for each listing.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">In particular embodiments, when a new private data exchange is created for a data provider, the cloud computing service <b>112</b> may designate an exchange admin (e.g., the data exchange administrator, as discussed above), and may also generate the following metadata about the private data exchange: the name of the private data exchange, which needs to be unique, a display name, a logo, a short description of the private data exchange, and an indication of whether approval from the exchange admin is necessary for publishing (e.g., Admin_Approval_for_Publishing). This may be a true/false statement. It may be set to true if the exchange admin needs to approve listings submitted to the private data exchange before they are published. It may be set to false if the exchange admin does not need to provide such approval. In this case, providers can publish data directly. If the exchange admin sets the Admin_Approval_for_Publishing to True, the exchange admin may be able to see a list of Listings, and select a listing to preview and approve/reject. The owner of the private data exchange may be the account that is paying for the private data exchange. This metadata information may be stored as part of an Exchange object. Also stored in association with the private data exchange may be the users and accounts who provide data to the exchange, the consumers of the exchange, and the exchange admin(s).</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">In particular embodiments, the exchange admin may add members (e.g., data providers and data consumers) to the private data exchange by inviting the members in any suitable manner. For example, by inviting the users' accounts on the cloud computing service <b>112</b>, or by sending an email to the users' email account addresses. When the exchange admin adds a member to the private data exchange, the exchange admin may also specify one or more member-types: exchange admin, provider, or consumer. An exchange admin may be able to add and remove members from the private data exchange and to edit metadata associated with the private data exchange. For each user, the exchange admin may designate whether the user is an exchange admin, a data provider, and a data consumer, or multiple of these roles. The following table summarizes the rights associated with each type of account.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="252pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Rights Associated with Each Type of Private Data Exchange Account</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="147pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>is_Exchange_</entry><entry>is_Data_</entry><entry>is_Data_</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>Admin</entry><entry>Provider</entry><entry>Consumer</entry><entry>Description</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>False</entry><entry>False</entry><entry>True</entry><entry>Can Discover &#x26; Consume listings (subject</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>to Listing visibility and access rules), but</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>cannot publish listings</entry></row><row><entry>False</entry><entry>True</entry><entry>True</entry><entry>Can Discover &#x26; Consume listings (subject</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>to Listing visibility and access rules), plus</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>can publish listings</entry></row><row><entry>False</entry><entry>True</entry><entry>False</entry><entry>Can publish listings, but when they go to</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>the consumer view they only see their own</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>listings.

Additionally, existing shares added to the Exchange by the member are no longer considered part of the private data exchange. The listings published by that member may be archived, and are no longer visible in the UI to anyone, including the member. The cloud computing service <b>112</b> can un-archive this if the same member (same account on the cloud computing service <b>112</b>) who has been removed is made a Provider again.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0143">In some embodiments, the exchange admin may be able to specify a list of categories as well as edit an existing list. Categories may have icons associated with them, and the exchange admin may be able to specify the icon along with the category name.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0144">When a member becomes a data provider, a provider profile may be generated that includes a logo, a description of the provider, and a URL to the provider's website. When submitting listings, a provider may do the following: select which private data exchange to publish the data in (e.g., many private exchanges may exist and the provider may need to select a subset of these exchanges, which may be one or more), and set metadata about the new listing. The metadata may include a listing title, a listing type (e.g., Standard or Personalized), a listing description, one or more usage examples (e.g., title and sample queries), a listing category, which may be input as free form text, an update frequency for the listing, a support email/URL, and a documentation link. The provider may also set access for the listing. The provider may allow the exchange admin to control the visibility of the listing, or the provider may retain that control for itself. The provider may also associate a share with a listing. For a standard share, a listing may be associated with zero or more shares. The provider may associate shares to a listing through the UI or SQL. For personalized shares, when the provider provisions a share in response to a request, the provider may associate that share with the listing. When the provider wishes to publish the listing, the listing may first need approval from the exchange admin, depending on the publishing rules of the private data exchange.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0145"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example tunneling of a data listing between a public data exchange and a private data exchange. Alternatively, data may be tunneled between two public data exchanges or between two private data exchanges, or from one public exchange to multiple private exchanges, or any other suitable combination. In some embodiments, an entity may wish to offer a publicly listed data listing on its private data exchange. For example, Entity B may wish to include Listing F of public data exchange <b>1100</b> on its own private data exchange <b>1000</b>. The data underlying Listing F may be tunneled from public data exchange <b>1100</b> to private data exchange <b>1000</b>. In particular embodiments, data may be tunneled between two private data exchanges. At times, a first data provider may wish to allow a second data provider to list data belonging to the first data provider on a private data exchange of the second data provider. Tunneling of data listings may allow the two data providers to offer the same listing. As an example, Entity A and Entity B may have a business agreement to share listing F on each of their private data exchanges. Listing F may be the property of Entity A, but Entity B may have a license to offer it on its private data exchange as well. In this case, both of the listings titled &#x201c;Listing F&#x201d; will point to the same data set stored in cloud computing platform <b>110</b>. The tunnel <b>1015</b> is a representation to illustrate that Listing F may be shared securely and easily between two or more data exchanges <b>1100</b> and <b>1000</b>. No data is copied or transferred in the tunneling. Instead, each listing contains a pointer to the data referenced by Listing F as discussed herein.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0146">In particular embodiments, tunnel linking may be accomplished between a private data exchange and a public data exchange, or vice versa. For instance, data exchange <b>1100</b> may be a public data exchange. Entity B may use a listing listed on the public data exchange <b>1100</b> on its own private data exchange <b>1000</b> via tunnel <b>1015</b>. In some embodiments, a data listing may be tunneled from one data exchange to another data exchange and then the underlying data may be joined with another data set, and then a new listing may be generated from the combined data set. As an example and not by way of limitation, a first data set may be listed on a private data exchange that includes NBA player shooting statistics over the last five years. A second data set may be listed on a different data exchange that includes weather data over the same time span. These two data sets may be joined and listed as a new listing in either a private or a public data exchange. Data consumers may then access this data set, subject to the viewing and access controls discussed herein, to gain insight into how the weather might affect player shooting percentages. Additionally, if data is listed on a public data exchange (e.g., a data exchange hosted by the cloud computing service <b>112</b>), this data may be tunneled to a private data exchange.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0147">In some embodiments, tunneling of datasets may be used to create an &#x201c;industry-wide&#x201d; data exchange that is either public or private. Many different entities may tunnel datasets to a &#x201c;mega ecosystem data exchange.&#x201d; If a private ecosystem data exchange really takes off, it could become so big and influential that it could become the standard place for a whole industry to interchange, collaborate around, and monetize data. There is probably room for one or two &#x201c;mega ecosystem data exchanges&#x201d; in each industry. Once any one gains significant traction, it could become the &#x201c;go to&#x201d; place for that industry. If more than one viable exchange emerges in an industry, the respective hosts of these could decide to partner and &#x201c;cross-tunnel&#x201d; some (but maybe not all) assets between their exchanges to get critical mass.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0148">While it is possible that industry coalitions could host such exchanges via tunneling, it may be more likely that one or two large players in each industry will bootstrap ecosystem private data exchanges fast and broadly enough to become the defacto data exchange for their industry. This provides a significant incentive for companies that want to become major players in the data side of their industries to start as soon as they can to build their internal data exchanges and then open them up quickly to their suppliers, customers, and partners.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0149"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example data query and delivery service <b>1200</b> according to some embodiments of the invention. Data query and delivery service <b>1200</b> illustrates four ways a data provider may be able to share data. The first way is through a data exchange <b>900</b>. The data exchange <b>900</b> may be a public data exchange or a private data exchange. The data provider <b>1210</b> may list <b>1211</b> the data on the data exchange according to the methods and systems described herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>8</b></figref>. The data consumer <b>1220</b> may access the data in the listings by either accepting an invitation from the data provider as discussed herein or by requesting <b>1212</b> access to the listing as discussed herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. The second way data may be shared is by directly sharing the data at <b>1213</b>. This may be a point-to-point share as discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, or may be any other suitable type of share, accomplished using the secure data share methods discussed herein. Note that the data provider <b>1210</b> and the data consumer <b>1220</b> are both users of the cloud computing service <b>112</b>. If the data provider <b>1210</b> wishes to share data with a non-user <b>1230</b>, this is possible as a third way to share the data, with a reader account <b>1215</b><i>a </i>or with a reader/writer account <b>1215</b><i>b</i>. Here the non-user may need to have a reader account but may not need to be an actual user of the cloud computing service <b>112</b>. A reader account may allow the non-user <b>1230</b> to view the data but do nothing else to the data. Finally, a fourth way to share data is via a file drop to cloud storage <b>1214</b>. Here the data provider <b>1210</b> may make a copy of a data set <b>1216</b> and may allow for another non-user <b>1230</b> to have the data set <b>1216</b>. This way of sharing data may not allow the data provider <b>1210</b> to retain control of the data set. Thus, using the fourth way, the non-user <b>1230</b> may be able to view, manipulate, and re-share the data.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Global Data Sharing</heading><p id="p-0152" num="0150">As described above, the private data exchange is used within one data region of a cloud computing service or within a single cloud computing service. A customer may like to be able to have one or more listings across multiple regions of a cloud computing platform and/or across multiple cloud computing platforms. In order for a data provider to share data sets across multiple cloud computing platform regions and/or multiple cloud computing platforms, the data providers would need to set up accounts in different regions, login to each account to setup replication, and refresh using tasks. The data provider would need to share with the consumer in the target region as well as needing to replicate the entire database. This whole process adds significant overhead for a data provider. In addition, when a virtual private cloud (VPC) customer wants to consume shared data through the data exchange, this customer currently does not have a way to do this within their VPC account. A workaround, such as asking the customer to open a multi-tenant account and persisting the shared data there, puts a burden on the consumer. In one embodiment, a multi-tenant account is an account in a system that supports isolation of computing resources and data between different customers/clients and between different users within the same customer/client. Thus it is difficult. It would be useful to a data provider (and to a customer who consume this data) to achieve cross-region and cross-cloud data sharing.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0151">In one embodiment, for global data sharing, there are two types of data: standard and personalized. Standard data represent data that is the same for every consumer. For example, there is no dynamic filtering of rows based on the consumer's account. In contrast, personalized data represents data that is unique to each consumer (or a group of consumers). In one embodiment, personalized data can have a secure view to dynamically filter rows of the data based on the consumer's account, so each consumer sees their own slice of the data. In a further embodiment, for a data provider, this can mean they can create a view for some, or all their consumers instead of a view for each consumer.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0152">In one embodiment, a listing for shared data can include metadata associated with zero or more shares, or collection of database (DB) objects. In addition, the listing can be for free data or paid data. Furthermore, a data provider can grant access to a consumer for shared data depending on whether the shared data is standard, where the customers each get access to the same shared data, or whether the shared data is personalized, where data is shared on an individual or group basis. For personalized data, in one embodiment, a data provider adds each customer of the data to an entitlements table. Alternatively, a non-personalized data may still require some sort of approval process for the customer to access the data. For example and in one embodiment, in a private exchange, getting access to a share might need an approval workflow even though the data itself is not personalized. Thus, in one embodiment, for a standard data share, a data provider does not need to be in the request fulfillment loop. Any consumer account that discovers the listing can access the data and use this data to create a database from it. Alternatively, for data shared by request, a data provider will need to explicitly add the consumer to the share.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0153">In another embodiment, standard shares may exist in the context of the data exchange (whether, public or private) as the data exchange represents the membership base that it is made available to and how listings are discovered. In one embodiment, data shared by a data provider is also called a data share. In one embodiment, a consumer should not really care about the underlying share type (e.g., Standard or By Request). In addition, a consumer can always interact with the standard listing. In this embodiment, a data provider will have to be aware of shares to create them. However, the data exchange will handle the creation of these shares.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0154">In one embodiment, data shares outside of an exchange are, by definition, By Request shares. In addition, the data exchange can include unlisted or undiscoverable Standard Listings which do not have an entry in a data exchange. The effective membership base for this is any Snowflake customer. The listing, however, is not discoverable by consumers as the data provider would send around a listing URL. In this embodiment, anyone who views that URL and logs into the data exchange can view the data and, for example, create a DB from the share.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0155">In one embodiment, both Standard Listings and By Request listings could be free or paid. If the data share is free, a consumer can create a DB from the shared data, once the consumer accepts the provider terms. If data share is paid, the consumer can accept terms and arrange for payment. Then the consumer can create a DB from share. In one embodiment, for a standard listing, the data can be available in a region or not: If the data is not yet available in a region, consumer still clicks get and can create a DB from the share. At this point, the data exchange can let them know that the data will be available in a certain amount of time (e.g., could have visual countdown if it's in seconds or progress bar indication in the UI). In one embodiment, a personalized data share can be a type of By Request share or listing.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0156"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A</figref> is a block diagram of an example system <b>1300</b> of multiple cloud computing platform sharing data with a data exchange.

For example and in one embodiment, a data provider can provide non-personalized By Request data shares either in a data exchange or outside of the data exchange, where consumers can be in different deployments. In one embodiment, this is the basic building block that some of the other type can be built on. Another use case type is a data provider of a standard listing that used for many different consumers (e.g. weather data on a public or private exchange). A third use type case can be a data provider of personalized shares/listings. This use case type could be on the public data exchange, in a private data exchange, or outside the Exchange (just data sharing). Lastly, a use case type could be a consumer on VPC wanting access to a data share in a cloud computing platform. In one embodiment, an additional nuance is that a private data exchange adds that providers are added by the data exchange administrator. The data exchange administrator would ideally like to not have to train the providers in managing the complexities of setting up replication to share data from that provider to other private exchange members who may be on different regions/clouds.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0161">In one embodiment, a reservations data provider wants to share select tables and/or views whose data is stored on is the US-West region of a cloud computing platform and with a marketing data firm (whose main account is on the same cloud computing platform, but in a different region, say US-East). In this embodiment, the reservations data provider is a customer of marketing data provider. A primary goal is for marketing data provider to process and incorporate this info into a product of the marketing data provider. In one embodiment, costs should impact marketing data provider data exchange account, but not the account of the reservations data provider. In this embodiment, a secondary goal is for the marketing data provider to share certain views from the marketing data provider to reservations data provider. In this case, the reservations data provider is a customer of the marketing data provider, and so the marketing data provider does not want to make reservations data provider do the work. In addition, the marketing data provider have a view that references objects in another database, so both databases must be replicated. In one embodiment, the reservations data provider determines which tables and/or views to list in the data exchange. In response to the marketing data provider requesting the data share via the data exchange, the data exchange creates an account in the US-East region of the cloud computing provider and replicates the relevant data shares of the reservations data providers (e.g., the main data share indicated by the reservations data provider as well as the dependent data). Sharing data across cloud computing platforms and/or regions is described further in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> below.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0162">In a further embodiment, in a private exchange, a non-profit research institution wants listings that members have to request access to. In this embodiment, these requests trigger a workflow with cloud computing platform, and each consumer is added once the approval is done. This is a common scenario in private exchange, where the data is not personalized but the consumer needs to go through an approval workflow. Sharing data across cloud computing platforms and/or regions using an approval workflow is described further in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> below.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0163">In another embodiment, is that a data provider wishes to replicate a customized set of data shares for a consumer across different cloud computing platforms and/or regions. In this embodiment, the data provider wishes only to replicate certain tables of their database. A transportation analytics company its data in a cloud computing service, where each table contains data for a specific dataset. This company shares specific datasets with customers based on what datasets that customer is subscribed to. The transportation analytics company wants to model their data in cloud computing service independent of how shares will be created. Then, when the transportation analytics company creates shares for specific customers, they want only those tables to be replicated.

Paid standard shares present a new revenue stream with monetization. In one embodiment, an experience for the consumer to be able to get the free or paid listing as immediately as possible. Since the provider is not explicitly adding the consumer to the share, they are not in the user flow. In addition, a data provider has also said it would also be ideal to incur replication cost based on demand. For example and in one embodiment, a weather data provider has made available a free subset of their data as a free standard listings and wish to have a paid standard listing, where a customer can immediately pay and get the pre-defined package. Third, for more custom packages they want the consumer to contact them and they will set up a direct share with the consumer. The most likely scenario in this case is that free listing is made available in (almost) all regions. For the paid listing, data providers would want it to be available on any deployment as soon as there is at least one paying consumer in that deployment or if the cloud computing service covers replication cost. Note that while free vs paid shares could be set up as a filter on rows (secure view within one share) or set up as separate shares altogether, one scenario is that these are two separate shares. For example, a retail analytics provider would make a different share with a different set of objects available for free vs paid. Within the paid share, this data provider would have the ability for the consumer to select which rows they want, to create. dynamically created packages. For instance, a consumer will select through the data exchange user interface that they want only location data for &#x201c;Type=McDonald's&#x201d; and &#x201c;State=CA&#x201d;, and therefore pay only for the rows they get.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0165">In one embodiment, various scenarios can be handled using the data replication described above. For example and in one embodiment, a brand data provider is building its data-driven marketing solution on a cloud computing service. They will be a provider of both standard and personalized shares, on the public exchange. They have hundreds of TBs of data and can have hundreds of clients to share with, where most of whom will be new to the cloud computing service. Based on the data set a client has purchased on their platform, they automatically insert the clients ID into an entitlements table in the cloud computing service and add their consumer account to the share. They want this automatic sharing pipeline to work across regions &#x26; clouds with little or no manual effort. In addition, the brand data provider may also want to share data into a VPC.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0166">A customer relationship company builds mobile marketing campaigns and shares the results with customers via the data exchange. In one example, the campaign data arrives into their 50 TB event table at least every 15 minutes and consumer-specific data gets shared with consumers. In addition, this company wants a 15-minutes latency (or less) to their consumers.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0167">An equipment manufacturer wants to share machine health data with 200 dealers so they can take corrective actions. Data is not large in volume but is coming throughout the day and they want latency and/or freshness guarantees for their dealers. &#x201c;I expected remote data sharing to be a continuous data stream instead of a batch model.&#x201d; The company will set up secure views based on an entitlements table that maps dealers to equipment, so that each dealer only sees rows that are relevant for them.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0168">In another example, and embodiment, VPC customers want to consume shares from data providers who are in a multi-tenant deployment. In one embodiment, a VPC is an on-demand configurable pool of shared computing resources allocated within a public cloud environment, providing a level of isolation between the different organizations using the resources. For example, a financial company wants to consume marketing data from companies like marketing companies. However, when directly consuming data from these data sources, considerable effort is necessary to ingest the data, and manage and maintain the ingestion process, and change management of the underlying schemas. Solving problems, which usually are called &#x201c;first mile problem of data ingestion,&#x201d; can provide tremendous benefits. The financial company can have the data processed by a third party before ingesting the data from the exchange. In addition, the financial company has multiple business units (Bus), which have different needs and visibility requirements for shared data. For that reason, the financial company needs the ability to apply fine grained security controls when sharing the data provided by the third party company to its internal customers (BUs). Furthermore, any solution to be considered must be easy to use (no additional coding and/or engineering time), robust (no fragile ongoing or maintenance processes.) Handling a workflow of this type is further described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> below.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0169"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a process flow diagram of a method <b>1400</b> for sharing data across multiple cloud computing services and/or across multiple regions with a cloud computing service. In general, the method <b>1400</b> may be performed by processing logic that may include hardware (e.g., processing device, circuitry, dedicated logic, programmable logic, microcode, hardware of a device, integrated circuit, etc.), software (e.g., instructions run or executed on a processing device), or a combination thereof.

Creating a list is further described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> below. At block <b>1404</b>, processing logic receives request for listing of data sharing.

In a further embodiment, processing logic can customize the data based on the consumer (e.g., paid data represents one view as opposed to unpaid data, data shared is based on the region of the consumer, a consumer's affiliations, and/or other types of characteristics). Processing logic sets up tasks for frequency replication at block <b>1414</b>. In one embodiment, by setting up these tasks, the data that is shared with the different cloud computing platforms and/or cloud computing platform regions can be periodically refreshed, so that the data provider or consumer does not need to manually refresh the data.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0171">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, a consumer requests shared data across different cloud computing platforms and/or cloud computing platform regions.
