While there are currently a number of approaches to provide quality connectivity to devices, these approaches tend to require comprehensive coverage. Comprehensive coverage comes at a high cost since this requires the installation, hardware acquisition and potentially, licensing of restricted bands which could run into billions of dollars. Furthermore, even with costs aside, there is always the issue with high demand during peak hours only. This means, the network operator is forced to invest heavily into a network with high capacity which might not be used at full capacity for <b>24</b> hours. Furthermore, any out-of-home wireless network requires continuous expansion to cover dead-spots or new areas where users would be present. There is a continuous race to &#x2018;follow&#x2019; the users wherever they may be, but the installation cost and time cannot keep pace.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Based on the above discussion there is a need for new method and apparatus for increasing wireless coverage and/or capacity. It would be beneficial if these new method and apparatus did not require large capital investments in infrastructure or require additional licensing of restricted bands.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Methods and apparatus for supporting wireless networks, e.g., mesh networks, which are well suited for use in metropolitan areas are described. In various embodiments, vehicle based communications systems are used to support a mesh network. Thus as more vehicles come into proximity to one another the amount of hardware is effectively increased as the communications load in an area is also likely to increase due to the presence of more vehicles and/or individuals in the area. In various embodiments a communications device, e.g., vehicle's WiFi communications system, scans for access points in an area and selects between the available access points based on , e.g., speed and direction of the vehicle in which the communications device is located and, when available, information about the speed, direction and/or route of the access point to which the communications device is considering attaching. Access points are prioritized based on the QoS they can support and/or the amount of time that they are likely to be in communications range. The communications device then connects to one or more access points. Traffic load can be split between multiple access points with changes in load between access points as QoS of the connection to an access point changes and/or a connection is lost with an access point. Bi-directional communications is supported with the one or more access points to which attachments are made. While explained in the context of an exemplary WiFi based system other wireless communications technologies including, e.g., Bluetooth and/or other wireless technologies could be used to implement the devices, e.g., APs, and mesh network.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In at least some cases when the communications device is stationary, stationary access points are prioritized over moving access points since the stationary access point is expected to stay within communication range as long at the communications device remains stationary. However, in cases where both the communications device and potential access points to which it might attach are moving, a moving access point moving in the same general speed and direction as the communications device is likely to be, and often will be, prioritized over a stationary access point, since it is likely to remain in range as the devices move in the same direction for a period of time, while the stationary access point will move out of range over time due to the communications device's movement. The angle of direction of the communications device and access point are often taken into consideration when prioritizing access points. Direction of travel information and/or upcoming turns are communicated via message sent between devices in some cases. This allows a client device to establish a new connection and/or perform a new load balancing operation before a connection is lost due to an upcoming turn to can in direction of an access point.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A device which is selected as an access point may have a wireless connection to another device in the network, e.g., vehicle communications system and/or a connection to a cellular network.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The methods and apparatus are generally described in the context of one communications device acting as a client (also sometimes referred to as a slave) making decisions as to which access points (sometimes referred to as masters) it will connect to and use over time; it should be appreciated that since each communications device acts in some embodiments as a node in a mesh network, the same device can, and often does. appear as an available access point to other devices in the network.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">By using vehicle communications systems, e.g., WiFi systems of cars and/or other devices, to support a mesh network, overall connectivity to other devices can be enhanced as compared to systems which attempt to rely on fixed access points to support communications at little additional cost since many modern cars and many other vehicles come equipped with WiFi and/or cellular communications' devices. By using the mesh network implemented in accordance with the invention connectivity to fixed and/or cellular networks can be supported but potentially without all the traffic having to be communicated over such networks for the full communications path between communicating devices and, in some cases, without the communications having to traverse a cellular network at all.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">An exemplary method of operating a first communications device, in accordance with some embodiments, comprises: scanning, at the first communications device, for wireless networks; identifying at the first communications device, one or more available access points based on wireless network identifiers received during said scanning, said identified access points including a first access point; and prioritizing, at the first communications device, individual identified access points, said step prioritizing individual access points including prioritizing the first access point based on signal strength of a signal received from the first access point and one or more of: i) whether the first access point is a fixed or mobile wireless access point or ii) first access point motion information.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">While various features discussed in the summary are used in some embodiments it should be appreciated that not all features are required or necessary for all embodiments and the mention of features in the summary should in no way be interpreted as implying that the feature is necessary or critical for all embodiments.

A prioritization subroutine (flowchart <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), called in step <b>210</b>, is used as a subroutine for determining (based upon the results from the subroutine) and the evaluation of step <b>212</b>, if a new network scan (step <b>206</b>) should be initiated. A network scan (step <b>206</b>) is also initiated when there is an actual loss of a connection (step <b>256</b> yes) or a determination that a connection loss is likely to occur in the near future (step <b>258</b> yes) (See step <b>260</b> and connecting node D <b>264</b> which leads to step <b>206</b>). Without loss of connection, the flow still includes a loop through the QoS check (step <b>220</b>) followed by load balancing in step <b>226</b>. Since a connection loss or an impending connection loss will trigger a new scan and connection establishment process, followed by QoS checks and load balancing after each time new connections are made, the processes allows for new connections to be established in many cases prior to loss of a connection or all connections in use at a given time since path divergence triggering a decision that a loss of connection is likely thus allowing for a scan and new connection establishment process to proceed before actual loss of one or more connections.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The step (<b>258</b>) of deciding whether a connection loss is likely is implemented using a call to a subroutine (flowchart <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) in some embodiments which returns an indication of whether a connection loss is likely in the near future or not.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Prioritization of a set of connections is based on the information available during each pass through the prioritization step (<b>210</b>). In at least some embodiments the prioritization step is implemented by a call to a prioritization subroutine (flowchart <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). During the first pass through the prioritization subroutine only signal strength information is available allow with information on which APs signals were received from. Stored information may be, and sometimes is, accessed to determine if the AP is a known stationary AP or a mobile AP. The device may, and sometimes does, include a list of known stationary APs and if a detected AP is not on the listed it is assumed to be a mobile AP.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">While the communications device may be, and often is, a car or other mobile device, in some cases it may be parked for an extended period of time.

In such a case, when the communications device is considered stationary, stationary APs with acceptable received signal levels, e.g., above the minimum threshold, will be given higher priority than mobile APs and will be prioritized based on the detected received signal strength of the signals received from the stationary APs. Mobile APs will then be prioritized, e.g., based on signal strength and/or how quickly they are moving away from the communications device.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">If the communications device is not stationary, e.g., has been moving or has temporarily stopped motion for a brief period of time, e.g., due to braking, the communications device is considered to be a mobile device in which case, the most recent motion vector available for the communications device is determined (step <b>316</b>), e.g., if the device is still moving the current velocity vector is determined; however, if the device has briefly paused motion, e.g. due to braking, the device's most recent direction (heading) and speed prior to the brief stop in motion are used as the velocity vector. This information is used (in step <b>330</b>) in prioritizing APs for which similar information (AP velocity vectors of step <b>329</b>) is available.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">It should be appreciated that during an initial connection establishment process, at the time of prioritization velocity and/or path information for APs may not be available since the initial AP prioritization and connections may and normally will preceded the receipt of such information from APs in one or more messages. Accordingly, during the initial pass through the prioritization loop APs may be prioritized based on whether they are stationary and/or on the strength of signals received from the APs.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">However, once velocity and/or path information is available the velocity (motion) vectors of the communications device and APs can be compared (step <b>330</b>) and the APs are prioritized based on both the received signal strength and how long the APs are likely to remain in communications range of the communications device.

A comprehensive look at a MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) would include a vast number of connected devices with various bandwidths and uptime requirements. This could range from a user connected to a fixed Hotspot (WI-FI) or a moving car with a wireless gateway which uses Wi-Fi or cellular to connect to an endpoint. In the latter example, the car (or similar vehicle such as a bus, train, tram, etc.) would have an internal Hotspot device for its occupants. Furthermore, a MAN with mesh capabilities is likely to be the most practical system fro enabling Smart Cities and ensuring fast and dynamic coverage for all nodes.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The two examples (Stationary Hotspots and Mobile Hotspots) have a number of efficiency issues. With a stationary Hotspot, e.g., a Hotspot inside a coffee shop, house, etc., the connectivity is relatively reliable as the modem is usually connected to fixed line (coax cable, phone, fiber, etc.). However, the connectivity is very localized; that is it cannot be used beyond a limited space. The same would be true if the Hotspot device is attached to a pole outdoors. There are obvious limitations, having to do with line-of-sight and distance. If a network operator has already invested in providing wireless capabilities to fixed locations, there are long periods when the network is not being used, e.g. when the user is not at home, when a business location is closed, etc.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">With mobile Hotspots for connected vehicles, the most common option for external connectivity is the cellular option. This, of course, is not always a viable option with limited bandwidth and dead spots. For vehicle-to-vehicle mesh-network connectivity, which would act as a bridge from unlicensed to licensed band (WIFI then Cellular), the challenge is that the vehicles are in constant motion. This is especially true when the speed of vehicles is considered; this means a connection could be terminated very quickly without enough time to re-connect or locate to an alternative network route. Furthermore, vehicles going in different directions would not be well suited for a reliable connection. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a drawing illustrating two vehicles (vehicle <b>1</b> <b>1102</b> and vehicle <b>2</b> <b>1104</b>) with wireless communications capabilities, e.g. WiFi and cellular wireless communications capabilities. Vehicle <b>1</b> <b>1102</b> is going in a first direction indicated by arrow <b>1106</b>, while vehicle <b>2</b> <b>1104</b> is going in a second direction indicated by arrow <b>1108</b>. The first direction is <b>180</b> degrees different than the second direction and thus vehicles (<b>1102</b>, <b>1104</b>) are not well suited for maintaining a reliable connection.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Various exemplary embodiments, implemented with features of the present invention, tie components of a decentralized network within a metropolitan area network (MAN) together, e.g. through a Software Defined Network (SDN). The exemplary components include fixed nodes (in homes, hotspots with extended range, stationary vehicles, etc.) as well as mobile nodes in vehicles (cars, buses, trains, etc.). The main role of the mesh network is to provide fluidity to connected nodes. As bandwidth requirements increase, the mobile nodes handle the extra load without necessarily relying on cellular towers. For instance, during rush hour, connected vehicles would require more bandwidth which poses a challenge. To remedy this, the vehicles (mobile nodes) connect to nearby vehicles in a series of hops that ultimately end up in a connected end-point. In addition, each of the connected vehicles through which a connection is made are more likely to remain within proximity.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary communications system <b>900</b> supporting an exemplary mesh network in accordance with an exemplary embodiment.

Operation starts in step <b>1002</b> in which the mobile node is powered on and initialized. Operation proceeds from start step <b>1002</b> to step <b>1104</b> in which the mobile node obtains an IP. In some embodiments the IP is pre-assigned and loaded into the mobile node, e.g. into the gateway of the mobile node.

Operation proceeds from step <b>1004</b> to step <b>1006</b>.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In step <b>1006</b> the mobile node scans for neighbors. For example, from within the mobile node, a component, e.g., a gateway, initiates a WiFi scan for any wireless network with shared authentication mechanism, e.g. WiFi profile, etc. The mobile node may detect one or more networks as a result of the scan.

Each Access Point (AP) is identified by its unique ESSID (MAC address). One or more APs may have been detected during the scanning. The mobile node, e.g. via its gateway, then joins, e.g., connects to, a best-performing network based on signal strength and other parameters, assuming at least one detected AP satisfied a minimum level of requirement, e.g., a minimum acceptable signal strength. In some embodiments, the mobile node may, and sometimes does, join, e.g., connect to more than one detected AP.

Each node which makes a connection, that is deemed suitable based on QoS rules, to another node is considered a &#x2018;Slave Node&#x2019;. The node which accepts the connection is considered a &#x2018;Master Node&#x2019;. The two nodes form a Layer II (On the OSI Model) network. This connection does not include any other network or nodes on that specific layer. The role of the Master Node is to relay Ethernet frames from the Slave Node. The Master Node might use other networks to forward the data. The next node might be another node (mobile or static). The connection between master-slave is duplex in nature; that is, a master node might send an &#x2018;out-of-band&#x2019; message to the slave node for urgent commands such as imminent disconnect information.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">Out of Band Messages in the context of a mesh network in accordance with an exemplary embodiment will now be described. While a node might be used primarily to relay data frames so their ultimate destination, other types of communication is possible. This might include information which would be helpful to any node in order to: react to an imminent degradation of service, disconnect or change of direction of the node (example: vehicle making right-turn). Each of the out-of-band messages are expected to be short and should be processed in timely manner. This is important for the MAN as a whole in order to ensure quick and adaptive responses to ensure high-availability for each of the connected clients.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">Predictive Directional Nodes will now be described in the context of an exemplary mesh network in accordance with an exemplary embodiment. In a mobile node (such as a vehicle, bus, train, etc.) the direction of any two nodes is important. It is important between master-slave nodes to have directional vectors within a set maximum (example: 30 degrees). Any increase in the angle would indicate one of the nodes is moving away and the connection is likely to be degraded or disconnected. Geospatial data (obtained from a GPS system) can be, and sometimes is, used to &#x2018;predict&#x2019; where the moving node would be located. For instance, it would be possible to determine if the node would be making a turn or merely changing lanes. This system can be further enhanced by connecting it to the steering wheel and tie its turns to the intended direction.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a drawing <b>1300</b> illustrating two exemplary moving vehicles (<b>1302</b>, <b>1304</b>, each supporting Wi-Fi and cellular communications and further supporting mesh networks in accordance with an exemplary embodiment. Vehicle <b>1302</b> is a client node with respect to vehicle <b>1304</b> which is a WiFi AP node. Initially both vehicles (<b>1302</b>, <b>1304</b>) are traveling in the same direction along road <b>1301</b>. The edge of road <b>1301</b> is shown as solid line <b>1303</b>. AP vehicle <b>1304</b> has to steer around stopped vehicle <b>1306</b> and it turns to the right as indicated by its velocity vector <b>1305</b> deviating by angle <b>1307</b> from the initial direction, which is the direction of vector <b>1303</b> (client velocity vector). In some embodiments, a sensor which detects the position of the steering wheel in vehicle <b>1304</b> is used to detect the turn, e.g. in addition to vehicle <b>1304</b> GPS and/or IMU information. The detected steering wheel motion can be, and sometimes is, used by vehicle <b>1304</b> (AP node) to distinguish between lane change and a turn, e.g., off the road to another road.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">Load balancing aspects will now be described. Once a node starts a discovery process, it scans all available nodes (mobile and static). A selection is made based on a number of factors which include one or more or all of: i) signal strength, ii) moving direction vector, iii) ping response time, iv) type of target node (mobile vs. stationary, cellular vs. hotspot), and v) cost of cellular connection (if more than one provider is detected). Once the data is collected, the best candidates are selected. Based on QoS and preset of weights, a rating is calculated which should add up to 100% (ex: A: 30%, B: 50% &#x26; C: 20%). The percentages will dictate the number of frames which would be sent to each network. For example, if there are 100 frames, then 30 would be sent through A, 50 would be sent through B and 20 would be sent through C. The frames could be sent through a parallel process or round robin.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">Security aspects will now be described. The described system can be classified as H-SDN (Hidden Software Defined Network). As the network is topology is defined purely through software and logic, it would fall under the SDN categorization. Considering any node is directly connected to, at most two other nodes (master and slave), the node cannot know about any other nodes which are part of any connection. This adds a layer of security and privacy, even if the network within a single node is compromised. For additional security, an encryption layer can be added for all data traversing the network using any modern standard.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">Decentralization and redundancy aspects will now be described. An exemplary network, in accordance with various embodiments, is decentralized. It is made up of two-node segments. While the data might be relayed from a node to the end-point through 10 nodes, for example, the nodes do not have visibility to the other used in the data transmission. This allows the network to be resilient with no single point of failure. Furthermore, any node, even when actively relaying data, could fail at any moment; the rest of the nodes (primarily the ones set up as &#x2018;slave&#x2019; to the failing node), will redirect the data (frame) either through other routes or simply attempt to find an alternative master node. The predictive aspect of the logic, allows all nodes to preemptively adjust their routes even before a target node is out-of-range, at risk of disconnect, etc.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Numbered List of Exemplary Method Embodiments</heading><p id="p-0155" num="0154">Method Embodiment 1 A method of operating a first communications device, the method comprising: scanning (<b>206</b>), at the first communications device, (e.g., checking received signals for network identifiers such as ESSIDs transmitted by wireless access points) for wireless networks;
