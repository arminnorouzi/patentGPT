Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Blades of turbo machines such as gas turbines comprise an airfoil section or body exposed to a working fluid and a root body forming a mechanical interface for coupling the blade to a rotor disk. Because the blades of turbo machines have to be able to withstand high temperatures, the blades include inner voids or cavities for circulating cooling fluid therein. In a related art, the blades are manufactured in a casting process in which a core is provided to form the inner cavity and over molded with liquid metal. Typically, the inner void is opened in the root body after the casting process to remove the core and to receive the cooling fluid.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, GB 2411442 A discloses a turbine blade having a firtree shaped root body, wherein multiple radial cooling channels are formed in the root body. A similar turbine blade is disclosed in EP 3059394 A1.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The root body, as the mechanical interface to the disk, carries high mechanical loads.
