Such windshields allow the driver to position the windshield to provide normal windshield protection, or to position the windshield so that the area immediately in front of the driver is substantially free of a blocking windshield. Typically, this is accomplished by flipping the windshield from a lowered position to a raised position.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Prior art flip windshields have disadvantages when used with vehicles equipped with a roof, and may not provide full protection even when the windshield is closed. The present invention addresses those needs, and may provide distinctive, source-identifying design elements in the product as well.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one preferred aspect of the present invention there is provided a removable windshield assembly for attachment to the cage of a vehicle.

It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended, such alterations and further modifications in the described device, and such further applications of the principles of the invention as illustrated therein, being contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As indicated above, one aspect of the present invention relates to a removable windshield assembly for attachment to the cage of a vehicle. As is known to the art, a vehicle cage typically comprises a pair of lateral support members, one on each side of a passenger compartment, and a horizontal cross member spanning the distance between the two vertical support members. While not always considered to be part of the cage, the structure may optionally include a vehicle roof member.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one embodiment the inventive windshield assembly comprises:</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">a) an upper portion adapted to abut the roof of the vehicle in a manner effective to prevent a noticeable gap between the roof and the windshield and substantially spanning the uppermost portion of the area between the left vertical member and the right vertical member;</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">b) a lower portion adapted to abut the hood of the vehicle in a manner effective to prevent a noticeable gap between the hood and the windshield and substantially spanning a lowermost portion of the area between the left vertical member and the right vertical member; and</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">c) a main viewing portion hingedly attached to the upper portion in a manner effective to allow the main viewing portion to be moved from a closed position to an open position, and substantially spanning the space between the upper portion and the lower portion between the left vertical member and the right vertical member;</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">wherein when the main viewing portion is in its closed position the main viewing portion substantially spans the space between the upper portion, the lower portion, the left vertical member, and the right vertical member;</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">and when the main viewing portion is in its open position the space between the upper portion, the lower portion, the left vertical member, and the right vertical member is substantially free of windshield protection.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In another embodiment the inventive windshield assembly comprises a multiple-piece windshield assembly of at least three parts, configured to mount to a vehicle having a left vertical member and a right vertical member and at least one cross support member connecting the left vertical member and a right vertical member. Such an assembly may comprise:</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">a) a lower fixed windshield portion adapted to abut the hood of the vehicle in a manner effective to prevent a noticeable gap between the hood and the windshield, and spanning the lower portion of the area between the left vertical member and the right vertical member;</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">b) an upper fixed windshield portion adapted to abut the roof of the vehicle in a manner effective to prevent a noticeable gap between the roof and the windshield and spanning the upper portion of the area between the left vertical member and the right vertical member;</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">c) a central, movable windshield portion hingedly connected to the upper fixed windshield portion and adapted to substantially span the area between the upper fixed windshield portion and the lower fixed windshield portion when positioned in a closed position; wherein the central, movable windshield portion is movable to a partially-open position in which a gap of less than about 6&#x2033; is provided between the central, movable windshield portion and the lower fixed windshield portion, and is further movable to a fully-open position in which a gap of more than about 24&#x2033; is provided between the central, movable windshield portion and the lower fixed windshield portion.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments the upper fixed windshield portion is attached to the cross support member; and the lower fixed windshield portion and the central, movable windshield portion are each attached to the left vertical member and to the right vertical member. With this construction, the upper piece abuts the roof to prevent a noticeable gap between the windshield and the roof regardless of whether the windshield is open or closed. The lower piece spans the lowermost portion of the windshield area. The middle piece is the main viewing portion, and is hingedly attached to the upper piece to allow the main viewing portion to be moved from a closed position to one or more open positions. Using an upper piece that abuts the roof to prevent substantial airflow into the cabin at the roof line, and connecting that upper piece to the main windshield piece with a hinged connection that prevents substantial airflow into the cabin between the upper and middle windshield pieces, serves to prevent wind and rain from flowing into the cabin area between the roof and the main windshield section regardless of whether the windshield is open or closed.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Accordingly, when the middle piece is in its closed position, it substantially spans the space between the upper piece and the lower piece. When the middle piece is in a fully open position, the space between the upper windshield piece and the lower windshield piece is substantially free of windshield protection. When the middle piece is in a partially open position, it is flipped partially upward so that air may flow relatively freely unto the cabin area under the middle piece, but the vehicle occupants are still substantially protected from harsh wind and rain.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The assembly may additionally comprise one or more struts for holding the central, movable windshield portion in its fully-open position.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The assembly may also additionally comprise a handle for assisting with moving the central, movable windshield portion from its closed position to its partially- or fully-open positions.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The assembly may also additionally comprise a latch for securing the central, movable windshield portion in its closed position. The latch may additionally be effective for securing the central, movable windshield portion in its partially-open position. The handle and the latch may be provided as a combined assembly.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The inventive flip windshield assembly is preferably adapted to clear the vehicle roof so that opening and closing the flip windshield is not inhibited.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The inventive flip windshield assembly is preferably adapted to substantially seal the space across the top of the windshield, thus preventing fluids such as rain and air from flowing over the top of the windshield and beneath the vehicle roof.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows one embodiment of the three-piece flip windshield of the present invention.
