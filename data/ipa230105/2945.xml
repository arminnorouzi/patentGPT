The processing data includes coordinate data for relatively moving the head <b>5</b> with respect to the workpiece W. The coordinate data is set inside the processing region R and is represented by a processing coordinate system including X coordinates in the X direction and Y coordinates in the Y direction. The X direction is a lengthwise direction of the processing device <b>3</b>. The Y direction is orthogonal to the X direction. The processing data executed by the processing device <b>3</b> in which the cutting blade <b>7</b> is attached to the head <b>5</b> is also referred to as cutting data. The processing data executed by the processing device <b>3</b> in which the drawing pen <b>8</b> is attached to the head <b>5</b> is also referred to as drawing data. In other words, the processing data of the present embodiment is data collectively referring to the cutting data and the drawing data.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The processing data generation processing performed by the sewing machine <b>1</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, using a specific example in which the processing data is generated for a T-shaped pattern <b>62</b> input by the user. The processing data is data for causing the processing device <b>3</b> to perform the processing with respect to the sheet-shaped workpiece W. The processing data of the present embodiment includes the cutting data for cutting the workpiece W using the cutting blade <b>7</b>, and the drawing data for drawing on the workpiece W using the drawing pen <b>8</b>. The processing data is used for cutting sewing object pieces when creating a patchwork representing a pattern specified by the user. The processing data generation processing is activated when the user operates the touch screen <b>26</b> and inputs a command to start the processing data generation processing. When the controller <b>2</b> detects the command to start the processing data generation processing, the controller <b>2</b> reads out, to the RAM <b>83</b>, a program for executing the processing data generation processing stored in the program storage area of the ROM <b>82</b>. The controller <b>2</b> performs the following steps in accordance with instructions included in the program read out to the RAM <b>83</b>.

With the sewing machine <b>1</b> of the present embodiment, the single presser foot <b>22</b> selected from among a plurality of types of presser foot can be detachably mounted to the lower end of the presser bar <b>21</b>. The controller <b>2</b> may identify the type of the presser foot <b>22</b> on the basis of information input by the user, or, when the sewing machine <b>1</b> is provided with a detector for detecting the type of the presser foot <b>22</b>, the sewing machine <b>1</b> may identify the type of the presser foot <b>22</b> on the basis of a detection result of the detector. For example, the detector may be an imaging device that can capture an image of the lower end of the presser bar <b>21</b> and generate image data. In this case, the controller <b>2</b> may analyze the image data generated by the imaging device, and identify the type of the presser foot <b>22</b> mounted to the lower end of the presser bar <b>21</b>. The detector may be a reader that reads an RFID tag attached to the presser foot <b>22</b> and representing the type of the presser foot <b>22</b>.

The flash memory <b>84</b> stores the types of the presser foot <b>22</b> in correspondence with the predetermined distances D. The predetermined distance D indicates a seam allowance of the sewing object pieces configuring the patchwork. For example, the predetermined distance D is a distance, in the left-right direction, between a needle drop position P (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>) when the needle bar <b>6</b> is disposed at a left baseline position, which is a left end position of an oscillation range of the needle bar <b>6</b>, and the right end of the presser foot <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The controller <b>2</b> sets a shape (step S<b>3</b>). In main processing of the present embodiment, the pattern specified by the user is disposed inside the shape. The shape is represented as a loop using a single line. The graphic may be a geometrical shaped pattern, such as a circular shape, an elliptical shape, a polygonal shape, a star shape, a trapezoid, and the like. A configuration may be adopted in which the user can set the shape, size, and the like of the shape, or a configuration may be adopted in which the shape, size, and the like of the shape are set in advance. The controller <b>2</b> of the present embodiment sets a rectangular shape <b>61</b>, and, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, displays a screen <b>60</b> on the LCD <b>25</b>. The screen <b>60</b> includes the shape <b>61</b>, an OK key <b>63</b>, and a check box <b>68</b>. The OK key <b>63</b> is selected when confirming the pattern that is the target of generating the processing data, and the arrangement of the pattern inside the shape <b>61</b>. The check box <b>68</b> is used to input an instruction as to whether or not to divide a margin pattern. A margin pattern <b>67</b> is a pattern representing a portion between the pattern and the shape <b>61</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, in the specific example, the user operates the touch screen <b>26</b>, arranges the pattern <b>62</b>, which is the target of generating the processing data, inside the shape <b>61</b> displayed on the screen <b>60</b>, and, after making a setting in the check box <b>68</b>, selects the OK key <b>63</b>. An arrangement method of the pattern <b>62</b> may be set as appropriate, and, for example, the shape of the pattern <b>62</b> may be specified by operating the touch screen <b>26</b>, or the pattern <b>62</b> whose shape has been specified may be arranged. The pattern <b>62</b> may be selected from among the patterns stored in the flash memory <b>84</b>, and may be arranged at a predetermined position with respect to the shape <b>61</b> (for example, a position at which the center of the shape <b>61</b> and a center of the pattern <b>62</b> are aligned). The pattern <b>62</b> may be acquired from the external device connected via the USB connector <b>28</b> and arranged inside the shape <b>61</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The controller <b>2</b> determines whether the selection of the OK key <b>63</b> has been detected (step S<b>4</b>). The controller <b>2</b> stands by until the selection of the OK key <b>63</b> is detected (no at step S<b>4</b>). When the selection of the OK key <b>63</b> is detected (yes at step S<b>4</b>), the controller <b>2</b> acquires the pattern <b>62</b> disposed inside the graphic <b>61</b> (step S<b>5</b>). The pattern <b>62</b> is the T-shaped pattern represented by a contour. The controller <b>2</b> divides the pattern <b>62</b> acquired at step S<b>5</b> into a plurality of pattern pieces (step S<b>6</b>). As the method for dividing the pattern acquired at step S<b>5</b> into the plurality of pattern pieces, a known technique may be adopted as appropriate. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, the controller <b>2</b> of the present embodiment divides the pattern <b>62</b> into two square-shaped pattern pieces <b>73</b> and <b>75</b>, by adding a partition line segment <b>64</b> that joins two points on the contour representing the pattern <b>62</b> acquired at step S<b>5</b>. The position of the partition line segment <b>64</b> may be set by the user, or may be set by the controller <b>2</b> in accordance with a number and the like of the pattern pieces that can be obtained as a result of the division. In addition to the square shape, the shape of each of the pattern pieces may be changed as appropriate, such as a triangular shape or the like.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The controller <b>2</b> determines, on the basis of the setting in the check box <b>68</b> when the selection of the OK key <b>63</b> is detected, whether to divide the margin pattern <b>67</b> (step S<b>7</b>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, since a check mark is entered into the check box <b>68</b> in the present embodiment, the controller <b>2</b> determines to divide the margin pattern <b>67</b> (yes at step S<b>7</b>), and divides the margin pattern <b>67</b> into a plurality of pattern pieces (step S<b>8</b>). Processing at step S<b>8</b> may be performed in a similar manner to the processing at step S<b>6</b>, or step S<b>6</b> and step S<b>8</b> may be performed using mutually different methods. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, for example, the controller <b>2</b> divides the margin pattern <b>67</b> into six pattern pieces <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>, <b>73</b>, <b>74</b>, and <b>76</b> to <b>78</b>, and, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>, displays on the LCD <b>25</b> a screen <b>69</b> representing the pattern pieces <b>71</b> to <b>78</b> divided by the processing at step S<b>6</b> and step S<b>8</b>. The screen <b>69</b> includes a designation field <b>58</b>, and a key <b>59</b>. The designation field <b>58</b> is selected when inputting attribute information for each of the pattern pieces <b>71</b> to <b>78</b>. The attribute information is information that is used to categorize the plurality of pattern pieces into a plurality of groups. The attribute information is, for example, information indicating a type (a color, a pattern, a material, and the like) of the sewing object representing the pattern piece. The attribute information of the present embodiment is the color of the sewing object piece configuring the patchwork. The key <b>59</b> is selected when inputting an instruction to allocate the attribute information displayed in the designation field <b>58</b>. A method of allocating the attribute information may be set as appropriate, and the attribute information may be allocated by the user for each of the pattern pieces, or may be automatically allocated by the controller <b>2</b>. In the present embodiment, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>, in the designation field <b>58</b>, the attribute information is allocated to each of the pattern pieces <b>71</b> to <b>78</b>. In the designation field <b>58</b>, a first color is allocated to the six pattern pieces <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, and <b>76</b> to <b>78</b>, a second color different from the first color is allocated to the pattern piece <b>73</b>, and a third color different from the first color and the second color is allocated to the pattern piece <b>75</b>. The user operates the touch screen <b>26</b> and, after verifying a setting state of the attribute information in the designation field <b>58</b>, selects the key <b>59</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">When the margin pattern <b>67</b> is not to be divided (no at step S<b>7</b>), or after the processing at step S<b>8</b>, when the selection of the key <b>59</b> is detected, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, the controller <b>2</b> allocates the attribute information to each of the pattern pieces <b>71</b> to <b>78</b>, in accordance with a setting status of the attribute information in the designation field <b>58</b> (step S<b>9</b>). The controller <b>2</b> allocates identification information to each of the plurality of pattern pieces (step S<b>10</b>). A method of allocating the identification information may be set as appropriate, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref>, for example, the controller <b>2</b> allocates identification informationW<b>1</b> to W<b>8</b> to each of the pattern pieces <b>71</b> to <b>78</b>. Apart from the character, the identification information allocated at step S<b>10</b> may be a symbol, a shape, or the like. The controller <b>2</b> acquires, from among the plurality of pattern pieces <b>71</b> to <b>78</b>, a set of adjacent pattern pieces that has not yet been acquired at step S<b>11</b> (step S<b>11</b>). All of the pattern pieces <b>71</b> to <b>78</b> of the present embodiment are square shaped. For each of two of the adjacent pattern pieces, of the contour of one of the pattern pieces, the controller <b>2</b> identifies an adjacent portion adjacent to the other pattern piece, that is, identifies line segments on edges, of the two pattern pieces, which are mutually adjacent. When the adjacent portion of the one pattern piece is the same length as the adjacent portion of the other pattern piece, the controller <b>2</b> acquires the two adjacent pattern pieces as the set of adjacent pattern pieces. When the patchwork is to be created using the sewing object pieces corresponding to the pattern pieces, portions corresponding to the adjacent portions of the set of adjacent pattern pieces are portions at which a set of adjacent sewing object pieces are sewn together. For example, of the pattern pieces <b>71</b> to <b>78</b>, the controller <b>2</b> acquires, as the set of adjacent pattern pieces, the pattern piece <b>74</b> and the pattern piece <b>75</b> that is to the right of the pattern piece <b>74</b> and is adjacent to the pattern piece <b>74</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The controller <b>2</b> refers to the pattern storage area <b>87</b>, and sets a common pattern with respect to the set of adjacent pattern pieces acquired at step S<b>11</b> (step S<b>12</b>). When the patchwork is to be created using the sewing object pieces corresponding to the pattern pieces, in order to make it easy to identify the set of sewing object pieces that are to be sewn together, from the plurality of sewing object pieces, the controller <b>2</b> generates the processing data for processing the adjacent portions of the common pattern or the seam allowance set for the adjacent portions. The controller <b>2</b> of the present embodiment can set, as the common pattern, at least one selected from the group of a cutting pattern and a drawing pattern. As shown in the pattern storage area <b>87</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the cutting pattern is represented by a notch shape formed in the seam allowance set for the adjacent portion. The drawing pattern is represented by a line type of a line that draws the adjacent portion. The drawing pattern may be represented by a color of the line that draws the adjacent portion, a number of the lines that draw the adjacent portions, and the like. The controller <b>2</b> of the present embodiment sets the cutting pattern of the rectangular shaped notch as the common pattern for the pattern pieces <b>74</b> and <b>75</b>, for example (step S<b>12</b>).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The controller <b>2</b> sets offset lines for the adjacent portions of the set of adjacent pattern pieces acquired at step S<b>11</b> (step S<b>13</b>). The offset line is a line disposed at a position separated by the predetermined distance D from the adjacent portion of the set of adjacent pattern pieces, on the outside, with respect to the contour of a first piece. The first piece is one of set of adjacent pattern pieces. The adjacent portion is adjacent to a second piece. The second piece is another of set of adjacent pattern pieces. The outside is opposite to a side of a region surrounded by the contour of the first piece. A region between the offset line and the adjacent portion indicates the seam allowance of the sewing object piece corresponding to the pattern piece. The predetermined distance D is the distance set at step S<b>2</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>E</figref>, the controller <b>2</b> of the present embodiment, uses the cutting pattern of the rectangular notch set at step S<b>12</b>, sets an offset line Q<b>1</b> disposed at a position separated to the right by the predetermined distance D from the right edge of the pattern piece <b>74</b>, and sets an offset line Q<b>2</b> disposed at a position separated to the left by the predetermined distance D from the left edge of the pattern piece <b>75</b>. The cutting pattern of the rectangular notch shape set at step S<b>12</b> is, for example, disposed in the vicinity of the center of the offset line, taking into account the arrangement of the offset lines with respect to the adjacent portions. The positions of the notches with respect to the offset lines are adjusted such that, when the offset line Q<b>2</b> and the contour of the pattern piece <b>75</b> are inverted with respect to an extending direction of the offset line Q<b>2</b>, while maintaining the arrangement between the offset line Q<b>2</b> and the contour of the pattern piece <b>75</b>, the notches of the offset line Q<b>1</b> and the offset line Q<b>2</b> are perfectly overlapped, and the adjacent portion of the pattern piece <b>74</b> and the adjacent portion of the pattern piece <b>75</b> overlap perfectly with each other. In this way, the controller <b>2</b> sets the offset line Q<b>1</b> corresponding to the pattern piece <b>74</b> by processing the pattern piece <b>74</b> as the first piece and the pattern piece <b>75</b> as the second piece. The controller <b>2</b> sets the offset line Q<b>2</b> corresponding to the pattern piece <b>75</b> by processing the pattern piece <b>75</b> as the first piece and the pattern piece <b>74</b> as the second piece.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Of the plurality of pattern pieces <b>71</b> to <b>78</b>, the controller <b>2</b> determines whether all the sets of adjacent pattern pieces have been acquired at step S<b>11</b> (S<b>14</b>). When the sets of adjacent pattern pieces acquired at step S<b>11</b> are not all of the sets of adjacent pattern pieces (no at step S<b>14</b>), the controller <b>2</b> returns the processing to step S<b>11</b>. At step S<b>11</b>, when the adjacent portion of the one pattern piece and the adjacent portion of the other pattern piece are not the same length as each other, for each of the two adjacent pattern pieces, the controller <b>2</b> identifies all of the pattern pieces adjacent to the edge that includes the adjacent portion of the pattern piece for which the adjacent portion is longer, and acquires the pattern piece having the longer adjacent portion and all of the pattern pieces adjacent to the edge including that adjacent portion, as the set of adjacent pattern pieces. For example, for the pattern piece <b>73</b>, the lower edge of the pattern piece <b>73</b> is in contact with the upper edge of the pattern piece <b>74</b>, but the lower edge of the pattern piece <b>73</b> is longer than the upper edge of the pattern piece <b>74</b>. In this case, the controller <b>2</b> identifies the pattern pieces <b>74</b> to <b>76</b> as the pattern pieces that are adjacent to the pattern piece <b>73</b> at the lower edge of the pattern piece <b>73</b>, and acquires the pattern pieces <b>73</b> to <b>76</b> as the set of adjacent pattern pieces.

For the third group (step S<b>18</b>), the controller <b>2</b> sets the processing lines and the contour drawing lines for the pattern piece <b>75</b> in a processing region R<b>4</b> different from the processing regions R<b>1</b> to R<b>3</b> (step S<b>19</b>), and generates each of the processing line processing data, the contour drawing data, and the identification drawing data (step S<b>20</b> to step S<b>22</b>). When all of the groups have been acquired by the processing at step S<b>18</b> (yes at step S<b>23</b>), the controller <b>2</b> outputs the processing data generated at step S<b>20</b> to step S<b>22</b> per group (step S<b>24</b>). For example, the controller <b>2</b> stores the processing data in the USB device <b>30</b> connected to the USB connector <b>28</b> and in the flash memory <b>84</b>. When the sewing machine <b>1</b> is connected to the processing device <b>3</b> by a wireless or a wired connection, the sewing machine <b>1</b> may output the processing data to the processing device <b>3</b>. The sewing machine <b>1</b> of the present embodiment refers to the processing data stored in the flash memory <b>84</b>, in sewing guide processing to be described below. The sewing machine <b>1</b> here ends the processing data generation processing.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">On the basis of the output data, the user causes the processing device <b>3</b> to be driven in accordance with the processing data. The processing device <b>3</b> processes the workpiece W with the sewing object as the workpiece W. For example, the user causes the sewing object of the first color to be held by the holding member <b>9</b> such that the reverse surface of the sewing object is the upper surface, and causes the processing device <b>3</b> to be driven on the basis of the processing line processing data, the contour drawing data, and the identification drawing data for performing the processing inside the processing region R<b>1</b>. When the patchwork is created by cutting out the sewing object pieces from the sewing object and sewing them together, of the surfaces of the sewing object, the reverse surface of the sewing object is the surface of the side on which the seam allowance is disposed. The processing device <b>3</b> processes the sewing object in accordance with each of the data. An order of executing the processing line processing data, the contour drawing data, and the identification drawing data may be set as appropriate. For example, after the processing device <b>3</b> performs the drawing processing that draws on the reverse surface of the sewing object on the basis of the contour drawing data and the identification drawing data, in a state in which the drawing pen <b>8</b> is mounted, the processing device <b>3</b> may perform the cutting processing that cuts the sewing object along the processing lines on the basis of the processing line processing data, in a state in which the drawing pen <b>8</b> is replaced with the cutting blade <b>7</b>. Similarly, the user can obtain the eight sewing object pieces corresponding to each of the pattern pieces <b>71</b> to <b>78</b> by causing each of the processing processes to be executed for the processing region R<b>2</b>, or by causing each of the processing processes to be executed for the processing region R<b>3</b> using the sewing object of the second color, and the processing region R<b>4</b> using the sewing object of the third color.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The sewing guide processing will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, using a specific example of creating the patchwork representing the T-shaped pattern <b>62</b> as a whole, by sequentially sewing together the eight sewing object pieces created on the basis of the data output by the processing data generation processing.

At step S<b>21</b>, the contour drawing data may be data that draws some of the contours of the pattern pieces, and the contour drawing data need not necessarily include data that draws the identification information of the pattern pieces. The common pattern at step S<b>12</b> may be changed as appropriate. When the cutting pattern is set as the common pattern, the cutting pattern need not necessarily be used for determining the positions of the ends of the two sewing objects. At step S<b>11</b>, the controller <b>2</b> may acquire the two pattern pieces regardless of whether or not there is the plurality of the adjacent pattern pieces with the edges that are targeted, among the contours of the pattern pieces.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">(C-2) For the pattern <b>62</b> and the shape <b>61</b> of the specific example, the controller <b>2</b> may set the processing lines and the contour drawing lines as in processing regions R<b>5</b> and R<b>6</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, and may generate the processing line processing data, the contour drawing data, and the identification drawing data. Specifically, the controller <b>2</b> may omit the processing at step S<b>15</b>, and need not necessarily set the offset lines for the portions that do not include the adjacent portion, of the contours of the pattern pieces. In this case, it is sufficient that the controller <b>2</b> set the processing lines on the contours of the pattern pieces for the portions that do not include the adjacent portion. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, in the pattern pieces <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>, <b>77</b>, and <b>78</b>, the offset lines are not set for the portions that do not include the adjacent portion, and the processing lines are set on the contours. The controller <b>2</b> may omit the processing at step S<b>12</b>, and may set the offset lines in a specific shape at step S<b>13</b> (a straight line segment, for example). The controller <b>2</b> may omit the processing at step S<b>9</b>, step S<b>17</b>, step S<b>18</b>, and step S<b>23</b>, and may generate each of the processing line processing data, the contour drawing data, and the identification drawing data without categorizing the plurality of pattern pieces <b>71</b> to <b>78</b> generated at step S<b>6</b> and step S<b>8</b> into the groups. At step S<b>12</b>, the controller <b>2</b> may set a drawing pattern that is common to the adjacent portions, in place of the cutting pattern, and may set the contour drawing data using line types that are mutually different depending on the adjacent portion, such as a dotted line, a one dot chain line, and the like. With respect to the regions R, the controller <b>2</b> may rotate the arrangement of the plurality of pattern pieces <b>71</b> to <b>78</b> in the processing regions R<b>5</b> and R<b>6</b> such that a number of the processing regions R is a minimum number. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the pattern pieces <b>72</b> and <b>77</b> are disposed after being rotated by <b>90</b> degrees in the clockwise direction with respect to the processing region R<b>6</b>.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
