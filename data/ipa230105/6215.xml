Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to an electrode for a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell and a membrane-electrode assembly including the same, more particularly to an antioxidant for a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell electrode catalyst, an electrode for a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell including the antioxidant, and a membrane-electrode assembly including the electrode.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Since a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell exhibits higher efficiency, higher current density and output density, shorter start-up time and faster responsiveness to load change when compared to other types of fuel cells, it can be applied to various applications including power sources of zero-emission vehicles, self-power generation, transportation, power supplies for military purposes, etc. For the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell to exhibit superior output performance, it should be able to operate stably in a wide range of current density.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In such a fuel cell system, a fuel cell stack, which actually generates electricity, has a structure in which several to tens of unit cells each consisting of a membrane-electrode assembly (MEA, also called an electrode-membrane assembly) and a separator (also called a bipolar plate) are stacked.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A cause of the deterioration of the durability of the membrane-electrode assembly is decomposition of the polymer electrolyte owing to chemical instability. The crossover of hydrogen and oxygen gases through the electrolyte membrane facilitates the production of hydrogen peroxide (HOOH). The hydrogen peroxide generates oxygen-containing radicals such as hydroxyl radical (OH), hydroperoxyl radical (OOH), etc. The produced radicals lower the durability of the fuel cell by attacking the functional groups (&#x2014;SO<sub>3</sub>H) of the perfluorosulfonate-based electrolyte membrane and thereby inducing chemical degradation of the membrane.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As another cause, during the process of directly transferring a catalyst layer onto the polymer electrolyte membrane, cracking of the catalyst layer may occur depending on the thickness of the catalyst layer, the content of a binder and the type of the catalyst. This eventually leads to the loss of the catalyst layer, and the presence of cracks in the catalyst layer causes the deterioration of performance and durability owing to the direct exposure of the polymer membrane to a gas supply channel.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Meanwhile, methods of adding various types of antioxidants to the electrolyte membrane or the electrode in order to mitigate the chemical degradation of the membrane-electrode assembly have been proposed. These antioxidants may be classified into primary antioxidants which are radical scavengers (or quenchers) and secondary antioxidants which are hydrogen peroxide decomposers. Representative primary antioxidants include cerium-based compounds, terephthalic acid, etc.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">For improvement of the durability of the fuel cell membrane-electrode assembly, development of an electrode for a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell to which a different type of antioxidant has been added to ensure physical robustness and chemical stability and minimize deterioration of performance in spite of long-term operation, and a method for preparing a membrane-electrode assembly using the same is necessary.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">REFERENCES OF THE RELATED ART</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Korean Patent No. 10-2238598</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present disclosure is directed to providing an antioxidant for a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell electrode catalyst, which is formed of a solid acid that is stable even under strong acidity and can be prepared into a dispersion due to high dispersibility in the form of a nanofiber.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present disclosure is also directed to providing an electrode for a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell, which can reinforce the mechanical strength of a catalyst layer and minimize the deterioration of chemical durability even after long-term operation, wherein the antioxidant is added to a catalyst slurry for a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell electrode.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present disclosure is also directed to providing a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell, wherein a membrane-electrode assembly including an electrode including the antioxidant is introduced, which exhibits high output performance and can operate stably due to minimized decrease of performance even after long-term operation.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an aspect, the present disclosure provides an antioxidant for a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell electrode catalyst, which contains cerium hydrogen phosphate (HCe<sub>2</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)) in the form of a nanofiber.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The antioxidant may be a radical scavenger.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The cerium hydrogen phosphate (HCe<sub>2</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)) may be a solid acid.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The nanofiber may have a diameter of 10-900 nm.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In another aspect, the present disclosure provides an electrode for a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell wherein the antioxidant for a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell electrode catalyst is dispersed.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The electrode may be based on one or metal selected from platinum (Pt), ruthenium (Ru), rhodium (Rh), molybdenum (Mo), osmium (Os), iridium (Ir), rhenium (Re), palladium (Pd), vanadium (V), tungsten (W), cobalt (Co), iron (Fe), selenium (Se), nickel (Ni), bismuth (Bi), tin (Sn), chromium (Cr), titanium (Ti), gold (Au), cerium (Ce), silver (Ag) and copper (Cu).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The electrode may be one wherein the metal is supported on porous carbon.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The electrode may include a fluorine-based ionomer, a perfluorosulfonate-based ionomer and a hydrocarbon-based polymer ionomer.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The electrode for a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell may be used in a fuel cell including a polymer electrolyte based on a fluorine-based ionomer, a perfluorosulfonate-based ionomer or a hydrocarbon-based ionomer.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In another aspect, the present disclosure provides a method for preparing an electrode catalyst slurry for a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell, which includes:</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">(a) a step of preparing a solution of cerium hydrogen phosphate (HCe<sub>2</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)) in the form of a nanofiber by reacting an acid solution in which a cerium (Ce) precursor is dissolved with a phosphoric acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) solution;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">(b) a step of preparing a first mixture solution by mixing the solution of cerium hydrogen phosphate (HCe<sub>2</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)) in the form of a nanofiber with an ionomer polymer solution;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">(c) a step of preparing a second mixture solution by mixing an electrode catalyst powder, distilled water and an alcohol solvent;

However, whereas the membrane-electrode assembly of Comparative Example 2 showed 19% decrease after 200 hours from the initial performance of 0.8 A cm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>, the membrane-electrode assembly of Example 3 with the antioxidant added showed only 9.6% decrease from the initial performance even after 500 hours (2.5 times longer).
