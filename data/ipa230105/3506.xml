When products are shipped by Internet mail order in particular, the products are placed on a base paper, and each product on its base paper is shrink-packaged (JP 2018-79971 A). The products which are shrink-packaged have various shapes and sizes, and multiple products may also be shrink-packaged together, but objects of different sizes are normally shrink-packaged by a single shrink-packaging machine.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">When a product is shrink-packaged, the object for packaging, including the base paper and the product, is wrapped in a shrink film formed into a cylindrical shape, and the shrink film is then heated and caused to contract. The object for packaging is packaged and held by means of the contracted shrink film.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">When objects of different sizes are packaged using a single shrink-packaging machine as described above, the size of the shrink film for packaging the objects for packaging needs to be set at a size capable of wrapping the largest envisaged object. However, when a small object is shrink-packaged using a large shrink film, there are risks of an excessive amount of contraction of the shrink film, causing a large number of creases which detract from the appearance, or sometimes the amount of contraction of the film is insufficient so the object cannot be appropriately held. Furthermore, more shrink film than necessary is used, which is also wasteful in terms of material. Under such circumstances, it would be desirable to detect in advance the size of the object to be shrink-packaged. Furthermore, the objects to be shrink-packaged may also include those which are formed either partially or fully from a transparent material, and objects which absorb light and reflect virtually no light, etc., and it would also be desirable to be able to accurately measure the size of such objects.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In light of the problems mentioned above, the object of the present invention lies in providing a shape profile measurement device capable of measuring a shape profile even of objects that transmit or absorb light, and a shrink-packaging machine comprising such a shape profile measurement device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">That is to say, the present invention provides a shape profile measurement device comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">a light projector having a plurality of light-emitting portions arranged in a predetermined array direction, each of the light-emitting portions emitting substantially parallel measurement light;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0008">a light receiver having a plurality of light-receiving portions arranged in the predetermined array direction facing the plurality of light-emitting portions, each of the light-receiving portions receiving the measurement light emitted from a corresponding light-emitting portion among the plurality of light-emitting portions, and outputting a signal indicating a light intensity of the received measurement light;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0009">a movement mechanism for causing an object for measurement to move in relation to the light projector and the light receiver so that the object for measurement passes between the plurality of light-emitting portions and the plurality of light-receiving portions; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0010">a calculation unit for acquiring the signal of the light receiver when the object for measurement is at a plurality of different movement-direction positions between the plurality of light-emitting portions and the plurality of light-receiving portions, and for obtaining a shape profile of the object for measurement on the basis of the signal acquired and information relating to the plurality of movement-direction positions,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0011">wherein the calculation unit determines that the object for measurement is present on a propagation path on which the measurement light propagates when the light intensity of the measurement light received by the light-receiving portions drops to or below a predetermined threshold in relation to an initial intensity before measurement.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0008" num="0012">This shape profile measurement device is configured to obtain the shape profile of the object for measurement on the basis of the magnitude of light intensity of measurement light received by the light-emitting portions. If the object for measurement is opaque and does not transmit light, the measurement light striking the object for measurement is blocked without reaching the corresponding light-receiving portion, so the light intensity of the measurement light at that light-receiving portion is substantially zero, and as a result it is possible to detect that the object for measurement is present at a position where the measurement light propagates. In this case, the shape profile measurement device does not utilize reflection of light that has struck the object for measurement, and therefore the shape profile measurement is unaffected when the object for measurement has absorbed the light. If the object for measurement is transparent, on the other hand, the measurement light striking the object for measurement is transmitted by the object for measurement and reaches the light-receiving portion, but the measurement light is reflected or scattered to some extent as it passes through the object for measurement, so the light intensity of the measurement light reaching the light-receiving portion decreases to some extent. The shape profile measurement device detects the presence of the object for measurement by a drop in the light intensity of the measurement light received by the light-receiving portions, to or below a predetermined threshold, so the shape profile can be measured even in the case of a partially or fully transparent object.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0013">Specifically, the shape profile measurement device may further comprise:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0014">a movement amount measurement means for measuring an amount of movement of the object for measurement conveyed by means of the movement mechanism, and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0015">the information relating to the plurality of movement-direction positions may constitute the amount of movement of the object for measurement measured by the movement amount measurement means.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0010" num="0016">Furthermore, based on the shape profile, the calculation unit may execute a calculation to obtain a minimum length of a film required for wrapping the object for measurement in said film.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0017">In this case, the calculation unit may execute:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0018">a calculation to obtain a starting vertex on the shape profile, which is where, when a predetermined straight line approaches the shape profile, that straight line initially makes contact;

a film wrapping device <b>3</b> for wrapping the periphery of the object O for packaging with a shrink film; and a heating device <b>4</b> for heating the shrink film to cause contraction thereof.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the shape profile measurement device <b>2</b> comprises: a belt conveyor (movement mechanism) <b>10</b>; and a light projector <b>12</b> and a light receiver <b>14</b> arranged facing each other with the belt conveyor <b>10</b> interposed therebetween. The belt conveyor <b>10</b> conveys the object O for packaging, which has been placed thereon, at a set speed. It should be noted that the object O for packaging depicted comprises a base paper P and an article Q placed thereon. The light projector <b>12</b> comprises a plurality of light-emitting portions <b>16</b> arranged in an array direction, which is a vertical direction, and each of the light-emitting portions <b>16</b> emits substantially parallel measurement light L in a horizontal direction. The light receiver <b>14</b> comprises a plurality of light-receiving portions <b>18</b> (which are not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) arranged in the same array direction facing the plurality of light-emitting portions <b>16</b> of the light projector <b>12</b>. Each of the light-receiving portions <b>18</b> receives the measurement light L emitted from a corresponding light-emitting portion <b>16</b>, and outputs a signal indicating a light intensity of the received measurement light L. The shape profile measurement device <b>2</b> further comprises a controller (calculation unit) <b>24</b> connected to an encoder (movement amount measurement means) <b>22</b> for measuring a rotation speed of a drive roller <b>20</b> of the belt conveyor <b>10</b>, and to the light receiver <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0044">A conveyance speed of the belt conveyor <b>10</b> is set at 0.5 m/s in the shape profile measurement device <b>2</b> of this embodiment, and the light-emitting portions <b>16</b> of the light projector <b>12</b> and the light-receiving portions <b>18</b> of the light receiver <b>14</b> are each arranged at a pitch of 5 mm. Furthermore, the controller <b>24</b> receives and acquires signals from the light receiver <b>14</b> at intervals of 10 ms, while detecting, on the basis of output of the encoder <b>22</b>, an amount of movement of the object O for packaging placed on the belt conveyor <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0045">When the object O for packaging conveyed by the belt conveyor <b>10</b> passes between the light projector <b>12</b> and the light receiver <b>14</b>, a portion of the measurement light L propagating therebetween is blocked by the object O for packaging. The article Q of the object O for packaging depicted has an opaque part R and a transparent part S. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a state in which the transparent part S is positioned between the light projector <b>12</b> and the light receiver <b>14</b>. The measurement light L emitted from the light-emitting portion <b>16</b> at the very bottom is blocked as it strikes the base paper P of the object O for packaging, and therefore does not reach the corresponding light-receiving portion <b>18</b>. The measurement light L emitted from the light-emitting portions <b>16</b> second to fifth from the bottom is likewise blocked as it strikes the opaque part R of the article Q of the object O for packaging, and is therefore not received by the corresponding light-receiving portions <b>18</b>. On the other hand, the measurement light L emitted from the light-emitting portions <b>16</b> sixth to fourteenth from the bottom strikes the transparent part S of the article Q and, although a portion thereof is reflected and scattered, most of it is transmitted by the transparent part S and received by the corresponding light-receiving portions <b>18</b>. There is nothing to block the measurement light L emitted from the fifteenth and subsequent light-emitting portions <b>16</b> from reaching the light-receiving portions <b>18</b>, so that light is received by the corresponding light-receiving portions <b>18</b> at an unchanged light intensity. Each of the light-receiving portions <b>18</b> outputs a signal commensurate with the light intensity of the received measurement light L.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0046">The signals from the light-receiving portions <b>18</b> are sent to the controller <b>24</b>, which determines the vertical size of the object O for packaging on the basis of the signals received. Specifically, when the light intensity of the measurement light L received by the light-receiving portions <b>18</b> drops to or below a predetermined threshold in relation to an initial intensity before measurement, the controller <b>24</b> determines that the object O for packaging is present on a propagation path on which the measurement light L propagates. The predetermined threshold may be set at any value, but is 95% in this embodiment, for example. That is to say, when the measurement light L received by the light-receiving portions <b>18</b> has dropped by 5% or more in relation to the initial intensity, the object O for packaging is deemed to be present on the propagation path of the measurement light L.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0047">In the example depicted, the measurement light L emitted from the first to fifth light-emitting portions <b>16</b> is completely blocked by the object O for packaging, and therefore does not reach the corresponding light-receiving portions <b>18</b>. Accordingly, the light intensity of the measurement light L received by the first to fifth light-receiving portions <b>18</b> is 0% in relation to the initial intensity, and the first to fifth light-receiving portions <b>18</b> output a signal indicating that the light intensity has dropped to 0%. The measurement light L emitted from the sixth to fourteenth light-emitting portions <b>16</b> reaches the corresponding light-receiving portions <b>18</b> with a slight drop in light intensity due to reflection and scattering, etc. when the measurement light L is transmitted by the transparent part S of the object O for packaging. Accordingly, the light intensity of the measurement light L received by the sixth to fourteenth light-receiving portions <b>18</b> drops in relation to the initial intensity, reaching around 90%, for example. In this case, the measurement light L reaches the light-receiving portions <b>18</b>, but the light intensity of the measurement light L received by the light-receiving portions <b>18</b> has dropped to 90%, which is below the 95% threshold, and therefore the controller <b>24</b> determines that the object O for packaging is present on the propagation path on which the measurement light L propagates. The measurement light L emitted from the fifteenth and subsequent light-emitting portions <b>16</b> reaches the corresponding light-receiving portions <b>18</b> without being blocked by the object O for packaging, so the light intensity of the measurement light L received by the fifteenth and subsequent light-receiving portions <b>18</b> is substantially 100%. The light intensity of that measurement light L has not dropped to or below the predetermined threshold (95%), so the controller <b>24</b> determines that the object O for packaging is not present on the conveyance path on which the measurement light L propagates. The controller <b>24</b> thus determines that the height of the object O for packaging at the position depicted is around 7 cm, which is the same level as the fifteenth light-emitting portion <b>16</b> and light-receiving portion <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0048">The height measurement as described above is continuously executed at intervals of 10 ms with respect to the object O for packaging being conveyed at a speed of around 0.5 m/s. The amount of movement of the object O for packaging per 10 ms is around 5 mm, and therefore the height of the object O for packaging is measured at a plurality of movement-direction positions at intervals of around 5 mm. The controller <b>24</b> ascertains a movement-direction distance between signals acquired from the light receiver <b>14</b> on the basis of the amount of movement of the object O for packaging measured by means of the encoder <b>22</b>, and obtains a shape profile <b>30</b> such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The shape profile measurement device <b>2</b> can thus measure this shape profile <b>30</b> regardless of whether the object O for packaging is light absorbent or light transmissive. It should be noted that the amount of movement of the object O for packaging measured by means of the encoder <b>22</b> is utilized as information relating to the movement direction of the object O for packaging in this embodiment, but, provided that the conveyance speed of the belt conveyor <b>10</b> is kept fixed and the time intervals of the height measurement are always fixed time intervals, it is also possible to utilize a given amount of movement calculated from the fixed conveyance speed and time intervals as the information relating to the movement direction, without using the encoder <b>22</b>. Alternatively, if the conveyance speed of the belt conveyor <b>10</b> is not fixed, a first height measurement may be performed, then a subsequent height measurement may be performed when the amount of movement measured by means of the encoder <b>22</b> has reached a given magnitude (e.g., 5 mm) from a movement-direction position when the first height measurement was performed.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0049">The controller <b>24</b> of the shape profile measurement device <b>2</b> has a further function of obtaining a minimum length of a film <b>32</b> required for wrapping the object O for packaging having the measured shape profile <b>30</b> with said film <b>32</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, when the minimum length is obtained, a vertex at the highest position of the shape profile <b>30</b> is first of all specified and set as a starting vertex A<b>0</b>. The starting vertex A<b>0</b> is the point furthest above a bottom surface of the shape profile <b>30</b>, in other words, it is the point where, when a horizontal straight line approaches the shape profile <b>30</b> from above, that straight line initially makes contact. In the example depicted, an upper surface of the shape profile <b>30</b> is horizontal, so there are multiple points on the upper surface which are furthest above the bottom surface, but in such a case, a point at a corner on a front side (the left-hand side as seen in the drawing) may be used as the starting vertex A<b>0</b>, for example. Next, when a straight line B<b>1</b> passing only through the starting vertex A<b>0</b> and not passing through the shape profile <b>30</b> outside of the starting vertex A<b>0</b> is rotated in a first rotation direction (anticlockwise as seen in the drawing) about the starting vertex A<b>0</b> within a plane of the shape profile <b>30</b>, a point at which that straight line B<b>1</b> initially makes contact with the shape profile <b>30</b> outside of the starting vertex A<b>0</b> is specified, and that point is set as a first adjacent vertex A<b>1</b>. In the same way, when a straight line B<b>2</b> passing only through the first adjacent vertex A<b>1</b> is rotated in the first rotation direction about the first adjacent vertex A<b>1</b>, the point of initial contact is specified, and that point is set as a second adjacent vertex A<b>2</b>. The same calculation is repeated until the adjacent vertex obtained reaches an end point C of the shape profile <b>30</b>, i.e., a point next to or contacting the belt conveyor <b>10</b>. In the example depicted, the second adjacent vertex A<b>2</b> is already the end point C of the shape profile <b>30</b>. Next, when a straight line B<b>3</b> passing only through the starting vertex A<b>0</b> is rotated in a second rotation direction (clockwise as seen in the drawing) opposite to the first rotation direction, a point at which that straight line B<b>3</b> initially makes contact outside of the starting vertex A<b>0</b> is specified, and that point is set as a third adjacent vertex A<b>3</b>. The same calculation is repeated to obtain a fourth adjacent vertex A<b>4</b> and a fifth adjacent vertex A<b>5</b>. The length of a polygonal line <b>34</b> formed by successively joining the starting vertex A<b>0</b> and the first to fifth adjacent vertices A<b>1</b>-A<b>5</b> by first to sixth line segments D<b>1</b>-D<b>6</b> is the minimum length for wrapping the shape profile <b>30</b> with the film <b>32</b>. It should be noted that here, the vertex at which, when the horizontal straight line approaches from above, that straight line initially makes contact is set as the starting vertex A<b>0</b>, but the starting vertex A<b>0</b> may equally be a point at a different position. For example, a point at a lower end may be set as the starting vertex A<b>0</b>, and adjacent vertices may be obtained in succession. Furthermore, the adjacent vertices A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b> may be obtained by means of a method in which a straight line is rotated in the first rotation direction, after which a method in which a straight line is further rotated in the first rotation direction in relation to A<b>2</b> is further performed, the adjacent vertices A<b>5</b>, A<b>4</b>, A<b>3</b> are obtained in succession, then the calculation to obtain the adjacent vertices may be terminated at the time when the adjacent vertex obtained is the same point as the starting vertex A<b>0</b>. Additionally, the method for obtaining each of the vertices has been described here by a procedure that involves rotating straight lines, but such a calculation does not necessarily have to be performed in practice, and a different calculation method may also be used to obtain the same vertices.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0050">For example, the starting vertex and each of the adjacent vertices may also be obtained by means of a calculation such as below. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a movement direction is X and a height direction is Y, and a data point where Y is greatest is specified from among data points that constitute the shape profile <b>30</b> (the black circles in the drawing). There are multiple data points where Y is greatest in the case of the shape profile <b>30</b>, so a data point a among these where X is smallest is set as the starting vertex A<b>0</b>. Data points where the value of X is the same as or smaller than that of the starting vertex A<b>0</b> are then extracted, and angles of line segments joining the starting vertex A<b>0</b> and each of the data points are respectively obtained. For example, an angle &#x3b8;b of a line segment Eb joining the starting vertex A<b>0</b> (X<sub>A</sub>, Y<sub>A</sub>) and a data point b (X<sub>b</sub>, Y<sub>b</sub>) may be obtained by means of the following formula.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>&#x3b8;</mi>   <mi>b</mi>  </msub>  <mo>=</mo>  <mrow>   <semantics definitionURL="">    <mo>&#x2758;</mo>    <annotation encoding="Mathematica">"\[LeftBracketingBar]"</annotation>   </semantics>   <mrow>    <msup>     <mi>tan</mi>     <mrow>      <mo>-</mo>      <mn>1</mn>     </mrow>    </msup>    <mo>(</mo>    <mfrac>     <mrow>      <msub>       <mi>Y</mi>       <mi>A</mi>      </msub>      <mo>-</mo>      <msub>       <mi>Y</mi>       <mi>b</mi>      </msub>     </mrow>     <mrow>      <msub>       <mi>X</mi>       <mi>A</mi>      </msub>      <mo>-</mo>      <msub>       <mi>X</mi>       <mi>b</mi>      </msub>     </mrow>    </mfrac>    <mo>)</mo>   </mrow>   <semantics definitionURL="">    <mo>&#x2758;</mo>    <annotation encoding="Mathematica">"\[RightBracketingBar]"</annotation>   </semantics>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0035" num="0051">Angles &#x3b8; of line segments in relation to all of the other data points extracted are obtained in the same way. When angles &#x3b8;b, &#x3b8;c, &#x3b8;d, &#x3b8;e for the representative data points b, c, d, e are actually obtained, they are found to be approximately 67.4&#xb0;, approximately 63.4&#xb0;, approximately 56.3&#xb0;, and approximately 58.4&#xb0;, respectively. The data point where the angle &#x3b8; is smallest is obtained from among all of the extracted data points, and that data point is set as the next adjacent vertex. In the case of the shape profile <b>30</b> depicted, the angle &#x3b8;d of a line segment Ed with the data point d is the smallest, so the data point d is set as the first adjacent vertex A<b>1</b>. In order to obtain the second adjacent vertex A<b>2</b>, data points where the value of X is the same as or smaller than that of the data point d constituting the first adjacent vertex A<b>1</b> are then extracted, and angles of line segments joining the data point d and each of the extracted data points are calculated. The data point e is the only data point extracted in the case of the shape profile <b>30</b>, so the data point e is set as the second adjacent vertex A<b>2</b>. Following this, the adjacent vertex to the right of the starting vertex A<b>0</b> is obtained. Data points where the value of X is greater than that of the starting vertex A<b>0</b> are extracted, and angles of line segments joining the starting vertex A<b>0</b> and each of those data points are obtained in the same way. There are a large number of data points where the angle &#x3b8; is a minimum of 0&#xb0; in the shape profile <b>30</b>, but, among those, a data point f furthest from the starting vertex A<b>0</b> is set as the third adjacent vertex A<b>3</b>. Data points where the value of X is the same as or greater than that of the third adjacent vertex A<b>3</b> are then extracted, angles of line segments joining the third adjacent vertex A<b>3</b> and each of those data points are respectively obtained, and the data point having the smallest angle is specified. An angle &#x3b8;g in relation to a line segment Eg with a data point g is the smallest, so the data point g is set as the fourth adjacent vertex A<b>4</b>. A data point h is set as the fifth adjacent vertex A<b>5</b> in the same way. It should be noted that such a calculation to set the point having the smallest angle in relation to a particular data point as the following adjacent vertex is substantially the same as setting the point of initial contact when a straight line is rotated as the following adjacent vertex, as described above, and the results of both calculations are in principle the same.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a shape profile <b>30</b>&#x2032; when a different object for packaging is measured by means of the same method, and a polygonal line <b>34</b>&#x2032; indicating the minimum length obtained with respect to the shape profile <b>30</b>&#x2032;.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0053">When the measurement performed by the shape profile measurement device <b>2</b> has been completed, the object O for packaging is then wrapped with the shrink film <b>32</b> by means of the film wrapping device <b>3</b>. The film wrapping device <b>3</b> forms the cylindrical shrink film <b>32</b> by welding two shrink films, and the object O for packaging is wrapped inside the two films. The peripheral length of the cylindrical shrink film <b>32</b> in this case is determined on the basis of the minimum length obtained by means of the shape profile measurement device <b>2</b>.
