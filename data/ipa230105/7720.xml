data. In general, a wireless communication system is a multiple access system that supports communication of multiple users by sharing available system resources (a bandwidth, transmission power, etc.). Examples of multiple access systems include a code division multiple access (CDMA) system, a frequency division multiple access (FDMA) system, a time division multiple access (TDMA) system, an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system, and a single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) system.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In particular, as a large number of communication devices require a large communication capacity, the enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) communication technology, as compared to the conventional radio access technology (RAT), is being proposed. In addition, not only massive machine type communications (massive MTC), which provide a variety of services anytime and anywhere by connecting multiple devices and objects, but also a communication system considering a service/user equipment (UE) sensitive to reliability and latency is being proposed. Various technical configurations for this are being proposed.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure may provide a method and apparatus for effectively controlling a configuration associated with sidelink communication in a wireless communication system.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure may provide an apparatus and method for changing an identifier associated with sidelink for unicast communication in a wireless communication system.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure may provide an apparatus and method for reestablishing an entity of a lower layer according to a change of an identifier associated with sidelink for unicast communication in a wireless communication system.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure may provide an apparatus and method for managing a context of link according to a change of an identifier associated with sidelink for unicast communication in a wireless communication system.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The technical objects to be achieved in the present disclosure are not limited to the above-mentioned technical objects, and other technical objects that are not mentioned may be considered by those skilled in the art through the embodiments described below.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, a method for operating a user equipment (UE) in a wireless communication system may include, performing communication through a link established between the UE and another UE; transmitting a first message for requesting an update of an identifier of the link; receiving a second message for responding to the first message; and reestablishing a packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) entity of the UE based on the update of the identifier.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, a user equipment in a wireless communication system includes a transceiver and at least one processor coupled with the transceiver.

GTP-C is used within a GPRS core network for signalling between gateway GPRS support nodes (GGSN) and serving GPRS support nodes (SGSN). GTP-C allows the SGSN to activate a session (e.g., PDN context activation), deactivate the same session, adjust the quality of service parameters, or renew a session for a subscriber, that has just operated from another SGSN, for the user. GTP-U is used to carry user data within the GPRS core network and between the radio access network and the core network.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Cell as a radio resource: the 3GPP LTE/LTE-A system has used a concept of a cell to manage radio resources, and a cell related to the radio resource is distinguished from a cell of a geographic area. The &#x201c;cell&#x201d; related to the radio resource is defined as a combination of downlink (DL) resources and uplink (UL) resources, i.e., a combination of DL carriers and UL carriers. The cell may be configured with DL resource only or a combination of DL resources and UL resources. If carrier aggregation is supported, a linkage between a carrier frequency of the DL resource and a carrier frequency of the UL resource may be indicated by system information. Here, the carrier frequency refers to a center frequency of each cell or carrier. In particular, a cell operating on a primary frequency is called a primary cell or Pcell, and a cell operating on a secondary frequency is called a secondary cell or Scell. The Scell refers to a cell that can be configured after radio resource control (RRC) connection establishment is achieved and can be used for providing additional radio resources. Depending on capabilities of the UE, the Scell together with the Pcell can form a set of serving cells for the UE. For the UE that is in a RRC_CONNECTED state but is not configured with carrier aggregation, or does not support carrier aggregation, there is only one serving cell configured with only the Pcell. The &#x201c;cell&#x201d; of the geographic area can be understood as a coverage in which a node can provide services using a carrier, and the &#x201c;cell&#x201d; of the radio resource is related to a bandwidth (BW) that is a frequency range configured by the carrier. Since a downlink coverage that is a range within which the node can transmit a valid signal and an uplink coverage that is a range within which the node can receive the valid signal from the UE depend on the carrier carrying the corresponding signal, the coverage of the node is associated with the coverage of the &#x201c;cell&#x201d; of the radio resource the node uses. Thus, the term &#x201c;cell&#x201d; may be used to sometimes denote the coverage of the service by the node, sometimes denote the radio resource, and sometimes denote a range that a signal using the radio resources can reach with a valid strength.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The EPC is a key element of system architecture evolution (SAE) to improve the performance of 3GPP technologies. The SAE corresponds to a research project to determine a network structure supporting mobility between various kinds of networks. The SAE aims to provide an optimized packet-based system, for example, supporting various radio access technologies on an IP basis and providing more improved data transfer capability.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">More specifically, the EPC is a core network of an IP mobile communication system for the 3GPP LTE system and can support packet-based real-time and non-real time services. In the existing mobile communication system (i.e., in the 2nd or 3rd mobile communication system), functions of the core network have been implemented through two separate sub-domains including a circuit-switched (CS) sub-domain for voice and a packet-switched (PS) sub-domain for data. However, in the 3GPP LTE system that is an evolution of the 3rd mobile communication system, the CS and PS sub-domains have been unified into a single IP domain. That is, in the 3GPP LTE system, a connection between UEs having IP capabilities can be configured via an IP-based base station (e.g., evolved Node B (eNodeB)), an EPC, and an application domain (e.g., IP multimedia subsystem (IMS)). In other words, the EPC is an essential architecture to implement end-to-end IP services.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The EPC may include various components, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates some of the EPC components, including a serving gateway (SGW), a packet data network gateway (PDN GW), a mobility management entity (MME), a SGSN (serving GPRS (general packet radio service) supporting node), and an enhanced packet data gateway (ePDG).</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The SGW (or S-GW) operates as a boundary point between a radio access network (RAN) and a core network, and is an element that functions to maintain a data path between the eNB and the PDN GW. Further, if the UE moves across areas served by the eNB, the SGW serves as a local mobility anchor point. That is, packets can be routed through the SGW for mobility within the E-UTRAN (evolved-universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) terrestrial radio access network defined in 3GPP Release-8 or later). The SGW may also serve as an anchor point for mobility with other 3GPP networks (RAN defined before 3GPP Release-8, for example, UTRAN or GERAN (global system for mobile communication (GSM)/enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE) radio access network).</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The PDN GW (or P-GW) corresponds to a termination point of a data interface to a packet data network. The PDN GW can support policy enforcement features, packet filtering, charging support, and the like. In addition, the PDN GW can serve as an anchor point for mobility management between the 3GPP network and a non-3GPP network (e.g., untrusted networks such as an interworking wireless local area network (I-WLAN) or trusted networks such as a code division multiple access (CDMA) network and Wimax).</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Hereinafter, the present disclosure is described based on the terms defined as above.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Three major requirement areas of 5G include (1) an enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) area, (2) a massive machine type communication (mMTC) area, and (3) an ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC) area.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Some use cases may require multiple areas for optimization, and other use case may be focused on only one key performance indicator (KPI). 5G supports these various use cases in a flexible and reliable method.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">eMBB is far above basic mobile Internet access and covers media and entertainment applications in abundant bidirectional tasks, cloud or augmented reality. Data is one of key motive powers of 5G, and dedicated voice services may not be first seen in the 5G era. In 5G, it is expected that voice will be processed as an application program using a data connection simply provided by a communication system. Major causes for an increased traffic volume include an increase in the content size and an increase in the number of applications that require a high data transfer rate. Streaming service (audio and video), dialogue type video and mobile Internet connections will be used more widely as more devices are connected to the Internet. Such many application programs require connectivity always turned on in order to push real-time information and notification to a user. A cloud storage and application suddenly increases in the mobile communication platform, and this can be applied to both business and entertainment. Furthermore, cloud storage is a special use case that tows the growth of an uplink data transfer rate. 5G is also used for remote business of cloud. When a tactile interface is used, further lower end-to-end latency is required to maintain excellent user experiences. Entertainment, for example, cloud game and video streaming are other key elements which increase a need for the mobile broadband ability. Entertainment is essential in the smartphone and tablet anywhere including high mobility environments, such as a train, a vehicle and an airplane. Another use case is augmented reality and information search for entertainment. In this case, augmented reality requires very low latency and an instant amount of data.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Furthermore, one of the most expected 5G use case relates to a function capable of smoothly connecting embedded sensors in all fields, that is, mMTC.

Such fast speed is required to deliver TV with a resolution of 4K or more (6K, 8K or more) in addition to virtual reality and augmented reality. Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) applications include immersive sports games. A specific application program may require a special network configuration. For example, for VR games, in order for game companies to minimize latency, a core server may need to be integrated with the edge network server of a network operator.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">An automotive is expected to be an important and new motive power in 5G, along with many use cases for the mobile communication of an automotive. For example, entertainment for a passenger requires a high capacity and a high mobility mobile broadband at the same time. The reason for this is that future users continue to expect a high-quality connection regardless of their location and speed. Another use example of the automotive field is an augmented reality dashboard. The augmented reality dashboard overlaps and displays information, identifying an object in the dark and notifying a driver of the distance and movement of the object, over a thing seen by the driver through a front window. In the future, a wireless module enables communication between vehicles, information exchange between a vehicle and a supported infrastructure, and information exchange between a vehicle and other connected devices (e.g., devices accompanied by a pedestrian). A safety system guides alternative courses of a behavior so that a driver can drive more safely, thereby reducing a danger of an accident. A next stage will be a remotely controlled or self-driven vehicle. This requires very reliable, very fast communication between different self-driven vehicles and between an automotive and infra. In the future, a self-driving vehicle can perform all driving activities, and a driver will be focused on only abnormal traffics, which cannot be identified by a vehicle itself. Technical requirements of a self-driving vehicle require ultra-low latency and ultra-high speed reliability so that traffic safety is increased up to a level which cannot be achieved by a person.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">A smart city and smart home mentioned as a smart society will be embedded as a high-density radio sensor network. The distributed network of intelligent sensors will identify the cost of a city or home and a condition for energy-efficient maintenance. A similar configuration may be performed for each home. All of a temperature sensor, a window and heating controller, a burglar alarm and home appliances are wirelessly connected. Many of such sensors are typically a low data transfer rate, low energy and a low cost. However, for example, real-time HD video may be required for a specific type of device for surveillance.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The consumption and distribution of energy including heat or gas are highly distributed and thus require automated control of a distributed sensor network. A smart grid collects information, and interconnects such sensors using digital information and a communication technology so that the sensors operate based on the information. The information may include the behaviors of a supplier and consumer, and thus the smart grid may improve the distribution of fuel, such as electricity, in an efficient, reliable, economical, production-sustainable and automated manner. The smart grid may be considered to be another sensor network having small latency.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">A health part owns many application programs which reap the benefits of mobile communication. A communication system can support remote treatment providing clinical treatment at a distant place. This helps to reduce a barrier for the distance and can improve access to medical services which are not continuously used at remote farming areas. Furthermore, this is used to save life in important treatment and an emergency condition. A radio sensor network based on mobile communication can provide remote monitoring and sensors for parameters, such as the heart rate and blood pressure.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Radio and mobile communication becomes increasingly important in the industry application field.

A medium access control (MAC) layer of the second layer functions to map various logical channels to various transfer channels, and also performs a function of logical channel multiplexing for mapping several logical channels to one transfer channel. The MAC layer is connected to a radio link control (RLC) layer, that is an upper layer, via the logical channel. The logical channel is roughly divided into a control channel used to transmit information of the control plane and a traffic channel used to transmit information of the user plane according to a type of transmitted information.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0255">The MAC layer of the second layer segments and concatenate data received from the upper layer and adjusts a data size so that a lower layer is adapted to transmit data to a radio section.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0256">A packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) layer of the second layer performs a header compression function of reducing an IP packet header size that has a relatively large size and contains unnecessary control information, in order to efficiently transmit data in a radio section having a small bandwidth upon transmission of IP packet such as IPv4 or IPv6. In addition, in the LTE system, the PDCP layer also performs a security function, which consists of ciphering for preventing data interception by a third party and integrity protection for preventing data manipulation by a third party.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0257">A radio resource control (RRC) layer located at the uppermost part of the third layer is defined only in the control plane and is responsible for controlling logical channels, transport channels, and physical channels in relation to configuration, reconfiguration, and release of radio bearers (RBs). The RB means services provided by the second layer to ensure data transfer between the UE and the E-UTRAN.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0258">If an RRC connection is established between an RRC layer of the UE and an RRC layer of a wireless network, the UE is in an RRC connected mode. Otherwise, the UE is in an RRC idle mode.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0259">An RRC state of the UE and an RRC connection method are described below. The RRC state refers to a state in which the RRC of the UE is or is not logically connected with the RRC of the E-UTRAN. The RRC state of the UE having logical connection with the RRC of the E-UTRAN is referred to as an RRC_CONNECTED state, and the RRC state of the UE not having logical connection with the RRC of the E-UTRAN is referred to as an RRC_IDLE state. Since the UE in the RRC_CONNECTED state has the RRC connection, the E-UTRAN can identify the presence of the corresponding UE on a per cell basis and thus efficiently control the UE. On the other hand, the E-UTRAN cannot identify the presence of the UE of the RRC_IDLE state, and the UE in the RRC_IDLE state is managed by a core network based on a tracking area (TA) which is an area unit larger than the cell. That is, for the UE in the RRC_IDLE state, only presence or absence of the corresponding UE is identified in an area unit larger than the cell. In order for the UE of the RRC IDLE state to receive typical mobile communication services such as voice and data, the UE should transition to the RRC_CONNECTED state. Each TA is distinguished from another TA by a tracking area identity (TAI) thereof. The UE may configure the TAI through a tracking area code (TAC) which is information broadcasted from a cell.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0260">When the user initially turns on the UE, the UE first searches for a proper cell, and then establishes RRC connection in the corresponding cell and registers information of the UE in the core network. Thereafter, the UE stays in the RRC_IDLE state. The UE staying in the RRC_IDLE state (re)selects a cell and checks system information or paging information, if necessary. This operation is called camping on a cell. Only when the UE staying in the RRC_IDLE state needs to establish the RRC connection, the UE establishes the RRC connection with the RRC layer of the E-UTRAN through a RRC connection procedure and transitions to the RRC_CONNECTED state. There are several cases where the UE remaining in the RRC_IDLE state needs to establish the RRC connection. For example, the cases may include an attempt of a user to make a phone call, an attempt to transmit data, or transmission of a response message when receiving a paging message from the E-UTRAN.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0261">A non-access stratum (NAS) layer positioned over the RRC layer performs functions such as session management and mobility management.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0262">The NAS layer shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is described in detail below.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0263">The evolved session management (ESM) belonging to the NAS layer performs functions such as default bearer management and dedicated bearer management to control the UE to use a PS service from a network. The default bearer resources are allocated from a network when they are accessed to the network upon first access to a specific packet data network (PDN). In this instance, the network allocates an IP address available for the UE so that the UE can use a data service, and also allocates QoS of a default bearer. LTE roughly supports two types of bearers including a bearer with guaranteed bit rate (GBR) QoS characteristics for guaranteeing a specific bandwidth for data transmission/reception and a non-GBR bearer with best effort QoS characteristics without guaranteeing a bandwidth. The default bearer is allocated the non-GBR bearer. The dedicated bearer may be allocated a bearer with GBR or non-GBR QoS characteristics.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0264">A bearer that the network allocates to the UE is referred to as an evolved packet service (EPS) bearer. When the network allocates the EPS bearer to the UE, the network assigns one ID. This ID is called an EPS bearer ID. One EPS bearer has QoS characteristics of a maximum bit rate (MBR) and/or a guaranteed bit rate (GBR).</p><p id="p-0267" num="0265"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a view illustrating an example of a common architecture of a new radio (NR)-radio access network (RAN).

Accordingly, in order to prevent service interruption, a link identifier update procedure may be used to update peer UE associated with a unicast link facing an impending change of identifiers used for the link before the identifier change occurs.

For example, a change of identifier may be determined due to a change of an application layer ID or according to expiry of timer. Herein, the link identifier update request message may include new identifiers to be used. The new identifiers may include a new application layer ID, a new layer-2 ID, a new IP address/prefix.

As a Uu interface informs each terminal of when an uplink radio resource is used and when a downlink radio resource is used, the terminal only needs to monitor a radio resource allocated to the terminal. However, in the case of the PC5 interface, it is not known when neighboring terminals actually transmit data, and due to a feature of a V2X application especially in view of safety, it is preferable to be ready for receiving information from any neighboring terminal (e.g., vehicle). Because of such a feature, when a user with malicious purpose keeps monitoring the PC5 interface, especially when a vehicle keeps using a same identifier, the vehicle may be easily subject to tracking, which is not preferable in view of security. Accordingly, a V2X application enables each vehicle to change its identifier periodically or at random. Thus, it may be prevented that some vehicle keeps track of another vehicle.</p><p id="p-0352" num="0398">According to an embodiment, a terminal may operate as follows.</p><p id="p-0353" num="0399">Terminals may perform connection establishment with other terminals according to a request of an application. A terminal (e.g., a terminal A), with another terminal (e.g., a terminal B), may establish a bearer and may use the established bearer to transmit and/or receive data using direct communication between terminals like PC5 interface. For a purpose like privacy protection, a terminal may recognize that a change of a layer-2 ID is needed, and the terminal A may start a procedure for changing the layer-2 ID.</p><p id="p-0354" num="0400">For this, the terminal A may generate a link identifier update request message and transmit the link identifier update request message to the terminal B. In this case, in order to apply a new layer-2 ID at a same time as the terminal B, the terminal A may additionally designate a specific time (hereinafter referred to as &#x2018;reconfiguration time&#x2019;) by using a time reference value managed in a PC5 interface between the terminal A and the terminal B and may further include information related to the specific time in the link identifier update request message.</p><p id="p-0355" num="0401">The terminal B, which receives the link identifier update request message, may recognize a change of an identifier of a terminal, based on a content of the link identifier update request message, store information included in the link identifier update request message, if an update of the identifier the terminal B is needed, generate a link identifier update response message including an identifier of the terminal B and transmit the link identifier update response message to the terminal A.</p><p id="p-0356" num="0402">In case the link identifier update request message received from the terminal A includes reconfiguration time information, the terminal B may determine whether or not the terminal B is capable of accepting the reconfiguration time. For example, in case a security key associated with the update of the identifier should be newly generated, a predetermined processing time is required, and thus a change of a lower layer may be needed. Accordingly, as an example, in case that the message is received too late, that is, in case that reconfiguration of every item according to the update of the identifier cannot be completed within an activation time, the terminal B may determine that it is incapable of accepting the reconfiguration time. As another example, in case that the terminal B has a plurality of links to many other terminals at the same time, if there is an ongoing procedure with another terminal different from the terminal A requesting the update of the identifier, the terminal B may determine that reconfiguration of identifier and related items cannot be completed as requested within a suggested time.</p><p id="p-0357" num="0403">In case the link identifier update request message received from the terminal A includes the reconfiguration time information and the terminal B is capable of applying a new identifier at a corresponding time, the terminal B may include a reconfiguration time with a same value in the link identifier update response message or include an indication for confirming the reconfiguration time in the link identifier update response message.</p><p id="p-0358" num="0404">On the other hand, in case the link identifier update request message received from the terminal A includes the reconfiguration time information and the terminal B is incapable of applying a new identifier at a corresponding time, the terminal B may include information on a time, that is, a new reconfiguration time, in which it is capable of applying a changed context, in the link identifier update response message or may transmit a link identifier update reject message instead of the link identifier update response message. A cause value included in the link identifier update reject message may include information to the effect that a change is impossible in the reconfiguration time.</p><p id="p-0359" num="0405">After receiving the link identifier update response message from the terminal B, the terminal A may operate as follows. The terminal A checks the reconfiguration time included in the link identifier update response message and identify whether the reconfiguration time is identical with a value that the terminal A transmitted before through the link identifier update request message.</p><p id="p-0360" num="0406">In case the reconfiguration time included in the link identifier update response message is identical with the reconfiguration time included in the link identifier update request message, the terminal A may perform transmission and reception by using the layer-2 ID of the terminal A and the terminal B, which is in current use, until the reconfiguration time and may proceed transmission and reception by using a new layer-2 ID after the reconfiguration time.</p><p id="p-0361" num="0407">On the other hand, in case the reconfiguration time included in the link identifier update response message is different from the reconfiguration time included in the link identifier update request message and the terminal A is capable of supporting a reconfiguration time that is newly suggested by the terminal B, the terminal A may perform transmission and reception by using the layer-2 ID of the terminal A and the terminal B, which is in current use, until the reconfiguration time and may perform transmission and reception by using a new layer-2 ID of the terminal A and the terminal B after the reconfiguration time. In this case, additionally, the terminal A may transmit, to the terminal B, information that the terminal A accepts the reconfiguration time value that is suggested by the terminal B.</p><p id="p-0362" num="0408">The terminal A may receive the link identifier update reject message or other information from the terminal B. In this case, the terminal A may notify a new reconfiguration time to the terminal B by designating or transmitting a new reconfiguration time value or may cancel a link identifier update procedure.</p><p id="p-0363" num="0409">In addition, during the above-described procedure, the terminal A may drive a timer when transmitting the link identifier update request message. If the terminal A does not receive a link identifier update response message from the terminal B before the timer expires, the terminal A may determine failure of the link identifier update procedure. In this case, the terminal A may suspend the link identifier update procedure or may consider there is a problem in a unicast link with the terminal B. Accordingly, the terminal A may perform an operation of reestablishing a unicast link with the terminal B or perform an operation of releasing the unicast link with the terminal B.</p><p id="p-0364" num="0410">During the above-described procedure, each terminal may operate as follows at a time of changing to a new ID. For an ongoing HARQ process, each terminal may keep using an current ID and process a successfully received MAC PDU based on a context of a related link. In addition, for data received in relation to the ongoing HARQ process, each terminal may perform decoding by using a security parameter based on a previous ID. Then, for a new HARQ process, each terminal may use only a new ID and apply a new security parameter.</p><p id="p-0365" num="0411">According to the above-described operations, a terminal may prevent data loss that occurs in a process of changing a link identifier. In the process, a PC5-S entity for managing the link identifier may enable at least one of MAC, RLC and PDCP to be adequately reestablished by subsequently forwarding information to the PC5-RRC.</p><p id="p-0366" num="0412">According to an embodiment, a terminal may operate as follows.</p><p id="p-0367" num="0413">Terminals may perform connection establishment with other terminals according to a request of an application. A terminal (e.g., a terminal A) together with another terminal (e.g., a terminal B) may establish a bearer and may use the established bearer to transmit and/or receive data using a direct communication interface like PC5 interface between terminals. In the description below, a layer-2 ID of the terminal A is referred to as ID A1, a layer-2 ID of the terminal B is referred to as ID B1, and a PC5 link between the two terminals is referred to as a link K. Herein, a physical layer may process only data, which are received according to scheduling associated with a combination of A1 and B1, in the link K. For a purpose like privacy protection, the terminal may recognize that a change of the layer-2 ID is needed. Accordingly, the terminal A may start a process of changing the layer 2-ID.</p><p id="p-0368" num="0414">For this, the terminal A generates a link identifier update request message and transmits the link identifier update request message to the terminal B. Additionally, the terminal A may notify the ID A2 to a lower layer.</p><p id="p-0369" num="0415">When receiving the link identifier update request message, the terminal B generates a link identifier update response message and transmits the link identifier update response message to the terminal A. In the description below, a newly forwarded layer-2 ID of the terminal A is referred to as ID A2, and a newly forwarded layer-2 ID of the terminal B is referred to as ID B2. Herein, a PC5-S layer of the terminal B notifies a lower layer that the ID A2 and the ID B2 are to be added to context information of the link K. Next, a lower layer of the terminal B may recognize data received based on scheduling information associated with a combination of ID A1/B1 and A2/B2 as data associated with the link K and may process the data. As for transmitting the link identifier update response message, a lower layer of the terminal B may use A1/B1 or A2/B2 to transmit relevant scheduling information.</p><p id="p-0370" num="0416">The terminal A attempts reception in a PC5 interface by using an A1/B1 or A2/B1 combination. Thus, if the terminal A successfully receives the link identifier update response message transmitted by the terminal B, the terminal A notifies the ID B2, which is a new ID of the terminal B included in the link identifier update response message, to the lower layer. For processing data associated with a HARQ process associated with a combination of A1/B1 or A2/B1 during on-going HARQ processes, the lower layer, that received the ID B2, may keep using a scheduling combination of A1/B1 or A2/B1 until the HARQ process/buffer is flushed and may process the successfully received data in RLC/PDCP of a corresponding link K. In another case, that is, in case ID associated with receiving a subsequent new HARQ TB is not A2/B2, the lower layer, that received the ID B2, may not associate the HARQ TB with the link K anymore. In addition, for data blocks that are newly generated and transmitted after that, security based on a new key session ID and layer-2 ID may be applied. Then, after a predetermined time elapse, the A1/B1 may not be processed anymore, and the A1 and the B1 may be removed from a context of the link K.</p><p id="p-0371" num="0417">After transmitting the link identifier update response message, the terminal B attempts reception based on an A1/B1 or A2/B2 combination. In case data associated with the A2/B2 combination is received, the terminal B may determine that the link identifier update response message is successfully transmitted to the terminal A and may operate as follows. For a HARQ process associated with the A1/B1 combination during on-going HARQ processes, the terminal B continues to receive data based on A1/B1 until the HARQ process/buffer is flushed. In addition, the terminal B may process successfully received data in RLC/PDCP of a corresponding link K. In another case, that is, in case ID associated with subsequent transmission of a new HARQ TB is not A2/B2, the terminal B may not associate the HARQ TB with the link K anymore and remove A1 and B1 from the context of the link K. In addition, for data blocks that are newly transmitted after that, the terminal B may apply security based on a new key session ID and layer-2 ID and apply the new security to a newly received data block.</p><p id="p-0372" num="0418">According to the above-described operations, a terminal may prevent data loss that occurs in a process of changing a link identifier. In the above-described process, a PC5-S entity for managing a link identifier may operate to enable at least one layer of MAC, RLC and PDCP to be adequately reestablished by subsequently forwarding information to the PC5-RRC.</p><p id="p-0373" num="0419">In the above-described procedure, during a procedure where new security is applied according to a time of changing ID, each security key such as a key applied for ciphering and a key applied for integrity may be generated based on an ID of each terminal. Accordingly, since keys are different before and before an ID is changed, a transmitting terminal may add an identifier for indicating which key is used (e.g., a key ID), into a transmitted PDU.</p><p id="p-0374" num="0420">In this procedure, according to a change of a security key, for example, if a PDCP SN is initialized, a receiving terminal should manage an order of PDCP PDUs. The receiving terminal performs deciphering a received PDCP PDU using a security key set 1. Hereinafter, a key ID used herein is referred to as ID 1. Next, a layer-2 ID update operation is performed. In relation to a security context that is generated by the layer-2 ID update operation, a new key ID may be indicated in a PDCP PDU header. Hereinafter, the new key ID is referred to as ID 2.</p><p id="p-0375" num="0421">After receiving the link identifier update response message, the terminal A ciphers a newly generated PDCP PDU by using a new security context and transmits the PDCP PDU. In this process, the terminal A may change a key and a key ID and use consecutive values for SNs. Next, a PDCP layer of the terminal B confirms a key ID value associated with the received PDU. If the key ID of the received PDU is 1, the terminal B deciphers data using a previous security value. If the key ID of the received PDU is 2, the terminal B deciphers data using a new security value.</p><p id="p-0376" num="0422">At this time, in case a PDU received using ID 2 occurs, if an SN value of the PDU is a next SN value that the PDCP entity should receive, the terminal B processes the PDU and removes a security context associated with ID 1 from the PDCP entity. In case the SN value of the PDU is not the next SN value that the PDCP entity should receive and PDU is not received which has an SN value smaller than a confirmed SN value, the terminal B waits for the PDU until reordering is completed. In this process, a timer may be used to prevent the PDCP entity from waiting indefinitely. When the timer expires, a security context corresponding to ID 1 is not used anymore.</p><p id="p-0377" num="0423">Alternatively, in this process, the terminal A may additionally initialize an SN value, while applying security associated with ID 2 to a new PDU. Then, the terminal B performs a deciphering operation according to a key ID of a received PDU. At this time, after completely receiving data encrypted with ID 1, the terminal B may expect to receive data encrypted with the ID 2. However, due to characteristics of an operation of HARQ in an MAC layer, a reception order of PDUs may be different as expected. For example, a PDU #1 and a PDU #2 are encrypted with ID 1 and a PDU #3 is encrypted with ID 2, but PDUs may be received in an order of the PDU #1, the PDU #3 and the PDU #2.</p><p id="p-0378" num="0424">In case a key ID of a received PDU is the ID 2, the terminal B may store the received PDU using a separate reordering buffer. Alternatively, the terminal B may postpone processing the received PDU until reception of PDUs associated with the ID 1 is completed, that is, the terminal B may process the PDU associated with the ID 2 after a predetermined time elapses. Alternatively, the terminal B may finish a PDU reception operation associated with the ID 1. For example, the terminal B may not wait to receive a PDU associated with the ID 1 anymore or, even when a PDU associated with the ID 1 is received, the terminal B may remove the PDU and immediately start processing the PDU associated with the ID 2.</p><p id="p-0379" num="0425">In case a key ID of a received PDU is the ID 1, the terminal B may process the received PDU according to an existing operation and not process a PDU further received after a predetermined time. In this process, the terminal A may notify a last PDU using the ID 1, or the terminal A may use a PDCP control PDU and the like in order to stop processing the ID 1 and to indicate whether or not to process a PDU of ID 2. For example, the terminal A may notify a last SN number transmitted by using the ID 1. For example, in case the last SN number is 7, if the terminal B receives all PDUs with an SN of 7 by using the ID 1, the terminal B may immediately start processing PDUs received with the ID 2.</p><p id="p-0380" num="0426">According to another embodiment, while a terminal performs communication with another terminal by using a PC5 interface, in order to change an environment through synchronization, the terminal control the change through a physical control channel of sidelink. For example, by transmitting, by the terminal, and receiving, by the another terminal, a command in a physical channel that transmits an allocation schedule of resources in sidelink, the terminals may be synchronized with each other at the same time, for example, may apply a new identifier and a new security value.</p><p id="p-0381" num="0427"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> is a view illustrating an embodiment of a procedure of changing an identifier associated with a sidelink in a device applicable to the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> exemplifies an operation method of a first device that performs sidelink communication with a second device.</p><p id="p-0382" num="0428">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, at step S<b>2101</b>, the first device performs communication through a link established between the first device and the second device.

The information related to whether or not to accept the requested reconfiguration time may include an indicator informing of either yes or no or may be defined in a same form as the information related to the reconfiguration time included in the first message.</p><p id="p-0393" num="0439">At step S<b>2307</b>, the device identifies whether or not the reconfiguration times of the first message and the second message are identical with each other. In the information related to whether or not to accept the requested reconfiguration time is defined in a same form as the information related to the reconfiguration time included in the first message, whether or not the second device is to accept the reconfiguration time requested by the first device may be indicated depending on whether or not a value included in the first message and a value included in the second message are identical with each other. Accordingly, the first device checks whether or not the values are identical with each other. On the other hand, in case the information related to whether or not to accept the requested reconfiguration time is defined in a form of the indicator, this step S<b>2307</b> may be replaced by an operation by which the first device identifies whether or not the indicator is set as a positive value.</p><p id="p-0394" num="0440">If the reconfiguration times of the first message and the second message are not identical with each other, at step S<b>2309</b>, the first device determines whether or not the reconfiguration time included in the second message is acceptable. In other words, the first device determines whether or not the second ID is applicable at the reconfiguration time requested by the second device. For example, the device may determine whether to be capable to complete necessary processes until the requested reconfiguration time and to apply the new second ID by considering a desired time for reconfiguring an identifier and processing a subsequent operation and an ongoing procedure associated with another device, which is not the second device. Herein, if the reconfiguration time included in the second message is not acceptable, the first device finishes this procedure. Then, if necessary, the procedure for updating the identifier may be performed again.</p><p id="p-0395" num="0441">If the reconfiguration times of the first message and the second message are identical with each other, or if the reconfiguration time requested by the second device is acceptable even though the reconfiguration times are not identical, at step S<b>2311</b>, the first device uses the second ID from the reconfiguration time. In other words, the first device may process data associated with the link by using the first ID until the reconfiguration time and may process data associated with the link by using the second ID after the reconfiguration time.</p><p id="p-0396" num="0442"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> is a view illustrating an embodiment of a procedure of controlling a context of a link according to a state of a HARQ process in a device applicable to the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> exemplifies an operation method of a first device that performs sidelink communication with a second device.</p><p id="p-0397" num="0443">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, at step S<b>2401</b>, the first device performs a procedure for updating an identifier associated with a link from a first ID into a second ID. Herein, the first device may be one of a device requesting an update of a parameter or a device accepting the update. For this, the first device may transmit and/or receive, to/from the second device, at least one message for updating the parameter. Accordingly, the first device may process a data block (e.g., security application) associated with the second ID based on the second ID.</p><p id="p-0398" num="0444">At step S<b>2403</b>, the first device identifies whether or not a HARQ process associated with the first ID ends. That is, the first device identifies whether or not there is a HARQ process associated with an identifier value before update. The HARQ process may end when decoding of the data block is successful or a number of retransmissions exceeds a maximum number of retransmissions.</p><p id="p-0399" num="0445">If the HARQ process associated with the first ID ends, at step S<b>2405</b>, the first device removes the first ID from a context of the link. That is, since all the data associated with the first ID are processed, the first device removes information related to the first ID.</p><p id="p-0400" num="0446">Else the HARQ process associated with the first ID does not end, at step S<b>2407</b>, the first device identifies whether or not a data block associated with the first ID is received. That is, the first device identifies whether or not the data block associated with the first ID is received, while the HARQ process associated with the first ID is maintained.</p><p id="p-0401" num="0447">If the data block associated with the first ID is received, at step S<b>2409</b>, the first device processes the data block by using a protocol stack of the link. The first device may decode data based on the present HARQ process and, if decoding is successful, may process the decoded data by using a RCL layer and a PDCP layer of a corresponding link. Next, the first device returns to step S<b>2403</b>.</p><p id="p-0402" num="0448">As the examples of the proposal method described above may also be included in one of the implementation methods of the present disclosure, it is an obvious fact that they may be considered as a type of proposal methods.
