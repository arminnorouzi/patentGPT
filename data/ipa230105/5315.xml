For example, the manager of the access management system <b>100</b> may allow or restrict the entry of people to a space where people are concentrated in the same space, such as a restaurant or a school.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The access management system <b>100</b> may be implemented in an electronic manner. For example, the processes for implementing the access management system <b>100</b> may be provided in the form of a computer program or a mobile application, and the user terminal <b>130</b>, the management server <b>140</b>, and the guardian terminal <b>150</b> can run computer programs or mobile applications.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the access management system <b>100</b>, data and information can be traded through network.
