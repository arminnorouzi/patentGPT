The installation of this elevator takes place synchronously with the erection of the building, i.e. the usable lifting height of the internal construction elevator grows with the increasing height of the building or elevator shaft. Adapting the usable lifting height in this way means that construction specialists and construction material can be transported to the current uppermost part of the building during the construction progress and, moreover, such an elevator can be used as a passenger and freight elevator for floors already used as residential or business premises during the construction phase of the building. In order to be able to easily achieve an increasing usable lifting height of the elevator, the elevator car thereof is designed as a self-propelled elevator car that is moved up and down by a drive system that comprises a rack strand and a pinion that is attached to the elevator car and interacts with the rack strand. A guide system for the elevator car, the length of which guide system can be adapted to the current elevator shaft height, is installed along the elevator shaft, and the rack strand, which has a length that can also be adapted to the current elevator shaft height, is fixed to this guide system parallel to the guide direction thereof. The pinion interacting with the rack strand in order to drive the elevator car is fastened to the output shaft of a drive unit arranged on the elevator car. Energy is supplied to the drive unit via an electrical conductor line.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The internal construction elevator described in CN106006303 A, which has a backpack guide and rack drive, is not suitable as an elevator having a high travel speed. However, high travel speeds of for example at least 3 m/s are necessary for final elevator systems in buildings in which the building height justifies the installation of a construction phase elevator system, the usable lifting height of which can be adapted to an increasing height of the elevator shaft during the construction phase of the building.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to a first aspect of the invention, the problem addressed is that of providing a method of the type described at the outset, with the use of which the disadvantages of the internal construction elevator cited as prior art can be avoided. In particular, the method is intended to solve the problem that the travel speed that can be achieved by the internal construction elevator is not sufficient for being used for a normal passenger and goods elevator after completion of a tall building.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The problem is solved, according to the first aspect of the invention, by a method of the type described above, in which method, for the duration of the construction phase of the building, a construction phase elevator system is installed in the elevator shaft which becomes higher with the increasing height of the building, which system comprises a self-propelled construction phase elevator car, the usable lifting height of which can be adapted to an increasing elevator shaft height, wherein at least one guide rail strand is installed in order to guide the construction phase elevator car along its travel path in the elevator shaft, wherein, in order to drive the construction phase elevator car, a drive system is mounted which comprises a primary part attached to the construction phase elevator car and a secondary part attached along the travel path of the construction phase elevator car, wherein the guide rail strand and the secondary part of the drive system are gradually extended upwards during the construction phase in accordance with the increasing elevator shaft height, wherein the self-propelled construction phase elevator car is used both for transporting persons and/or material for the construction of the building and as a passenger and freight elevator for floors already used as residential or business premises during the construction phase of the building, and wherein, after the elevator shaft has reached its final height, a final elevator system is installed in the elevator shaft instead of the construction phase elevator system, which final elevator system is modified by comparison with the construction phase elevator system.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The advantages of the method according to the invention can be seen in particular in the fact that, during the construction phase, an elevator optimal for this phase is available, by means of which the already constructed floors may be reached without repeatedly lifting a movable machine room, in order to transport construction specialists, construction material and residents of already created lower floors, and also in the fact that, after the elevator shaft has reached its final height, a final elevator system that is particularly suitable for the building in terms of travel speed can be used. Possible modifications may consist, for example, in using a drive motor and/or associated speed regulating device having a higher power, changing transmission ratios in drive components or diameters of traction sheaves or friction wheels, installing elevator cars having a reduced weight or other dimensions and equipment, or integrating a counterweight into the final elevator system.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one of the possible embodiments of the method according to the invention according to the first aspect, a final elevator system is installed in the elevator shaft instead of the construction phase elevator system, in which final elevator system a drive system of an elevator car is modified by comparison with the drive system of the construction phase elevator car. By modifying the drive system of the elevator car of the final elevator system, at least the necessary high travel speed of the elevator car of the final elevator system can be achieved. Examples of possible modifications of the elevator system include increasing the drive power of the drive motor and the associated speed control device, changing transmission ratios of drive components, using a different type of drive, for example a type of drive not suitable for a self-propelled elevator car, etc.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a further possible embodiment of the method according to the invention according to the first aspect, the drive system of the elevator car of the final elevator system is based on a different operating principle to the drive system of the construction phase elevator car. Since the final elevator system and thus the associated drive system do not have to meet the requirement of being adaptable to an increasing building height, the use of a drive system based on a different operating principle makes it possible to optimally adapt the final elevator system to requirements concerning travel speed, transport efficiency and travel comfort. In the present context, the term &#x201c;operating principle&#x201d; refers to the manner of generating a force for lifting an elevator car and transmitting the force to the elevator car. Preferred drive systems having an operating principle different from that of the self-propelled construction phase elevator car are drives having flexible suspension means, such as wire cables or belts, which support and drive the elevator car of a final elevator system in various arrangement variants of the drive machine and suspension means. In general, however, it is possible to use all drive systems&#x2014;including, for example, electric linear motor drives, hydraulic drives, recirculating ball screw drives, etc.&#x2014;of which the operating principle differs from the operating principle of the drive system of the self-propelled construction phase elevator car and which are suitable for relatively large lifting heights and are able to generate sufficiently high travel speeds of the elevator car.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a further possible embodiment of the method according to the invention according to the first aspect, a final elevator car of the final elevator system is guided on the same at least one guide rail strand on which the construction phase elevator car was guided. This avoids the large amount of work, the high costs and, in particular, the long interruption period to elevator operation needed to replace at least one guide rail strand.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another possible embodiment of the method according to the invention according to the first aspect, the construction phase elevator car is used during the construction phase of the building both for transporting persons and/or material for the construction of the building and as a passenger and freight elevator for floors already used as residential or business premises during the construction phase of the building.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">This ensures that construction workers and building materials can be transported in the construction phase elevator car during almost the entire construction period of the building. Moreover, users of apartments or business premises occupied before the building has been completed can be transported between at least the floors associated with these rooms in compliance with the regulations, without having to interrupt operation for days on end when adjustments are made to the lifting height of the construction phase elevator car.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a further possible embodiment of the method according to the invention according to the first aspect, an assembly platform and/or a protective platform is/are temporarily installed above a current upper limit of the travel path of the construction phase elevator car, as a result of which, during the adaptation of the usable lifting height of the construction phase elevator car to an increasing elevator shaft height, the assembly platform and/or the protective platform can be lifted to a higher elevator shaft level by means of the self-propelled construction phase elevator car. This ensures that the at least one protective platform, which is relatively heavy and absolutely necessary as protection against falling objects, and optionally also an assembly platform can be lifted along the newly created elevator shaft and fixed in a new position with little effort in terms of working time and lifting devices.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a further possible embodiment of the method according to the invention according to the first aspect, the protective platform which can be lifted by means of the self-propelled construction phase elevator car is designed as an assembly platform, from which at least the at least one guide rail strand is extended upwards. The combination of protective platform and assembly platform results in cost savings in terms of their manufacturing. Moreover, the protective platform and the assembly platform can each be brought into and fixed in a new position in the elevator shaft, which new position is suitable for the assembly work to be carried out, in a single work step and without additional lifting equipment, by lifting by means of the self-propelled construction phase elevator car.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a further possible embodiment of the method according to the invention according to the first aspect, the primary part of the drive system assembled for driving the construction phase elevator car comprises a plurality of driven friction wheels, the construction phase elevator car being driven by an interaction of the driven friction wheels with the secondary part of the drive system that is attached along the travel path of the construction phase elevator car. The use of friction wheels as the primary part of a drive of a construction phase elevator car is advantageous because a corresponding secondary part extending along the entire travel path can be produced from simple and inexpensive elements, and because relatively high speeds can be realized by using friction wheel drives while keeping noise generation low.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a further possible embodiment of the method according to the invention according to the first aspect, the at least one guide rail strand is used as a secondary part of the drive system of the self-propelled construction phase elevator car. Using the guide rail strand, which is necessary for both the construction phase elevator car and the final elevator car, as the secondary part of the drive system means that very high costs for manufacturing and, in particular, for the installation and adjustment of such a secondary part extending over the entire elevator shaft height can be saved.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a further possible embodiment of the method according to the invention according to the first aspect, at least two driven friction wheels are pressed against each of two opposing guide surfaces of the at least one guide rail strand in order to drive the construction phase elevator car, the friction wheels that act on the same guide surface in each case being arranged spaced apart from another in the direction of the guide rail strand. By arranging at least four driven friction wheels acting on each guide rail strand in this way, the necessary high driving force for lifting at least the construction phase elevator car and the protective platform or the combination of protective platform and assembly platform can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a further possible embodiment of the method according to the invention according to the first aspect, at least one of the friction wheels is rotationally mounted at one end of a pivot lever which is pivotally mounted at its other end on a pivot axle fixed to the construction phase elevator car, the pivot axle of the pivot lever being arranged such that the center of the friction wheel lies below the center of the pivot axle when the friction wheel is placed or pressed against the guide surface of the guide rail strand associated therewith. Such an arrangement of the at least one friction wheel ensures that, when the construction phase elevator car is driven in an upward direction, a pressing force is automatically established between the friction wheel and the guide surface, which pressing force is approximately proportional to the driving force transmitted from the guide surface to the friction wheel. This avoids the friction wheels always having to be pressed hard enough to transmit a driving force necessary for the maximum total weight of the construction phase elevator car.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a further possible embodiment of the method according to the invention, the at least one friction wheel is pressed against a guide surface of a guide rail strand at any time with a minimum pressing force by the effect of a spring member, for example a helical compression spring. In combination with the described arrangement of the friction wheels, the minimum pressing force means that, as soon as the friction wheels start driving the construction phase elevator car in an upward direction, pressing forces between the friction wheels and the guide surfaces of the guide rail strand are automatically adjusted, which pressing forces are approximately proportional to the current total weight of the construction phase elevator car.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a further possible embodiment of the method according to the invention according to the first aspect, the at least one friction wheel is driven by an electric motor exclusively associated with this friction wheel or by a hydraulic motor exclusively associated with this friction wheel. A drive arrangement of this kind allows a very simple and compact drive configuration.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a further possible embodiment of the method according to the invention according to the first aspect, the at least one friction wheel and the electric motor associated therewith or the friction wheel and the associated hydraulic motor are arranged on the same axis. Such an arrangement of friction wheel and drive motor can further simplify the entire drive configuration.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a further possible embodiment of the method according to the invention according to the first aspect, in a drive system in which at least two driven friction wheels are pressed against each of two opposing guide surfaces of the at least one guide rail strand and each friction wheel and its associated electric motor are arranged on the same axis, the electric motors of the friction wheels acting on the one guide surface of a guide rail strand are arranged so as to be offset, with respect to the electric motors of the friction wheels acting on the other guide surface, by approximately one length of an electric motor in the axial direction of the friction wheels and electric motors. As a result of the electric motors, the diameters of which are substantially larger than the diameters of the friction wheels, being arranged so as to be offset from each other in the axial direction, the installation spaces of the electric motors of the friction wheels acting on the one guide surface of the guide rail strand do not overlap with the installation spaces of the electric motors of the friction wheels acting on the other guide surface of the guide rail strand, even if the friction wheels arranged on either side of the guide rail strand are positioned so that their mutual distances, measured in the direction of the guide rail strand, are not substantially larger than the diameters of the electric motors. The necessary height of the installation space for the drive system is minimized by this arrangement of the drive system, particularly when using drive electric motors having relatively large diameters.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a further possible embodiment of the method according to the invention according to the first aspect, at least one group of a plurality of friction wheels is driven by a single electric motor associated with the group or by a single hydraulic motor associated with the group, torque transmission to the friction wheels of the group being brought about by means of a mechanical gear. A drive concept of this kind can simplify the electrical or hydraulic part of the drive.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In another possible embodiment of the method according to the invention according to the first aspect, a sprocket gear, a belt gear, a toothed gear or a combination of such gears is used as mechanical gear for the torque transmission to the friction wheels. Gears of this kind make it possible to drive the friction wheels of a group of a plurality of friction wheels from a single drive motor.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In another possible embodiment of the method according to the invention according to the first aspect, each of the electric motors driving at least one friction wheel and/or an electric motor driving a hydraulic pump feeding at least one hydraulic motor driving at least one friction wheel is fed by at least one frequency converter controlled by a controller of the construction phase elevator system. A drive concept of this kind allows for perfect regulation of the travel speed of the construction phase elevator car.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a further possible embodiment of the method according to the invention according to the first aspect, a device for supplying power to the construction phase elevator car is installed, which power supply device comprises a conductor line installed along the elevator shaft, which conductor line is extended according to the increasing elevator shaft height during the construction phase. This enables a power supply to the construction phase elevator car that can be easily adjusted to the current elevator shaft height, which power supply can also transfer the electrical power necessary for lifting the construction phase elevator car and the protective platform, or optionally for lifting the construction phase elevator car and the combination of protective platform and assembly platform.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a further possible embodiment of the method according to the invention according to the first aspect, a holding brake acting between the construction phase elevator car and the at least one guide rail strand is activated during each standstill of the self-propelled construction phase elevator car of the construction phase elevator system, and, if there is at least one friction wheel, the torque transmitted from the associated drive motor to the at least one friction wheel in order to generate driving force is reduced to a minimum. An embodiment of this kind has the advantage that, during the standstill of the construction phase elevator car, the friction wheels do not have to apply the necessary vertical holding force. Therefore, they do not have to be pressed correspondingly hard against the guiding surfaces of the guide rail strand. In this way, the problem of the periphery of the friction linings being flattened during a standstill can be largely mitigated. Since, on account of the type of arrangement described above, each friction wheel is pressed against the guide surface approximately proportionally to the driving force transmitted between the wheel and the guide surface, it is necessary to at least reduce this driving force or the torque transmitted from the drive motor to the friction wheel.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In a further possible embodiment of the method according to the invention according to the first aspect, a primary part of an electric linear drive is used as the primary part of the drive system for driving the construction phase elevator car, and a secondary part of the electric linear drive that is fixed along the elevator shaft is used as the secondary part of the drive system. Such an embodiment of the method according to the invention has the advantage that the drive of the construction phase elevator car is contact-free and wear-free, and the traction capability of the drive cannot be impaired by dirt.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In another possible embodiment of the method according to the invention according to the first aspect, at least one electric motor or hydraulic motor that drives a pinion and is speed-controlled by means of a frequency converter is used as the primary part of the drive system in order to drive the construction phase elevator car, and at least one rack strand fixed along the elevator shaft is used as the secondary part of the drive system. Such an embodiment of the method according to the invention is advantageous in that, in the case of a rack-and-pinion drive, the driving force is transmitted in a form-fitting manner, and a holding brake on the construction phase elevator car is not necessarily required. In addition, relatively few driven pinions are required in order to transmit the entire driving force. By controlling the speed by means of a frequency inverter, during which the frequency inverter acts either on the electric motor driving at least one pinion or on an electric motor which controls the speed of a hydraulic pump feeding the hydraulic motor, the travel speed of the construction phase elevator car can be continuously regulated.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to a second aspect of the invention, the problem addressed is that of providing a method for centering an elevator car, in particular a method for centering the construction phase elevator car in the method for erecting a final elevator installation in an elevator shaft of a building according to the first aspect of the invention, as described above and below.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The problem is solved, according to the second aspect of the invention, by a method for centering an elevator car of an elevator installation, wherein the elevator installation comprises a self-propelled elevator car, a first guide rail strand for guiding the elevator car along its travel path in the elevator shaft, a second guide rail strand, and a drive system which has a primary part attached to the elevator car and a secondary part attached along the travel path, wherein the primary part of the drive system mounted to drive the elevator car comprises a plurality of driven friction wheels, wherein the elevator car is driven by an interaction of the driven friction wheels with the secondary part of the drive system that is attached along the travel path of the elevator car, wherein the first guide rail strand and the second guide rail strand are used as the secondary part of the drive system of the self-propelled elevator car, wherein at least two driven friction wheels are pressed against each of two opposing guide surfaces of the first guide rail strand and the second guide rail strand in order to drive the elevator car, wherein the first guide rail strand lies in a first plane, wherein

parallel with the first and second planes, wherein a first rotational speed of the friction wheels which act on the first guide rail strand and a second rotational speed of the friction wheels which act on the second guide rail strand can be adjusted independently of one another.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a further possible embodiment of the method according to the invention according to the second aspect, if a deviation of the center from the center plane is detected, the first rotational speed and/or the second rotational speed is changed such that, when the elevator car moves along the travel path, the center moves in the direction of the center planes.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a further possible embodiment of the method according to the invention according to the second aspect, the elevator car comprises at least two distance sensors, in particular in the form of an eddy current sensor and/or an optical triangulation sensor, a first distance sensor measuring a first

if the center of the elevator car deviates from the center planes.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a further possible embodiment of the method according to the invention according to the second aspect, the difference between the first rotational speed and the second rotational speed increases or decreases depending on a horizontal target speed which the elevator car is intended to have in the direction of the travel path.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In a further possible embodiment of the method according to the invention, the centering of the elevator car toward the center plane is supported by at least two passive guide rollers which are attached to the side of the car and each act on one of the two guide rail strands.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The method according to the second aspect of the invention is advantageous in that any skew of the car can be actively controlled by a controller and the load on the guide rails is thus reduced.

<b>1</b></figref> schematically shows a construction phase elevator system <b>3</b>.<b>1</b> which is installed in an elevator shaft <b>1</b> of a building <b>2</b> in its construction phase and comprises a construction phase elevator car <b>4</b>, the usable lifting height of which is gradually adapted to an increasing elevator shaft height. The construction phase elevator car <b>4</b> comprises a car frame <b>4</b>.<b>1</b> and a car body <b>4</b>.<b>2</b> mounted in the car frame. The car frame has car guide shoes <b>4</b>.<b>1</b>.<b>1</b>, via which the construction phase elevator car <b>4</b> is guided on guide rail strands <b>5</b>. These guide rail strands are extended upwards above the construction phase elevator car from time to time according to the construction progress and, after reaching a final elevator shaft height, are also used to guide a final elevator car (not shown) of a final elevator installation, which final elevator car replaces the construction phase elevator car <b>4</b>. The construction phase elevator car <b>4</b> is designed as a self-propelled elevator car and comprises a drive system <b>7</b> which is preferably installed inside the car frame <b>4</b>.<b>1</b>. The construction phase elevator car <b>4</b> can be equipped with different drive systems, these drive systems each comprising a primary part attached to the construction phase elevator car <b>4</b> and a secondary part attached along the travel path of the construction phase elevator car. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the primary part of the drive system <b>7</b> is shown schematically by a plurality of friction wheels <b>8</b> driven by drive motors (not shown), which friction wheels interact with the at least one guide rail strand <b>5</b> forming the secondary part in order to move the construction phase elevator car <b>4</b> up and down within its currently usable lifting height. The drive motors driving the friction wheels <b>8</b> can preferably be present in the form of electric motors or in the form of hydraulic motors. Electric motors are preferably fed by at least one frequency converter system in order to allow the speed of the electric motors to be regulated. This ensures that the travel speed of the construction phase elevator car <b>4</b> can be continuously regulated so that any travel speed between a minimum speed and a maximum speed can be selected. The minimum speed is used, for example, for selecting stop positions or for driving in a manually controlled manner in order to lift assembly aid devices by means of the construction phase elevator car, and the maximum speed is used, for example, for operating an elevator operation for construction workers and for users or residents of the already constructed floors. The speed of hydraulic motors can be correspondingly controlled either by feeding the motors by means of a hydraulic pump preferably installed on the construction phase elevator car <b>4</b>, the supply flow of which pump can be regulated electrohydraulically at a constant speed, or by feeding the motors by means of a hydraulic pump driven by an electric motor which can be speed-controlled by means of frequency conversion.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The drive motors of the drive system <b>7</b> of the construction phase elevator car <b>4</b> can be controlled optionally by a conventional elevator controller (not shown) or by means of a mobile manual controller <b>10</b> that preferably has wireless signal transmission.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The electric motors of the drive system of the construction phase elevator car <b>4</b> can be fed via a conductor line <b>11</b> guided along the elevator shaft <b>1</b>. In this case, a frequency inverter <b>13</b> arranged on the construction phase elevator car <b>4</b> can be supplied with alternating current via the conductor line <b>11</b> and corresponding sliding contacts <b>12</b>, the frequency converter feeding the electric motors driving the friction wheels <b>8</b> or at least one electric motor driving a hydraulic pump at a variable speed. Alternatively, a stationary AC-DC converter can feed direct current into such a conductor line, which direct current is tapped on the construction phase elevator car by means of the sliding contacts and supplied to the variable-speed electric motors of the drive system via at least one inverter having a controllable output frequency. If the friction wheels <b>8</b> are driven by hydraulic motors fed by a hydraulic pump having a supply flow that can be controlled at a constant speed, no frequency conversion is necessary.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In order to enable the aforementioned elevator operation for construction workers and floor users, the construction phase elevator car <b>4</b> is equipped with a car door system <b>4</b>.<b>2</b>.<b>1</b> controlled by the elevator controller, which car door system interacts with shaft doors <b>20</b> which are each installed prior to adapting the usable lifting height of the construction phase elevator car <b>4</b> along the additional travel range in elevator shaft <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the construction phase elevator system <b>3</b>.<b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an assembly platform <b>22</b> is arranged above the currently usable lifting height of the construction phase elevator car <b>4</b>, which assembly platform can be moved up and down along an upper portion of the elevator shaft <b>1</b>. From such an assembly platform <b>22</b>, the at least one guide rail strand <b>5</b> is extended above the currently usable lifting height of the construction phase elevator car <b>4</b>, it also being possible to assemble other elevator components in the elevator shaft <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">A first protective platform <b>25</b> is temporarily fixed in the uppermost region of the currently present elevator shaft <b>1</b>. This protective platform protects persons and devices in elevator shaft <b>1</b>, in particular in the aforementioned assembly platform <b>22</b>, from objects that could fall down during the construction work taking place on the building <b>2</b>. Moreover, the first protective platform <b>25</b> can be used as a supporting member for a lifting apparatus <b>24</b> by means of which the assembly platform <b>22</b> can be lifted or lowered. In the embodiment of the construction phase elevator system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the first protective platform <b>25</b> having the assembly platform <b>22</b> suspended thereon must be lifted from time to time by means of a construction crane to a higher level corresponding to the construction progress in the current uppermost region of the elevator shaft, where the first protective platform <b>25</b> is then temporarily fixed.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a second protective platform <b>23</b> which is temporarily fixed in the elevator shaft <b>1</b> below the assembly platform <b>22</b>, which second protective platform protects persons and devices in the elevator shaft <b>1</b> from objects falling from the assembly platform <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the construction phase elevator system <b>3</b>.<b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the self-propelled construction phase elevator car <b>4</b> and its drive system <b>7</b> are dimensioned such that at least the second protective platform <b>23</b> can be lifted by means of the self-propelled construction phase elevator car <b>4</b> in the elevator shaft <b>1</b> after the first protective platform <b>25</b> having the assembly platform <b>22</b> suspended therefrom has been lifted by the construction crane for the purpose of increasing the usable lifting height of the construction phase elevator car. For this purpose, the car frame <b>4</b>.<b>1</b> of the construction phase elevator car <b>4</b> is designed to have support members <b>4</b>.<b>1</b>.<b>2</b> which are preferably provided with damping members <b>4</b>.<b>1</b>.<b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In another possible embodiment of the construction phase elevator system <b>3</b>.<b>1</b>, both the second protective platform <b>23</b> and the assembly platform <b>22</b> can be lifted together by the construction phase elevator car <b>4</b> to a level desired for specific assembly work, where they are temporarily fixed in the elevator shaft <b>1</b> or temporarily held by the construction phase elevator car. Since in this case no lifting apparatus is present for lifting the assembly platform <b>22</b>, this embodiment assumes that the construction phase elevator car, in addition to its function of ensuring the elevator operation for construction workers and floor users, can be made available sufficiently frequently and for a sufficiently long time for lifting and, if necessary, holding the assembly platform <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a construction phase elevator system <b>3</b>.<b>2</b> which differs from the construction phase elevator system <b>3</b>.<b>1</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in that no construction crane is required to lift the first protective platform <b>25</b> and the assembly platform <b>22</b>. Before any increase in the lifting height of the construction phase elevator car <b>4</b>, the three components&#x2014;the first protective platform <b>25</b>, assembly platform <b>22</b> and second protective platform <b>23</b>&#x2014;are lifted with the aid of the self-propelled construction phase elevator car <b>4</b> equipped with a correspondingly powerful drive system, after which the first protective platform <b>25</b> is fixed again in a higher position above the current uppermost travel range of the construction phase elevator car. At least one distance member <b>26</b> is fixed between the assembly platform <b>22</b> and the first protective platform <b>25</b> in such a way that an intended distance is provided between the first protective platform <b>25</b> and the assembly platform <b>22</b> before the three components are lifted. The assembly platform <b>22</b>, which is used for extending the at least one guide rail strand <b>5</b> and for assembling further elevator components, and the second protective platform <b>23</b> can be moved, by means of the lifting apparatus <b>24</b>, in the portion of the elevator shaft <b>1</b> that lies within this distance after the three components have been lifted. Advantageously, the at least one distance member <b>26</b> is fastened at its lower end to the assembly platform <b>22</b>, and, when the assembly platform is moved by means of the lifting device <b>24</b> against the first protective platform <b>25</b>, the at least one distance member <b>26</b> can slide through at least one opening <b>27</b> in the first protective platform <b>25</b>, which opening is associated with the at least one distance member. Before lifting the three components again to increase the lifting height of the construction phase elevator car, the assembly platform <b>22</b> and the at least one distance member <b>26</b> are lowered by means of the lifting device <b>24</b> far enough that the upper end of the distance member is located just inside the opening <b>27</b> in the first protective platform <b>25</b>. Then, the upward sliding of the at least one distance member <b>26</b> through the first protective platform <b>25</b> is prevented by means of a blocking device, for example by means of a plug-in bolt <b>28</b>, so that, when the assembly platform <b>22</b> is lifted again by the self-propelled construction phase elevator car <b>4</b>, the first protective platform <b>25</b> is also lifted by the intended distance to the assembly platform <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> also shows that the second protective platform <b>23</b> and the assembly platform <b>22</b> can advantageously form a unit which can be lifted by means of the self-propelled construction phase elevator car <b>4</b>, by forming the second protective platform <b>23</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> into the assembly platform <b>22</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, from which assembly platform <b>22</b> at least the at least one guide rail strand <b>5</b> can be extended upward. However, such a combination of protective platform and assembly platform is not necessarily required.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> shows a construction phase elevator car <b>4</b> suitable for use in the method according to the invention in a side view, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> shows this construction phase elevator car in a front view. The construction phase elevator car <b>4</b> comprises a car frame <b>4</b>.<b>1</b> having car guide shoes <b>4</b>.<b>1</b>.<b>1</b> and a car body <b>4</b>.<b>2</b> mounted in the car frame, which car body is provided for accommodating passengers and objects. The car frame <b>4</b>.<b>1</b> and thus also the car body <b>4</b>.<b>2</b> are guided on guide rail strands <b>5</b> via car guide shoes <b>4</b>.<b>1</b>.<b>1</b>, which guide rail strands are preferably fastened to walls of the elevator shaft and, as explained above, form the secondary part of the drive system <b>7</b>.<b>1</b> of the construction phase elevator car <b>4</b> and are later used to guide the final elevator car of a final elevator installation.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The drive system <b>7</b>.<b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> comprises a plurality of driven friction wheels <b>8</b> which interact with the guide rail strands <b>5</b> in order to move the self-propelled construction phase elevator car <b>4</b> along an elevator shaft of a building in its construction phase. The friction wheels are each arranged within the car frame <b>4</b>.<b>1</b> of the construction phase elevator car <b>4</b> above and below the car body <b>4</b>.<b>2</b>, at least one friction wheel acting on each of the opposing guide surfaces <b>5</b>.<b>1</b> of the guide rail strands <b>5</b>. If sufficient room is available for the drive motors between the car body and the car frame, the friction wheels can also be attached to the side of the car body.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the embodiment of the drive system <b>7</b>.<b>1</b> shown here, each of the friction wheels <b>8</b> is driven by an associated electric motor <b>30</b>.<b>1</b>, each friction wheel and its associated electric motor preferably being arranged on the same axis (coaxially). Each of the friction wheels <b>8</b> is rotatably mounted on one end of a pivot lever <b>32</b> so as to be coaxial with the rotor of the associated electric motor <b>30</b>.<b>1</b>. The pivot lever <b>32</b> associated with each of the friction wheels is pivotally mounted at its other end on a pivot axle <b>33</b> fixed to the car frame <b>4</b>.<b>1</b> of the construction phase elevator car <b>4</b>, in such a way that the center of the friction wheel <b>8</b> lies below the axis line of the pivot axle <b>33</b> of the pivot lever <b>32</b> when the friction wheel <b>8</b> is pressed against its associated guide surface <b>5</b>.<b>1</b> of the at least one guide rail strand. The pivot lever <b>32</b> and friction wheel <b>8</b> are arranged in such a way that a straight line extending from the pivot axle <b>33</b> to the point of contact between the friction wheel <b>8</b> and guide surface <b>5</b>.<b>1</b> is preferably inclined at an angle of 15&#xb0; to 30&#xb0; relative to a normal to the guide surface <b>5</b>.<b>1</b>. The pivot lever <b>32</b> is loaded by a pretensioned compression spring <b>34</b> in such a way that the friction wheel <b>8</b> mounted at the end of the pivot lever is pressed with a minimum pressing force against the guide surface <b>5</b>.<b>1</b> associated therewith. The described arrangement of the friction wheels and the pivot levers ensures that, when the construction phase elevator car <b>4</b> is being driven in an upward direction, pressing forces are automatically generated between the friction wheels <b>8</b> and the associated guide surfaces <b>5</b>.<b>1</b> of the guide rail strand, which pressing forces are approximately proportional to the driving force transmitted from the guide surface to the friction wheel. This ensures that the friction wheels do not have to be continuously pressed as hard as would be necessary to lift the elevator car <b>4</b> loaded with maximum load and the other components discussed above. This considerably reduces the risk of the periphery of the plastics-coated friction wheels being flattened as a result of prolonged pressing at the maximum necessary pressing force.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">An additional measure for preventing the plastics friction linings of the friction wheels <b>8</b> from being flattened consists in the fact that, during each standstill of the construction phase elevator car <b>4</b>, the load on the friction wheels <b>8</b> is relieved by activating a holding brake <b>37</b> that acts between the construction phase elevator car and the elevator shaft, preferably between the construction phase elevator car and the at least one guide rail strand <b>5</b>, and the torque transmitted by the drive motors <b>30</b>.<b>1</b> to the friction wheels is at least reduced. A brake which is only used for this purpose or a controllable safety brake can be used as the holding brake.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In order to control the travel speed, the electric motors <b>30</b>.<b>1</b> are fed via a frequency converter <b>13</b> that is controlled by an elevator controller (not shown).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B</figref> and the detail X shown, the diameters of the electric motors <b>30</b>.<b>1</b> are substantially larger than the diameters of the friction wheels <b>8</b> driven by the electric motors. This is necessary so that the electric motors can generate sufficiently high torques for driving the friction wheels. In order to provide sufficient installation space for the electric motors <b>30</b>.<b>1</b> arranged on both sides of the guide rail strand <b>5</b>, relatively large vertical spaces between the individual friction wheel arrangements are required. As a result, the installation spaces for the drive system <b>7</b>.<b>1</b> and thus the entire car frame <b>4</b>.<b>1</b> become correspondingly high.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> show a self-propelled construction phase elevator car <b>4</b> which is very similar in function and appearance to the construction phase elevator car shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>. A drive system <b>7</b>.<b>2</b> having driven friction wheels <b>8</b> is shown, which system allows the use of electric motors, the diameters of which correspond, for example, to three to four times the friction wheel diameter without their vertical spacing from one another having to be greater than the motor diameters. The height of the installation spaces for the drive system <b>7</b>.<b>2</b> can thus be minimized. This is achieved by the electric motors <b>30</b>.<b>2</b> of the friction wheels <b>8</b> that act on one guide surface <b>5</b>.<b>1</b> of a guide rail strand <b>5</b> being arranged so as to be offset by approximately one motor length in the axial direction of the electric motors relative to the electric motors of the friction wheels acting on the other guide surface <b>5</b>.<b>1</b>. Although the spacing between two electric motors of this kind is smaller than their diameter, this measure prevents the installation spaces of these electric motors from overlapping. This is particularly clear from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, which also shows that the electric motors <b>30</b>.<b>2</b> are preferably relatively short in design and have relatively large diameters. With large motor diameters, the necessary drive torques for the friction wheels <b>8</b> are easier to generate.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> show a self-propelled construction phase elevator car <b>4</b> which is very similar in function and appearance to the construction phase elevator cars shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B and <b>4</b>A, <b>4</b>B</figref>. The height of the installation spaces for the drive system <b>7</b>.<b>3</b> and thus the overall height of the construction phase elevator car is, however, reduced in this embodiment by using smaller drive motors for the friction wheels <b>8</b>. The vertical distances between the individual friction wheel arrangements are in this case no longer determined by the installation spaces for the drive motors. This is achieved by the use of hydraulic motors <b>30</b>.<b>3</b> instead of electric motors for driving the friction wheels <b>8</b>. In relation to the total motor volume, hydraulic motors are capable of generating significantly higher torques than electric motors. Hydraulic motors can therefore also be used to drive friction wheels having larger diameters, which allow a higher pressing force to be applied and can therefore transmit a higher traction force.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Hydraulic drives require at least one hydraulic power unit <b>36</b>, which preferably comprises an electrically driven hydraulic pump.
