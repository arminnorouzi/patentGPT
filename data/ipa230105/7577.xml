These purposes include, for example, reconnaissance, mapping, delivery, communications, and purely recreational purposes. As the number of use cases for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has increased, so too has the type and robustness of UAV communications systems increased. Because of their relatively lower flight altitudes (in many cases), some UAVs may include a modem and antenna that enable the UAV's communications system to connect to a cellular radio access network. A UAV connected to a cellular radio access network may, for example, download reconnaissance photos or sensed parameters (e.g., weather information); provide streaming video of what the UAV sees; provide diagnostic information to a remote server or device; report the UAV's location; or receive an updated flight plan or other control information.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some of the signals or information that a UAV may transmit or receive may be time-sensitive or include large payloads. As a result, it may be desirable to maintain a high reliability for the UAV's connection to a cellular radio access network. Systems, methods, devices, and apparatus that can be used to achieve or maintain the reliability, quality, continuity, or other aspects of a UAV's connection(s) to a cellular radio access network are therefore useful.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts, in simplified form, that are further described in other sections. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Described herein are unique systems, methods, devices, and apparatus that enable an aerial vehicle to communicate with a cellular radio access network. In some embodiments, the systems, methods, devices, and apparatus may employ a distance-based serving cell selection process instead of the typical signal strength-based serving cell selection process. In accord with a distance-based serving cell selection process, an aerial vehicle may issue a query for cells of a cellular radio access network (or issue a query for locations of cells of the cellular radio access network), which cells (or cell locations) are in the vicinity of the aerial vehicle. The aerial vehicle may then determine which of the cells (or cell locations) is nearest to its current location (e.g., by line of sight distance); operate an antenna steering mechanism (e.g., a motor) to direct an antenna lobe or beam of a directional antenna toward the location of the nearest cell; and establish communications with the cellular radio access network, using the nearest cell as a serving cell.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">More specifically, an aerial vehicle is described herein. The aerial vehicle may include a frame, a directional antenna, a modem, a motor, and a processor. The modem may be configured to communicate with a cellular radio access network using the directional antenna. The motor may be attached to the directional antenna and the frame. The processor may be configured to determine a current location of the aerial vehicle; determine, in response to the current location, a location of a nearest cell of the cellular radio access network; and operate the motor to move the directional antenna with respect to the frame and direct an antenna lobe or beam of the directional antenna toward the location of the nearest cell.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Also disclosed is a UAV. The UAV may include an antenna, a modem, and a processor. The modem may be configured to communicate with a cellular radio access network using the antenna. The processor may be configured to determine that a set of one or more conditions is met and, at least partly in response to determining the set of one or more conditions is met, switch from using a signal-based serving cell selection process for the cellular radio access network to a distance-based serving cell selection process for the cellular radio access network.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Also disclosed is a method of communicating between an aerial vehicle and a cellular radio access network. The method may include determining a current location of the aerial vehicle; determining, in response to the current location, a location of a nearest cell of the cellular radio access network; and processing communications between the aerial vehicle and the cellular radio access network, using the nearest cell as a serving cell.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The disclosure will be readily understood by the following detailed description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate like structural elements.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example aerial vehicle;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example block diagram of systems that may be included in an aerial vehicle;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an example block diagram of a communications system that may be included in an aerial vehicle;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> show an example flight path for an aerial vehicle; and</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>10</b></figref> show various example methods that may be used for communications between an aerial vehicle and a cellular radio access network.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The use of cross-hatching or shading in the accompanying figures is generally provided to clarify the boundaries between adjacent elements and also to facilitate legibility of the figures.

It should be understood that the following description is not intended to limit the embodiments to one preferred embodiment. To the contrary, it is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as can be included within the spirit and scope of the described embodiments as defined by the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">When an aerial vehicle such as a drone is at altitude, and the aerial vehicle tries to connect to a cellular radio access network, the aerial vehicle may receive strong signals from multiple cells of the cellular radio access network, and the cell that provides the aerial vehicle with the strongest signal may change frequently. This can result in &#x201c;ping-ponging&#x201d; of the aerial vehicle's communications (i.e., frequent handovers of the aerial vehicle's communications, from one serving cell to another). Ping-ponging at a high rate can lead to deterioration in service reliability (e.g., deterioration in service quality and/or continuity). To lessen the chance of ping-ponging, an aerial vehicle may employ a distance-based serving cell selection process instead of the typical signal strength-based serving cell selection process.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In accord with a distance-based serving cell selection process, an aerial vehicle may issue a query for cells of a cellular radio access network (or issue a query for locations of cells of the cellular radio access network), which cells (or cell locations) are in the vicinity of the aerial vehicle. In some cases, the query may be transmitted to a remote server or device (e.g., a server or device that the aerial vehicle accesses via a current serving cell of the cellular radio access network. In other cases, the query may be executed locally, within a memory of the aerial vehicle. The query may include a current location of the aerial vehicle, and the current location may be used to filter a superset of cells managed by one or more mobile network operators (MNOs), so that a subset of the cells (or locations of the cells) may be returned or retrieved. From the returned or retrieved subset of cells, the aerial vehicle may determine which of the cells (or cell locations) is nearest to its current location (e.g., by line of sight distance). The aerial vehicle may then operate an antenna steering mechanism (e.g., a motor) to direct an antenna lobe or beam of a directional antenna toward the location of the nearest cell. This can reduce or eliminate interference from other cells; allow the aerial vehicle to establish communications with the nearest cell of the cellular radio access network, using the nearest cell as a serving cell; and reduce ping-ponging of the aerial vehicle's communications between serving cells.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The determination of the nearest cell and/or the aerial vehicle's current location may be made with more or less assistance from (and in some cases entirely by) one or more remote servers or devices connected to the cellular radio access network, or one or more servers or devices of a mobile network operator's core network.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example aerial vehicle <b>100</b>.

In some embodiments, the aerial vehicle <b>400</b> and/or a cellular radio access network may determine various parameters related to the aerial vehicle's ability to communicate with each cell <b>404</b> in a set of possible serving cells for the aerial vehicle <b>400</b>. The determined parameter(s) may include, for example, determinations of signal strength, signal power, and/or signal quality. For example, the aerial vehicle <b>400</b> and/or each cell <b>404</b> capable of communicating with the aerial vehicle <b>400</b> may determine parameters such as a received signal strength indicator (RSSI), a reference signal received power (RSRP), or a reference signal received quality (RSRQ).

As the aerial vehicle <b>400</b> moves along its flight path <b>402</b>, the optimum serving cell for the aerial vehicle <b>400</b> may change, and communications between the aerial vehicle <b>400</b> and the cellular radio access network may be handed over from one cell <b>404</b> to another. In some cases, the handovers may be initiated much the same as they would be for a mobile communications device (e.g., a user equipment (UE)) used in a car or on a train.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">A problem with communications between an aerial vehicle and a cellular radio access network, however, is that an aerial vehicle flying at a reasonably high altitude can often receive strong signals (e.g., signals having high RSSI, RSRP, and/or RSRQ parameters) from multiple cells; the determined parameters for the signals (e.g., signal strengths) can be very close; and small fluctuations in the aerial vehicle's yaw, pitch, roll, heading, altitude, velocity, temperature; or changes in weather conditions; or fluctuations in power and so on of the cellular radio access network (and particular, its cells) can cause frequent changes in parameters such as RSSI, RSRP, and RSRQ parameters, leading to frequent handovers of the aerial vehicle's communications. In some cases, the aerial vehicle's serving cell may ping-pong (e.g., the aerial vehicle's cellular radio access network connection may be frequently handed over, from one cell to another cell), even though the aerial vehicle has not traveled sufficiently far to warrant a change in its serving cell. Such frequent handovers can greatly interfere with the aerial vehicle's ground-to-air (or equivalently, air-to-ground) communications.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">To reduce the likelihood of frequent and possibly disruptive changes in an aerial vehicle's serving cell, an aerial vehicle's serving cell may be selected using a distance-based serving cell selection process instead of a more conventional signal-based serving cell selection process. Under a signal-based serving cell selection process, a serving cell may be selected in response to signal parameters such as RSSI, RSSP, and/or RSRQ. Under a distance-based serving cell selection process, a cell that is nearest to the aerial vehicle (e.g., by line of sight distance) may be selected as the aerial vehicle's serving cell. In some cases, a distance-based serving cell selection may be made by a processing system on-board the aerial vehicle, using information obtained by the on-board processing system. In other cases, a distance-based serving cell selection may be made by a remote processing system, such as a processing system of a cellular radio access network, or by a processing system of a server or other device of a core network to which the cellular radio access network connects, using information obtained by the remote processing system.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A distance-based serving cell selection may be made at periodic intervals (e.g., at predetermined times), or in response to a distance traveled by the aerial vehicle (e.g., at predetermined distance intervals). A distance-based serving cell selection may additionally or alternatively be made at other times, upon the satisfaction of one or more other conditions, or upon the occurrence of one or more events.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some cases, an aerial vehicle may be configured to communicate with multiple serving cells contemporaneously.
