More particularly, this invention relates to a method of applying grout to the leg of an offshore structure. More specifically, although not exclusively, this invention relates to a method of fixing an offshore structure to a pre-piled foundation pile.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Offshore structures, commonly present in both the offshore wind and offshore oil and gas industries, most often include a structural jacket supporting a payload above the surface of the water. In the offshore wind industry, the payload is a wind turbine, and in the offshore oil and gas industry, the payload tends to be a processing and/or accommodation platform.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The structural jacket is secured to the seabed via one or more foundation piles, which often take the form of hollow tubes piled into the seabed. In order to secure the structural jacket to the foundation piles, and therefore the seabed, a cementitious material commonly known as grout is applied to the foundation. The grout is applied such that the interface between each foundation pile and respective leg of the jacket is filled. The grout is subsequently left to cure. Conventionally, the grout is applied from a pump unit on the surface via a pipe or hose.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to an aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for fixing an offshore structure to a pre-piled foundation pile, wherein the foundation pile comprises a tube piled into the sea floor and the offshore structure comprises a leg inserted into the foundation pile, wherein the method comprises applying grout to a first region between an end portion of the leg and the sea floor within the foundation pile, allowing the grout to at least partially cure, and then applying grout to a second region, wherein the second region is an annular region between the leg and the foundation pile.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The end portion of the leg may be commonly referred to as a stab-in or a stab-in portion of the leg.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The offshore structure may be configured to support a payload above the surface of water. The payload may be mounted to the offshore structure, e.g. a jacket thereof, after grouting has been completed. The payload may be or may comprise a wind turbine or oil and gas platform.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present method may be particularly advantageous in the case that the payload is a wind turbine. In such a case, there may be cyclical side loading applied to the offshore structure, e.g. due to wind and/or operation of the wind turbine. The structural integrity of the foundation, as a result of the present invention, may provide a more reliable structure when subject to such side loading.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The leg or stab-in may be inserted into an open end of the foundation pile.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The offshore structure may comprise a plurality of foundation piles and the jacket may comprise a plurality of corresponding legs. Each leg may be inserted into an open end of a respective foundation pile.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The method may comprise applying the grout to the first regions of all of the plurality of foundation piles prior to applying the grout to the second regions of the plurality of foundation piles.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The grout applied to the first region may be left to cure, e.g. to a predetermined degree, before applying the grout to the second region. The grout applied to the first region may be left to cure until firm or hard, or substantially firm or hard, before applying the grout to the second region. The grout applied to the first region may be left to cure until it reaches its final set before applying the grout to the second region.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The grout applied to the region between an end portion of the leg and the sea floor may be or comprise a first grout. The grout applied to the annular region between a leg and a foundation pile may be or comprise a second grout. The first grout may be different to the second grout. That is, the first grout may have a different composition to the second grout. The first grout may be left to cure, e.g. to a predetermined degree, before applying the second grout.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The first grout may be left to cure for a predetermined period of time before the second grout is applied. The predetermined period of time may be determined based on the volume of the first grout applied and/or a water temperature at the foundation pile.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The method may comprise testing the grout applied to the first region (i.e. the first grout), e.g. to determine whether it has cured. The method may comprise testing the grout applied to the first region (i.e. the first grout) before applying the grout to the second region (i.e. the second grout).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The grout or second grout may be applied to the second region until it fills or overflows the second region.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Filling or overflow of grout from the second region may be determined acoustically and/or visually. Filling or overflow of grout from the second region may be determined using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). Filling or overflow of grout from the second region may be determined using a density gauge or density meter, e.g. an ultrasonic density gauge or meter or nuclear density gauge or meter.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The method may comprise applying grout to the first region via a first conduit extending through or along the leg, e.g. from a surface location such as a vessel. The first conduit may have a first outlet at or towards the bottom of the respective leg. The grout may be applied to the second region via a second conduit extending through or along the leg, e.g. from the surface location. The second conduit may have a second outlet on or towards the side of the respective leg.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The second outlet may be above the first outlet. The second outlet may be spaced from the first outlet. The second outlet may be further spaced from the sea floor than the first outlet when the leg is located in the foundation pile. The second outlet may be rotationally offset from the first outlet.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Grout may be applied to the first region via a conduit extending from a surface location. The conduit may be positioned such that an outlet of the conduit is at a first position on, or proximate to, the sea floor within the foundation pile. Grout may be subsequently applied to the second region by raising the conduit such that the outlet is at a second position, further spaced from the sea floor than the first position.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The conduit may comprise a rigid tube having a first open end for receipt of grout, a sidewall and an outlet. The outlet may be disposed in the sidewall. The rigid may comprise a second end, e.g. opposite the first end. The second end may be a closed end. The outlet may be disposed in the sidewall proximate to the closed end.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The conduit is preferably separate from the offshore structure and the foundation pile. For example, the conduit may be carried onboard, and deployed from, a seagoing vessel, e.g. a supply ship.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The method may comprise preparing grout (i.e. second grout) to be applied to the second region, after applying grout (i.e. first grout) to the first region. That is, the method may comprise preparing the second grout after applying the first grout, e.g. to the first region. The method may comprise preparing the second grout after allowing the first grout to cure, e.g. to a predetermined degree.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The composition of the grout may be prepared in dependence on water temperature on the day of application.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The composition of the first grout and/or second grout may be prepared in dependence on water temperature on the day of application.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Within the scope of this application it is expressly intended that the various aspects, embodiments, examples and alternatives set out in the preceding paragraphs, in the claims and/or in the following description and drawings, and in particular the individual features thereof, may be taken independently or in any combination.

In different examples, the payload (not shown) may be a wind turbine or an oil and gas platform. The offshore structure <b>1</b> includes a jacket <b>2</b> having three legs <b>3</b>. In this example, the legs <b>3</b> are interconnected by cross-members <b>4</b>. Each leg <b>3</b> has a main body <b>3</b><i>a </i>and stab-in portion <b>3</b><i>b </i>(shown more clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in particular). Each of the main body <b>3</b><i>a </i>and stab-in portion <b>3</b><i>b </i>are hollow steel tubes in this example. In other examples, the main body <b>3</b><i>a </i>and stab-in portion <b>3</b><i>b </i>of each leg <b>3</b> may comprise a different material and construction. In this example the offshore structure <b>1</b> has three legs <b>3</b>, but it will be appreciated that the offshore structure <b>1</b> may have any number of legs <b>3</b>, including four legs <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The offshore structure <b>1</b> is secured to the seabed by fixing it to the foundation piles <b>5</b>, which are hollow steel tubes pre-piled into the seabed in this example. The stab-in portion <b>3</b><i>b </i>of each leg <b>3</b> is received within an open end <b>50</b> of a respective foundation pile <b>5</b>. A cementitious material, in the form of grout, is used to at least substantially fill the remaining region or volume between the stab-in portion <b>3</b><i>b </i>and foundation pile <b>5</b> (made up of regions A and B, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> to <b>6</b></figref>, in particular), and thereby fix the jacket <b>2</b> to the foundation pile <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> there is shown the interface between a jacket <b>2</b> and a foundation pile <b>5</b> with the stab-in portion <b>3</b><i>b </i>inserted into the foundation pile <b>5</b>. Located between the main body <b>3</b><i>a </i>and stab-in portion <b>3</b><i>b </i>on each leg is a flange <b>30</b><i>a</i>. The flange <b>30</b><i>a </i>is radially extending. When a respective stab-in portion <b>3</b><i>b </i>is located within a respective foundation pile <b>5</b>, the flange <b>30</b><i>a </i>braces against the rim at the open end <b>50</b> of the foundation pile <b>5</b>. The position of the flange <b>30</b><i>a </i>on the leg <b>3</b> defines the amount of the leg <b>3</b>, in particular the stab-in portion <b>3</b><i>b</i>, that is inserted into the foundation pile <b>5</b>.
