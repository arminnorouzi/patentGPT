The electric vehicle uses a battery module in which a plurality of rechargeable cells are formed as one pack as a main power source, and thus no exhaust gas is generated and noise is very low.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such an electric vehicle is driven by a driving motor which operates through electric power supplied from the battery module. In addition, the electric vehicle includes electrical components for controlling and managing the driving motor as well as a plurality of electronic convenience devices and charging the battery module.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Since a large amount of heat is generated in the battery module as well as the electrical components including the driving motor used as a primary power source of the electric vehicle, efficient cooling is required, so efficient temperature management of the electrical components and the battery module may be a very important problem.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Conventionally, separate cooling systems are applied to adjust the temperature of the electrical components and the battery module, but it is necessary to increase capacity of the cooling system according thereto, which leads to space restrictions. Further, when the capacity of the cooling systems is increased, power required for operating the cooling systems is also increased.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, technologies are being developed for efficiently using waste heat generated from the electrical components, as well as adjusting the temperature of the electrical components and the battery in order to maximize the energy efficiency while securing the durability of the electrical components and the battery module in the electric vehicle.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">On the other hand, recently, high-performance electric vehicles capable of track driving are being developed, and in the track driving that requires higher performance compared with general driving and in which a lot of load is generated, temperature changes of electrical components and battery modules may rapidly occur.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, in the electric vehicle capable of track driving, there is a demand for technology development for controlling the temperature of the electrical components and the battery modules during the track driving and for optimizing the track driving.</p><p id="p-0011"
