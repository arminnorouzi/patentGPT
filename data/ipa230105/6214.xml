In this way, during discharging of the battery, lithium metal ions are deintercalated from the negative electrode and intercalated into a positive electrode material without changing the shape of the carbon framework, and therefore, without reducing the volume of the negative electrode plate. During charging of the battery, the lithium metal ions are deintercalated from a positive electrode and deposited onto the negative electrode plate, and the lithium ions can be stored in pores of the carbon framework to maintain a stable volume of the negative electrode plate. In addition, the carbon framework can disperse a current and reduce a current density at a local region, thereby improving a deposition morphology, reducing lithium dendrites, increasing a lithium deposition density, and in turn, improving the performance of lithium-ion battery.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, a binding energy of the carbon material that binds with lithium is as high as approximately&#x2014;1 eV.

Further, due to the uneven deposition of the lithium metal, the volume of the negative electrode plate changes greatly during cycles, so that the energy density of the lithium-ion battery manufactured based on the existing carbon-framework negative electrode plate remains to be improved.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An objective of this application is to provide a negative electrode plate, a method for preparing same, a battery containing same, and an electronic device to improve deposition uniformity of lithium metal.

All other technical solutions derived by a person of ordinary skill in the art based on the embodiments of this application without making any creative effort fall within the protection scope of this application.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0034">In an existing lithium-ion battery, a negative electrode plate is made of a material such as graphite. During charging, lithium ions are intercalated into and exist in a graphite layer structure. The graphite layer is similar to a framework structure, and provides a storage space for lithium. However, no such framework structure exists in a lithium-ion battery containing a pure lithium metal electrode. Therefore, in a charge-and-discharge process, the volume of the negative electrode plate changes violently. Generally, the thickness of the negative electrode plate changes in a range of 8 to 200 &#x3bc;m, resulting in a decline of the cycle performance of the battery. In addition, during charging, lithium is deposited on a surface of a current collector of the negative electrode plate. Due to non-uniformity of a current density and a concentration of lithium ions in the electrolytic solution, lithium ions are deposited on some sites at an unusually high speed during deposition. Such lithium ions grow out of the lithium metal body in a form similar to synapses, and keep growing or even branch off to eventually form sharp lithium dendrites. The existence of the lithium dendrites decreases the deposition density greatly, thereby decreasing the energy density of the battery greatly. For example, in some lithium-ion batteries, an actual deposition density of the lithium metal is approximately 0.2 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, much less than 0.534 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>that is a true density of the lithium metal. Due to loose deposition of the lithium metal, the energy density of the battery decreases by at least 100 Wh/L. In addition, the lithium dendrites are prone to pierce the separator to cause a short circuit and lead to battery failure, thereby impairing battery safety.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0035">In view of this, this application provides a negative electrode plate. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a top view of a negative electrode plate according to an implementation solution of this application, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a sectional view of a negative electrode plate according to an implementation solution of this application. The negative electrode plate includes a current collector <b>1</b> and an active layer <b>2</b>. The active layer <b>2</b> includes a porous carbon framework <b>3</b> and includes silicon nanoparticles <b>4</b> and lithium metal <b>5</b> that are located in the porous carbon framework <b>3</b>. Understandably, the silicon nanoparticles <b>4</b> and the lithium metal <b>5</b> may be discretely distributed in the porous carbon framework <b>3</b>, or may be continuously distributed in the porous carbon framework <b>3</b>. This application does not exclude the possibility that a small part of silicon nanoparticles <b>4</b> and lithium metal <b>5</b> are located on the surface of the porous carbon framework.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0036">In an implementation solution of this application, the active layer <b>2</b> may be formed of a porous carbon framework <b>3</b>, silicon nanoparticles <b>4</b>, and lithium metal <b>5</b>. The porous carbon framework <b>3</b> may be a film structure with a large number of pores. The pores in the porous carbon framework <b>3</b> may be micropores, or holes in other shapes. In addition, the porous carbon framework <b>3</b> possesses sufficient strength. For example, the strength of the porous carbon framework <b>3</b> is not lower than 200 GPa, so as to maintain a stable morphology and internal space. During charging, the porous carbon framework <b>3</b> can provide a stable space, so that the lithium metal is disposed in a large number of pores of the porous carbon framework <b>3</b>. During discharging, when the lithium on the negative electrode keeps decreasing, the porous carbon framework <b>3</b> can form a stable structure and internal space to prevent the negative electrode from shrinking violently. On the other hand, the porous carbon framework <b>3</b> is a carbon-based material, and is high ionic and electronic conductivity, and therefore, can provide conductive channel. Further, the porous carbon framework <b>3</b> possesses a high specific surface area, and therefore, can effectively disperse the current in charge-and-discharge processes, reduce the current density, and form a more uniform electric field, thereby improving the uniformity of lithium deposition and suppressing the growth of lithium dendrites.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0037">However, through research, the inventor finds that the effect of the porous carbon framework <b>3</b> can be maximized only if the lithium metal deposition positions are effectively controlled. If the lithium metal is deposited on the surface of the negative electrode plate, the volume of the negative electrode plate still changes violently during cycles, so that the effect of the porous carbon framework <b>3</b> can hardly be exerted.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0038">Therefore, the active layer according to this application further includes silicon nanoparticles <b>4</b>. The silicon nanoparticles are located in the porous carbon framework <b>3</b>. The silicon nanoparticles <b>4</b> can spontaneously alloy with the lithium metal at an alloying potential of up to approximately 0.2 V, so as to provide sites required for lithium metal deposition, and in turn, effectively regulate the lithium metal deposition positions. In this way, the lithium metal is preferentially deposited in the pores of the porous carbon framework <b>3</b> rather than on the surface of the negative electrode plate during cycles.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0039">The active layer according to this application may further include pre-supplement lithium metal <b>5</b>. Understandably, the lithium metal <b>5</b> is a negative active material. The lithium metal possesses a higher specific capacity than materials such as carbon and silicon. The specific capacity of the lithium metal is 3860 mAh/g, the specific capacity of silicon is 3600 mAh/g, but the specific capacity of carbon is merely 372 mAh/g. Therefore, the battery containing such a negative electrode plate possesses a higher energy density. Understandably, the lithium metal <b>5</b> may be a supplement added beforehand during preparation of the negative electrode plate, or may be all transferred from the positive electrode, or, may derive from both the pre-supplement and the transfer from the positive electrode.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0040">In an implementation solution of this application, the silicon nanoparticles <b>4</b> may be attached into the porous carbon framework <b>3</b>, and the lithium metal <b>5</b> may fill in the porous carbon framework <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0041">In an implementation solution of this application, a volume sum of the porous carbon framework and the silicon nanoparticles accounts for 10% to 60% of a total volume of the active layer. By controlling the sum of the volume percent of the porous carbon framework and the silicon nanoparticles to fall within the foregoing range, the lithium-ion battery manufactured by using the negative electrode plate is rechargeable for more cycles at a lower volume expansion rate.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0042">In an implementation solution of this application, the ratio of the total volume of the porous carbon framework to the total volume of the silicon nanoparticles may be 5:1 to 100:1. That is, in the active layer <b>2</b>, the ratio of the total volume of the porous carbon framework to the total volume of the silicon nanoparticles is 5:1 to 100:1. When a volume percent of the silicon nanoparticles in the active layer is low, the guiding effect of the silicon nanoparticles on the lithium metal deposition is insufficient, and consequently, a part of the lithium metal is deposited on the surface of the negative electrode plate, and leads to a relatively high degree of volume expansion of the negative electrode plate. When the volume percent of the silicon nanoparticles in the active layer is moderate, the lithium metal is deposited inside the negative electrode plate, and the degree of volume expansion of the negative electrode plate is relatively low. However, when excessive silicon nanoparticles exist in the active layer, because the silicon nanoparticles themselves do not participate in the reaction during cycles, the excess silicon nanoparticles are adverse to the lithium metal deposition instead. By controlling the volume percent of the silicon nanoparticles in the active layer to fall within the foregoing range, the lithium-ion battery manufactured by using the negative electrode plate is rechargeable for more cycles at a lower volume expansion rate.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0043">In an implementation solution of this application, the content of the lithium metal in the active layer is 0.001 to 3 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>. If the content of pre-supplement lithium is deficient, little effect can be produced on the improvement of the cycle performance of the battery. If the content of pre-supplement lithium is excessive, safety of the battery may be impaired.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0044">In an implementation solution of this application, a thickness of the active layer is 1 to 100 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0045">In an embodiment of this application, a porosity of the porous carbon framework is 40% to 90%.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0046">The material of the current collector according to this application is not particularly limited, and may be a material well known to a person skilled in the art. For example, the material of the current collector includes or is not limited to at least one of copper, nickel, titanium, molybdenum, iron, zinc, stainless steel, or an alloy thereof. Alternatively, the material of the current collector is a conductive inorganic material such as carbon or graphene. One of such materials may be used alone, or two or more thereof may be used in combination.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0047">With the negative electrode plate according to this application, the nano-silicon can spontaneously alloy with lithium metal from a positive electrode during cycles, thereby providing sites required for lithium deposition, and effectively regulating the lithium deposition positions.

Therefore, the thickness needs to be set optimally by comprehensively considering the energy density, volume expansion, number of cycles, and dosage of the positive active material.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0134">In Comparative Embodiment 1, the battery is prepared by using merely a lithium-coated copper foil negative electrode plate, the volume expansion rate of the battery is significantly higher and the number of cycles is significantly lower than that of the battery prepared in Embodiments 1 to 17.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0135">In Comparative Embodiment 2, when the negative electrode plate contains no silicon nanoparticles, the volume expansion rate is significantly higher and the number of cycles is significantly lower than that of the battery prepared in Embodiments 1 to 17.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0136">In Comparative Embodiment 3, when the negative electrode plate contains no carbon framework despite the silicon nanoparticles contained, the volume expansion rate is significantly higher and the number of cycles is significantly lower than that of the battery prepared in Embodiments 1 to 17.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0137">In Comparative Embodiment 4, when the negative electrode plate contains silicon particles other than the silicon nanoparticles prepared by the SVD method and contains no pre-supplement lithium, the volume expansion rate scarcely changes but the number of cycles is significantly lower than that in Embodiments 1 to 17.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0138">In Comparative Embodiment 5, when the negative electrode plate contains merely silicon particles (not prepared by the CVD method) but contains no carbon framework or pre-supplement lithium, the volume expansion rate is significantly higher and the number of cycles is significantly lower than that of the battery prepared in Embodiments 1 to 17.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0139">In Comparative Embodiment 6, when the negative electrode plate contains merely the porous carbon framework but contains no pre-supplementing lithium, the volume expansion rate scarcely changes but the number of cycles is significantly lower than that of the battery prepared in Embodiments 1 to 17.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0140">In Comparative Embodiment 7, when the negative electrode plate contains merely the current collector but contains no carbon framework or pre-supplement lithium, the volume expansion rate is significantly higher and the number of cycles is significantly lower than that of the battery prepared in Embodiments 1 to 17.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0141">In Comparative Embodiment 8, when the negative electrode plate contains merely the current collector and pre-supplement lithium, the volume expansion rate is significantly higher and the number of cycles is significantly lower than that of the battery prepared in Embodiments 1 to 17.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0142">In Comparative Embodiment 9, when the negative electrode plate contains merely the current collector and pre-supplement lithium and the battery is charged at a charge rate of 0.4 C, the volume expansion rate is significantly higher and the number of cycles is significantly lower than that of the battery prepared in Embodiments 1 to 17.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0143">What is described above is merely preferred embodiments of this application, but is not intended to limit this application.
