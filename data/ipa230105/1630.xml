Such a process is used in various fields, such as design related fields for purposes of visualization, demonstration and mechanical prototyping, as well as for rapid manufacturing (RM).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The basic operation of any AM system consists of slicing a three-dimensional computer model into thin cross sections, translating the result into two-dimensional position data and feeding the data to control equipment which manufacture a three-dimensional structure in a layerwise manner.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various AM technologies exist, amongst which are stereolithography, digital light processing (DLP), and three dimensional (3D) printing, 3D inkjet printing in particular. Such techniques are generally performed by layer by layer deposition and solidification of one or building materials, typically photopolymerizable (photocurable) materials.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Stereolithography, for example, is an additive manufacturing process which employs a liquid UV-curable building material and a UV laser. In such a process, for each dispensed layer of the building material, the laser beam traces a cross-section of the part pattern on the surface of the dispensed liquid building material. Exposure to the UV laser light cures and solidifies the pattern traced on the building material and joins it to the layer below. After being built, the formed parts are immersed in a chemical bath in order to be cleaned of excess building material and are subsequently cured in an ultraviolet oven.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In three-dimensional inkjet printing processes, for example, a building material is dispensed from a dispensing head having a set of nozzles to deposit layers on a supporting structure. Depending on the building material, the layers may then be cured or solidified using a suitable device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Various three-dimensional inkjet printing techniques exist and are disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,259,962, 6,569,373, 6,658,314, 6,850,334, 7,183,335, 7,209,797, 7,225,045, 7,300,619, 7,479,510, 7,500,846, 7,962,237, 9,031,680 and U.S. patent application having Publication No. 2015/0210010, all of the same Assignee.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A printing system utilized in additive manufacturing may include a receiving medium and one or more printing heads. The receiving medium can be, for example, a fabrication tray that may include a horizontal surface to carry the material dispensed from the printing head. The printing head may be, for example, an ink jet head having a plurality of dispensing nozzles arranged in an array of one or more rows along the longitudinal axis of the printing head. The printing head may be located such that its longitudinal axis is substantially parallel to the indexing direction. The printing system may further include a controller, such as a microprocessor to control the printing process, including the movement of the printing head according to a pre-defined scanning plan (e.g., a CAD configuration converted to a Stereo Lithography (STL) format and programmed into the controller). The printing head may include a plurality of jetting nozzles. The jetting nozzles dispense material onto the receiving medium to create the layers representing cross sections of a 3D object.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition to the printing head, there may be a source of curing energy, for curing the dispensed building material. The curing energy is typically radiation, for example, UV radiation.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Additionally, the printing system may include a leveling device for leveling and/or establishing the height of each layer after deposition and at least partial solidification, prior to the deposition of a subsequent layer.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The building materials may include modeling materials and support materials, which form the object and the temporary support constructions supporting the object as it is being built, respectively.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The modeling material (which may include one or more material) is deposited to produce the desired object/s and the support material (which may include one or more materials) is used, with or without modeling material elements, to provide support structures for specific areas of the object during building and assure adequate vertical placement of subsequent object layers, e.g., in cases where objects include overhanging features or shapes such as curved geometries, negative angles, voids, and so on.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Both the modeling and support materials are preferably liquid at the working temperature at which they are dispensed, and subsequently hardened, typically upon exposure to curing energy (e.g., UV curing), to form the required layer shape. After printing completion, support structures are removed to reveal the final shape of the fabricated 3D object.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Several additive manufacturing processes allow additive formation of objects using more than one modeling material. For example, U.S. patent application having Publication No. 2010/0191360 of the present Assignee, discloses a system which comprises a solid freeform fabrication apparatus having a plurality of dispensing heads, a building material supply apparatus configured to supply a plurality of building materials to the fabrication apparatus, and a control unit configured for controlling the fabrication and supply apparatus. The system has several operation modes. In one mode, all dispensing heads operate during a single building scan cycle of the fabrication apparatus. In another mode, one or more of the dispensing heads is not operative during a single building scan cycle or part thereof.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a 3D inkjet printing process such as Polyjet&#x2122; (Stratasys Ltd., Israel), the building material is selectively jetted from one or more printing heads and deposited onto a fabrication tray in consecutive layers according to a pre-determined configuration as defined by a software file.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">When a cured rigid modeling material forms the final object, the cured material should preferably exhibit heat deflection temperature (HDT) which is higher than room temperature, in order to assure its usability. Typically, the cured modeling material should exhibit HDT of at least 35&#xb0; C. For an object to be stable in variable conditions, a higher HDT is desirable.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">U.S. patent application having Publication No. 2013/0040091, by the present assignee, discloses methods and systems for solid freeform fabrication of shelled objects, constructed from a plurality of layers and a layered core constituting core regions and a layered shell constituting envelope regions.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to an aspect of some embodiments of the present invention there is provided a method of layerwise fabrication of a three-dimensional object.

The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">The method and system of the present embodiments manufacture three-dimensional objects based on computer object data in a layerwise manner by forming a plurality of layers in a configured pattern corresponding to the shape of the objects. The computer object data can be in any known format, including, without limitation, a Standard Tessellation Language (STL) or a StereoLithography Contour (SLC) format, Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML), Additive Manufacturing File (AMF) format, Drawing Exchange Format (DXF), Polygon File Format (PLY) or any other format suitable for Computer-Aided Design (CAD).</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The term &#x201c;object&#x201d; as used herein refers to a whole object or a part thereof.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Each layer is formed by additive manufacturing apparatus which scans a two-dimensional surface and patterns it. While scanning, the apparatus visits a plurality of target locations on the two-dimensional layer or surface, and decides, for each target location or a group of target locations, whether or not the target location or group of target locations is to be occupied by building material, and which type of building material is to be delivered thereto. The decision is made according to a computer image of the surface.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In preferred embodiments of the present invention the AM comprises three-dimensional printing, more preferably three-dimensional inkjet printing. In these embodiments a building material is dispensed from a dispensing head having a circuit for controllably dispensing building material in layers on a supporting structure. Typically, each dispensing head optionally and preferably has a set of nozzles to deposit building material in layers on a supporting structure. The AM apparatus thus dispenses building material in target locations which are to be occupied and leaves other target locations void. The apparatus typically includes a plurality of dispensing heads, each of which can be configured to dispense a different building material. Thus, different target locations can be occupied by different building materials. The types of building materials can be categorized into two major categories: modeling material and support material. The support material serves as a supporting matrix or construction for supporting the object or object parts during the fabrication process and/or other purposes, e.g., providing hollow or porous objects. Support constructions may additionally include modeling material elements, e.g. for further support strength.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">The modeling material is generally a composition which is formulated for use in additive manufacturing and which is able to form a three-dimensional object on its own, i.e., without having to be mixed or combined with any other substance.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">The final three-dimensional object is made of the modeling material or a combination of modeling materials or modeling and support materials or modification thereof (e.g., following curing). All these operations are well-known to those skilled in the art of solid freeform fabrication.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In some exemplary embodiments of the invention an object is manufactured by dispensing two or more different modeling materials, each material from a different dispensing head of the AM. The materials are optionally and preferably deposited in layers during the same pass of the dispensing heads. The materials and combination of materials within the layer are selected according to the desired properties of the object.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">A representative and non-limiting example of a system <b>110</b> suitable for AM of an object <b>112</b> according to some embodiments of the present invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>. System <b>110</b> comprises an additive manufacturing apparatus <b>114</b> having a dispensing unit <b>16</b> which comprises a plurality of dispensing heads. Each head preferably comprises an array of one or more nozzles <b>122</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>C</figref> described below, through which a liquid building material <b>124</b> is dispensed.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">Preferably, but not obligatorily, apparatus <b>114</b> is a three-dimensional printing apparatus, in which case the dispensing heads are printing heads, and the building material is dispensed via inkjet technology. This need not necessarily be the case, since, for some applications, it may not be necessary for the additive manufacturing apparatus to employ three-dimensional printing techniques. Representative examples of additive manufacturing apparatus contemplated according to various exemplary embodiments of the present invention include, without limitation, fused deposition modeling apparatus and fused material deposition apparatus.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">Each dispensing head is optionally and preferably fed via a building material reservoir which may optionally include a temperature control unit (e.g., a temperature sensor and/or a heating device), and a material level sensor. To dispense the building material, a voltage signal is applied to the dispensing heads to selectively deposit droplets of material via the dispensing head nozzles, for example, as in piezoelectric inkjet printing technology. The dispensing rate of each head depends on the number of nozzles, the type of nozzles and the applied voltage signal rate (frequency). Such dispensing heads are known to those skilled in the art of solid freeform fabrication.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">Preferably, but not obligatorily, the overall number of dispensing nozzles or nozzle arrays is selected such that half of the dispensing nozzles are designated to dispense support material and half of the dispensing nozzles are designated to dispense modeling material, i.e. the number of nozzles jetting modeling materials is the same as the number of nozzles jetting support material. In the representative example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, four dispensing heads <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>, <b>16</b><i>c </i>and <b>16</b><i>d </i>are illustrated. Each of heads <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>, <b>16</b><i>c </i>and <b>16</b><i>d </i>has a nozzle array. In this Example, heads <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>can be designated for modeling material/s and heads <b>16</b><i>c </i>and <b>16</b><i>d </i>can be designated for support material. Thus, head <b>16</b><i>a </i>can dispense a first modeling material, head <b>16</b><i>b </i>can dispense a second modeling material and heads <b>16</b><i>c </i>and <b>16</b><i>d </i>can both dispense support material. In an alternative embodiment, heads <b>16</b><i>c </i>and <b>16</b><i>d</i>, for example, may be combined in a single head having two nozzle arrays for depositing support material.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">Yet it is to be understood that it is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention and that the number of modeling material depositing heads (modeling heads) and the number of support material depositing heads (support heads) may differ. Generally, the number of modeling heads, the number of support heads and the number of nozzles in each respective head or head array are selected such as to provide a predetermined ratio, a, between the maximal dispensing rate of the support material and the maximal dispensing rate of modeling material. The value of the predetermined ratio, a, is preferably selected to ensure that in each formed layer, the height of modeling material equals the height of support material. Typical values for a are from about 0.6 to about 1.5.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">As used herein throughout, the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; refers to &#xb1;10% or to &#xb1;5%.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">For example, for a=1, the overall dispensing rate of support material is generally the same as the overall dispensing rate of the modeling material when all modeling heads and support heads operate.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In a preferred embodiment, there are M modeling heads each having m arrays of p nozzles, and S support heads each having s arrays of q nozzles such that M&#xd7;m&#xd7;p=S&#xd7;s&#xd7;q. Each of the M&#xd7;m modeling arrays and S&#xd7;s support arrays can be manufactured as a separate physical unit, which can be assembled and disassembled from the group of arrays. In this embodiment, each such array optionally and preferably comprises a temperature control unit and a material level sensor of its own, and receives an individually controlled voltage for its operation.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Apparatus <b>114</b> can further comprise a hardening device <b>324</b> which can include any device configured to emit light, heat or the like that may cause the deposited material to hardened. For example, hardening device <b>324</b> can comprise one or more radiation sources, which can be, for example, an ultraviolet or visible or infrared lamp, or other sources of electromagnetic radiation, or electron beam source, depending on the modeling material being used. In some embodiments of the present invention, hardening device <b>324</b> serves for curing or solidifying the modeling material.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">The dispensing head and radiation source are preferably mounted in a frame or block <b>128</b> which is preferably operative to reciprocally move over a tray <b>360</b>, which serves as the working surface. In some embodiments of the present invention the radiation sources are mounted in the block such that they follow in the wake of the dispensing heads to at least partially cure or solidify the materials just dispensed by the dispensing heads. Tray <b>360</b> is positioned horizontally. According to the common conventions an X-Y-Z Cartesian coordinate system is selected such that the X-Y plane is parallel to tray <b>360</b>. Tray <b>360</b> is preferably configured to move vertically (along the Z direction), typically downward. In various exemplary embodiments of the invention, apparatus <b>114</b> further comprises one or more leveling devices <b>132</b>, e.g. a roller <b>326</b>. Leveling device <b>326</b> serves to straighten, level and/or establish a thickness of the newly formed layer prior to the formation of the successive layer thereon. Leveling device <b>326</b> preferably comprises a waste collection device <b>136</b> for collecting the excess material generated during leveling. Waste collection device <b>136</b> may comprise any mechanism that delivers the material to a waste tank or waste cartridge.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">In use, the dispensing heads of unit <b>16</b> move in a scanning direction, which is referred to herein as the X direction, and selectively dispense building material in a predetermined configuration in the course of their passage over tray <b>360</b>. The building material typically comprises one or more types of support material and one or more types of modeling material. The passage of the dispensing heads of unit <b>16</b> is followed by the curing of the modeling material(s) by radiation source <b>126</b>. In the reverse passage of the heads, back to their starting point for the layer just deposited, an additional dispensing of building material may be carried out, according to predetermined configuration. In the forward and/or reverse passages of the dispensing heads, the layer thus formed may be straightened by leveling device <b>326</b>, which preferably follows the path of the dispensing heads in their forward and/or reverse movement. Once the dispensing heads return to their starting point along the X direction, they may move to another position along an indexing direction, referred to herein as the Y direction, and continue to build the same layer by reciprocal movement along the X direction. Alternately, the dispensing heads may move in the Y direction between forward and reverse movements or after more than one forward-reverse movement. The series of scans performed by the dispensing heads to complete a single layer is referred to herein as a single scan cycle.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">Once the layer is completed, tray <b>360</b> is lowered in the Z direction to a predetermined Z level, according to the desired thickness of the layer subsequently to be printed. The procedure is repeated to form three-dimensional object <b>112</b> in a layerwise manner.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In another embodiment, tray <b>360</b> may be displaced in the Z direction between forward and reverse passages of the dispensing head of unit <b>16</b>, within the layer. Such Z displacement is carried out in order to cause contact of the leveling device with the surface in one direction and prevent contact in the other direction.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">System <b>110</b> optionally and preferably comprises a building material supply system <b>330</b> which comprises the building material containers or cartridges and supplies a plurality of building materials to fabrication apparatus <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">A control unit <b>340</b> controls fabrication apparatus <b>114</b> and optionally and preferably also supply system <b>330</b>. Control unit <b>340</b> typically includes an electronic circuit configured to perform the controlling operations. Control unit <b>340</b> preferably communicates with a data processor <b>154</b> which transmits digital data pertaining to fabrication instructions based on computer object data, e.g., a CAD configuration represented on a computer readable medium in a form of a Standard Tessellation Language (STL) format or the like. Typically, control unit <b>340</b> controls the voltage applied to each dispensing head or nozzle array and the temperature of the building material in the respective printing head.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Once the manufacturing data is loaded to control unit <b>340</b> it can operate without user intervention. In some embodiments, control unit <b>340</b> receives additional input from the operator, e.g., using data processor <b>154</b> or using a user interface <b>116</b> communicating with unit <b>340</b>. User interface <b>116</b> can be of any type known in the art, such as, but not limited to, a keyboard, a touch screen and the like. For example, control unit <b>340</b> can receive, as additional input, one or more building material types and/or attributes, such as, but not limited to, color, characteristic distortion and/or transition temperature, viscosity, electrical property, magnetic property. Other attributes and groups of attributes are also contemplated.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">Another representative and non-limiting example of a system <b>10</b> suitable for AM of an object according to some embodiments of the present invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>B-<b>5</b>D</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>B-<b>5</b>D</figref> illustrate a top view (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>), a side view (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>) and an isometric view (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref>) of system <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">In the present embodiments, system <b>10</b> comprises a tray <b>12</b> and a plurality of inkjet printing heads <b>16</b>, each having a plurality of separated nozzles.

Non-round shapes are also contemplated, provided they can be rotated about a vertical axis.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">Tray <b>12</b> and heads <b>16</b> are optionally and preferably mounted such as to allow a relative rotary motion between tray <b>12</b> and heads <b>16</b>. This can be achieved by (i) configuring tray <b>12</b> to rotate about a vertical axis <b>14</b> relative to heads <b>16</b>, (ii) configuring heads <b>16</b> to rotate about vertical axis <b>14</b> relative to tray <b>12</b>, or (iii) configuring both tray <b>12</b> and heads <b>16</b> to rotate about vertical axis <b>14</b> but at different rotation velocities (e.g., rotation at opposite direction). While the embodiments below are described with a particular emphasis to configuration (i) wherein the tray is a rotary tray that is configured to rotate about vertical axis <b>14</b> relative to heads <b>16</b>, it is to be understood that the present application contemplates also configurations (ii) and (iii). Any one of the embodiments described herein can be adjusted to be applicable to any of configurations (ii) and (iii), and one of ordinary skills in the art, provided with the details described herein, would know how to make such adjustment.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">In the following description, a direction parallel to tray <b>12</b> and pointing outwardly from axis <b>14</b> is referred to as the radial direction r, a direction parallel to tray <b>12</b> and perpendicular to the radial direction r is referred to herein as the azimuthal direction &#x3c6;, and a direction perpendicular to tray <b>12</b> is referred to herein is the vertical direction z.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">The term &#x201c;radial position,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to a position on or above tray <b>12</b> at a specific distance from axis <b>14</b>. When the term is used in connection to a printing head, the term refers to a position of the head which is at specific distance from axis <b>14</b>.

The working area on which one or objects are printed is typically, but not necessarily, smaller than the total area of tray <b>12</b>. In some embodiments of the present invention the working area is annular. The working area is shown at <b>26</b>. In some embodiments of the present invention tray <b>12</b> rotates continuously in the same direction throughout the formation of object, and in some embodiments of the present invention tray reverses the direction of rotation at least once (e.g., in an oscillatory manner) during the formation of the object. Tray <b>12</b> is optionally and preferably removable. Removing tray <b>12</b> can be for maintenance of system <b>10</b>, or, if desired, for replacing the tray before printing a new object.

The advantage of this embodiment is that it reduces the tendency of the pedestal to lift from the tray.</p><p id="p-0332" num="0331">Inaccuracies in Z may occur at the lowest layers of the printed object. This may be because the top surface of the tray at Z start level (the Z level of the tray when printing starts) may not be exactly at a height which enables the leveling device to reach and thus level the first layers deposited in the printing process, when the leveling device may be at its lowest point (e.g., because of inaccuracy in adjustments and/or incomplete flatness and horizon of the tray). As a result, the lower layers of object <b>200</b> may not be leveled by the leveling device and therefore their thickness may be greater than the designed layer thickness, therefore increasing the height of object <b>200</b> as printed in contrast to the object as designed. The use of pedestal <b>202</b> under the lowest point of the object solves this problem by specifying that the height at which the printing of the actual object starts may be the height at which the pedestal itself may be significantly leveled by the leveling device.</p><p id="p-0333" num="0332">In various exemplary embodiments of the invention pedestal <b>202</b> has a core-shell structure, in which the shell comprises spaced pillars of modeling formulation with support formulation in-between, and the core comprises only soluble (e.g., water soluble) support formulation, and is devoid of any non-soluble modeling formulation.

Thus, for example, a material extended to an elongation at failure which is 200%, and which upon release of tensile stress returns to a state characterized by a strain of 20% relative to the original length, would be characterized as having a recovery of 90% (i.e., 200%-20% divided by 200%).</p><p id="p-0339" num="0338">Herein, &#x201c;Tg&#x201d; refers to glass transition temperature defined as the location of the local maximum of the E&#x2033; curve, where E&#x2033; is the loss modulus of the material as a function of the temperature.

For example, selection of the first formulation and/or ratio that enhance the damping at high temperatures provides an object that is capable of dissipating energy, and that is less sensitive to internal stresses and crack propagation, when used in a high temperature environment. This applies to any first and second formulations, including, but not limited to, the first and second formulations of the present embodiments.</p><p id="p-0600" num="0576">Accordingly, properties of a fabricated object can be controlled by judicious selection of the modeling formulations and/or ratio between a first and a second modeling formulation in the various regions of the object, particularly the core region, if a core-shell structure is fabricated. For example, a predetermined damping range of the core, the shell or the entire object can be obtained by selecting an amount of a first modeling formulation in the core, and/or by selecting one or more parameters characterizing the first formulation. The damping range can be expressed, for example, using the phase lag &#x3b4; between the stress and the strain of the core, the shell or the entire object, for a particular temperature range.</p><p id="p-0601" num="0577">In some of any of the embodiments described herein, the first and second formulations are characterized by, feature, or selected so as to feature, when hardened, the tangent of the phase lag between the stress and the strain of the respective structure (core, shell or the entire object), which is at least 0.25 at a temperature range of from about 70&#xb0; C. to about 90&#xb0; C., or at least 0.20 at a temperature range of from about 90&#xb0; C. to about 110&#xb0; C., or at least 0.15 at a temperature range of from about 110&#xb0; C. to about 160&#xb0; C., or at least 0.15 at a temperature range of from about 130&#xb0; C. to about 160&#xb0; C.]. Thus, for example, the first and second formulations can be selected so as to provide a desired damping performance at the environmental temperature at which a printed object is to be used.</p><p id="p-0602" num="0578">For obtaining a desired damping performance, at a selected temperature, first and/or second modeling formulations, differing from one another by a characteristic parameter such as the extent of cross linking of the first formulation (expressed, for example, by the relative amount of a cross linking component (e.g., a multi-functional curable component) in the first formulation). The selected characteristic parameter can alternatively or additionally be a total calculated Tg of the first formulation, as calculated by summing individual Tg values of chemical components of first formulation. The summation is optionally and preferably a weight sum, wherein each Tg value is multiplied by the relative amount (e.g., weight percentage) of the respective chemical components of first modeling formulation.</p><p id="p-0603" num="0579">For obtaining a characteristic parameter such as elongation and/or toughness, first modeling formulations, differing from one another by the presence or absence of an additional flexible monomer as described herein, can be used.</p><p id="p-0604" num="0580">The selection of the characteristic parameter(s) can be achieved, for example, by a look-up table having a plurality of entries, each including a value indicative of the damping (e.g., the tangent of the phase &#x3b4;) and a corresponding parameter or set of parameters (weight percentage of the first modeling formulation in the core, extent of cross linking, total calculated Tg, etc.) corresponding to the damping. The selection of the characteristic parameter(s) can alternatively or additionally be achieved by one or more calibration curves describing a value indicative of the damping as a function of the respective parameter. Representative examples of such calibration curves are provided in the Examples section that follows (see, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>A-<b>15</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0605" num="0581">In various exemplary embodiments of the invention the selection is performed by a data processor, e.g., data processor <b>24</b> or <b>154</b>. For example, the operator can enter, via a user interface, the desired damping or damping range, and the processor can access a memory medium storing a digital representation of the look-up table or calibration curve, and display or automatically select the parameter or set of parameters that provide the desired damping or damping range. The selection can optionally and preferably be based on the type of modeling formulations that are loaded to the fabrication system (e.g., the type of modeling formulations in supply apparatus <b>330</b>), so that the data processor selects only the parameters that are applicable to modeling formulations already loaded into the system. Alternatively, the operator can also enter via the user interface, the desired modeling formulation, in which case the data processor selects only the parameters that are applicable to the modeling formulation that was entered by the operator.</p><p id="p-0606" num="0582">In some embodiments, the modeling material formulations described herein in any of the respective embodiments, form a part of the above-described look-up table.</p><p id="p-0607" num="0583">In some embodiments of the present invention the total calculated Tg value of the first modeling formulation is from about 100&#xb0; C. to about 115&#xb0; C., e.g., about 107&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0608" num="0584">In some embodiments of the present invention the total calculated Tg value of the first modeling formulation is from about 120&#xb0; C. to about 135&#xb0; C., e.g., about 127&#xb0; C.
