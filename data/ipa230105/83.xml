In order to enable the surfaces of these materials to have the antibacterial and antifungal properties, a coating method or a spray method is usually adopted in the related art. Although using the methods mentioned can enable these materials to maintain good transparency, the antibacterial and antifungal properties on the surfaces of these materials cannot be maintained for a desired time.
