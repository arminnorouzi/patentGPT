frequency division duplex (FDD) in a wireless local area network (WLAN) system, and more particularly, to a method and apparatus for transmitting and receiving a physical layer protocol data unit (PPDU) by using the FDD scheme in the WLAN system.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Discussion for a next-generation wireless local area network (WLAN) is in progress. In the next-generation WLAN, an object is to 1) improve an institute of electronic and electronics engineers (IEEE) 802.11 physical (PHY) layer and a medium access control (MAC) layer in bands of 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, 2) increase spectrum efficiency and area throughput, 3) improve performance in actual indoor and outdoor environments such as an environment in which an interference source exists, a dense heterogeneous network environment, and an environment in which a high user load exists, and the like.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An environment which is primarily considered in the next-generation WLAN is a dense environment in which access points (APs) and stations (STAs) are a lot and under the dense environment, improvement of the spectrum efficiency and the area throughput is discussed. Further, in the next-generation WLAN, in addition to the indoor environment, in the outdoor environment which is not considerably considered in the existing WLAN, substantial performance improvement is concerned.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In detail, scenarios such as wireless office, smart home, stadium, Hotspot, and building/apartment are largely concerned in the next-generation WLAN and discussion about improvement of system performance in a dense environment in which the APs and the STAs are a lot is performed based on the corresponding scenarios.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the next-generation WLAN, improvement of system performance in an overlapping basic service set (OBSS) environment and improvement of outdoor environment performance, and cellular offloading are anticipated to be actively discussed rather than improvement of single link performance in one basic service set (BSS). Directionality of the next-generation means that the next-generation WLAN gradually has a technical scope similar to mobile communication. When a situation is considered, in which the mobile communication and the WLAN technology have been discussed in a small cell and a direct-to-direct (D2D) communication area in recent years, technical and business convergence of the next-generation WLAN and the mobile communication is predicted to be further active.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present specification proposes a method and apparatus for transmitting and receiving a physical layer protocol data unit (PPDU), based on frequency division duplex (FDD), in a wireless local area network (WLAN) system.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An example of the present specification proposes a method of transmitting and receiving a PPDU, based on FDD.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present embodiment may be performed in a network environment in which a next-generation WLAN system is supported.

Further, transmission from the AP to the STA may be expressed as downlink transmission and transmission from the STA to the AP may be expressed as a term called uplink transmission.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0111">In addition, a PHY protocol data unit (PPDU), a frame, and data transmitted through the downlink transmission may be expressed as terms such as a downlink PPDU, a downlink frame, and downlink data, respectively.

The PPDU header may include a PHY header and a PHY preamble and the PSDU (alternatively, MPDU) may include the frame or indicate the frame (alternatively, an information unit of the MAC layer) or be a data unit indicating the frame. The PHY header may be expressed as a physical layer convergence protocol (PLCP) header as another term and the PHY preamble may be expressed as a PLCP preamble as another term.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0112">Further, a PPDU, a frame, and data transmitted through the uplink transmission may be expressed as terms such as an uplink PPDU, an uplink frame, and uplink data, respectively.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0113">In the wireless LAN system to which the embodiment of the present description is applied, the total bandwidth may be used for downlink transmission to one STA and uplink transmission to one STA. Further, in the wireless LAN system to which the embodiment of the present description is applied, the AP may perform downlink (DL) multi-user (MU) transmission based on multiple input multiple output (MU MIMO) and the transmission may be expressed as a term called DL MU MIMO transmission.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0114">In addition, in the wireless LAN system according to the embodiment, an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based transmission method is preferably supported for the uplink transmission and/or downlink transmission. That is, data units (e.g., RUs) corresponding to different frequency resources are allocated to the user to perform uplink/downlink communication. In detail, in the wireless LAN system according to the embodiment, the AP may perform the DL MU transmission based on the OFDMA and the transmission may be expressed as a term called DL MU OFDMA transmission. When the DL MU OFDMA transmission is performed, the AP may transmit the downlink data (alternatively, the downlink frame and the downlink PPDU) to the plurality of respective STAs through the plurality of respective frequency resources on an overlapped time resource. The plurality of frequency resources may be a plurality of subbands (alternatively, sub channels) or a plurality of resource units (RUs). The DL MU OFDMA transmission may be used together with the DL MU MIMO transmission. For example, the DL MU MIMO transmission based on a plurality of space-time streams (alternatively, spatial streams) may be performed on a specific subband (alternatively, sub channel) allocated for the DL MU OFDMA transmission.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0115">Further, in the wireless LAN system according to the embodiment, uplink multi-user (UL MU) transmission in which the plurality of STAs transmits data to the AP on the same time resource may be supported. Uplink transmission on the overlapped time resource by the plurality of respective STAs may be performed on a frequency domain or a spatial domain.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0116">When the uplink transmission by the plurality of respective STAs is performed on the frequency domain, different frequency resources may be allocated to the plurality of respective STAs as uplink transmission resources based on the OFDMA. The different frequency resources may be different subbands (alternatively, sub channels) or different resources units (RUs). The plurality of respective STAs may transmit uplink data to the AP through different frequency resources. The transmission method through the different frequency resources may be expressed as a term called a UL MU OFDMA transmission method.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0117">When the uplink transmission by the plurality of respective STAs is performed on the spatial domain, different time-space streams (alternatively, spatial streams) may be allocated to the plurality of respective STAs and the plurality of respective STAs may transmit the uplink data to the AP through the different time-space streams. The transmission method through the different spatial streams may be expressed as a term called a UL MU MIMO transmission method.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0118">The UL MU OFDMA transmission and the UL MU MIMO transmission may be used together with each other. For example, the UL MU MIMO transmission based on the plurality of space-time streams (alternatively, spatial streams) may be performed on a specific subband (alternatively, sub channel) allocated for the UL MU OFDMA transmission.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0119">In the legacy wireless LAN system which does not support the MU OFDMA transmission, a multi-channel allocation method is used for allocating a wider bandwidth (e.g., a 20 MHz excess bandwidth) to one terminal. When a channel unit is 20 MHz, multiple channels may include a plurality of 20 MHz-channels. In the multi-channel allocation method, a primary channel rule is used to allocate the wider bandwidth to the terminal. When the primary channel rule is used, there is a limit for allocating the wider bandwidth to the terminal. In detail, according to the primary channel rule, when a secondary channel adjacent to a primary channel is used in an overlapped BSS (OBSS) and is thus busy, the STA may use remaining channels other than the primary channel. Therefore, since the STA may transmit the frame only to the primary channel, the STA receives a limit for transmission of the frame through the multiple channels. That is, in the legacy wireless LAN system, the primary channel rule used for allocating the multiple channels may be a large limit in obtaining a high throughput by operating the wider bandwidth in a current wireless LAN environment in which the OBSS is not small.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0120">In order to solve the problem, in the embodiment, a wireless LAN system is disclosed, which supports the OFDMA technology. That is, the OFDMA technique may be applied to at least one of downlink and uplink. Further, the MU-MIMO technique may be additionally applied to at least one of downlink and uplink. When the OFDMA technique is used, the multiple channels may be simultaneously used by not one terminal but multiple terminals without the limit by the primary channel rule. Therefore, the wider bandwidth may be operated to improve efficiency of operating a wireless resource.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0121">As described above, in case the uplink transmission performed by each of the multiple STAs (e.g., non-AP STAs) is performed within the frequency domain, the AP may allocate different frequency resources respective to each of the multiple STAs as uplink transmission resources based on OFDMA. Additionally, as described above, the frequency resources each being different from one another may correspond to different subbands (or sub-channels) or different resource units (RUs).</p><p id="p-0126" num="0122">The different frequency resources respective to each of the multiple STAs are indicated through a trigger frame.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0123"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates an example of a trigger frame.

The control field improved according to the present disclosure includes a first control field including control information required to interpret the PPDU and a second control field including control information for demodulate the data field of the PPDU. The first and second control fields may be used for various fields. For example, the first control field may be the HE-SIG-A <b>730</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, and the second control field may be the HE-SIG-B <b>740</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0144">Hereinafter, a specific example of improving the first or the second control field will be described.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0145">In the following example, a control identifier inserted to the first control field or a second control field is proposed. The size of the control identifier may vary, which, for example, may be implemented with 1-bit information.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0146">The control identifier (for example, a 1-bit identifier) may indicate whether a 242-type RU is allocated when, for example, 20 MHz transmission is performed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> to <b>6</b></figref>, RUs of various sizes may be used. These RUs may be divided broadly into two types. For example, all of the RUs shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> to <b>6</b></figref> may be classified into 26-type RUs and 242-type RUs. For example, a 26-type RU may include a 26-RU, a 52-RU, and a 106-RU while a 242-type RU may include a 242-RU, a 484-RU, and a larger RU.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0147">The control identifier (for example, a 1-bit identifier) may indicate that a 242-type RU has been used. In other words, the control identifier may indicate that a 242-RU, a 484-RU, or a 996-RU is included. If the transmission frequency band in which a PPDU is transmitted has a bandwidth of 20 MHz, a 242-RU is a single RU corresponding to the full bandwidth of the transmission frequency band (namely, 20 MHz). Accordingly, the control identifier (for example, 1-bit identifier) may indicate whether a single RU corresponding to the full bandwidth of the transmission frequency band is allocated.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0148">For example, if the transmission frequency band has a bandwidth of 40 MHz, the control identifier (for example, a 1-bit identifier) may indicate whether a single RU corresponding to the full bandwidth (namely, bandwidth of 40 MHz) of the transmission frequency band has been allocated. In other words, the control identifier may indicate whether a 484-RU has been allocated for transmission in the frequency band with a bandwidth of 40 MHz.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0149">For example, if the transmission frequency band has a bandwidth of 80 MHz, the control identifier (for example, a 1-bit identifier) may indicate whether a single RU corresponding to the full bandwidth (namely, bandwidth of 80 MHz) of the transmission frequency band has been allocated. In other words, the control identifier may indicate whether a 996-RU has been allocated for transmission in the frequency band with a bandwidth of 80 MHz.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0150">Various technical effects may be achieved through the control identifier (for example, 1-bit identifier).</p><p id="p-0159" num="0151">First of all, when a single RU corresponding to the full bandwidth of the transmission frequency band is allocated through the control identifier (for example, a 1-bit identifier), allocation information of the RU may be omitted. In other words, since only one RU rather than a plurality of RUs is allocated over the whole transmission frequency band, allocation information of the RU may be omitted deliberately.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0152">Also, the control identifier may be used as signaling for full bandwidth MU-MIMO. For example, when a single RU is allocated over the full bandwidth of the transmission frequency band, multiple users may be allocated to the corresponding single RU. In other words, even though signals for each user are not distinctive in the temporal and spatial domains, other techniques (for example, spatial multiplexing) may be used to multiplex the signals for multiple users in the same, single RU. Accordingly, the control identifier (for example, a 1-bit identifier) may also be used to indicate whether to use the full bandwidth MU-MIMO described above.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0153">The common field included in the second control field (HE-SIG-B, <b>740</b>) may include an RU allocation subfield. According to the PPDU bandwidth, the common field may include a plurality of RU allocation subfields (including N RU allocation subfields). The format of the common field may be defined as follows.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00008" num="00008"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="189pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" rowsep="1">TABLE 8</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Number</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>Subfield</entry><entry>of bits</entry><entry>Description</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>RU Allocation</entry><entry>N &#xd7; 8</entry><entry>Indicates the RU assignment to be used in the data portion in</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>the frequency domain.

Embodiment Applicable to the Present Disclosure</p><p id="p-0176" num="0163">The existing WiFi system uses a TDD scheme to operate DL transmission in which transmission is performed from an AP to an STA and UL transmission in which transmission is performed from the STA to the AP. In this case, in order for the STA to perform UL transmission, DL reception is performed and thereafter UL transmission is performed. Therefore, a time delay occurs to transmit data through UL transmission. Alternatively, in order for the AP to perform DL transmission, UL reception is performed and thereafter DL transmission is performed. Therefore, a time delay occurs to transmit data through DL transmission.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0164">Compared to an FDD system, a TDD system may increase frequency efficiency because DL/UL are located at the same frequency, but has a disadvantage in that a delay is great because transmission and reception are performed in such a manner that DL/UL are separated in terms of time.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0165">Meanwhile, in AR/VR, video information and user's motion information shall be transmitted and received in an interworking manner without latency. If the latency or disconnection occurs in the interworking of the video information and the user's motion information, an AR/VR performance experienced by a user is significantly degraded, which leads to a bottle neck in replacing the existing wired AR/VR with wirelessly one.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0166">Therefore, the proposed method proposes a method for increasing the performance experienced by the user while replacing the AR/VR with wireless one.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0167">The present specification proposes a series of processes and signalling to enable faster UL transmission compared to the existing wireless LAN system. A PPDU format for support this is also proposed.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0168">2. Proposed Embodiment</p><p id="p-0182" num="0169"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is an example of applying FDD in a Wi-Fi system. That is, FDD is applied to the existing Wi-Fi system.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0170">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, a DL carrier occupies 160 MHz and a UL carrier occupies 160 MHz or 20 MHz. However, this is only an example, and thus DL and UL may occupy different bandwidths (BWs). The BW of DL and the BW of UL are not necessarily identical.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0171">In addition, DL and UL may be located in the same band or located in different bands. For example, DL may be defined in a 5 GHz band, and UL may be defined in a 2.4 GHz band. The other way around is also possible.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0172">Meanwhile, in the proposed method, a carrier on which DL is transmitted is defined as a primary channel. It is assumed herein that DL traffic is greater than UL traffic and an STA for performing DL transmission is an AP/PCP.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0173">In order to operate as described above, an RF chain shall be configured separately for each DL and UL. In addition, in order to perform transmission and reception at the same time, two baseband modules are required.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0174"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> shows an example in which DL or UL transmission operates with a plurality of carriers in a Wi-Fi system.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0175">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, DL transmission is performed through two carriers, and UL transmission is performed through one carrier. In addition, it is an example for a case where each of DL carriers does not have the same BW and a UL carrier does not have the same BW, either. That is, the proposed method proposes a scheme in which each of carriers does not have the same BW.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0176">Specifically, in the proposed method, a carrier having the greatest BW is selected as a primary channel. That is, secondary channels cannot have a greater BW compared to the primary channel. This is because the Wi-Fi system operates a basic CCA operation by using the primary channel. That is, the existing Wi-Fi system performs transmission by using two channels only when the primary channel and the secondary channel are both idle, and performs transmission by using only the primary channel when only the secondary channel is busy. However, when the primary channel is busy, transmission is not possible even if the secondary channel is idle.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0177">In this case, if the secondary channel has a greater BW compared to the primary channel, a throughput experienced by a user may differ significantly according to whether the secondary channel is idle/busy.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0178">For example, comparing a case where the BW of the primary channel is greater than the BW of the secondary channel with the opposite case, whether the primary channel is idle/busy has the same effect on the two cases since it determines as a whole whether transmission is performed. However, according to whether the secondary channel is idle/busy, the former case (when the BW of the primary channel is greater than the BW of the secondary channel) may perform transmission through a primary channel occupying a wider BW, whereas the latter case (when the BW of the primary channel is smaller than the BW of the secondary channel) shall perform transmission through a primary channel occupying a narrower BW. Therefore, a throughput difference is great in the latter case, compared to a case where the primary channel and the secondary channel are both idle.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0179">In the proposed method, two or more UL carriers may be allocated to one DL carrier in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>. That is, 80 MHz of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> may be used for the DL carrier, and 40 MHz and 20 MHz of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> may be used for the UL carrier. This is to guarantee a UL throughput by aggregating several channels when a channel which can be allocated to UL is very small.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0180">Meanwhile, when FDD is configured as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, a problem occurs in UL channel access. That is, when an STA attempts channel access to a UL carrier to transmit UL data, a corresponding channel may be busy due to a co-located AP or OBSS in which the channel is used. In this case, there is a problem in that the STA cannot perform UL transmission. Since this may lead to a failure in achieving the purpose of introducing FDD to solve the low latency described above, a frame structure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is proposed.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0181"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> shows an example of a frame structure capable of transmitting a DL PPDU through a primary channel and a UL PPDU through a secondary channel.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0182">It is assumed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> that CH<b>1</b> is assigned as a primary channel and used for DL, and CH<b>2</b> is assigned as a secondary channel and used for UL. However, in order to solve the aforementioned problem, an AP simultaneously transmits a DL PPDU through the secondary channel. In this case, the DL PPDU transmitted through the secondary channel may be a preamble only frame or a Preamble+QoS null frame, or may be newly defined to effectively operate the proposed method. In this case, the preamble may include L-STF, L-LTF, and L-SIG, and may additionally include FDD-SIG to effectively operate the proposed method. In addition, the preamble transmitted through the secondary channel is transmitted in a duplicate format such that transmission is performed in the same manner as the preamble used in the primary channel. In doing so, when legacy STAs detect and decode even any one of the primary channel and the secondary channel, it can be recognized that a corresponding channel is occupied.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0183">In the proposed method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, an STA which has received the DL PPDU transmitted through the secondary channel transmits a UL PPDU after an SIFS. Alternatively, a value other than the SIFS may be applied (e.g., a value greater than SIFS and smaller than PIFS), and an IFS value may be indicated in a configurable manner through a beacon frame, a management frame, and a control frame.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0184">Although the UL PPDU of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> may be a frame composed of only data, an ACK frame for a DL PPDU received through a previous primary channel may be aggregated with data, or it may be composed of only the ACK frame. This means that, when the ACK frame is transmitted, the ACK frame for the primary channel is transmitted through the secondary channel. In addition, it means that a preamble only DL PPDU transmitted through the secondary channel does not require ACK. In this case, the ACK frame also includes a block ACK frame.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0185"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> shows an example of a frame structure to which FDD is applied when a length of a UL PPDU is longer than a length of a DL PPDU.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0186">Meanwhile, a maximum length of the UL PPDU is set to be equal to or shorter than an end point of the DL PPDU transmitted through a primary channel. This is to avoid a problem in which a separate CCA operation is forced for each channel, irrespective of whether CCA is performed on a primary channel, and thus a hardware (HW) complexity increases. This is caused when an AP shall perform CCA on a secondary channel to transmit a DL PPDU <b>4</b> in the middle of transmitting a DL PPDU <b>2</b> in a case where the UL PPDU is longer than the DL PPDU as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0187">In addition, with this configuration, since PPDUs transmitted through the secondary channel shall indicate length information of a UL PPDU transmitted by STAs after an SIFS, there is a problem in that the aforementioned preamble only DL PPDU structure cannot be used. That is, since a preamble of PPDUs transmitted through the secondary channel is composed of a duplicate format of a preamble transmitted through the primary channel, L-SIG information indicates a length of a PPDU transmitted through the primary channel, and a MAC frame shall be included to guarantee up to the UL PPDU.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0188">In the proposed method, BW information of the primary channel and secondary channel may be indicated by FDD-SIG which is newly defined. Alternatively, it may be indicated through request to send (RTS) and clear to send (CTS) frames as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>. The RTS frame and the CTS frame are signaling frames for solving a hidden node problem and an exposed node problem, and a wireless device may overhear whether data is transmitted and received between neighboring STAs, based on the RTS frame and the CTS frame.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0189"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is an example of a frame structure to which FDD is applied by using an RTS frame and a CTS frame.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0190">In case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, a center frequency or a channel number and BW information may be included in the RTS and CTS frames, and a new frame may be configured for indication.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0191"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> is another example of a frame structure to which FDD is applied by using an RTS frame and a CTS frame.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0192">In addition, if the RTS frame uses 1 bit to indicate that a UL frame is transmitted in a corresponding channel, a UL PPDU may be immediately transmitted after an SIFS of CRS without transmission or assistance of a DL PPDU in a secondary channel.

In addition, a method of configuring a DL PPDU and a UL PPDU in terms of time in a corresponding channel may be included for flexibility of a time resource, so that DL/UL can be freely changed in each channel. In this case, although a trigger frame transmitted through each channel may be transmitted by including only information on each channel as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, it is also possible that the trigger frame is configured by using information on all channels and may be transmitted by using a duplicate format, so that configuration information on all channels can be recognized even if only any one of the channels is received.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0197">However, there is a case where a data part (PSDU) included in a DL PPDU of CH#<b>4</b> is transmitted by being aggregated with a trigger frame of CH#<b>4</b>.
