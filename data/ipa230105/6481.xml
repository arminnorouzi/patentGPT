Wireless power transfer is a technology of converting electric energy into an electromagnetic wave having a frequency and wirelessly transferring energy by a load without a transmission line. The wireless power transfer technology may be a technology of transferring power wirelessly from a power transmission device to a power reception device without a wired connection between the power reception device and the power transmission device, and charging the battery of the power reception device with the power. The wireless power transfer technology may include a magnetic induction method and a magnetic resonance method, and many other wireless power transfer technologies are available.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, a magnetic inductive wireless power transmission system transmits power by using a magnetic field induced in a coil. Induced current flows in a receiving coil by a magnetic field generated from current flowing in a transmitting coil, and energy is supplied by a load. Representative magnetic induction standards include wireless power consortium (WPC) and power matters alliance (PMA). A specified frequency band may be used for power transmission, such as 110 to 205 kHz in WPC, and 227 to 357 kHz and 118 to 153 kHz in PMA.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The above information is presented as background information only to assist with an understanding of the disclosure. No determination has been made, and no assertion is made, as to whether any of the above might be applicable as prior art with regard to the disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to WPC, an electronic device (e.g., a wireless power reception device) may wirelessly receive power from an external electronic device (e.g., a wireless power transmission device) to perform charging. The electronic device may output a wireless power control signal for controlling power to be wirelessly transmitted from the external electronic device during wireless charging. For example, the wireless power control signal may be a control error packet (CEP) signal. The external electronic device may receive the CEP signal from the electronic device and control power to be wirelessly transmitted.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Typically, the CEP signal may have a specified frequency-based waveform. When the electronic device outputs the CEP signal, a circuit (e.g., a capacitor and/or a printed circuit board (PCB)) may be shaken due to the waveform of the CEP signal, thereby causing noise in the electronic device. In addition, upon receipt of the CEP signal, the external electronic device may experience vibration of its internal circuit, which causes noise (e.g., audible noise). The audible noise generated in the internal circuit of each of the electronic device and the external electronic device may cause inconvenience to a user. The vibration may also lead to damage of the electronic device and/or its components.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Aspects of the disclosure are to address at least the above-mentioned problems and/or disadvantages and to provide at least the advantages described below. Accordingly, an aspect of the disclosure is to provide an electronic device capable of reducing noise by minimizing or reducing vibration of circuits in the electronic device and an external electronic device, and a method of outputting a power control signal for wireless power reception in the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another aspect of the disclosure is to provide an electronic device capable of reducing noise (e.g., audible noise) caused by vibration of circuits in the electronic device and an external electronic device without decreasing or without a substantial decrease in the communication stability of wireless power by adjusting the waveform of a CEP signal to a waveform that reduces circuit vibration in the electronic device and the external electronic device, based on the magnitude of wireless power transmitted and received between the electronic device and the external electronic device, when the electronic device outputs the CEP signal, and a method of outputting a power control signal for wireless power reception in the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Additional aspects will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the presented embodiments.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with an aspect of the disclosure, an electronic device is provided. The electronic device includes a battery, at least one coil, a wireless power transmission/reception circuit electrically coupled to the at least one coil, a charging circuit electrically coupled between the wireless power transmission/reception circuit and the battery, and a processor. The processor may be configured to detect an external electronic device capable of receiving power transmitted wirelessly through the wireless power transmission/reception circuit, identify a magnitude of power to be received at the external electronic device, control the wireless power transmission/reception circuit to output a first control error packet (CEP) signal having a first power magnitude which is fixed, based on the magnitude of the power being less than a specified power magnitude, and control the wireless power transmission/reception circuit to output a second CEP signal having a variable power magnitude based on the first power magnitude and a second power magnitude, based on the magnitude of the power being equal to or greater than the specified power magnitude. Other embodiments are also possible.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with another aspect of the disclosure, a method of outputting a power control signal for wireless power reception in an electronic device is provided. The method includes detecting an external electronic device capable of receiving power transmitted wirelessly through a wireless power transmission/reception circuit, identifying a magnitude of power to be received from the external electronic device, outputting a first CEP signal having a first power magnitude which is fixed, based on the magnitude of the power being less than a specified power magnitude, and outputting a second CEP signal having a variable power magnitude based on the first power magnitude and the second power magnitude, based on the magnitude of the power being equal to or greater than the specified power magnitude.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to various embodiments of the disclosure, a non-volatile storage medium may store instructions which are configured to, when executed by at least one processor, cause the at least one processor to perform at least one operation. The at least one operation may include detecting an external electronic device capable of receiving power transmitted wirelessly through a wireless power transmission/reception circuit, identifying a magnitude of power to be received from the external electronic device, outputting a first CEP signal having a fixed first power magnitude, based on the magnitude of the power being less than a specified power magnitude, and outputting a second CEP signal having a variable power magnitude based on the first power magnitude and the second power magnitude, based on the magnitude of the power being equal to or greater than the specified power magnitude.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Advantageous Effects</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to various embodiments of the disclosure, noise may be reduced by minimizing vibration of circuits (e.g., a capacitor and/or a printed circuit board (PCB) in an electronic device and an external electronic device during wireless power transmission and reception between the electronic device and the external electronic device.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to various embodiments of the disclosure, when an electronic device outputs a CEP signal, noise (e.g., audible noise) caused by vibration of circuits in the electronic device and an external electronic device may be reduced without decreasing or substantially decreasing stability during wireless power transmission and reception by adjusting the waveform of the CEP signal to a waveform that reduces circuit vibration in the electronic device and the external electronic device, based on the magnitude of wireless power transmitted and received between the electronic device and the external electronic device.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Other aspects,
