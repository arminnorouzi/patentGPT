One existing monitoring solution is to check both input voltage and output voltage independently, which is then read by a controller via multiplexer. The two results (i.e., input and output of rely or fuse) are then compared by the controller. However, multiplexer power supply voltage is typically limited, especially at the high-voltage end. As a result, the multiplexor is more easily damaged by an over voltage. Furthermore, conventional monitoring solutions require two inputs to predict each fuse or relay status.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In view of the foregoing, described herein are systems, circuits, and methods for determining a status of fuses and/or relays one or more relays.

In this example, only one input can detect/receive the status signal <b>126</b> from the fuse <b>102</b>.

If the relay <b>140</b> is in a normal state (i.e., open if relay is normally open, and closed if relay is normally closed), the light source <b>152</b> is not illuminated, thus the detector <b>154</b> is off and voltage to the IO expander <b>124</b> is pulled up to logic high. If the relay <b>140</b> is switched from its normal state, the light source <b>152</b> is illuminated, thus the detector <b>154</b> is on and the input voltage is pulled down to logic low.
