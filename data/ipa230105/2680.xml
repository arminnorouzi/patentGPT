However, over the years, with increased regulations and levies on landfills, the percentage of the post-consumer waste being recycled or incinerated for energy recovery is gradually increasing.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Attempts have been made to crack the plastic into useful products using conventional cracking apparatus that are used for cracking of petroleum derived feeds such as gas oils.

The process includes introducing a catalyst into the reactor using dilute-phase pneumatic transfer of regenerated catalyst coupled with the reactor via cyclone, standpipe, or vessel-dipleg system. The process includes pyrolyzing the plastic component to form a pyrolysis product. The process includes removing the pyrolysis product from the reactor via a second conduit disposed at a top &#xbd; height of the reactor. The process includes removing the catalyst from the reactor via a third conduit disposed at a bottom &#xbd; height of the reactor, wherein the catalyst removed from the reactor comprises ash. The process includes introducing the catalyst from the third conduit to a separator to form a catalyst-rich phase and an ash-rich phase in the separator.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, provided is an apparatus including one or more nozzles coupled with a reactor. The nozzle includes an inlet disposed substantially perpendicular to a horizontal conduit disposed in the nozzle. The apparatus includes a riser coupled with the reactor. The apparatus includes a first outlet conduit disposed at a top &#xbd; height of the reactor. The first outlet conduit is coupled with a cyclone separator. The apparatus includes a second outlet conduit disposed at a bottom &#xbd; height of the reactor. The second outlet conduit is coupled with a second separator. The apparatus includes a regenerator coupled with the second separator and the riser.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Apparatus and processes of the present disclosure provide high throughput of pyrolysis products formed using pyrolysis of plastic. Processes can be performed as a single-stage process, providing higher yields than conventional processes for processing waste plastic. Apparatus and processes of the present disclosure provide elutriation of char, char ash, attrited catalyst, and co-injection material such that spent catalyst can be easily regenerated, providing improved throughput of the pyrolysis products in addition to higher purity of recycled catalyst to the reactor. In addition, use of catalyst having a narrow size distribution and larger average diameter than the co-injection material provides elutriation of co-injection material from the catalyst in the reactor. In addition, use of catalyst having a large average diameter, in addition to a reactor configured to provide bubble control, provides reduced plugging and wear of vessel conduits, valves, and other apparatus components, providing maintained integrity and a longer life cycle of apparatus of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In addition, use of a separator of the present disclosure provides improved throughput of pyrolysis products because of improved separation of spent catalyst from components such as ash. Throughput is improved using the separator because, inter alia, the time intervals between apparatus shutdown can be lengthened because catalyst can remain viable (e.g., the catalyst is regenerated). A separator of the present disclosure can also provide improved regeneration of spent catalyst (because ash is removed in the separator), which further improves throughput and yield of pyrolysis products.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Reactor Conditions</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, provided is a process including introducing a plastic melt including a plastic component into a reactor via one or more nozzles coupled with the reactor. The process includes introducing a catalyst into the reactor by pneumatic transfer via a first conduit coupling the reactor with a riser. For example, the process may include introducing a catalyst into the reactor using dilute-phase pneumatic transfer of regenerated catalyst coupled with the reactor via cyclone-dipleg system. The process includes pyrolyzing the plastic component to form a pyrolysis product.

Apparatus <b>100</b> includes a pyrolysis reactor <b>102</b>, a riser <b>102</b><i>a</i>, a first separator <b>104</b>, a second separator <b>106</b>, and a regenerator <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A plastic melt is introduced into pyrolysis reactor <b>102</b> via nozzle <b>110</b>. The plastic melt can include any suitable plastic material, such as plastic scrap, automotive plastic waste, thermoplastics, thermosets, or combination(s) thereof. The plastic melt can include one or more plastics such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate, polyvinylchloride, or combination(s) thereof. The plastics can be obtained from recyclable plastics. For example, a bale comprising the plastics can be sorted into a plurality of portions, where at least one of the portions comprises one or more of the plastics. In some embodiments, the plastic melt is introduced into the reactor at a rate of about 60,000 lb/hr to about 100,000 lb/hr, such as about 75,000 lb/hr to about 85,000 lb/hr. The plastic melt can be provided to the nozzle <b>110</b> by a plastic melt source (not shown) that can be configured to provide heat to the plastic to form the plastic melt. In some embodiments, the plastic melt, upon being introduced to the reactor, has a solids (e.g., char) content of about 20 wt % or less upon introduction into reactor <b>102</b>, such as about 15 wt % or less, such as about 10 wt % or less, such as about 5 wt % or less, such as about 1 wt % or less.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The plastic melt may further include a viscosity reducing agent. For example, a viscosity reducing agent can be a recycled portion of pyrolysis product, such as an organic compound (e.g., aromatic or mono-olefin), such as an ethylene, a propylene, a butene, a benzene, a toluene, a xylene, or combination(s) thereof. The viscosity reducing agent may, additionally or alternatively, include a paraffinic organic compound such as a C<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>100 </sub>paraffin, such as a C<sub>6</sub>-C<sub>50 </sub>paraffin, such as a C<sub>10</sub>-C<sub>30 </sub>paraffin. The viscosity reducing agent can be introduced to the plastic melt in the plastic melt source (not shown) or nozzle <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, a weight ratio of plastic to viscosity reducing agent (upon introduction to the reactor) is about 0.5:1 to about 1.5:1, such as about 1:1. In some embodiments where the plastic melt includes a viscosity reducing agent, the plastic melt is introduced into the reactor at a rate of about 60,000 lb/hr to about 200,000 lb/hr, such as about 120,000 lb/hr to about 200,000 lb/hr, such as about 148,000 lb/hr to about 172,000 lb/hr.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A catalyst can be introduced into the pyrolysis reactor <b>102</b> via a first conduit <b>112</b>.

In some embodiments, the catalyst is introduced into reactor <b>102</b> via the first conduit <b>112</b> at a catalyst flow rate of about 5.5 tons per minute to about 13.8 tons per minute, such as about 7.5 tons per minute to about 12.4 tons per minute. In some embodiments, the catalyst disposed in the riser <b>102</b><i>a </i>has a minimum gas fluidization velocity of about 0.4 ft/sec to about 0.6 ft/sec. In some embodiments, a weight ratio of catalyst to feed (e.g., plastic melt with or without viscosity reducing agent) in reactor <b>102</b> is about 15:1 to about 5:1, such as about 11:1 to about 7:1, such as about 9:1.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The pyrolysis product is removed from reactor <b>102</b> via a second conduit <b>114</b> disposed at a top &#xbd; height of the reactor. The catalyst is removed from reactor <b>102</b> via a third conduit <b>116</b> disposed at a bottom &#xbd; height of the reactor. For example, the catalyst can be removed from the reactor via third conduit <b>116</b>, where third conduit <b>116</b> is disposed at a bottom surface of the reactor <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, reactor <b>102</b> is a bubbling bed reactor. Alternatively, a fluidized bed reactor, slurry reactor, rotating kiln reactor, or packed bed reactor may be used. The plastic melt (e.g., without viscosity reducing agent) can have a temperature of about 900&#xb0; F. to about 1,100&#xb0; F., such as about 1,000&#xb0; F. to about 1,050&#xb0; F., alternatively about 900&#xb0; F. to about 1,020&#xb0; F., during introducing the plastic melt into the reactor. Alternatively, the plastic melt (e.g., with viscosity reducing agent) can have a temperature of about 300&#xb0; F. to about 700&#xb0; F., such as about 350&#xb0; F. to about 665&#xb0; F., during introducing the plastic melt into the reactor.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, a reactor temperature during pyrolysis of the plastic melt is about 900&#xb0; F. to about 1,100&#xb0; F., such as about 1,000&#xb0; F. to about 1,050&#xb0; F., alternatively about 900&#xb0; F. to about 1,020&#xb0; F. For example, pyrolyzing the plastic may be performed at a reactor temperature of about 900&#xb0; F. to about 1,100&#xb0; F., such as about 1,000&#xb0; F. to about 1,050&#xb0; F., and/or a reactor pressure of about 20 psig to about 40 psig, such as about 27 psig to about 33 psig.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Pyrolysis of the present disclosure can provide the pyrolysis product such that the pyrolysis product includes valuable monomers of light gas olefins and aromatics, such as benzene, toluene, xylenes, or combination(s) thereof. The process yields are tunable to the desired yields of olefins and aromatics by using a combination of the catalyst, reactor setup, and process operating conditions. The pyrolysis product can include an organic compound, such as a C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>12 </sub>hydrocarbon. In some embodiments, the pyrolysis product includes an organic compound selected from the group consisting of ethylene, propylene, and combination(s) thereof. In some embodiments, the pyrolysis product includes an organic compound selected from the group consisting of an ethylene, a propylene, a butene, a benzene, a toluene, a xylene, and combination(s) thereof.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, in addition to the catalyst, a co-injection particle is introduced into reactor <b>102</b>. For example, a co-injection particle can be introduced into reactor <b>102</b> via nozzle <b>110</b> at a rate of about 1,000 lb/hr to about 3,000 lb/hr. In some embodiments, a co-injection particle is a particle configured to trap halogens (e.g., fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine present in polymers or contaminants of the plastic melt). During the pyrolysis process, such halogens may appear as unwanted contaminants in desired pyrolysis products, or they may be deposited on or react with pyrolysis catalyst components, thereby reducing desirable catalyst properties such as activity and selectivity to desired pyrolysis products. Further, such halogens may be deposited on or react with mechanical components of the pyrolysis system, leading to damage, reduced efficiency or mechanical failure.

Processes can be performed as a single-stage process, providing higher yields than conventional processes for processing waste plastic. Apparatus and processes of the present disclosure provide elutriation of char, attrited catalyst, and co-injection material such that spent catalyst can be easily regenerated, providing improved throughput of plastic pyrolysis in addition to higher purity of recycled catalyst to the reactor. In addition, use of catalyst having a narrow size distribution and larger average diameter than the co-injection material provides the elutriation of co-injection material. In addition, use of catalyst having a large average diameter, in addition to a reactor configured to provide bubble control, provides reduced plugging and wear of vessel conduits, valves, and other apparatus components, providing maintained integrity and a longer life cycle of apparatus of the present disclosure. In addition, use of a separator of the present disclosure provides improved throughput of pyrolysis products because of improved separation of spent catalyst from components such as ash. Throughput is improved using the separator because, inter alia, the time intervals between apparatus shutdown can be lengthened because catalyst can remain viable (e.g., the catalyst is regenerated).
