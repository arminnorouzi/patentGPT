In this image forming apparatus, when the motor is rotated reversely, a photosensitive drum rotates reversely, whereas a developing roller is kept stopped while being pressed against the photosensitive drum. A developing cartridge includes a coupling that receives a driving force from a body of an image forming apparatus. Furthermore, an image forming apparatus is known in which toner is supplied appropriately from a developer cartridge to a casing of a developing cartridge in accordance with the amount of toner remaining in the casing of the developing cartridge. This image forming apparatus is configured as follows. A lever provided on the body is moved by activating a solenoid of the apparatus body, and the lever provided on the body accesses a lever provided on the developing cartridge, whereby toner is supplied.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present application may note that, in the known image forming apparatus, however, the developing roller cannot be rotated in the same direction in both cases where the coupling is rotated clockwise and counterclockwise. The present application may also note separately that, in the known apparatus, toner cannot be supplied to a developing chamber of the developing cartridge only by the operation of the coupling and that there is a demand for a developing device in which toner can be supplied with required timing only by the operation of a coupling.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, one aspect of disclosure provides a developing device in which a developing roller rotates in the same direction in either case where a coupling is rotated clockwise or counterclockwise. Another aspect of disclosure provides a developing device in which toner can be supplied to a developing chamber only by the operation of a coupling</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of an image forming apparatus.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a developing device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating one side of the developing device in the axial direction.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view illustrating the one side of the developing device in the axial direction, with a gear cover removed.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating the one side of the developing device in the axial direction, with the gear cover removed.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> includes an exploded perspective view illustrating a coupling gear, a clutch, and a second gear;

The second gear <b>32</b> has a greater diameter than the coupling gear <b>22</b>B. Therefore, when the coupling <b>22</b> is rotated in the clockwise direction D<b>1</b>, the first gear <b>31</b> is rotated at a speed increased by the moving gear <b>33</b>. In contrast, when the coupling <b>22</b> is rotated in the counterclockwise direction D<b>2</b>, the first gear <b>31</b> is rotated at a speed increased by the second gear <b>32</b>.

Therefore, the toner T can be supplied from the toner accommodation chamber <b>11</b>B to the developing chamber <b>11</b>A with required timing only by the operation of the coupling <b>22</b>.
