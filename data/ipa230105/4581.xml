This information is typically related to a person's goals, e.g. the innovation they're attempting to create. A part of this effort is discovering related work. For example, most academic publications include a background section describing related work.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Current techniques for information retrieval make an assumption that a user's query is to be matched against existing material such as documents. A search engine such as that provided by Google&#xae; is an information retrieval system. Google's search illustrates the IR assumption described above: each link brings a user to an existing document or web page in other words, a tenet of information retrieval is the existence of material that corresponds to a user's query.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the case of concepts such as innovation, projects, etc., however, multiple files relate to various aspects of the concept. For example, multiple files document the course of innovation. These can include project planning and scoping documents to experimental results and scorecards. This information tends to live in disparate sources, locations and formats. Rarely is the innovation, the collection of all documentation along with the relationship between documents, represented or captured, yet those participating in the innovation are fundamentally aware of the innovation's holistic nature. Users cannot easily and quickly find all project documents related to an innovation project or initiative. This leaves the user with an incomplete picture of related work and makes it difficult for an institution or person to avoid past mistakes.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Search and retrieval of data associated with innovation projects thus represents a particular challenge to traditional IR techniques. While a particular search term may be used to retrieve certain documents, the holistic nature of an innovation project, and the relationships between documents, is not retrievable/searchable. These challenges do not exist only in the case of innovation projects, but more generally for any collection of documents related to a concept that has no persistent representation.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, systems and methods that enable associating data with non-material concepts remains highly desirable, for instance to allow for subsequent searching and retrieval.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description.

While traditional information retrieval techniques perform searching where each returned result corresponds to a material document, the systems and methods disclosed herein associate data with non-material concepts such that the holistic nature of the concept, including different stages of the concept and data associated with the different stages of the concept, can be searched and retrieved.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In accordance with the present disclosure, a concept definition is received that defines a structure to the non-material concept. The concept definition comprises a concept identifier used for identifying data associated with the concept, and a plurality of discrete stages of the concept. A piece of data, such as a document, web page, etc., can be retrieved from public or private data sources and analyzed to determine if the data corresponds to the concept, and if the data corresponds to the concept, determines at least one discrete stage of the concept definition that the data corresponds to. The data is stored in association with the concept identifier and the at least one discrete stage to allow for subsequent searching and retrieval. When a search request relating to the concept is received, the data associated with the different stages of the concept can be retrieved and output in a manner to capture the holistic nature of the concept.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In accordance with the present disclosure, a holistic view of a non-material concept (for example, a complete innovation project) can be searched and retrieved when searching for either the concept itself or when searching for related works to a different concept. This gives users a complete view of non-material concepts such as an innovation project or initiative and helps institutions or individuals build on previous work. The retrieved data related to the non-material concept can be represented and output as a material document for the purpose of search and retrieval. In accordance with the present disclosure, users may be able to search for and interact with a non-material concept, thus providing a complete and holistic view of the non-material concept. An advantage of being able to search and interact with a non-material concept is to provide a better understanding of past work including possibly past mistakes, that could not otherwise be easily searchable or evident from a disparate collection of documents. Accordingly, institutions/people embarking on a similar project can learn from previous projects and avoid past mistakes.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In accordance with the present disclosure, material data is data that has a persistent representation. Material data exist and can be loaded by an application that understands the data format. An example of material data is a Microsoft Word&#x2122; or Excel&#x2122; document, for example, but is not limited to such, and may also encompass various types of files, a web page, etc. Accordingly, material data is some data having a particular format that may be viewed with a particular application. In contrast, non-material data is data that has no persistent representation. For example, a non-material concept may be related to a collection of material data, but does not itself have a persistent representation. However, in accordance with the systems and methods disclosed herein, it is possible to associate the material data with the non-material concept in a manner that allows for representing the non-material concept with a persistent representation.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">While the following description may describe particular implementations of the systems and methods with reference to innovation projects, a person skilled in the art will appreciate that the systems and methods disclosed herein may be applicable to data associated with various types of non-material concepts that do not have a persistent representation, and may in particular be applied to any concept that may be represented by a directed graph or partially ordered set such as initiatives or projects having a workflow or data flow with a plurality of discrete stages.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Embodiments are described below, by way of example only, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a flow diagram of associating data with non-material concepts and retrieving data associated with the non-material concepts. Data such as documents, numerical data, graphs, web pages, etc., are stored in various locations such as the Internet, private/public databases, SharePoint&#x2122;, etc. These data are ingested into a processing system that associates relevant data with a non-material concept, computes relationships between the data, stores these relationships and, upon being queried, retrieves a non-material concept and outputs the data related to the non-material concept, which may for example be a representation of the concept.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Designer <b>102</b> is a component of the system and provides a user interface and a mechanism for a user to define a concept definition. A user interacts with designer <b>102</b> to define a concept definition which defines a structure of the concept and comprises a concept identifier and a plurality of discrete stages of the concept. A concept identifier may for example be a name of the concept (for example, a project name). In another example, the concept identifier may be a numerical identifier such as a project number, etc. The concept identifier may comprise one or more identifiers (e.g. a project name and a project number). In general, the concept identifier is an identifier that is able to uniquely identify the concept. The plurality of discrete stages of the concept are inter-related, with each discrete stage being related to at least one other discrete stage of the concept. The plurality of discrete stages may vary in time. Each concept definition may thus be represented as a directed graph comprising a plurality of discrete stages as nodes and interdependencies between the plurality of discrete stages such as the order in which the stages occur defining edges connecting the nodes. The user further provides any other relevant information defining each stage via the designer <b>102</b>, such as a time period that the stage occurred, classes of data and/or data content associated with the stage, etc. Thus, the concept definition captures stages defining the concept, and may define classes of data and/or data content related to each stage, and a workflow/relationships between the different stages.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a representation of an example concept definition. The concept definition comprises a concept identifier <b>200</b> that is used for identifying the concept. As described above, the concept definition further defines a plurality of discrete stages, which may be represented by nodes in a directed graph. For example, the representation of the concept definition shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> may represent a particular initiative such as an innovation project. The project has several stages represented as nodes in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, starting with proof of need <b>202</b>, followed by project proposal <b>204</b>, kick-off meeting <b>206</b>, scoping <b>208</b>, R&#x26;D <b>210</b>, testing <b>212</b>, and lastly a final deliverable <b>214</b>. Based on the information provided by the user, interdependencies between stages can be defined which are represented by arrows between nodes. For example, project proposal <b>24</b> follows proof of need <b>202</b>, kick-off meeting <b>206</b> follows project proposal <b>204</b>, etc. Stages may also be performed simultaneously or in overlapping relationship to one another. For example, the bi-directional arrow between R&#x26;D <b>210</b> and testing <b>212</b> represents the recursive manner that these stages may be performed. Moreover, based on input provided by the user, metadata may be used to define each of the stages, and metadata <b>202</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>a</i>, <b>206</b><i>a</i>, <b>208</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>212</b><i>a</i>, and <b>214</b><i>a</i>, is shown as associated with respective nodes. The metadata may for example define a time period that the stage occurred, classes of data and/or data content associated with the stage, etc. The directed graph may have associated therewith a timeline in relation to the respective nodes, as for example is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Note that the concept definition may comprise more or less information associated with stages of the concept than that which has been described above.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The specific manner in which the concept definition is defined/received is not particularly limited. For example, a user may be provided with a software tool in a user interface such as the designer <b>102</b> that allows them to generate a concept definition in a manner such as that which is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. A concept definition could also be viewed as a template from which multiple concept definitions are created, and a user may input information into the template. Alternatively, a user may simply input information defining the concept and stages thereof into the user interface for use by the system in associating data to the concept. That is, a representation of the concept such as that which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> need not necessarily be created by the user of the designer <b>102</b>, and may instead be created based on the information provided by the user, including after data has been associated to the stages of the concept definition as further described below. Moreover, the concept definition may be represented textually, graphically, a combination of text/graphics, etc., and the representation of the concept definition shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is solely for the sake of example only.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, concept definitions <b>114</b>, which comprise the concept definition generated by the designer <b>102</b>, are passed to an AI module <b>106</b> for use in classification of data and associating the data to the concept defined in the concept definition.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Data <b>108</b> is provided to a data ingestion component <b>110</b>. The data <b>108</b> may be provided or retrieved from various disparate sources, including public and/or private databases, the Internet, etc. For example, a client may have a private database that they wish to have ingested to associate data to a particular project. In another example, an academic researcher may wish to search all public data related to a particular initiative. The data <b>108</b> may be a dataset, wherein some data is associated with the concept and some data is not associated with the concept. The data ingestion component <b>110</b> transforms the data <b>108</b> into a standard data format <b>112</b>, which is then passed to the AI module <b>106</b> for use in associating the data to the concept defined in the concept definition.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The data ingestion process is more particularly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, which shows a flow diagram of how data is ingested and transformed for associating data with non-material concepts. A data connector component <b>304</b> connects with a data source <b>302</b>, which may comprise various data, by running an appropriate application to open the data in its original data format and extract data therefrom. Only one data connector component <b>304</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> but it would be appreciated that there may be a plurality of data connector components. A transformer component <b>306</b> performs a process whereby data in various original formats such as Word, PDF, a database record, etc. are converted into a standard form and format and output as standard data <b>308</b>. One standard form and format may be JSON with agreed upon structural conventions such as how text or tables are captured. Converting the data to a standard format via the data connector component <b>304</b> and transformer component <b>306</b> provide an abstraction from the existing original data that allows internal processing used in associating the data to non-material concepts to be agnostic of certain details. The standard data <b>308</b> may also have associated metadata that is captured. For example, for any particular data (e.g., a Word document), a processing time timestamp, a unique identifier of the original data (e.g, a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) or Uniform Resource Locator (URL)), content representation (e.g., sha1 hash), a data creation timestamp, etc., may be captured/stored. In general, only non-sensitive metadata may be stored (e.g. no personal information), though this may depend on the particular application. Further, the original data may or may not itself be stored, as the unique identifier of the original data may be used for retrieving the original data, though one could store the original data for another purpose such as speed in retrieval.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The metadata associated with the standard data, in particular the unique identifier of the original data and the content representation, allows the data ingestion process to identify new, removed, and modified data. For example, new data would have no existing unique identifier whereas modified data may be recognized by changes in timestamp and/or content representation of data associated with an existing unique identifier. Removed or deleted data may be identified by attempting to access the original data using it's unique identifier and determining that the original data no longer exists. A cache and messaging component <b>310</b> may send create, update or delete messages <b>312</b> based on the metadata associated with the standard data to interested modules/components such as the AI module <b>106</b> and storage and indexing component <b>116</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, as described in more detail below. The messages may contain the metadata associated with the standard data as well as any other relevant data, and may for example include the unique identifier of the original data and/or a unique identifier of the standard data (e.g. a URL link, tagged as &#x201c;url&#x201d;), a temporary or permanent storage location of the standard data (e.g. Google cloud storage&#x2014;tagged as &#x201c;standoc_url&#x201d;), and an operation (e.g. create&#x2014;New document, update&#x2014;old updated document, delete&#x2014;removed document) etc. Appropriate modules/components may then request the standard data and associated metadata depending on processing needs. Where the standard data is to be processed, such as new or modified data, the cache and messaging component <b>310</b> may temporarily store the standard data in a cache <b>314</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the AI module <b>106</b> performs processing on the standard data <b>112</b> based on the concept definitions <b>104</b> to classify the standard data and associate relevant data with a non-material concept. The AI module <b>106</b> may receive a message from the data ingestion component <b>110</b>, such as message <b>312</b> from the cache and messaging component <b>310</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, and if appropriate, retrieves standard data to be processed from the cache <b>314</b>. If the message received from the cache and messaging component is to delete data, the AI module <b>106</b> would do nothing. The standard data is processed to determine correlation of the data with a concept, and more specifically is processed to determine whether the data is associated with a concept identifier of a concept definition, and to determine a stage of the concept definition <b>104</b> that the data is associated with (e.g. a particular project and a node of the project). The AI module <b>106</b> uses the concept definitions <b>104</b> to group data such as documents by concept and to recognize which stage of the concept each piece of data is associated with. In other words, the AI module <b>106</b> attempts to associate data with stages of a concept as defined by the concept definition.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">For each data retrieved from the standard data <b>112</b>, the AI module <b>106</b> performs processing to determine whether the data corresponds to a concept identifier from among the concept definitions received. The concept identifier may be derived from the standard data's original location (e.g., subcomponent of a file path. URL of a web page, etc.) or from the data itself (e.g., extracted from a table, header or footer). These identifiers are often in prominent locations of the data are thus typically able to be readily extracted. In some cases, however, a concept identifier may not be readily discernible from the standard data or its metadata. In such situations, the AI module <b>106</b> may perform data classification to determine a data class of the standard data, as further described below. Determining the standard data's data class, such as what type of document the standard data best corresponds to, may be used to help identify the concept identifier that the standard corresponds to, such as by determining whether a discrete stage of a concept definition exists that would contain data of the determined data class.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The AI module <b>106</b> further performs processing to determine at least one discrete stage of the concept definition the data corresponds to. The data may typically only correspond to one discrete stage of the concept definition, though it is also possible that the data may correspond to more than one discrete stage. Determining the at least one discrete stage of the concept definition that the data corresponds to may be performed using the metadata of the standard data and the metadata of the discrete stages/nodes defined in the concept definition. Additionally or alternatively, the standard data's data class (e.g. whether the standard data is a scoping document, a test document, etc.) may be determined from the standard data by comparing the standard data against known data specimens that have been previously classified and stored. Similarity between standard data and the data specimens may be measured based on the original data format (e.g., docx, xlsx, pdf), general data structure (e.g., number of tables, text blocks, and images), and data content (e.g., main topics, text blocks sections, subsections, and layout). For example, a proposal document may have a generalized specimen format that can be used to identify whether the standard data corresponds to a scoping document and should be associated with a proposal stage of an initiative. Similarly, standard data with numerical values, tables, and graphs may be discernible as data belonging to a testing stage of an initiative or project. The standard data is associated with at least one discrete stage of the concept definition that it best matches based on its data class. The AI module <b>106</b> may for example evaluate a distance function that outputs a value indicating matching/distance. When the concept identifier associated with the standard data has already been determined, there are a limited number of discrete stages of the concept definition that the standard data may be associated with.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The AI module <b>106</b> may be initially trained by classifying data according to data class using known data specimens and matching to pre-defined stages. Further, any incorrect associations may be identified by a user and correct associations provided as feedback to the AI module <b>106</b> for continued learning. The AI module <b>16</b> may for example be a function that outputs the distance/similarity value, or it may use another standard classification technique. Alternatively, the AI module <b>106</b> could utilize a recurrent neural network, for example, operating on document pairs.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The foregoing processing of determining whether data is associated with a concept identifier and associating the data with a stage of the concept definition may also be performed collectively for groups of related data. Related data may for example comprise data that are part of a same dataset, are associated with a same data location, sub-folder, etc. Performing processing on groups of related data may be beneficial where determinations/associations are challenging, as the group of related data may be compared against concept definitions, data classes, etc., to disambiguate the data which may appear to match several concept definitions or data classes. As one non-limiting example, if a concept identifier is not readily identifiable from data in a dataset, it may be easier to consider the dataset as a whole to find a corresponding concept definition that the dataset matches, and thus determine the concept identifier.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The AI module <b>106</b> terminates after processing all standard data and associating relevant standard data with an associated concept identifier and at least one discrete stage of the concept definition. The associated data <b>114</b> comprises the standard data that is associated with a concept identifier and discrete stage of the concept definition, which information is sufficient to store the associated data for later retrieval and presentation, as described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The associated data <b>114</b> is stored and indexed in a storage and indexing database <b>116</b>. The concept definitions <b>104</b> are also stored in storage and indexing database <b>116</b>. Other standard data, such as that which is not associated with a concept definition, may also be stored in the storage and indexing database <b>116</b> as such data may still be queried/searched. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a flow diagram of how the associated data <b>114</b> is stored and indexed.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, associated data <b>402</b>, such as that which is represented as associated data <b>114</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, is processed for storage <b>404</b>. In one implementation, the associated data is processed for storage in association with the concept definition that the respective standard data is associated to. For example, standard data associated with a concept definition may be used to generate/populate a representation of a concept definition by associating each piece of standard data that is associated with the concept identifier to a corresponding stage of the concept represented as a node. In some aspects, such as if a representation of the concept definition is not generated at the initial designer component, a graphical representation of the concept definition, or certain aspects thereof such as certain edges/interdependencies, may be generated based on the associated data. For example, the standard data metadata, such as file name, time created, etc., may be used to infer the relationships between stages. As an example, if two documents are associated with different stages and have different document creation times, the document creation times of the documents may be used to infer which stage occurred first and draw a directed edge between two nodes. If documents associated with different stages share similar document creation times, this may infer that the different stages occurred simultaneously or in overlap. As another example, a CAD model associated with one stage may have a file name of: &#x201c;Revised design in response to stress test&#x201d;, which could be used to infer that a testing stage and the R&#x26;D stage are interrelated. An instance of the concept definition (such as a graphical representation) populated with associated data may be stored in storage <b>406</b>. The concept definition may also be stored in association with a unique identifier to facilitate retrieval.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Additionally or alternatively, during the storage processing step <b>404</b>, it is also possible to create other types of data that represents a non-material concept, such as an initiative instance, for the purpose of indexing, storage and retrieval. Creation of this representative data depends on engineering consideration (e.g., storage space or processing time) and user considerations (e.g., importance of the user to solely interact with the non-material concept, preferred representations of the non-material concept to users, etc.). In cases where there is value in creating another representation of the non-material concept then one may be created. For example, the associated data could be summarized, using machine summarization techniques, and the automatically generated summary could be stored as an additional or alternative representation of the non-material initiative instance. This representation may also be stored in association with a unique identifier to facilitate retrieval.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Furthermore, the associated data <b>402</b> may be processed for indexing <b>408</b>. Processing associated data <b>402</b> for indexing may comprise generating an index for use in retrieval of the concept definition in response to a user's search query. Having stored the data associated with the concept (e.g by generating a representation of the concept definition), an index may be populated with a record that comprises information such as a storage location of the concept definition, an identifier of the concept definition such as the concept identifier or the unique identifier associated with the concept definition in storage <b>406</b>, etc. Creating an index populated with such records facilitates retrieval of the concept definition since the storage <b>406</b> does not have to be processed to search for a concept definition in response to a search query, but instead the index can be searched more quickly. Processing for storage in an index may include some natural language processing such as language identification, tokenization and calculating asemantic representation of the standard data. The record(s) is/are stored in an index database <b>410</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Note that while the foregoing description of storage and indexing with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> has been in relation to associated data, it will be appreciated that other standard data which has not been associated to a concept definition may also be stored and indexed for the purpose of subsequent searching and retrieval.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a query <b>118</b> created by a machine or user to request to retrieve specific information may be received, for example using conventional search infrastructure. When the query <b>118</b> is received, a set of validation, authentication and authorization checks may be performed. The query <b>118</b> is processed in preparation for submission to an information retrieval module <b>120</b>, such as an enterprise search system backed by Apache Solr&#x2122;. The information retrieval module <b>120</b> executes a search ranking algorithm on the information stored in the storage and indexing database <b>116</b> based on the query <b>118</b> to determine results that are relevant to the query. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that various types searching algorithms may be employed.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The results of information retrieval are presented to the user, for example as an output <b>122</b> in a user interface. Users may select a particular result, or a result may be automatically selected for them. Results may contain material items (e.g., documents) with no relation to non-material concepts, material items related to non-material concepts such as an initiative instance, or the non-material concept itself through a constructed representation.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">If a non-material concept is directly or indirectly selected then a process may be undertaken to reconstruct the non-material concept.
