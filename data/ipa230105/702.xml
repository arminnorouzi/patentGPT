The rails <b>144</b>, <b>148</b> are generally two opposing L-shaped members that are inserted into the respective grooves <b>142</b>, <b>146</b>, allowing motion in a first direction (e.g., illustrated as movement along a y-direction) and preventing separation in a second direction that is perpendicular to the first direction (e.g., illustrated as movement along an x-direction). The housing <b>140</b> may slidably couple with the control box <b>130</b> for convenient engagement and disengagement of the manifold assembly <b>22</b> with the mattress <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The blower <b>112</b> and the manifold assembly <b>22</b> are disposed substantially within the housing <b>140</b>, providing a compact assembly within the mattress <b>16</b> for adjusting the bladders <b>20</b>. The housing <b>140</b> includes a selectively removable top <b>150</b> to access an interior <b>152</b> of the housing <b>140</b>. The blower <b>112</b> and the manifold assembly <b>22</b> operate to direct fluid into and out of the bladders <b>20</b>. Generally, the fluid is air but may be other fluid without departing from the teachings herein. The blower <b>112</b> generally includes an intake tube <b>160</b> that extends partially outside of the housing <b>140</b>.

The tubing <b>198</b> directs fluid between the manifold assembly <b>22</b> and the bladders <b>20</b> based on the operation of the pneumatic system <b>110</b>. The tubing <b>198</b> fits about ends <b>200</b> of the outlet engagement tubes <b>196</b> to fluidly couple the manifold core <b>24</b> to the bladders <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The manifold assembly <b>22</b>, including the engagements between the manifold assembly <b>22</b> and the various tubing <b>174</b>, <b>198</b> of the pneumatic system <b>110</b>, is an airtight assembly to prevent leakage of the fluid moving through the pneumatic system <b>110</b>. For example, in various locations, the manifold assembly <b>22</b> includes a sealant <b>202</b> to provide this airtight engagement. The sealant <b>202</b> is generally grease disposed between two coupled components.

The support frame <b>210</b> and the support member <b>214</b> each retain the selected position of the supported components (i.e., the blower <b>112</b> and the manifold core <b>24</b>, respectively), including the spacing between the supported components. In this way, the spacing and arrangement between the blower <b>112</b> and the manifold core <b>24</b> are retained as the mattress <b>16</b> is moved, the patient moves on the mattress <b>16</b>, or as pressure through the pneumatic system <b>110</b> changes.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The housing <b>140</b> may include a filter <b>216</b> on one side <b>218</b> thereof. The filter <b>216</b> is coupled to the housing <b>140</b> via a retainer <b>220</b>. The filter <b>216</b> allows air to flow into and out of the housing <b>140</b>. It is contemplated that air removed from the bladders <b>20</b> may be released into the interior <b>152</b> of the housing <b>140</b>. This filter <b>216</b> may be advantageous for allowing air to flow from the housing <b>140</b> to reduce a buildup pressure around the manifold assembly <b>22</b>.

In such examples, the deflated condition may be a less inflated condition than a previous state of the bladders <b>20</b> (i.e., some amount of air released from the bladders <b>20</b>), and the inflated condition may be a more inflated condition (i.e., some amount of air directed into the bladders <b>20</b>).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the manifold assembly <b>22</b> includes the support member <b>214</b>, which has a base <b>240</b> and a support wall <b>242</b> extending from the base <b>240</b>. The support wall <b>242</b> is generally positioned in a central location on the base <b>240</b>, allowing components to be supported on each side of the support wall <b>242</b> over the base <b>240</b>. The manifold assembly <b>22</b> includes a motor assembly <b>244</b>, which is positioned substantially on a first side <b>246</b> of the support wall <b>242</b>. The motor assembly <b>244</b> includes the motor <b>42</b> and a driveshaft <b>248</b> coupled to the motor <b>42</b>.
