Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to a pipeline inspection system, and more specifically, to a pipeline inspection system having a novel structure, able to scan a pipeline, gather image information in real time while moving along an old pipeline, transfer the image information and location information to a server via a communications module, store the image information and the location information as attributes of BIM drawings, and inspect a state of the pipeline through the information transferred to the server, and which can remove scale accumulated on the inner wall of the pipeline with ultrasonic vibrations so as to continuously maintain the pipeline and to take a proactive approach to maintenance.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In general, various kinds of pipes, including water supply conduits, are provided inside a building. Particularly, water containing a large amount of lime may flow in the water supply conduit. Because lime scale is generated in the pipeline when being used for a long time, there may be a reduction of the lifespan of the pipeline or a blockage of the pipeline. Moreover, such a pipeline requires continuous maintenance when aging together with the building. However, there has been no method for reviewing an aged pipeline when an owner of a building transfers ownership of the building. Therefore, a method for solving the problem is required.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Existing maintenance means a repair after a failure. That is, a method for taking action after a water leakage has been generated in a pipe is applied. This causes a physical loss due to water leakage and a temporal monetary penalty.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Meanwhile, since the pipe is buried in a floor or a wall surface of a building, in order to maintain the pipe, it is necessary to maintain the pipe using a thermal imaging camera, an endoscope, or an ultrasonic inspection device, but it is very difficult to maintain the pipe.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, a method of removing scale in the pipe using a fast flow rate by increasing the water pressure in the pipe is applied in some fields, but it is difficult to expect a significant effect, and accidents in which old pipes are damaged are frequently generated.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Korean Patent Publication No. 10-2011-0048652 discloses a cleaning device for a pipe, for removing rust, scale, and slime formed inside a pipe of a building using ozone generated by an ozone generator, and for performing washing and sterilization at the same time, comprising: a pump connected to a raw water supply pipe to which raw water is supplied; a magnetized water generator mounted on the raw water supply pipe to magnetize the raw water supplied to the pump with magnetic force to generate magnetized water; a compressor for generating high-pressure compressed air; a supply pipe connected to the compressor and connected to one side of the pump to supply the compressed air to the pump; an injector mounted on the supply pipe to intake and supply the compressed air and ozone generated by the ozone generator to the pump together; a discharge pipe connecting the pump and the main pipe of the building to each other; and a mixer mounted on the discharge pipe so that the washing water generated by mixing the ozone and the magnetized water passing through the pump is supplied to the main pipe of the building.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, Korean Patent No. 10-2026930 discloses a technology of removing scale, slime, and foreign matter in a water supply pipe using water and pneumatic pressure, the technology comprising: a main body including a housing, which has an empty space formed therein by an open upper surface, a water inlet and a water outlet disposed at the lower area of both side surfaces of the outer face, and an air inlet formed in an upper area of one side surface thereof, a dashboard which is detachably mounted on the upper portion of the housing to allow a user to control the device and to display a used state, and a cover hinge-coupled to an upper end of the rear surface of the housing to cover the dashboard; a pipe washing device including a washing unit, which is mounted inside the housing of the main body, and which has a water injection pipe communicating with the water inlet, a first valve, a water flow pipe, a second valve, and a water discharge pipe which are connected in order, wherein the water discharge pipe is connected to the water outlet and a water supply pump is disposed to supply water to the water injection pipe, and an air supply pipe communicating with the air inlet, an air supply pump, and an air discharge pipe, wherein the air discharge pipe is connected to one side of the water discharge pipe; and a fixing module which is installed in a water pipe to be washed.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additionally, Korean Utility Model Registration No. 20-0389135 discloses a pipe cleaning device comprising: an injector mounted on a connection part of a supply pipe of a pump connected to a water tank and an ozone input pipe to simultaneously introduce water supplied through the pump and ozone generated by an ozone generator; a mixer connected to an injection port of the injector to uniformly mix the water and the ozone passing through the injector; and a bubble generating unit mounted between the mixer and a pipe of a building to generate a large amount of bubbles.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The conventional art teaches extending the service life of pipes by washing the inside of the pipes without replacing old pipes. However, the conventional art exhibits insufficient effect in removing scale accumulated for a long period of time even in the case that high-pressure water, compressed air, and ozone are injected into the pipe, and have a limitation in extension of service life through washing since a cleaning robot cannot dispense washing solution to a heating pipe, a small pipe having a curvature. In addition, the conventional art does not teach checking an exact location in which scale is accumulated. Therefore, there is a need to make a new method for solving this problem.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Prior art documents include the Korean patents and utility model registration mentioned above, i.e., 10-2011-0048652, dated May 11, 2011, 10-2026930, dated Sep. 24, 2019, 20-0389135, dated Jun. 29, 2005, and also 10-2057699, dated Jan. 22, 2020.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present disclosure has been made to solve the above-mentioned problems occurring in the prior art, and an object thereof is to provide a pipeline inspection system for effectively managing a pipeline by inspecting a state of the pipeline while moving together with fluid or gas along the pipeline.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is another object to provide a pipeline inspection system, which can improve scale removal efficiency by removing scale accumulated on the inner wall of the pipeline with ultrasonic vibrations and prevent water leakage due to corrosion of the inner wall of the pipeline.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">To accomplish the above objects, in an aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a pipeline inspection system including: a smart ball formed with a spherical shape to move along the inside of a pipe, and having a plurality of through-holes penetrating the outer circumferential surface and a space portion formed inside the smart ball to communicate with the through-holes; and an ultrasonic vibration module mounted in the space portion of the smart ball, driven by electric power of a battery, and provided to be controlled wirelessly by a control unit, wherein when ultrasonic vibrations are generated by the ultrasonic vibration module while the smart ball is moved along the pipe, the ultrasonic vibrations are emitted by fluid inside the pipe as a carrier, so that the scale is removed by a cavitation phenomenon.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to another embodiment of the present disclosure, the fluid inside the pipe is a fluid with low dissolved oxygen saturation from which oxygen is removed.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to another embodiment of the present disclosure, the fluid inside the pipe is circulated through a filtering process by the filtering module.

When the smart ball rotates in the same direction as the flywheel around the rotary shaft by the rotational movement of the flywheel, the outer surface of the smart ball is rotated while contacting the inner circumferential surface of the pipe. Since the rotational speed of the flywheel is set to be varied by the control unit, the rotational force of the smart ball is increased or decreased, so that the rotational friction force is variably transmitted.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to another embodiment of the present disclosure, the flywheel is mounted in an eccentric position about the rotary shaft to generate vibratory force due to eccentric rotation.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to another embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided a pipeline inspection system including: a pipeline inspection system including: a smart ball formed of a transparent material; a main body provided inside the smart ball; a camera provided in the main body to capture images of the outside through the smart ball; a gyro sensor and a GPS receiver provided on the main body; a control means provided in the main body to receive signals from the camera, the gyro sensor, and the GPS receiver and to control operations of the driving means; and a Bluetooth module for transmitting and receiving various kinds of information.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to another embodiment of the present disclosure, the smart ball has a diameter smaller than the inner diameter of the pipe so as to be inserted into the pipe, and the control means can wirelessly communicate with a remote controller manipulated by a worker.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to another embodiment of the present disclosure, the main body comprises a chemical spraying means operated by the control means to spray chemicals for removing scale, and a water leakage blocking means for repairing a water leakage point.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to another embodiment of the present disclosure, the driving means comprises: a driving wheel provided at the lower side of the main body so that the lower peripheral portion comes into close contact with the inner circumferential surface of the smart ball; and a driving motor connected to the driving wheel.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to another embodiment of the present disclosure, discharge holes are formed in both sides of the smart ball, and the chemical spraying means and the water leakage blocking means respectively include: reservoirs in which chemicals for removing scale are stored; connection pipes for connecting the reservoirs and the discharge holes to each other; and supply pumps respectively provided at the middle portions of the connection pipes.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to another embodiment of the present disclosure, the smart ball includes: a support portion formed to have a cylindrical shape extending in a lateral direction and having the main body therein; and a pair of first and second rotating parts formed in a dome shape corresponding to each other and provided on both sides of the support portion, and the main body is fixed at the lower side inside the support portion.
