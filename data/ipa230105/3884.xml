These products and parts are typically stored in receptacles, for example bins, until the products or parts are needed in the distribution or manufacturing process. Items of several different types can each be stored in different bins within a single storage area, and operators can pick items as needed from these different bins. However, selecting the correct bin to pick from can be a time-consuming and error-prone process. Current methods used for picking items from inventory utilize a one-sensor-per-bin approach. This approach is economical when the bin configuration does not change but is less useful in dynamic manufacturing and product fulfillment environments. More complex methods can utilize a motorized scanner or a two-piece grid array. However, these approaches may add considerable complexity and cost in the infrastructure necessary to install, align, service, reconfigure and maintain such systems.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Devices consistent with the technology disclosed herein include a sensor device.

In some embodiments, the device can sense the position of objects adjacent openings of various bins in the moment when each object is removed from its respective bin and is located adjacent to the opening of its respective bin. Such bin systems can be used, for example, on a manufacturing floor when providing parts for various processes, or in an order fulfillment system such as can be used in a warehouse. However, embodiments are not limited to object detection adjacent to the openings of bins.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The technology disclosed herein relates to a sensor array that employs triangulation to monitor objects in a particular region. Using triangulation to detect and locate objects in the context of a bin pick system advantageously may allow a single sensor device to be used to monitor an entire array of bins. This is differentiated from some existing systems where multiple sensor devices need to be installed in the system, either where each bin is monitored individually by a separately mounted sensor or where two sensor arrays need be installed in a complementary fashion (either perpendicularly or in parallel, such as laser sensors) to monitor the array of bins. The sensor device <b>115</b> described herein is advantageously reconfigurable to accommodate numerous variations in the design of the system within which it will be installed. Accordingly, sensor devices <b>115</b> can advantageously be deployed, configured, and reconfigured quickly and efficiently. In various embodiments, the need for physical reconfiguration, remounting, and/or rewiring of indicators and/or sensor can be reduced or eliminated.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a facing view of a schematic distance sensing and visual indication system <b>100</b> in which example embodiments can be implemented, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a side schematic view of the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The example system <b>100</b> is consistent with a pick-to-light (or put-to-light) system. The system has a plurality of bins at least arranged in a plurality of columns of bins <b>130</b>, where &#x201c;columns&#x201d; is defined herein to encompass general alignment in either the vertical direction or the horizontal direction (although in the current figure, the plurality of columns of bin openings <b>130</b> are arranged vertically, and &#x201c;the plurality of columns of bin openings&#x201d; is also denoted by element number <b>130</b>). Correspondingly, &#x201c;rows,&#x201d; is defined herein as general alignment in the direction perpendicular to the columns, whether in the horizontal direction or the vertical direction.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the current example, the plurality of columns of bins <b>130</b> include six columns of bins <b>131</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>133</b>, <b>134</b>, <b>135</b>, <b>136</b>. In each of the fourth <b>134</b>, fifth <b>135</b> and sixth <b>136</b> columns of bins each have a single bin, but in various other embodiments each of those columns can have multiple bins.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, the plurality of bins <b>101</b> are not necessarily arranged in rows, but in some other embodiments, such as the example depicted, the plurality of bins <b>101</b> are arranged in a plurality of rows <b>140</b>. The plurality of bins <b>101</b> can have various specific configurations, but in this specific example, a first plurality of bins <b>110</b> form a first row of bins <b>141</b>. A second bin <b>112</b> (which could alternately be a second plurality of bins) form a second row of bins <b>142</b>. A third plurality of bins <b>114</b> form a third row of bins <b>143</b>. A fourth plurality of bins <b>116</b> are larger than at least the first plurality of bins <b>110</b> and third plurality of bins <b>114</b>, and each bin of the fourth plurality of bins <b>116</b> forms a column that extends across at least a portion of each of the first row of bins <b>141</b>, the second row of bins <b>142</b>, and the third row of bins <b>143</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Each of the bins defines a bin opening <b>101</b> (not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, but <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> provides a facing view of each of the bin openings, and &#x201c;the plurality of bins&#x201d; is also denoted by element number <b>101</b>) through which an object can pass through (such as during placement or removal of the object into or from the bin). As such, the bin openings <b>101</b> have the same arrangement as the bins such that the bin openings <b>101</b> are arranged in a plurality of columns and, in the current example, also arranged in a plurality of rows. Each of the bins can store a particular object for retrieval. In some implementations, each of the bins stores a different object that is configured to be removed for assembly of objects forming a kit, a product order, or the like.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The term &#x201c;bin&#x201d; as used herein is defined as a delineated area that is configured to store one or more objects. The term &#x201c;bin&#x201d; includes a shelf, drum, box, and the like. While in some embodiments each bin is a discrete area separated from one or more adjacent bins by a physical structure such as a sidewall, in some other embodiments a bin is a discrete area separated from one or more adjacent bins by a void space rather than a physical structure such as a sidewall. In the current example however, each bin, such as the second bin <b>112</b>, has at least one sidewall <b>111</b> and, in particular, four sidewalls (also denoted as <b>111</b>) that define the delineated area of the second bin <b>112</b> and the bin opening <b>101</b>. Three of the four sidewalls <b>111</b> create a physical barrier between the example second bin <b>112</b> and adjacent bins, and one of the four sidewalls <b>111</b> creates a physical barrier between the example second bin <b>112</b> and the environment outside of the bin system.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">To remove an object <b>150</b> from its respective bin, such as the second bin <b>112</b> as currently depicted, a user reaches into the second bin <b>112</b> with one or two hands (visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) and removes the object <b>150</b>. As the object <b>150</b> is being removed from its second bin <b>112</b>, there is a period of time (which may be relatively brief) when the object <b>150</b> is outside of the bin, within a region <b>102</b> adjacent to the bin opening <b>101</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The system <b>100</b> disclosed herein is generally configured to detect the position of the object in the region <b>102</b> adjacent the bin openings of the plurality of bins <b>101</b> to confirm that the correct object was removed from the correct bin. In particular, the system <b>100</b> compares the position of the object <b>150</b> in the region <b>102</b> adjacent the bins to the location of each of the bins to correlate the position of the object <b>150</b> with a particular bin. In some embodiments the system <b>100</b> may also incorporate a notification device, which will be described in more detail herein.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The system <b>100</b> has a sensor device <b>115</b>. The sensor device <b>115</b> is generally configured to sense the presence and location of an object that has just been removed from a bin or, alternatively, is being inserted into a bin. More particularly, the sensor device <b>115</b> is configured to sense the presence and location of an object <b>150</b> that is in the region <b>102</b> adjacent the plurality of columns of bins <b>130</b> and, therefore, a corresponding plurality of columns of bin openings. Such a positioning of an object <b>150</b> generally suggests that the object <b>150</b> is either being inserted or removed from the bin. In various embodiments, the sensor device <b>115</b> is configured to use triangulation to identify the location of an object <b>150</b>.

It is contemplated that a similar identification scheme may be utilized for proper placement of an object intended to be placed into (rather than removed from) a target bin. In some embodiments the bin identifier <b>722</b> is configured to receive data identifying the target bin from an external system, for example. In some embodiments, the processor <b>704</b> is in data communication with a bin identifier <b>722</b> (or another internal or external system or component) to receive the target bin data.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The bin identifier <b>722</b> can also be configured to communicate the target bin to system users engaging in a bin pick operation.

Generally, the illumination elements <b>125</b> are configured to selectively illuminate a beam of light outwardly from the elongate frame <b>205</b>. In various embodiments, the illumination elements <b>125</b> are configured to selectively illuminate a beam of light outwardly from the sensor plane <b>121</b>. The illumination elements <b>125</b> can be organized in an array, in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The bin identifier <b>722</b> is in operative communication with each of the illumination elements <b>125</b>. The bin identifier <b>722</b> is configured to selectively illuminate an individual illumination element <b>125</b> of the plurality of illumination elements <b>125</b>.

Such a configuration provides visual indication to a user of the particular column of bins that contains the target bin from which the next object <b>150</b> will be retrieved.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">It should be noted that the sensor device <b>115</b> may be programmed to illuminate the individual illumination elements <b>125</b> that best align, rather than perfectly align, with a particular column of bins openings <b>130</b>. Furthermore, in some implementations, multiple illumination elements <b>125</b> may generate a beam of light that aligns with a particular column of bin openings <b>130</b>, or where the target bin extends across multiple columns, such as the second bin <b>112</b>. Even further, in some implementations, one or more individual illumination elements <b>125</b> may not sufficiently align with any particular column of bins openings <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">For example, the third illumination element <b>125</b>-<b>3</b> of the plurality of illumination elements is positioned at a border between the second column of bin openings <b>132</b> and the third column of bin openings <b>133</b> and thus the third illumination element <b>125</b>-<b>3</b> may be omitted from programming that would result in using the third illumination element <b>125</b>-<b>3</b> to identify a particular column of bin openings <b>130</b> from the plurality of bin openings <b>101</b>. In such an example, the third illumination element <b>125</b>-<b>3</b> can be programmed to be a component of a notification device, where the notification device will be described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The illumination elements <b>125</b> can have a variety of different configurations. In some embodiments, each illumination element <b>125</b> of the plurality of illumination elements is a single light emitting diode (LED), for example. In some other embodiments, each illumination element <b>125</b> of the plurality of illumination elements can include multiple sub-elements. For example, each illumination element <b>125</b> can be a grouping of a plurality of LEDs. In some such embodiments, each LED is a different color. For example, each of the plurality of illumination elements can have a first light emitting diode having a first color and a second light emitting diode having a second color. In some embodiments, each of the plurality of illumination elements comprises a multi-color light emitting diode. While LEDs are specifically referenced herein, the illumination elements <b>125</b> can also include other types of illumination elements such as lasers, liquid-crystal displays, e-ink displays, and the like.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The sensor device <b>115</b> is also configured to provide a user notification of the target bin within the particular column of bins that has been identified. Where the bins are arranged in rows, such as in the current example, the bin identifier <b>722</b> can be configured to provide an audio indication of the particular row, such as by number, relative location (for example, top, middle, and bottom), or the like. In such an example, the sensor device <b>115</b> can have a speaker <b>724</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) and/or a display (not currently depicted) with relevant circuitry that is operative by the bin identifier <b>722</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Additionally or alternatively, the bin identifier <b>722</b> can be programmed to correlate each color of each illumination element <b>125</b> with a particular row of bin openings.

In such an example, if the particular identified bin is third bin <b>113</b>, the bin identifier <b>722</b> is configured to illuminate the second illumination element <b>125</b>-<b>2</b> in the color red. The red illumination indicates to a user that the bin is the top row of bins <b>141</b> and the beam of light emanating from the second illumination element <b>125</b>-<b>2</b> aligns with column <b>2</b>. If the target bin is the second bin <b>112</b>, then the bin identifier <b>722</b> can be configured to illuminate the first illumination element <b>125</b>-<b>1</b>, the second illumination element <b>125</b>-<b>2</b>, and the third illumination element <b>125</b>-<b>3</b>, each in the color blue. However, it will be appreciated that a variety of other indicator schemes can be implemented.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some other embodiments, where the plurality of bins <b>101</b> are not arranged in rows, the bin identifier <b>722</b> can identify a target bin opening within the particular column of bin openings through an approach that is consistent with the particular system configuration. In some examples, the bins can be constructed to each reflect a different color within each column and, similarly to that described above, the bin identifier <b>722</b> can illuminate the relevant illumination element in the relevant color to identify the target bin within the particular column by color. As another example, the bins can be numbered within a particular column, and an audio or visual cue can be provided to the user to identify the target bin within the particular column. In some embodiments, upon confirmation by the processor <b>704</b> that the object location matches the target bin, illumination by the illumination elements <b>125</b> can be terminated until the bin identifier <b>722</b> identifies the next bin opening of the plurality of bin openings for the next picking operation.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In various embodiments, the sensor device <b>115</b> has a notification device <b>726</b> that is configured to provide an error signal to a user if there is a potential error in the bin pick operation. When the processor compares the identified object location to the target bin, and the identified object location and the target bin do not match (because the object location is inconsistent with an object having been removed from the target bin), the notification device <b>726</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) is configured to provide an error signal. Error signals can include commands to generate audio and/or visual alarms, notifications to remote or local devices, notifications to logging devices or databases, etc. In some embodiments the notification device is also configured to generate a user notification upon confirmation of a correct bin pick operation.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The notification device <b>726</b> is generally in data communication with the processor <b>704</b>. The notification device is in operative communication with the plurality of illumination elements <b>125</b> in various embodiments. In such embodiments the notification device <b>726</b> can be configured to illuminate a light to notify a user of an error.

In particular, the processor <b>704</b> can be configured to receive data reflecting the size of the object that is expected to be removed from the target bin. When the object <b>150</b> is removed from the bin opening <b>101</b> and is in the region <b>102</b> adjacent the bin opening <b>101</b>, the distance sensors <b>120</b> can be configured to sense the approximate length l and width w of the profile of the object <b>150</b> in an object plane <b>123</b>.

The processor <b>704</b> can approximate the size of the object <b>500</b> (and the location of the object, as described above) to confirm, for example, that a user has reached their hand into a target bin or to confirm the identity of the object <b>500</b> matches the size of objects expected to be stored in the target bin.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Sensor device <b>115</b> includes at least distance sensors <b>120</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>120</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>120</b>-<b>3</b>, and <b>120</b>-<b>4</b> coupled to a frame and defining a sensor plane <b>502</b>, which can be consistent with the discussion of the sensor plane <b>121</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref>. While four distance sensors <b>120</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>120</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>120</b>-<b>3</b> and <b>120</b>-<b>4</b> are shown, the sensor device <b>115</b> can include any number of distance sensors and further can include other circuitry and elements. The sensor device <b>115</b> is configured to detect the object <b>500</b> adjacent to the plurality of bin openings (not currently depicted).

The notification device is configured to generate an error signal when the approximated two-dimensional area does not match the expected two-dimensional area of the object <b>500</b>. The expected two-dimensional area is generally a range of two-dimensional areas that are consistent with the various potential orientations of the object <b>500</b> in a human hand in space relative to the sensor plane.

For example, if objects have an approximated two-dimensional area that is much smaller than the size of the target object from the target bin when positioned in a human hand, no error signal will be generated. In this manner, apparatuses, and methods according to embodiments can refrain from providing false alarms in the presence of debris, insects, or other small objects in the region adjacent the bin openings. Similarly, in some embodiments, objects with a relatively large approximated two-dimensional area will not cause the processor <b>704</b> to generate an error signal. Such a configuration may advantageously reduce inefficiencies associated with the system identifying, for example, a loading vehicle being present in the region adjacent the plurality of bin openings <b>101</b>.

The identifying can include identifying a first column of bin openings of the plurality of columns of bin openings by the illumination elements of the sensor device selectively illuminating a first beam of light towards the first column of bin openings. The identifying can further include identifying the first target bin opening within the first column of bin openings. In some embodiments, such as where the bin openings are arranged in rows, identifying the first target bin opening can include identifying a first row of bin openings of a plurality of rows of bin openings.

The triangulation can be performed subsequently to identifying the first target bin opening. Triangulation can be performed in a manner similar to that described above.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Method <b>600</b> can continue with operation <b>606</b> with the processor comparing the triangulated location of the first object to the first target bin opening.

Identifying the second target bin opening can include selectively illuminating a beam of light toward a second column of bin openings. Identifying the second target bin opening can also include identifying a second row of bin openings of a plurality of rows of bin openings, in configurations where the bin openings are also arranged in rows. In examples, the second target bin opening is different than the first target bin opening. After identifying the second target bin opening, a second object location can be triangulated <b>604</b> adjacent the plurality of bin openings similarly to as described above. The method <b>600</b> can further include comparing the triangulated location of the second object to the second target bin opening <b>606</b> and provide an error signal <b>608</b> when the triangulated location of the second object does not match the second target bin opening.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Computing Systems</heading><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In further examples, any of the compute nodes or devices discussed with reference to the present computing systems and environment may be fulfilled based on the components depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.
