The use of pro-benefit-agent compounds, in which a benefit agent fragment is joined by a cleavable or hydrolysable bond to a carrier molecule and then released when the bond breaks, can be a useful strategy. For example, certain amine compounds may be the basis of pro-perfume or pro-fragrance technologies. However, there remains room for improvement with regard to stability and/or deposition profiles. An additional area of need is the development of pro-perfumes that are substantially free of color forming moieties when combined with benefit agents that have conjugated 7-systems.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Furthermore, consumers may desire materials that are associated with desirable environmental or sustainability profiles.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There is a need for pro-benefit-agent compounds that provide improved delivery, release, and/or stability profiles, as well as treatment compositions that include such compounds.

The compounds may include a fragment or residue of a benefit agent, such as a perfume raw material or an antimicrobial agent, that includes an aldehyde or ketone moiety. In the pro-benefit-agent compounds of the present disclosure, the benefit agent fragment or residue is joined to the nitrogen atom of the modified amino acid and another heteroatom to form a heterocyclic moiety with other atoms. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that when the bonds that link the benefit agent fragment to the nitrogen atom and the second heteroatom are cleaved, the benefit agent is released. In addition to providing a beneficial release profile, it is believed that the character of the heterocyclic moiety tends provide improved stability, particularly improved color stability, in treatment compositions comprising such compounds, compared to other nitrogen-containing pro-benefit-agent compounds.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0015">Furthermore, the modified amino acid comprises one or more monovalent moieties that are organic groups that increase the relative hydrophobicity of the compound. For example, a first monovalent organic moiety may be attached to the acid end of the amino acid, thereby forming a carbonyl-containing group, which may be selected from an ester group, an amide group, or a thioester group. Additionally or alternatively, separate from any organic moieties that form a portion of the benefit agent fragment, a second monovalent organic group may be attached to the heterocyclic moiety. It is believed that the hydrophobic character imparted by the organic group(s) improve the delivery and/or deposition of the pro-benefit-agent compound to an intended target surface or article.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0016">Such pro-benefit-agent compounds, related treatment compositions, and related methods are described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0017">As used herein, the articles &#x201c;a&#x201d; and &#x201c;an&#x201d; when used in a claim, are understood to mean one or more of what is claimed or described.

The pro-benefit-agent compounds include a fragment (for example, a residue) of a benefit agent. The benefit agent from which the fragment is derived comprises an oxygen-containing moiety, namely an aldehyde moiety or a ketone moiety.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0026">The benefit agent fragment, which may be a first benefit agent fragment, is attached to a nitrogen atom of a carrier molecule by a carbon/nitrogen linking bond. As described in more detail below, the benefit agent is also attached to another heteroatom. The nitrogen, a carbon of the benefit agent fragment, and the second heteroatom form a portion of a heterocyclic moiety.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0027">When the bonds that join the benefit agent fragment to the heterocyclic are cleaved, the benefit agent is released. The release of the benefit agent may be triggered by any suitable mechanism, such as the presence of water or heat, preferably water, particularly when the linking bond is, for example, a N&#x2014;C&#x2014;O bond.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0028">The pro-benefit-agent compounds of the present disclosure may be derived from amino acids that have been modified. Proteinogenic amino acids may be a preferred starting material, as such compounds are attractive for environmental or sustainability reasons, as they tend to be naturally occurring. For most naturally-occurring amino acids, the stereogenic carbon alpha to the amino group has the L-configuration. D-Amino acids are occasionally found in nature. While either L- or D-Amino acids as well as mixtures may be used, economic factors may lead to a preference for the more abundant L-Amino acids. Relatedly, biosynthesized amino acids may be preferred.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0029">The starting amino acids may be modified by reacting the carboxylic acid group of the amino acid (a) with an alcohol of an organic group via an esterification reaction, (b) with an amine of an organic group via an amidation reaction, or (c) with a thiol group of an organic group via a thioesterification reaction. Such reactions can result in ester, amide, or thioester linking groups, respectively. Such linking groups, each of which is a type of carbonyl-containing moiety group, may be preferred compared to others for ease of reaction. Compounds formed with such carbonyl-containing moieties may even be preferred for environmental reasons, as these types of groups may break (e.g., hydrolyze) over time and/or in the presence of water, leaving the core material to revert, for example, to a common amino acid.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0030">The present disclosure relates to a pro-benefit-agent compound, where the compound comprises: a carbon-containing core, the core comprising a carbon backbone, one or more side groups, a nitrogen atom, and a carbonyl group, wherein the carbonyl group is part of a carbonyl-containing moiety that is selected from an ester moiety, an amide moiety, or a thioester moiety, wherein the carbonyl-containing moiety comprises a first heteroatom joined to the carbon of the carbonyl group, wherein the first heteroatom is selected from oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur, wherein the carbonyl-containing moiety further comprises a first monovalent moiety joined to the first heteroatom, wherein the first monovalent moiety is an organic group comprising from 1 to 34 chain atoms; a benefit agent fragment, wherein a carbon atom of the benefit agent fragment, the nitrogen of the carbon-containing core, and a second heteroatom are part of a heterocyclic moiety, wherein the second heteroatom is selected from oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur, wherein the second heteroatom is not part of a side group of the core, wherein the carbon atom of the benefit agent fragment is bonded to the nitrogen and the second heteroatom, and wherein the benefit agent fragment is derived from a benefit agent, the benefit agent comprising an aldehyde moiety, a ketone moiety, or combinations thereof, wherein the heterocyclic moiety optionally comprises a second monovalent moiety (not bound directly to the carbon atom of the benefit agent) that is an organic group comprising from 1 to 34 chain atoms, preferably carbon atoms, wherein at least one of the following is true: (a) at least one of the first monovalent moiety and the second monovalent moiety, if present, comprises at least five, preferably at least eight, chain atoms, preferably carbon atoms, and/or (b) the second monovalent moiety is present, and the sum of the number of chain atoms, preferably carbon chain atoms, in the first monovalent moiety and the second monovalent moiety is at least eight.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0031">The carbon-containing core comprises a carbon backbone. The carbon backbone is understood to not include the carbons of the carbonyl-containing moiety or the side group(s), if any. The carbon backbone may comprise from one to six carbon atoms, preferably from one to three carbon atoms, more preferably one carbon atom. Relatively fewer carbon atoms may be preferred for mass-efficiency reasons. In particular, backbones comprising only one carbon atom may be preferred because such structures are indicative of naturally-occurring, proteinogenic amino acids.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0032">The carbon-containing core may be derived from an amino acid. Preferably, the core is derived from a proteinogenic amino acid. In particular, naturally-derived or biosynthesized amino acids may be preferred.

The at least one side group may comprise one or more functional groups, such as carboxyl groups, amine groups, thiol groups, or hydroxyl groups. The at least one side group may be linear or branched. The at least one side group may comprise an aryl ring. The compound preferably may comprise only one non-hydrogen side group (e.g., only one organic group). The compound may comprise more than one non-hydrogen side group. The at least one side group preferably comprises the side group of a proteinogenic amino acid. The carbon-containing core may comprise at least one side group that is a hydrogen, and at least one side group that is an organic group. All of the side groups may be hydrogen, for example when the core is based on or otherwise derived from glycine.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0034">The side group may have the structure of a side group of a proteinogenic amino acid or a derivative thereof, preferably the side group of a proteinogenic amino acid selected from the group consisting of alanine, glycine, valine, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, a derivative thereof, or combinations thereof, more preferably alanine, glycine, valine, phenylalanine, a derivative thereof, or combinations thereof, even more preferably alanine, glycine, a derivative thereof, or combinations thereof.
