It is also the most common congenital infection worldwide. Because of the limited drugs approved for HCMV therapy (all viral DNA polymerase inhibitors), the side effects associated with them, and the emergence of resistant viral mutants during therapy, there is a pressing need to develop anti-HCMV compounds with novel mechanisms of action.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery that emetine inhibits HCMV replication at very low drug concentrations. The EC50 of emetine is 40 nM and its CC50 is 8 uM, resulting in a selectivity index of 200. HCMV inhibition by emetine required an interaction of ribosomal protein 14 and MDM2. Pharmacokinetic studies performed at NIH-NCATS revealed high tissue concentrations of emetine dosed at 1 mg/kg and a long half-life (24 h). Emetine was well-tolerated in mice. Infection with mouse CMV and emetine treatment revealed high efficacy in mouse CMV inhibition even at 0.1 mg/kg administered orally every 72 h. These in vitro and in vivo studies indicate the potential repurposing of emetine for HCMV, either alone or combined with approved HCMV drugs.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">More specifically, as described herein, Emetine inhibits HCMV at an early stage (after entry but before DNA replication), a mechanism that is different from current HCMV inhibitors. In addition, Emetine inhibits mouse CMV replication (in vivo) at a very low dose (0.1 mg/kg) which correlate with human dose of 0.01 mg/kg. HCMV inhibition by emetine involves a novel cellular pathway that requires RPS14 and its binding to MDM2.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention provides compositions for treating or preventing HCMV. In one embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition comprises emetine. In a more specific embodiment, the composition comprises an amount of emetine that is lower than the typical dose of emetine used to treat amebiasis. In certain embodiments, the low dose of emetine is about &#xbd; to about 1/100 the normal dose of emetine for amebiasis. In particular embodiments, the low dose of emetine is about 1/10 to about 1/100 the normal dose for amebiasis.

The definitions are not meant to be limiting in nature and serve to provide a clearer understanding of certain aspects of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Infection with human cytomegalovirus (CMV), a member of the herpes virus family, is common in humans. Seroprevalence rates increase with age, reaching 90% in individuals older than 80 years. The virus establishes lifelong persistent infection, which usually remains asymptomatic. In immunocompromised hosts, such as transplant recipients and patients with AIDS, CMV causes significant morbidity and mortality. Over 75% of solid organ transplant recipients are newly infected or reactivate latent CMV after transplantation. Since many organ donors are CMV-positive, recipients often require CMV prophylaxis to prevent CMV disease. CMV-seropositive HIV-infected patients progress 2.5-fold more rapidly to AIDS and death than those who are CMV-seronegative. Despite highly-active antiretroviral therapy, HIV-infected patients remain at risk for CMV disease.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">CMV is the most common congenitally-acquired infection causing mental retardation and deafness. It is the leading infectious cause of non-genetic hearing loss and central nervous system (CNS) damage in children. The hearing loss is severe and progressive, significantly impacting the child's life. The estimated annual societal cost of supporting children with congenital CMV approaches $2 billion (1991 US dollars).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The detection of CMV in blood of presumably immunocompetent hosts (viremia) was linked with outcomes of sepsis and pulmonary complications in CMV-seropositive patients treated in intensive care-units. Virus has also been detected in the brain tumor glioblastoma multiforme. Although the direct role of CMV in these syndromes is unclear, virus replication may contribute to their natural history, and the potential benefit of anti-viral therapy in these conditions is currently being investigated in clinical trials. At this time there is no approved CMV vaccine, although several formulations are at different stages of development.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The systemic anti-CMV drugs target the viral DNA polymerase and suppress virus replication. However, their use is associated with considerable toxicities to bone marrow (ganciclovir-GCV) and kidneys (foscarnet and cidofovir) and emergence of resistant viruses during prolonged courses of therapy (Jabs, D. A., Martin, B. K. &#x26; Forman, M. S. Mortality associated with resistant cytomegalovirus among patients with cytomegalovirus retinitis and AIDS. Ophthalmology 117, 128-132 (2010); Schreiber, A., et al. Antiviral treatment of cytomegalovirus infection and resistant strains. Expert. Opin. Pharmacother 10, 191-209 (2009); Steininger, C. Novel therapies for cytomegalovirus disease. Recent Pat Antiinfect. Drug Discov 2, 53-72 (2007)). A retrospective analysis from Johns Hopkins reveals high rates of complications and mortality in patients treated with foscarnet (Avery, R. K., et al. Outcomes in Transplant Recipients Treated with Foscarnet for Ganciclovir-Resistant or Refractory Cytomegalovirus Infection. Transplantation (2016)). Until recently, intravenous GCV was the only agent approved for congenital CMV infection with CNS involvement, based on a phase III clinical trial in which hearing preservation or prevention of hearing loss were documented in the treated children (Kimberlin, D. W., et al. Effect of ganciclovir therapy on hearing in symptomatic congenital cytomegalovirus disease involving the central nervous system: a randomized, controlled trial. J. Pediatr 143, 16-25 (2003)). This clinical trial demonstrated that anti-viral therapy has an important role in the outcome of congenital CMV-associated hearing loss. Recent data from a phase III clinical trial of oral valganciclovir (the valyl-ester prodrug of GCV) in congenitally-infected children reveal that 6 months' therapy has better neurological outcome than 6 weeks' therapy, but GCV-resistant mutants emerge (Kimberlin, D. W., et al. Valganciclovir for symptomatic congenital cytomegalovirus disease. N. Engl. J. Med 372, 933-943 (2015)). Widespread use of a limited number of drugs eventually leads to the development of drug resistant strains. New strategies for CMV therapy are needed to treat this chronic disease.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Newly-identified agents that target CMV proteins other than the DNA polymerase are the UL97 kinase inhibitor, maribavir, and the terminase inhibitor, AIC246 (letermovir) (Krosky, P. M., Baek, M. C. &#x26; Coen, D. M. The human cytomegalovirus UL97 protein kinase, an antiviral drug target, is required at the stage of nuclear egress. J. Virol 77, 905-914 (2003); Williams, S. L., et al. In vitro activities of benzimidazole D- and L-ribonucleosides against herpesviruses Antimicrob. Agents Chemother 47, 2186-2192 (2003); Lischka, P., et al. In vitro and in vivo activities of the novel anticytomegalovirus compound AIC246 Antimicrob. Agents Chemother 54, 1290-1297 (2010); and Kaul, D. R., et al. First report of successful treatment of multidrug-resistant cytomegalovirus disease with the novel anti-CMV compound AIC246. Am. J. Transplant 11, 1079-1084 (2011)). Maribavir showed efficacy in a phase II clinical trial (Winston, D. J., et al. Maribavir prophylaxis for prevention of cytomegalovirus infection in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study. Blood 111, 5403-5410 (2008)), but a phase III trial in bone marrow transplant recipients showed no significant difference in rates of CMV disease between maribavir and placebo recipients. Additional studies are needed to establish the role and indications for use of maribavir. AIC246 completed a phase II clinical trial in 2014 (Lischka, P., et al. In vitro and in vivo activities of the novel anticytomegalovirus compound AIC246 Antimicrob. Agents Chemother 54, 1290-1297 (2010); Kaul, D. R., et al. First report of successful treatment of multidrug-resistant cytomegalovirus disease with the novel anti-CMV compound AIC246. Am. J. Transplant 11, 1079-1084 (2011); and Chemaly, R. F., et al. Letermovir for cytomegalovirus prophylaxis in hematopoietic-cell transplantation. N. Engl. J. Med 370, 1781-1789 (2014)). A few anti-CMV compounds are in pre-clinical stages of evaluation (James, S. H., et al. Cyclopropavir inhibits the normal function of the human cytomegalovirus UL97 kinase Antimicrob. Agents Chemother 55, 4682-4691 (2011); Mercorelli, B., et al. A 6-aminoquinolone compound, WCS, with potent and selective anti-human cytomegalovirus activity. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother 53, 312-315 (2009)).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">CMV uses multiple cell signaling pathways to achieve efficient replication. There is an interest in identifying compounds that can modulate cellular pathways critical for CMV replication. Such &#x201c;host-dependent anti-viral&#x201d; agents may not be under direct viral control and therefore are less likely to select for resistant mutants. Compounds modulating cellular pathways were reported to inhibit CMV. These can be grouped into inhibitors acting early during virus replication [phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor (Johnson, R. A., Wang, X., Ma, X. L., Huong, S. M. &#x26; Huang, E. S. Human cytomegalovirus up-regulates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) pathway: inhibition of PI3-K activity inhibits viral replication and virus-induced signaling. J. Virol 75, 6022-6032 (2001)), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs) (Johnson, R. A., Huong, S. M. &#x26; Huang, E. S. Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 by human cytomegalovirus infection through two distinct pathways: a novel mechanism for activation of p38. J. Virol 74, 1158-1167 (2000)) and tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Gleevec (Soroceanu, L., Akhavan, A. &#x26; Cobbs, C. S. Platelet-derived growth factor-alpha receptor activation is required for human cytomegalovirus infection. Nature 455, 391-395 (2008)), and those active at multiple steps of virus replication&#x2014;the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, roscovitine (Johnson, R. A., Wang, X., Ma, X. L., Huong, S. M. &#x26; Huang, E. S. Human cytomegalovirus up-regulates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) pathway: inhibition of PI3-K activity inhibits viral replication and virus-induced signaling. J. Virol 75, 6022-6032 (2001)), leflunomide and its active metabolite FK778 (Evers, D. L., Wang, X., Huong, S. M., Andreoni, K. A. &#x26; Huang, E. S. Inhibition of human cytomegalovirus signaling and replication by the immunosuppressant FK778. Antiviral Res 65, 1-12 (2005)). Toxicity associated with these agents precludes their use for CMV therapeutics, especially given the prolonged courses of therapy that are required.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As described herein, the present inventors performed a high throughput screening (HTS) for CMV inhibitors and identified emetine as a CMV inhibitor (Mukhopadhyay, R., et al. Efficacy and Mechanism of Action of Low Dose Emetine against Human Cytomegalovirus. PLoS Pathog 12, e1005717 (2016)). Emetine is an old drug that has been used parenterally for treatment of amebiasis, until it was replaced with metronidazole. In addition, syrup of Ipecac is available over-the-counter and contains significant amount of emetine as one of its active components. Although originally recommended to store in homes with children for induction of vomiting in case of intoxication, the American Academy of Pediatrics no longer endorses its use, and experience has shown that in many cases it did not induce vomiting. There was also variability in emetine concentration between batches of Ipecac. Emetine was also found to have anti-cancer activities for which it has entered clinical trials (Mastrangelo, M. J., Grage, T. B., Bellet, R. E. &#x26; Weiss, A. J. A phase I study of emetine hydrochloride (NSC 33669) in solid tumors. Cancer 31, 1170-1175 (1973); Panettiere, F. &#x26; Coltman, C. A., Jr. Experience with emetine hydrochloride (NSC 33669) as an antitumor agent. Cancer 27, 835-841 (1971)). Altogether there is clinical experience with emetine at doses up to 600 mg, which should provide exposures considerably above that required for anti-viral activity. As described herein, the in vitro and in vivo data of emetine in CMV inhibition, and its synergistic activity with GCV, support an evaluation at a lower dose in humans.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">For amebiasis, emetine has been administered intramuscularly (IM) or subcutaneously (SC) daily at 1 mg/kg (maximal dose of 60 mg) for up to 10 days. Severe side effects occurred rarely and were only observed at high doses. Emetine was well-tolerated when delivered intravenously at 1.5 mg/kg dose twice a week in clinical trials as an anti-tumor agent (Panettiere, F. &#x26; Coltman, C. A., Jr. Experience with emetine hydrochloride (NSC 33669) as an antitumor agent. Cancer 27, 835-841 (1971)). Patients treated with 1 mg/kg emetine daily via SC injection for 10 days did not experience any notable toxicity (Mastrangelo, M. J., Grage, T. B., Bellet, R. E. &#x26; Weiss, A. J. A phase I study of emetine hydrochloride (NSC 33669) in solid tumors. Cancer 31, 1170-1175 (1973)).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The present inventors found CMV inhibition with emetine at nM concentrations in vitro. The therapeutic plasma concentration of emetine as measured in the past is 0.005-0.075 &#x3bc;g/mL, and its half-life &#x3e;24-48 h (Regenthal, R., Krueger, M., Koeppel, C. &#x26; Preiss, R. Drug levels: therapeutic and toxic serum/plasma concentrations of common drugs. J. Clin. Monit. Comput 15, 529-544 (1999)). As described herein, the in vitro data suggest that at therapeutic plasma concentration CMV replication may be fully inhibited. In addition, PK studies support wide and prolonged tissue distribution, which may be a critical factor in CMV inhibition. In a specific embodiment, the present inventors found that a dose of 0.1 mg/kg administered orally every three days inhibits mouse CMV replication in vivo. Using allometric scaling this could translate into a human dose of 0.008 mg/kg (Nair, A. B. &#x26; Jacob, S. A simple practice guide for dose conversion between animals and human. J Basic Clin Pharm 7, 27-31 (2016)). For a 60 kg individual 0.5 mg/dose would be considered for human CMV therapy. In one month, 10 doses (a dose every 3 days) will result in a cumulative dose of 5 mg. Therefore, to reach the 600 mg amebiasis dose 120 months of CMV therapy would need to be provided. The expected cumulative dose with regimens used in general for CMV therapy would be substantially lower than the doses that have been used in the past, even if dosed daily.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Definitions</heading><p id="p-0038" num="0037">&#x201c;Agent&#x201d; refers to all materials that may be used as or in pharmaceutical compositions, or that may be compounds such as small synthetic or naturally derived organic compounds, nucleic acids, polypeptides, antibodies, fragments, isoforms, variants, or other materials that may be used independently for such purposes, all in accordance with the present invention.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A &#x201c;patient,&#x201d; &#x201c;subject,&#x201d; or &#x201c;host,&#x201d; to be treated by the present methods refers to either a human or non-human animal, such as primates, mammals, and vertebrates.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">A &#x201c;small molecule&#x201d; refers to a composition that has a molecular weight of less than 3 about kilodaltons (kDa), less than about 1.5 kilodaltons, or less than about 1 kilodalton.

More particularly, an &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; or a &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; is used interchangeably and refers to an amount of emetine, perhaps in further combination with an adjuvant and/or an HCMV drug, necessary to provide the desired &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; (defined herein) or therapeutic effect, e.g., an amount that is effective to prevent, alleviate, treat or ameliorate symptoms of a disease or prolong the survival of the subject being treated. As would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, the exact amount required will vary from subject to subject, depending on age, general condition of the subject, the severity of the condition being treated, the particular compound and/or composition administered, and the like. An appropriate &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; in any individual case can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art by reference to the pertinent texts and literature and/or by using routine experimentation.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are in biologically compatible form suitable for administration in vivo for subjects. The pharmaceutical compositions can further comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The term &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable&#x201d; means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly, in humans. The term &#x201c;carrier&#x201d; refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which emetine (and optionally in combination with an adjuvant and/or a second HCMV drug) are administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, including but not limited to peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. Water may be a carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered orally. Saline and aqueous dextrose may be carriers when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions may be employed as liquid carriers for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried slim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. The pharmaceutical composition may also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsions, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained-release formulations and the like.

Most suitable routes are oral administration or injection. In certain embodiments, subcutaneous injection is preferred.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In general, the pharmaceutical compositions comprising emetine may be used alone (e.g., a formulation comprising emetine) or in concert with other therapeutic agents (e.g., an adjuvant and/or HCMV drug) (e.g., emetine composition separate from the other agents or a combination pharmaceutical composition) at appropriate dosages defined by routine testing in order to obtain optimal efficacy while minimizing any potential toxicity. The dosage regimen utilizing a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be selected in accordance with a variety of factors including type, species, age, weight, sex, medical condition of the patient; the severity of the condition to be treated; the route of administration; the renal and hepatic function of the patient; and the particular pharmaceutical composition employed. A physician of ordinary skill can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition (and potentially other agents including therapeutic agents) required to prevent, counter, or arrest the progress of the condition.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Optimal precision in achieving concentrations of the therapeutic regimen (e.g., pharmaceutical compositions within the range that yields maximum efficacy with minimal toxicity may require a regimen based on the kinetics of the pharmaceutical composition's availability to one or more target sites. Distribution, equilibrium, and elimination of a pharmaceutical composition may be considered when determining the optimal concentration for a treatment regimen. The dosages of a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein may be adjusted when combined to achieve desired effects. On the other hand, dosages of the pharmaceutical compositions and various therapeutic agents may be independently optimized and combined to achieve a synergistic result wherein the pathology is reduced more than it would be if either was used alone.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In particular, toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein may be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD<sub>50 </sub>(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED<sub>50 </sub>(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effect is the therapeutic index and it may be expressed as the ratio LD<sub>50</sub>/ED<sub>50</sub>. Pharmaceutical compositions exhibiting large therapeutic indices are preferred except when cytotoxicity of the composition is the activity or therapeutic outcome that is desired. Although pharmaceutical compositions that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, a delivery system can target such compositions to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects. Generally, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be administered in a manner that maximizes efficacy and minimizes toxicity.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies may be used in formulating a range of dosages for use in humans. The dosages of such compositions lie preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED<sub>50 </sub>with little or no toxicity.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any composition used in the methods of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose may be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC<sub>50 </sub>(the concentration of the test composition that achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information may be used to accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Moreover, the dosage administration of the compositions of the present invention may be optimized using a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling system. For example, one or more dosage regimens may be chosen and a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model may be used to determine the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile of one or more dosage regimens. Next, one of the dosage regimens for administration may be selected which achieves the desired pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic response based on the particular pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile.

Although limited drugs are available for HCMV, development of new agents is desired. Through screening of the LOPAC library, we identified emetine as HCMV inhibitor. Additional studies confirmed the anti-HCMV activities of emetine in human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs), with EC<sub>50</sub>-40&#xb1;1.72 nM, CC<sub>50</sub>-8&#xb1;0.56 &#x3bc;M, and selectivity index of 200. HCMV inhibition occurred after virus entry, but before virus DNA replication and resulted in decreased expression of viral proteins. Synergistic virus inhibition was achieved when emetine was combined with ganciclovir. In a mouse CMV (MCMV) model emetine was well-tolerated, displayed long half-life, preferential distribution to tissues over plasma, and effectively suppressed MCMV. Since HCMV inhibition by emetine decreased significantly in cycling cells in vitro, control of virus inhibition through cell cycle regulators was suspected. Virus sensitivity to emetine dependend on ribosomal protein 14 (RPS14) binding to MDM2, leading to disruption of MDM2-p53 interaction and RPS14 degradation. Interaction of MDM2-p53 was necessary for HCMV replication. In contact-inhibited cells, HCMV induced RPS14 expression, emetine triggered nuclear translocation and binding of RPS14 to MDM2, competing with binding of p53 to MDM2. However, in cycling cells, RPS14 could not disrupt the existing MDM2-p53 interaction, resulting in virus escape and loss of emetine effect. Knockdown of RPS14 resulted in loss of HCMV inhibition by emetine, confirming its requirement for emetine activities. Summarized, emetine represents a promising candidate for HCMV therapy/prophylaxis alone or in combination with ganciclovir through a novel host-dependent mechanism.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Materials and Methods</heading><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Compounds. Ganciclovir (GCV), MG132, CPG 2006, and emetine dihydrochloride hydrate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo.).

A GCV-resistant pp28-luciferase HCMV strain, with a C607Y mutation in UL97 was also used. The recombinant viruses express luciferase under the control of the late CMV gene promoter, pp28. Luciferase expression is strongly activated 48-72 hours post infection (hpi). The recombinant viruses provide a highly-sensitive and reproducible reporter system which correlates with the classic plaque reduction assay. The Towne HCMV strain (ATCC VR-977) was used for plaque reduction, quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR, and immunoprecipitation assays. Human herpes virus strains were: luciferase HSV1-KOS/Dlux/oriS and clinical isolates of HSV2. The clinical isolates were provided by the clinical microbiology laboratory with no identifiers that can link to a specific subject. The Johns Hopkins Office of Human Subject Research Institutional Review Board determined that this research qualified for an exemption. Murid Herpesvirus (MCMV: ATCC VR-1399) was used for infection in mice.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Cell culture, virus infection and anti-viral assays. Human Foreskin Fibroblasts (HFFs) passage 12-16 (ATCC, CRL-2088&#x2122;) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) passage 9-14 (ATCC, CRL-1658&#x2122;) were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, Carlsbad, Calif.) in a 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator at 37&#xb0; C. Infection with HCMV or HSV was performed in HFFs, and infection with mouse CMV was performed in MEFs. For HCMV, cells were seeded in either a 96-well plate or 100 mm culture plates (Corning Costar, Sigma Aldrich) at 0.5 or 2 million cells/plate. Following 90 minute adsorption, media was removed and cells were washed with PBS. Media containing 4% FBS and compounds were added to each well. Infected treated HFFs were collected at 72 hpi and lysates were assayed for luciferase activity using a luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, Wis.) on GloMax&#xae;-Multi+Detection System (Promega). In second cycle assays, supernatants were collected from all conditions of the first cycle at 96 hpi and used for infection of fresh HFFs in 96-well-plates. Luciferase activity was measured 72 h following second cycle infection. For HSV1-KOS/Dlux/oriS, a luciferase assay was performed at 24 hpi. Plaque assays were performed with clinical isolates of HSV2 and HCMV Towne. HFFs were seeded at 3&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells/plate in 12-well plates and infected 24 h later with HSV2 at 200 PFU/well. For HCMV, HFFs were seeded at 0.5 or 2 million cells/plate in a 12-well plate and infected 24 hours later at 100 PFU/well. Following virus adsorption (60 min and 90 min for HSV and HCMV, respectively), virus was aspirated, and DMEM containing 4% fetal bovine serum (FBS) with (for HSV) or without (for HCMV) 0.5% carboxymethyl-cellulose, were added with the compounds at indicated concentrations into triplicate wells.

Screening of drug resistant virus was performed as reported. Two million cells were plated on a 6-well plate and infected with HCMV (MOI 0.05). After 90 min cells were washed with PBS and 10 nM of emetine or 0.5 &#x3bc;M of GCV were added. The cells were maintained in DMEM with 4% FBS until plaques were observed. The supernatants from these plates were used to infect fresh HFFs in a 6-well plate and each time drug concentration was increased by two fold. The cells were passaged 5 times until a final drug concentration of emetine (2.4 &#x3bc;M) and GCV (10.5 &#x3bc;M).

The combined inhibitory effect of compounds on HCMV replication was determined in infected HFFs. A dose response curve was first generated for each compound; the EC<sub>50 </sub>and slope were calculated. For drug combination, the concentrations of each drug were twice its EC<sub>50 </sub>followed by 2-fold serial dilutions. The Bliss model was used for quantification of the effect of two compounds on HCMV replication (40).

This protein has been reported to interact with p53-MDM2, major regulators of cell cycle progression. We theorized that the RPS14-MDM2-P53 plays a role in HCMV replication and may be regulated by emetine in HCMV-infected cells. The expression of RPS14 was measured in contact-inhibited and cycling cells, infected or uninfected. HCMV induced RPS14 expression at 72 hpi in contact-inhibited cells, which was reduced with emetine treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, left). At 24 hpi RPS14 expression was unchanged in contact-inhibited or in cycling cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, upper panel, left and right). In addition, the expression of RPS14 was unchanged in infected cycling cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, right). Irrespective of cell density, there was no change in RPS14 expression in non-infected cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>). Thus, induction of RPS14 expression at 72 h and its reduction by emetine was specific to infected contact-inhibited cells. Since the anti-HCMV activity of emetine occurred at the immediate early-early time of HCMV replication, the observed changes in RPS14 expression at 72 hpi represented an outcome of an earlier event.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0090">RPS14 interacts with MDM2 during ribosomal stress. Therefore, the outcome of the MDM2-RPS14 interaction during infection and emetine treatment was investigated. As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, MDM2 degrades proteins to which it binds, therefore these experiments were performed in the presence of the proteasomal inhibitor, MG132. At 24 hpi emetine strongly induced the interaction between RPS14 and MDM2 in contact-inhibited cells, but not in the cycling cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>). Similarly, a reverse IP showed enhanced interaction between RPS14-MDM2 in contact-inhibited cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref>). These results indicated that emetine induced the interaction of RPS14 with MDM2 in contact-inhibited infected cells but could not achieve the same effect in cycling cells (model depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>E</figref>) or in non-infected cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>). The enhanced interaction was followed by reduced expression of RPS14 at 72 hpi, suggesting that MDM2 may be targeting RPS14 for degradation in infected cells.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0091">Emetine induces the translocation of RPS14 into the nucleus and targets it for ubiquitination and degradation. To interact with MDM2, we predicted that RPS14 would translocate into the nucleus. Using confocal microscopy, RPS14 was located in the cytoplasm of uninfected or infected cells. Emetine treatment induced RPS14 translocation into the nucleus at 24 hpi. Infected cells were identified by IE1/2 staining (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>). Since in emetine treated contact-inhibited cells, RPS14 expression was decreased at 72 hpi (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>), while a strong interaction with MDM2 was observed in the presence of MG132 at 24 hpi (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, D) we conjectured that RPS14 may be targeted for degradation. MG123-treated samples were pulled-down with RPS14 and detected with either anti-RPS14 or anti-Ubiquitin antibody. In both cell densities, RPS14 ubiquitination decreased with infection. However, only in contact-inhibited cells, emetine increased ubiquitinated RPS14 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>). In agreement with RPS14 ubiquitination, at 72 hpi, there was almost no nuclear localization of RPS14 in infected emetine treated cells, indicating that emetine targets RPS14 for ubiquitination and degradation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>). Taken together, emetine treatment results in early RPS14 translocation into the nucleus of infected cells followed by its relocalization into the cytoplasm for ubiquitination and degradation, ultimately resulting in decreased RPS14 expression at 72 hpi (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, left).</p><p id="p-0094" num="0092">Emetine disrupts HCMV-mediated MDM2-p53 interaction. Since emetine inhibited HCMV in contact-inhibited, but not in cycling cells, and induced an interaction between MDM2 and RPS14 in the former, the expression level of cell cycle related proteins, p53 and MDM2, was measured in the contact-inhibited and cycling cells at 24 and 72 hpi. MDM2 expression was reduced after infection and increased with emetine treatment at 72 hpi in contact-inhibited cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>). The expression of p53 was unchanged with infection and increased with emetine treatment at 72 hpi (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>). There was no difference in the expression of either protein among different conditions at 24 hpi or in infected cycling cells at 72 hpi (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>). The downstream activity of p53 was measured by qRT-PCR for p21. Emetine treatment resulted in 5.4- and 6.7- fold increase in p21 mRNA at 24 and 72 hpi, respectively in contact-inhibited cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, (p&#x3c;0.01). In non-infected cells, the expression level of p53 and MDM2 was increased with emetine treatment, indicating both MDM2 and p53 were stabilized with emetine, irrespective of infection (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0093">RPS14 has been shown to bind to the acidic domain of MDM2, which is also the binding site for p53. Therefore, the effect of infection and emetine treatment on MDM2-p53 interaction was studied. Since p53 is degraded by the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of MDM2, MG132 treated samples were used for IP. The interaction between MDM2 and p53 was favored upon infection but disrupted with emetine treatment in contact-inhibited cells, but not in cycling cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>D</figref>). A reverse IP confirmed this interaction in infected cells and loss thereof with emetine treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>E</figref>). Our results indicate that emetine disrupts HCMV-induced interaction of MDM2-p53 (model depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>F</figref>). Since the expression of p53 and MDM2 was increased with emetine treatment in non-infected cells, we investigated the status of MDM2-p53-RPS14 interaction in non-infected cells. Although emetine could disrupt MDM2-p53 interaction as observed in HCMV-infected cells, it could not induce MDM2-RPS14 interaction (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>). Therefore, emetine could perturb the MDM2-p53 interaction irrespective of infection but its ability to associate RPS14 with MDM2 could only be achieved in infected cells.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0094">Finally, the enhanced interaction between RPS14-MDM2 could have effects on HCMV proteins that bind to MDM2. The immediate early 2 (IE2) was reported to interact with MDM2, therefore the effect of emetine on IE2-MDM2 interaction was tested in HEK293 cells. An IP was performed after IE1/2 transfection and emetine treatment. In emetine-treated cells, the interaction of MDM2 and IE2 was significantly decreased, while GCV had no effect on this interaction (data not shown). These results suggest that emetine-induced occupancy of the acidic domain of MDM2 by RPS14 may prevent it from binding IE2.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0095">RPS14 is indispensable for HCMV inhibition by emetine. As emetine induced nuclear translocation of RPS14 and its interaction with MDM2, we investigated the anti-HCMV activity of emetine in RPS14 knockdown cells. RPS14 expression was reduced in knockdown cells compared to its expression in control cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>). Cell viability was similar between wild-type (WT) and RPS14 knockdown cells during infection and drug treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>). In contact-inhibited RPS14 knockdown cells, emetine was unable to inhibit HCMV, evident from luciferase assay after first and second cycle, (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> C, D) and pp65 expression at 72 hpi (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>E</figref>), indicating the requirement of RPS14 for emetine activities.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">DISCUSSION</heading><p id="p-0098" num="0096">The existing antiviral drugs effectively suppress HCMV replication, but their considerable side effects, and selection of resistant viral strains, call for the identification of new HCMV inhibitors. HCMV perturbs a myriad of cellular signaling pathways for its own benefit of replication and survival, some of which could serve as novel targets for virus inhibition. We report here on the anti-HCMV activities of emetine at low nM concentration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), and its mode of action through targeting the interaction of RPS14-p53-MDM2, thus providing a novel host-dependent antiviral approach. Emetine inhibited GCV-resistant HCMV and HSV1&#x26;2 at nM concentrations as well (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>). Inhibition of HCMV replication by emetine occurred after virus entry and before the activities of GCV (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). MCMV was inhibited at low 0.1 mg/kg based on plaque assay from salivary gland and liver and quantitative PCR from blood. There was no significant difference in MCMV inhibition between 0.1 and 1 mg/kg. Plaque number was lower in liver compared to the salivary gland (as expected), but virus was inhibited in both organs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0099" num="0097">The observed decrease in emetine activity against HCMV in cycling cells as compared to contact-inhibited cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>), and a previous study that correlated emetine resistance in Chinese hamster ovary cells with mutations in RPS14, prompted us to investigate the role of RPS14 in HCMV replication (summarized in a model, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>D</figref>). HCMV induces multiple ribosomal proteins, but the requirement of specific ribosomal proteins for its replication has not been studied. Our results show that HCMV induces RPS14 during infection, likely as strategy for viral protein synthesis (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). In cycling non-infected cells, higher expression of RPS14 were observed compared to contact-inhibited cells, suggesting cycling cells are more active in synthesizing proteins for ongoing growth and division. Our results show that reduced RPS14 expression with emetine treatment at 72 hpi is a result of its degradation, which is consequential to its interaction with MDM2. The reported interaction of RPS14 with MDM2 directed us to investigate the role of RPS14 in the setting of MDM2-p53 interaction in HCMV replication (summarized in a model, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>D</figref>). Emetine treatment resulted in improved interaction between RPS14 and MDM2 in infected contact-inhibited cells. In uninfected cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, D) the interaction was not modified by emetine, likely because it did not translocate RPS14 into the nucleus (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>). In infected cells emetine induced RPS14 translocation into the nucleus (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>), where it could interact with MDM2 and compete with other viral proteins, such as IE2 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>) and cellular proteins such as p53 on the acidic domain of MDM2 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref>, D). Although the binding site of MDM2-IE2 has not been characterized, it is possible that through RPS14 binding to MDM2, IE2 is incapable of binding to MDM2. Later during infection RPS14 relocalized to the cytoplasm, was ubiquitinated and degraded (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>). RPS14 interacted with MDM2 at 24 hpi (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>), but its expression level was similar at all tested conditions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>), suggesting that at this time point a balance between virus-induced RPS14 and its emetine-triggered degradation was still maintained. However, at 72 hpi, when virus replication was sufficiently inhibited, a significant reduction in the expression of RPS14 was observed in emetine treated condition, indicating emetine-mediated RPS14 degradation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0100" num="0098">The dependence of emetine activity against HCMV on cell density at the time of infection (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) suggested that RPS14 interaction with the cell cycle regulators MDM2 and p53 may contribute to its activities. Reduced expression level of MDM2 during HCMV infection has been reported (16), and also shown here at 72 hpi (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>). Although infection induces p53 expression and results in reduced p53 activity, at MOI 1 we did not observe changes in p53 expression. Emetine treatment resulted in increased p53 activity in infected cells, evidenced by p21 mRNA expression (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>). Levels of MDM2 and p53 were stabilized with emetine (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, C), suggesting their interaction might be modified by the drug. Our data reveal that while MDM2-p53 interaction is required for HCMV replication, emetine disrupts this interaction by 24 h, resulting in stabilization of each interacting partner (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>D</figref>). In infected cycling cells in which HCMV escaped from emetine suppression (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>), MDM2-p53 interaction was not disrupted by the drug (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>D</figref>, E). Notably, in cycling non-infected cells the interaction between MDM2 and p53 was more significant than in the contact-inhibited cells, suggesting it prevents p53-mediated cell cycle arrest (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>D</figref>, E). However, in contact-inhibited cells, disruption of MDM2-p53 interaction takes place and in cycling cells, the p53 protein is targeted for degradation by interaction with MDM2.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0099">The p53 protein binds to MDM2 at the acidic domain (amino acid residues 235-300). RPS14 also binds to the same acidic domain of MDM2 at a significantly overlapping region with the p53 binding site (amino acid residues 215-300). Therefore, RPS14 may be competing with p53 for the same binding domain on MDM2. The reported mutations in the C-terminus domain of RPS14 that lead to emetine resistance; Arg-149-Cys and Arg-150-His, may imply altered binding to MDM2. With a higher number of amino group and proton donor, Arg may have higher affinity for the acidic domain of MDM2 as compared to His or Cys. Alternatively, haploinsufficiency of RPS14 may play a role in the interaction of MDM2-p53. These hypotheses will be tested in future studies.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0100">In HCMV-infected cells binding of RPS14 to MDM2 was required for emetine activities. In cycling cells, MDM2 and p53 already interacted, resulting in even higher affinity of MDM2 for p53, and the acidic domain of MDM2 was already occupied by p53. Therefore, RPS14 could not bind to MDM2 resulting in loss of emetine activity against HCMV. In contrast, in contact-inhibited cells, emetine induced RPS14 binding to the free MDM2-acidic domain and prevented virus-mediated interaction between p53 and MDM2, resulting in stabilization of p53 and MDM2. These findings were also supported by the early activity of emetine (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). If added after 12 hpi, emetine failed to inhibit virus, since by that time HCMV may engage most of the p53 with MDM2 resulting in blocking of the RPS14 binding site on MDM2. Although in non-infected cells, emetine stabilized MDM2 and p53 in both cycling and contact-inhibited cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref>), it could not induce the nuclear translocation of RPS14 or its binding with MDM2 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>). Future studies will address the consequences of disruption of MDM2-p53 binding and stabilization of p53 and MDM2 as a cellular strategy for HCMV inhibition.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0101">Our results show efficient inhibition of HCMV replication in vitro and MCMV replication in vivo, suggesting that repurposing of emetine at a much lower dose may provide therapeutic/prophylactic strategy for HCMV through host-directed antiviral mechanism. Although the route of administration and potential cumulative toxicities must be considered, the doses required for virus inhibition are significantly lower than the traditional doses used in clinical practice. For amebiasis, emetine has been administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously daily at 1 mg/kg (maximal dose of 60 mg) for up to 10 days. Severe side effects occurred rarely and were only observed at high doses. Emetine was well-tolerated when delivered intravenously at 1.5 mg/kg doses twice a week in clinical trials as an anti-tumor agent. Patients treated with 1 mg/kg emetine daily via subcutaneous injection for 10 days did not experience any notable toxicity. Extrapolating from a total of 600 mg amoebiasis dosing to HCMV dosing, 1000 times more drug would need to be administered to reach the same cumulative dose. The therapeutic plasma concentration of emetine is 0.005-0.075 &#x3bc;g/mL, and its half-life-&#x3e;24-48 h. As described herein, the in vitro data suggest that at therapeutic plasma concentration HCMV replication can be fully inhibited. In addition, the PK studies support wide and prolonged tissue distribution, which may be an important factor for HCMV inhibition.

Emetine exhibits efficient inhibition of CMV replication in vitro and in a mouse model in vivo, suggesting that its repurposing at a much lower dose may provide therapeutic strategy for CMV through host-directed anti-viral mechanism.

The total dose of emetine was as high as 1.42-1.75 gm, but no permanent cardiovascular changes were observed. The onset of ECG changes was variable and in some cases did not appear until after the treatment was stopped. In a study of 30 patients treated with 60 mg/day emetine hydrochloride IM for six days and three days with a three-day rest in between, no cardiac insufficiency or arrhythmias developed (Banerjea, J. C. The effect of emetine therapy on the cardiovascular system. J Assoc Physicians India 14, 349-364 (1966)). ECG changes occurred in 63% of patients (T-wave inversion and prolongation of the Q-T interval). No serious cardiotoxicity was observed. A similar conclusion was drawn by another study in 54 patients (Ramachandran, S. Adverse effects of emetine therapy. Ceylon Med J 18, 138-143 (1973)). The effect of emetine on serum transaminases was investigated in 30 patients treated with 60 mg/day emetine IM for 6-9 days (Kini, P. M., Venugopal, N. S., Santhamma, K. M. &#x26; Rao, R. R.

ECG changes were observed in 40% of patients, with T-wave changes being the most common. Rise in SGOT enzyme was associated with the development of ECG changes, but clear correlation could not be determined. SGOT decreased abruptly after drug discontinuation.

Although the action of emetine is cumulative, many of the toxic manifestations were transient and subsided in spite of further drug administration. Some of these were; diarrhea, nausea, EKG changes. The latter were transient, indicating that the myocardial effects of emetine at therapeutic doses for amebiasis are reversible. Emetine-induced neuritis has been reported at doses exceeding 1 gram.

Peak concentrations (Cmax) estimates are calculated based on both mouse data (dose-proportional using allometric scaling) and prior clinical data (dose-proportional using syrup of ipecac studies).</p><p id="p-0114" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="266pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Dosing Estimates of SC Emetine in Humans</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="9"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="9" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Mouse </entry><entry>Human </entry><entry>Human</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>oral</entry><entry>Oral</entry><entry>SC</entry><entry/><entry>Cmax</entry><entry>Cmax</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Target</entry><entry>dose</entry><entry>Dose<sup>1</sup></entry><entry>dose<sup>1</sup></entry><entry>Ipecac</entry><entry>Mouse<sup>3</sup></entry><entry>Ipecac<sup>1</sup></entry><entry>C48 h<sup>5</sup></entry><entry>C72 h<sup>5</sup></entry></row><row><entry>Ratio</entry><entry>mg/kg</entry><entry>mg/kg</entry><entry>mg/kg</entry><entry>ratio<sup>2</sup></entry><entry>ng/mL</entry><entry>ng/mL</entry><entry>ng/mL</entry><entry>ng/mL</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="9" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="9"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="28pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="28pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="28pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="28pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="9" colwidth="28pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>1/3X</entry><entry>0.033</entry><entry>0.0027</entry><entry>0.0031</entry><entry>0.06</entry><entry>0.5</entry><entry>1.0</entry><entry>0.12</entry><entry>0.06</entry></row><row><entry>1X</entry><entry>0.100</entry><entry>0.0080</entry><entry>0.0094</entry><entry>0.17</entry><entry>1.4</entry><entry>3.1</entry><entry>0.35</entry><entry>0.18</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="9" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="9" align="left" id="FOO-00001"><sup>1</sup>Assumptions: FPO = 0.31, FSC = 0.85, half-life 24 h.</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="9" align="left" id="FOO-00002"><sup>2</sup>Ipecac ratio based on planned human SC doses relative to oral Ipecac 11 mg dose.</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="9" align="left" id="FOO-00003"><sup>3</sup>Cmax based on BALB/c experiments reported above where 0.1 mg/kg achieved Cmax 1.4 ng/mL.</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="9" align="left" id="FOO-00004"><sup>4</sup>Cmax Ipecac is based on Ipecac ratio times observed clinical Cmax.</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="9" align="left" id="FOO-00005"><sup>5</sup>C48 h and C72 h based on 24 horn half-life.

Emetine API is provided by the NCATS collaborators according to GMP standards and delivered to the Hopkins IDS. On the day of dosing, the IDS prepares a unit dose for SC injection by dissolution of the API in sterile water based on each individual participant's body weight to achieve a final dose of 0.003 mg/kg (Cohort 1) or 0.009 mg/kg (Cohort 2).</p><p id="p-0115" num="0112">Dose escalation/adjustment criteria: Three participants are evaluated in cohort 1. If no participants experience grade 3 toxicity, then the study escalates to cohort 2 in which 6 research participants are evaluated. If 1 of 3 research participants experiences grade 3 or more toxicity in Cohort 1, then an additional 3 research participants are enrolled at that dose level. If a second participant experiences grade 3 or 4 toxicity, then the study is stopped. There are no reductions in dose as the mouse activity occurred at concentrations higher than those anticipated in cohort 1. Similarly, if any 2 research participants experience grade 3 or higher toxicity in Cohort 2, then the enrollment is stopped. Interim analysis of data for Cmax and AUC is completed following the first 3 research participants at each cohort level. If the median Cmax for Cohort 1 does not meet or exceed the mouse Cmax value in Table 1, then the dose for Cohort 2 is adjusted upwards proportionally to achieve the Cmax achieved at the 0.1 mg/kg level in the mouse studies (the level associated with anti-CMV activity).</p><heading id="h-0017" level="2">Study Procedures</heading><p id="p-0116" num="0113">Screening: Screening to determine study eligibility is established based on medical history, physical examination, ECG, and routine laboratory evaluation (chemistry, hematology).

Screening laboratory studies (chemistry, hematology) are repeated and used for baseline values, but not to further exclude research participants. Emetine is administered by SC injection based on cohort dose, either 0.003 mg/mg (Cohort 1) or 0.009 mg/kg (Cohort 2). Blood samples are obtained pre-dose, at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 32, 48, 72, and 96 hours post-dose. For both safety and logistical reasons, research participants remain in the research clinic for 24 hours after completion the dose. Research participants have safety evaluation each morning associated with a clinic visit (24, 48, 72, 96 hours) to include interim history and targeted physical examination. ECG and laboratory evaluation (chemistry, hematology) also occurs at 24, 72, and 96 hours post dose. Any abnormalities identified by history, physical examination, or laboratory test, are followed until resolution. All adverse events encountered during the clinical study are reported on the Case Report Form (CRF) that is prepared for this study.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0115">Safety is monitored by recording and assessing adverse events and abnormal laboratory values.

PK parameters are estimated using standard intensive PK methods for non-compartmental and compartmental data analysis. Non-compartmental estimates for each research participant are calculated and include area under the curve (AUC), maximum serum concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax (Tmax), terminal elimination half-life (t1/2), clearance (Cl/F), and volume of distribution (Vd/F). Compartmental PK parameters include (insofar as the data allow), Cmax, AUCO-inf, % AUCextrapolated, Cl/F, V/F, intercompartmental clearance (Q), elimination rate constant (ke), absorption rate constant (ka), distribution rate constant (kd), PK parameter estimates are summarized using descriptive statistics, including, means, standard deviations, medians, and ranges. Cmax and AUC are assessed for dose proportionality using dose-adjusted median values by cohort. Resultant PK parameters aid in determining the appropriate multi-dose regimen to achieve target serum concentration via PK model simulations.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0117">With the progress in transplantations, and the increasing number of people living with organ or bone marrow transplant, treatment for CMV becomes a major challenge. Not infrequently CMV infection affects graft survival, morbidity and mortality. The FDA-approved antiviral agents suppress CMV replication, but prolonged courses of therapy lead to emergence of drug resistant mutants. A recent retrospective review from Johns Hopkins highlights the toxicities associated with foscarnet (Avery, R. K., et al. Outcomes in Transplant Recipients Treated with Foscarnet for Ganciclovir-Resistant or Refractory Cytomegalovirus Infection. Transplantation (2016)). Through NIH-funded project for high throughput screening, the present inventors identified emetine as a CMV inhibitor at low nM doses.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0118">Because the rate of excretion of emetine is slow, the ingestion of daily oral doses may produce an accumulation that approaches the fatal parenteral dose, which has been estimated to be 600-1250 mg in adults (Palmer, E. P. &#x26; Guay, A. T. Reversible myopathy secondary to abuse of ipecac in patients with major eating disorders. N. Engl. J. Med 313, 1457-1459 (1985)). In a 70 kg person one month of emetine dosing for CMV at 0.008 mg/kg (extrapolated dose from the mice data to human dosing) will result in a cumulative dose of 7 mg (10 doses total), or 21 mg (30 doses total). Studies of amebiasis have shown ECG abnormalities when the total doses of emetine were 1.75 gm. No permanent cardiovascular changes were observed. The reported ECG changes can be monitored during therapy, and may not be significant at the low dose. Although the accumulated clinical experience indicates that patients treated with emetine do not have long-lasting myocardial damage, the observed inhibition of protein synthesis in vitro by emetine led to investigation of this question. There was no effect of emetine on cardiac protein synthesis (Yang, W. C. &#x26; Dubick, M. Mechanism of emetine cardiotoxicity. Pharmacol. Ther 10, 15-26 (1980)). Thus, the in vitro studies of protein inhibition may not apply to in vivo after chronic emetine treatment. We have reported that at concentration that inhibit CMV replication in vitro there was no inhibition of protein synthesis by emetine (Mukhopadhyay, R., et al. Efficacy and Mechanism of Action of Low Dose Emetine against Human Cytomegalovirus. PLoS Pathog 12, e1005717 (2016)). In fact, at the nM dosing and based on the present inventors' investigation of the mechanism of action of emetine, the expression level of some cellular proteins (such as MDM2 and p53) was increased. Taken together, the present inventors propose a new strategy for CMV therapeutics, based on repurposing of an old agent that was used in the past at much higher doses.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-sequence-list-doc id="SEQLST-1"><sequence-list file="US20230000857A1-20230105-S00001.XML" carriers="internal-electronic" seq-file-type="ST.25"/></us-sequence-list-doc><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00001" nb-file="US20230000857A1-20230105-M00001.NB"><img id="EMI-M00001" he="9.48mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230000857A1-20230105-M00001.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-claim-statement>We claim:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
