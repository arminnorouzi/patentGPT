Power transformers located in substations may be used to reduce high-voltages to low-voltages that can be distributed to the electricity consumers. Maintenance may be performed on equipment in the substation to ensure reliable, safe, and efficient operation. For example, some equipment in the substation may be subjected to wear over time and may be replaced. In some cases, some equipment may be tested to ensure proper operation. However, if the testing is not coordinated correctly, monitoring systems in the substation may interpret a testing mode as a failure or error in the equipment associated with the substation.

Furthermore, the phrase A &#x201c;based on&#x201d; B is intended to mean that A is at least partially based on B. Moreover, unless expressly stated otherwise, the term &#x201c;or&#x201d; is intended to be inclusive (e.g., logical OR) and not exclusive (e.g., logical XOR). In other words, the phrase &#x201c;A or B&#x201d; is intended to mean A, B, or both A and B.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In addition, several aspects of the embodiments described may be implemented as software modules or components. As used herein, a software module or component may include any type of computer instruction or computer-executable code located within a memory device and/or transmitted as electronic signals over a system bus or wired or wireless network. A software module or component may, for instance, include physical or logical blocks of computer instructions, which may be organized as a routine, program, object, component, data structure, or the like, and which performs a task or implements a particular data type.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In certain embodiments, a particular software module or component may include disparate instructions stored in different locations of a memory device, which together implement the described functionality of the module. Indeed, a module or component may include a single instruction or many instructions, and may be distributed over several different code segments, among different programs, and across several memory devices. Some embodiments may be practiced in a distributed computing environment where tasks are performed by a remote processing device linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment, software modules or components may be located in local and/or remote memory storage devices. In addition, data being tied or rendered together in a database record may be resident in the same memory device, or across several memory devices, and may be linked together in fields of a record in a database across a network.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Thus, embodiments may be provided as a computer program product including a tangible, non-transitory, computer-readable and/or machine-readable medium having stored thereon instructions that may be used to program a computer (or other electronic device) to perform processes described herein. For example, a non-transitory computer-readable medium may store instructions that, when executed by a processor of a computer system, cause the processor to perform certain methods disclosed herein. The non-transitory computer-readable medium may include, but is not limited to, hard drives, optical disks, compact disc read-only memories (CD-ROMs), digital versatile disc read-only memories (DVD-ROMs), read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs), erasable programmable read-only memories (EPROMs), electrically erasable programmable read-only memories (EEPROMs), magnetic or optical cards, solid-state memory devices, or other types of machine-readable media suitable for storing electronic and/or processor executable instructions.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Digital monitoring systems may be used to monitor and/or control various aspects of an electric power delivery system and/or substation. For example, a digital monitoring system (e.g., digital secondary system) may be used to place a merging unit into a maintenance mode in order to perform testing or maintenance on a primary switchgear. In some cases, a maintenance mode of a merging unit may be used to perform testing and/or maintenance on various power system elements, such as a circuit breaker, a current transformer, a power transformer, a disconnect, and the like, coupled to the merging unit, or the merging unit itself. A merging unit may be used to monitor a component of the electric power delivery system and may obtain data related to a voltage, a current, a temperature, a power, a load of the respective component, a switchgear status, and the like.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">When a switchgear associated with a merging unit or the merging unit itself undergoes testing, a relay coupled to the merging unit may still receive data from that merging unit. However, the data received from the merging unit may not be an accurate representation of a status of the delivery system or particular protection elements coupled to that merging unit. In some cases, inaccurate data interpreted by the relay may result in mis-operation of the relay and cause various protection elements to be taken off-line even though they are still needed. Thus, in some cases, the data received by the relay from the merging unit may indicate that the merging unit is in maintenance mode and the data should not be processed as providing an accurate representation of the upstream components.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Embodiments presented herein provide apparatus and techniques for indicating a maintenance mode of a merging unit coupled to protection devices of an electrical delivery system. In some cases, a maintenance mode of a merging unit may be indicated by software or hardware of the relay and/or merging unit. In some cases, data received by a relay from a merging unit may include an indication of a maintenance mode. In some cases, the relay may receive a separate indication (e.g., separate from the received data) that the merging unit is in maintenance mode. While a merging unit is in maintenance mode, a relay coupled thereto may disregard some or all data received from that merging unit. That is, the relay may use monitoring data from another (e.g., redundant) merging unit to monitor aspects of the electrical delivery system. In some cases, the relay may ignore or disregard all or a portion of the monitoring data received from a merging unit in maintenance mode by forcing one or more received data bits (and/or corresponding analog values) to zero.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, the relay may maintain a merging unit in maintenance mode even if the merging unit is removed (e.g., disconnected) from the relay. That is, the merging unit can no longer communicate with the relay. In that case, the relay may &#x201c;see&#x201d; the merging unit as being in maintenance mode and force the &#x201c;received&#x201d; data bits (and/or corresponding analog values) to zero. Without the merging unit being placed in a maintenance mode, the relay may consider the lack of communication as data loss and may block operation and/or performance of protection elements associated with that merging unit. That is, the maintenance mode of the merging unit (now disconnected) may enable the relay to maintain operation and/or monitoring of line protection elements even if an associated merging unit is temporarily taken out of service.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a simplified diagram of an electric power delivery system <b>100</b>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure.

The logic diagram <b>240</b> may be representative of logic programmed into the relay <b>220</b> discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>. For example, logic corresponding to the logic diagram <b>240</b> may be programmed and implemented via hardware, firmware, or software of the relay <b>220</b>. As shown, the logic diagram <b>240</b> includes a set/reset (SR) latch <b>242</b>, a OR gate <b>244</b>, and an AND gate <b>246</b> with an inverted input. The SR latch <b>242</b> receives an indication of whether or not a maintenance mode (MM) flag (e.g., bit) is set (e.g., a logic high, 1) in data received from a merging unit. If the maintenance mode flag is set, an &#x201c;MM flag&#x201d; <b>248</b> input to the SR latch <b>242</b> is the logic high resulting in an output (e.g., Q) of the SR latch <b>242</b> being the logic high.

Advantageously, the SR latch <b>242</b> enables the relay to detect a particular merging unit as being in maintenance mode even if the merging unit is removed or turned off. For example, to replace a merging unit, the merging unit may first indicate to the relay that the merging unit is in maintenance mode. Using an SR latch, the relay will maintain that merging unit in maintenance mode even if the relay loses connectivity with the merging unit due to replacement, or otherwise. In some cases, power to the particular merging unit may be turned off to maintenance and/or replacement of the merging unit or associated equipment.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The OR gate <b>244</b> receives a forced maintenance mode signal <b>252</b> indicating a forced maintenance mode of a merging unit. A merging unit may be forced into the maintenance mode if the merging unit fails and thus the maintenance bit in the data from the merging unit cannot be set. For example, if the merging unit is no longer operational (e.g., the merging unit needs to be installed or replaced, or a firmware of the merging unit needs to be updated and/or upgraded), no data can be sent from the merging to the relay <b>220</b>. In that case, a forced maintenance mode may be implemented by the relay <b>220</b> based on the forced maintenance mode signal <b>252</b>. If the merging unit is forced into maintenance mode, the forced maintenance mode signal <b>252</b> may be the logic high. If either or both the forced maintenance mode signal <b>252</b> or the output of the SR latch <b>242</b> is the logic high, an output of the OR gate <b>244</b> is the logic high.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The AND gate <b>246</b> receives the output of the OR gate <b>244</b> and a maintenance mode override signal <b>254</b>. The maintenance mode override signal <b>254</b> supersedes (e.g., overrides) the maintenance mode flag <b>248</b> and the forced maintenance mode signal <b>252</b>. The maintenance mode override signal <b>254</b> may be used to read the data values from a merging unit even if the merging unit is in maintenance mode (e.g., as indicated by the maintenance bit in the data received from the merging unit). As illustrated, the override signal <b>254</b> is inverted at the input of the AND gate <b>246</b>. In this way, a maintenance mode output <b>256</b> of the AND gate <b>246</b> (and the logic <b>240</b>) is a logic high if the output of the OR gate <b>244</b> is the logic high and the override is the logic low. That is, if the override signal <b>254</b> is the logic high, the maintenance mode output <b>256</b> is the logic low, indicating that the corresponding merging unit is not in the maintenance mode.

The process <b>330</b> is discussed with respect to data received by the relay from a single merging unit. However, it should be understood that the process <b>330</b> can be applied to a number of merging units coupled to a relay to determine if one or more of the merging units are in maintenance mode.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The process <b>330</b> begins at operation <b>332</b> where the relay receives data from the merging unit. The data may include measured or sensed values from equipment (e.g., a circuit breaker) corresponding to the merging unit. At operation <b>334</b>, the logic of the relay determines if the maintenance mode flag (e.g., bit) is set. For example, the logic may determine if a designated bit (e.g., a maintenance mode bit) in the data is a logic high to indicate a maintenance mode of the merging unit. If the maintenance mode bit is the logic high, the logic proceeds to operation <b>340</b>, discussed in more detail below, to determine if a mode override is received. If the maintenance mode bit is logic low (e.g., indicating the merging unit is not in maintenance mode) at operation <b>334</b>, the process <b>330</b> proceeds to operation <b>336</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">At operation <b>336</b>, the logic of the relay determines if a forced maintenance mode signal (e.g., bit) is received. As discussed above, the merging unit may be forced into maintenance mode if the merging unit fails and no data is received therefrom. Thus, the relay disregards the (expected) data as if the merging unit transmitted data to the relay that included a logic high maintenance mode bit. If the relay receives a forced maintenance mode signal at operation <b>336</b>, the logic determines if a mode override signal is received at operation <b>340</b>. As discussed above, a mode override may be used to read the data values from the merging unit even though the merging unit is maintenance mode based on the maintenance mode flag or the forced maintenance mode signal. If the logic determines that an override is not received, the relay treats the merging unit as being in maintenance mode and disregards the data from the merging unit at operation <b>342</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">If the forced maintenance mode signal is not received at operation <b>336</b>, or if a mode override is received at operation <b>340</b>, the relay reads and processes the data from the merging unit at operation <b>338</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">While specific embodiments and applications of the disclosure have been illustrated and described, it is to be understood that the disclosure is not limited to the precise configurations and components disclosed herein.
