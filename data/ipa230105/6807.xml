Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method for reception of a signal by a subscriber in a real-time network, the signal having a signal clock having a signal clock frequency and the subscriber comprising a counter that has a counter clock having a counter clock frequency and maps a local time of the subscriber.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Discussion of Background Information</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Data in the form of digital signals is transmitted between subscribers in a real-time network. A transmitting subscriber comprises a first counter having a first counter clock having a first clock frequency. A receiving subscriber comprises a second counter having a second counter clock having a second clock frequency. Often the second clock frequency does not match the first clock frequency, i.e., it is neither synchronous nor in phase. A counter increases its counter reading in the counter clock at the associated clock frequency, wherein it also is possible for the clock period to be viewed as the inverse of the clock frequency. With this consideration, the counter increments its counter reading every clock period.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The transmitting subscriber transmits the digital signal to the receiving subscriber. In order to transmit information via the signal, the transmitting subscriber quantizes information to be transmitted with the signal at specific points in time, which are specified in the signal clock by a signal clock frequency. Thus, the quantized values of the signal are spaced with the signal clock period. Because the transmitting subscriber comprises a first counter, it uses the first clock frequency of the first counter as the signal clock frequency. The signal is sampled by the receiving subscriber at a sampling clock frequency to quantize the signal. Because the receiving subscriber comprises a second counter, it in turn uses the second clock frequency of the second counter as the sampling clock frequency. If the second clock frequency is adapted to the signal clock frequency, the signal can be reconstructed without loss. It is also common in asynchronous transmissions to sample at a multiple of the bit rate/symbol rate, which is referred to as over-sampling. In this case, sampling frequencies of up to a few 100 MHz are provided. However, the resolution of the sampling of the signal is limited by the second clock frequency of the second counter of the receiving subscriber. If, for example, the second counter is operated at a clock frequency of 125 MHz, i.e., a second clock period of 8 ns, this leads to a resolution of 8 ns. The resolution can only be improved by increasing the clock frequency, which is not possible or only possible to a very limited extent.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Methods are known in which a master provides a clock signal that is recovered by a slave and fed back to the master. The master determines the deviation of the returned clock from the original clock using a phase detector and adjusts its clock signal to reduce the deviation. Said method is being developed at the CERN Institute as part of the White Rabbit project. To achieve a sub-nanosecond resolution, an extension of Synch (Synchronous Ethernet) is used. This makes a very high resolution possible. However, very high demands are also placed on the oscillator in terms of frequency deviation and jitter behavior. Furthermore, only approximately 10 subscribers can be connected in series, because the subscribers always synchronize their signals with the clock of a connected subscriber. Negative effects, such as jitter, etc., also cascade with the clock synchronization, since the signal which is sent to the other subscribers is generated with the clock of the port, with which said subscribers are to be synchronized.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 8,698,530 B2 discloses a global clock frequency that is made available to all subscribers. In order to achieve a higher resolution that is higher than the global resolution based on the global clock frequency, the local clock frequency is continuously regulated to adapt the clock frequencies of the subscribers to each other. To this end, the counters of the subscribers are operated in different time domains, i.e., each subscriber has a different local time.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments provide a flexible method for receiving signals.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to embodiments, a reception clock of a reception counter of the subscriber is provided for sampling the signal, the reception clock being derived from the counter clock, whereby the reception counter also maps the local time of the subscriber, a phase position of the reception clock being adapted to the phase position of the signal clock, when the reception clock is derived from the counter clock, and the signal being sampled at a reception clock frequency of the reception counter.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The signal can be further processed after sampling. The phase position of the reception clock can be adapted to the phase position of the signal clock, for example, by shifting the phase position of the reception clock in the direction of the phase position of the signal clock.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Since it is not possible to transfer a signal from one clock domain to another asynchronous clock domain (without generating inaccuracies) without special mechanisms, embodiments not only provide the counter in a counter clock domain for mapping the local time, but also an addition reception counter in a reception clock domain, the reception clock of said addition reception counter being derived from the counter clock. Though the reception counter is clock-asynchronous, it is value-synchronous and also maps the local time taking into account a phase shift relative to the counter clock. Thus, a reception counter having a reception clock frequency is provided at the subscriber in addition to a counter clock having a counter clock frequency for mapping the local time. After the timestamp has been formed in the reception clock domain, the information can be transmitted to the counter clock domain via an interface. It is thus desirable to ensure a sufficiently small phase shift between the counter clock and the reception clock so that the timing information of the two domains is synchronized.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The reception clock is preferably derived from the counter clock using a phase-locked loop.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The reception clock frequency can correspond to the counter clock frequency. However, the reception clock frequency is preferably a multiple of the counter clock frequency, whereby the reception counter has a multiple of the resolution of the counter because the signal can be sampled at a higher bit rate.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">It can be assumed that the reception clock frequency differs at least slightly from the signal clock frequency, which is why the reception clock and signal clock drift apart leading to a phase shift. This can be remedied, at least temporarily, by a one-time adjustment of the phase position of the reception clock to the signal clock. It is advantageous to also adapt the counter reading of the reception counter to the adjusted phase position, whereby the quantization time of the reception counter can be changed and the signal can be sampled with less uncertainty.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A sign of a phase shill between the reception clock and the signal clock is preferably determined and, based on this the phase position of the reception clock, is changed to adapt the phase position of the reception clock to the phase position of the signal clock. It is possible to recognize in which direction the phase position of the reception clock must be shifted to reduce the phase shift, by determining the sign of the phase shift. However, if the phase position is shifted by an amount greater than the phase shift, overshooting occurs, which in turn changes the sign of the phase shift.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The phase position of the reception clock can be changed over a plurality of reception clock periods. This allows the phase position of the reception clock to be successively adapted to the phase position of the signal clock. When the phase position is changed in one direction based on the previously determined sign of the phase shift and overshooting occurs (i.e., the phase difference changes its sign), then the phase position of the reception clock is shifted in the other direction in the next reception clock period, as a result of which overshoot can occur in the other direction. A situation can arise in which the phase position of the reception clock is changed alternately in one direction and the other and thus alternately overshoots in both directions, i.e. oscillates around the phase position of the signal clock frequency.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In case a phase-locked loop is used to generate the reception clock from the counter clock, it is advantageous that said phase-locked loop supports dynamic phase shifts. The size of said phase shifts is preferably constant. This allows the phase position of the reception clock to be shifted to the counter clock (which serves as a reference clock) in small steps (&#x3c;&#x3c;1 ns, depending on the FPGA or ASIC used), which in turn allows the phase position of the reception clock to be continuously adapted to the phase position of the signal clock.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The phase position of the reception clock is preferably changed for each reception clock period by shifting said phase position by a positive or negative phase increment. The current phase position can be determined using a signal edge. Signal edges always occur when 8B10B coding is used, for example. If, based on the sign of the phase shift, the phase position of the reception clock frequency is changed by one phase increment over a plurality of reception clock periods, a phase deviation of less than one (positive or negative) phase increment remains after a sufficient number of shift steps.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The counter reading of the reception counter is preferably changed analogously to the phase position of the reception clock. Thus, the quantization time of the reception counter is adjusted to the local time using the counter reading, such that it is correctly quantized and reproduced. By adjusting the phase position of the reception clock to the phase position of the signal clock and consequently adjusting the reception counter it can be ensured that the signal is sampled with low quantization errors. The resolution with which the received signal can be measured is no longer directly dependent on the counter clock, but on the currently occurring phase shift.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The signal clock frequency is known in advance and can preferably be reconstructed from the signal by the subscriber. If the signal is line-coded, for example with 8B10B line coding, the signal clock frequency can be reconstructed from the signal in a particularly simple manner.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Embodiments are directed to a method for reception of a signal by a subscriber of a real-time network.

It is advantageous, if the reception clock frequency f<b>20</b> is a multiple, for example five times, the counter clock frequency f<b>2</b>, whereby the resolution of the reception counter Z<b>20</b> is also a multiple of the counter Z<b>2</b> and the signal S can be sampled at this increased resolution.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The reception counter Z<b>20</b> increases its counter reading at the reception clock frequency f<b>20</b>, i.e., per reception clock period T<b>20</b>, by a plurality of reception counter increments I<b>20</b>, the local time t<b>2</b> only being reproduced exactly at these moments, i.e., only when the reception counter Z<b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> intersects the local time t<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Under real conditions, a phase shift &#x394;P can be assumed, which is why the change in the counter reading of the reception counter Z<b>20</b> takes place at slightly different points in time than a change in the counter reading of the counter Z<b>2</b>. It can also be assumed that the reception clock frequency f<b>20</b> differs from the signal clock frequency f<b>11</b> under real conditions.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Therefore, according to the invention, the phase position of the reception clock frequency f<b>20</b> (and the reception clock period T<b>20</b>) is adapted to the phase position of the signal clock period T<b>11</b> (and thus that of the signal clock frequency f<b>11</b>). It may be the case that the absolute phase shift &#x394;P between the reception clock period T<b>20</b> and the signal clock period T<b>11</b> is not known, but the sign of the phase shift &#x394;P is known. In this case it can be determined, for example, whether the phase shift &#x394;P increases or decreases when there is a change in the reception clock period T<b>20</b>. It is thus possible to conclude whether the phase shift &#x394;P between the reception clock period T<b>20</b> and the signal clock period T<b>11</b> is positive or negative.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The reception clock period T<b>20</b> is thus synchronized with the signal clock period T<b>11</b>. It can be assumed that an absolute phase shift &#x394;P remains despite synchronization, which results in a small quantization error after synchronization. In order to ensure that the signal clock period T<b>11</b> and the reception clock period T<b>20</b> do not diverge, it is advantageous when the synchronization takes place permanently.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The phase position of the reception clock is preferably shifted by a phase increment PI equal to a counter increment I<b>10</b> of the reception counter Z<b>20</b>. The sign of the phase shift &#x394;P is determined, for example, by a phase detector. The sign of the phase shift &#x394;P can be determined, for example, by first shifting the phase of the reception clock in one direction and then determining whether the phase shift &#x394;P has increased or decreased. After each introduction of a phase increment PI it is thus possible to determine whether a positive or negative phase increment PI is added in the next reception clock period T<b>20</b>. For example, if the phase shift &#x394;P is negative but less than a phase increment PI, adding a positive phase increment PI will result in a positive phase shift &#x394;P (which is also less than a phase increment PI). Therefore, in the next reception clock period T<b>20</b>, a negative phase increment &#x2212;PI is added, etc. This alternating addition of positive and negative phase increments would, for example, take place permanently if the reception clock period T<b>20</b> corresponded precisely to the signal clock period T<b>11</b>, but a phase shift &#x394;P smaller than a phase increment PI remains.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a negative phase shift &#x394;P initially occurs, the amount of which corresponds, for example, to three and a half phase increments PI and is therefore greater in amount than a phase increment PI, which is why a phase increment PI is added in the second reception clock period T<b>20</b> shown. In the next two reception clock periods T<b>20</b>, it is determined that the phase shift &#x394;P continues to be negative, which is why the phase of the reception clock period T<b>20</b> is shifted by a further positive phase increment PI. Thus, the phase shift &#x394;P is successively reduced to minus two and a half phase increments PI, minus one and a half phase increments PI and finally minus half a phase increment PI. After adding another phase increment PI, a phase shift &#x394;P of half a phase increment PI occurs.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The transient process is now complete because the phase shift &#x394;P is positive and has therefore changed signs. In the next reception clock period T<b>20</b>, the phase of the reception clock period T<b>20</b> is shifted by a negative phase increment &#x2212;PI. Subsequently, the phase shift &#x394;P is negative, which is why the phase of the reception clock period T<b>20</b> is shifted by a positive phase increment PI, etc.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The phase of the reception clock period T<b>20</b> can be shifted by a phase increment PI, for example, by means of a phase-locked loop.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">It is true that the reception clock frequency f<b>20</b> is asynchronous to the counter clock frequency f<b>2</b> due to shifting the phase position of the reception clock frequency T<b>20</b>. However, because the phase shifts &#x394;P are known, they can be taken into account in further processing.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">It is particularly advantageous if, in addition to changing the phase of the reception clock period T<b>20</b>, the counter reading of the reception counter Z<b>20</b> is also changed by a counter difference &#x394;Z corresponding to the phase shift &#x394;P, extended by a counter difference &#x394;Z=&#x394;P in the case of a positive phase shift &#x394;P and shortened by a counter difference &#x394;Z=&#x394;P in the case of a negative phase shift &#x394;P. In particular, if the phase shift &#x394;P is changed by a phase increment PI (corresponding to a counter increment I<b>20</b>), then the counter difference &#x394;Z is changed by the counter increment I<b>20</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, there is always a change in the phase shift &#x394;P by a phase increment PI and also an equivalent change in the counter reading of the reception counter Z.<b>20</b> by a counter increment I<b>20</b> in the amount of a phase increment PI. If the counter reading of the reception counter Z<b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> were not adjusted, then the reception counter would no longer be quantized in the local time t<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The adaptation of the reception counter Z<b>20</b> ensures that the local time t<b>2</b> continues to be mapped correctly by the reception counter Z<b>20</b> even after the phase shift &#x394;P. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the phase position and the counter reading of the reception counter Z<b>20</b> are changed in the same reception clock period T<b>20</b> of the reception counter Z<b>20</b>. However, the counter reading can also be changed in a later reception clock period T<b>20</b> by the counter difference &#x394;Z, or also piece-wise over a plurality of counter increments I<b>20</b>. Of course, it is only possible to use the added counter difference &#x394;Z if the reception counter Z<b>20</b> has a resolution that is greater than a reception frequency f<b>20</b>. For example, a resolution of 1 &#x3bc;s/2{circumflex over (&#x2003;)}16, i.e., approx. 15.26 ps, can be provided, which corresponds to a frequency of 65.536 GHz. This means that the resolution is 256 times higher than the reception clock frequency f<b>20</b>. If the phase shift &#x394;P corresponds, for example, to a 24th of the reception clock period T<b>20</b>, then the counter difference &#x394;Z corresponds to 65.536 GHz/(256 MHz*24)=10.6 (6 is periodic). In order to avoid an accumulation of rounding errors, all decimal places are preferably taken into account and the counter difference &#x394;Z is matched precisely to the phase shift &#x394;P.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The reception counter Z<b>20</b> requires a resolution that corresponds at least to the counter difference &#x394;Z. An even higher resolution is desirable, particularly when using digital filters. If the reception counter Z<b>20</b> has a reception clock frequency f<b>20</b> of 51.2 MHz, it is incremented 1280 times at a resolution of 15.26 ps in a reception clock period T<b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The reception counter Z<b>20</b> and the counter Z<b>2</b> therefore represent the same local time t<b>2</b> and are therefore &#x201c;value-synchronous,&#x201d; although the reception clock frequency f<b>20</b> and the counter clock frequency f<b>2</b> are asynchronous. However, because the phase shifts are known and are arranged before clock data recovery, they can be taken into account in further processing.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In reality, counter oscillators have a maximum deviation of +/&#x2212; 50 ppm, which means that two signals can deviate by a maximum of 100 ppm. It is therefore sufficient if the (accumulated) phase shift &#x394;P is not corrected after each counter increment I<b>20</b> of the reception counter Z<b>20</b>. It is therefore advantageous if the phase shift &#x394;P is corrected only after a maximum phase deviation has been exceeded, preferably in the amount of half a phase increment PI.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In addition to the above-described subscribers (transmitting and/or receiving), which can be implemented in particular by microprocessor-based hardware, microcontrollers, and/or integrated circuits (ASIC, FPGA), the subscribers can be implemental digitally, as software on microprocessor-based hardware.
