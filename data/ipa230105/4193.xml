The mobile electronic device <b>800</b> further comprises a touch panel <b>2</b> as needed. The door cover <b>5</b>, the functional module <b>6</b> and the stop apparatus <b>7</b> together form an expansion unit S.

The main framework <b>1</b> has therein a motherboard (not shown). The touch panel <b>2</b> is disposed on and fixed to the framework surface <b>11</b>. In a variant embodiment not illustrated by any diagram, a display screen or any other electronic device is fixed to the framework surface <b>11</b>.

The functional module <b>6</b> is electrically connected to a motherboard of the mobile electronic device <b>800</b> via the expansion window <b>33</b>. In embodiments of the application, the electrical connection between the functional module <b>6</b> and the motherboard is achieved by, for example, a connector <b>62</b> provided on functional module <b>6</b> and one or more flexible printed circuits (FPC, not shown) or a plurality of flexible flat cables (FFC, not shown) connected between the connector <b>62</b> and the motherboard, but the present disclosure is not limited thereto.

For instance, a protruding member <b>14</b> is protrudingly disposed at each of the four corners of the framework surface <b>12</b>, and all the protruding members <b>14</b> are higher than the back plate outer side <b>512</b>. Thus, even if the external force is exerted toward the back plate outer side <b>512</b>, the impact of the external force will be on the protruding members <b>14</b> rather than the back plate outer side <b>512</b>, thereby enhancing the insusceptibility of the back plate outer side <b>512</b> to a collision and a fall.

The first abutting portion <b>71</b> and the second abutting portion <b>72</b> bend relative to two opposing ends of the connecting portion <b>73</b>, respectively. The first abutting portion <b>71</b> is in contact with the aforesaid inward sides, because both its shape and bend angle match the aforesaid inward sides. The second abutting portion <b>72</b> is in contact with the stopping member <b>5311</b>, because both its shape and bend angle match the stopping member <b>5311</b>.

For example, where the functional module <b>26</b> is a port, the opening <b>255</b> allows a user to connect an external device to the mobile electronic device <b>800</b> via the port provided in the expansion unit S. In preferred embodiments, the functional module <b>26</b> is electrically connected to a motherboard <b>111</b> of the mobile electronic device <b>800</b> by a connector <b>62</b> of functional module <b>26</b> and a connector <b>112</b> of the motherboard <b>111</b>. A lid <b>257</b> is connected in a liftable and covering manner to the door cover <b>25</b>, so as to expose the opening <b>255</b> when lifted open or to block the opening <b>255</b> when closed for covering. In an alternate embodiment of the application illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>, the expansion unit S does not have a stop apparatus or an abutting structure.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In embodiments of the application, the lid <b>257</b> has a shape corresponding to that of the door cover <b>25</b>, and is also formed as an L-shaped bend (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>). In some embodiments, the lid <b>257</b> includes a fixing plate <b>2571</b>, a movable plate <b>2572</b>, and a bending portion <b>2573</b> connected between the fixed plate <b>2571</b> and the movable plate <b>2572</b>.
