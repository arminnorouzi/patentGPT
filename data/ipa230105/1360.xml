Because the size of the pore structures is close to those of permanent gases, a zeolite, if appropriately selected, can act as a molecular sieve, functioning analogously to conventional sand/stone/gravel sieves used at construction sites. Indeed, zeolite membranes have high potential for use in distinguishing minute differences in the shape and size of permanent gases, thus achieving energy-efficient gas separation (Jeon, M. Y. et al., <i>Nature </i>2017, 543, 690-691; Tung, C. T. P. et al., <i>Science </i>2011, 334, 1533-1538).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Among zeolite membranes, zeolite membranes having a DDR crystal structure have problems of difficulty in synthesizing DDR seed particles and very low reproducibility. Even when DDR structured particles are synthesized, there is a limitation in that it is difficult to obtain DDR seed particles having uniformity and size suitable for use as seed particles. Thus, such zeolite membranes are unsuitable for use in applied industrial processes despite the high potential thereof as a membrane. This is due to the absence to date of a robust method capable of reproducibly producing high-performance DDR structured zeolite membranes. Although a zeolite membrane synthesized using a seed growth (or secondary growth) method has the possibility of having reproducible separation performance, reproducible production of membranes having high separation ability using zeolite crystals with DDR structure is very rare even when this method is applied.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Zeolite membranes are usually produced using a seed growth method. In this case, seed particles having the same zeolite crystal structure as the zeolite constituting the membrane are uniformly deposited on a porous support (serving as a seed layer), and then a membrane is continuously grown. Therefore, in order to produce zeolite membranes with a CHA or DDR structure using conventional methods, the crystal structure of the zeolite constituting the seed particles should be the same as the crystal structure of the zeolite constituting the membrane. However, previously reported methods of synthesizing DDR zeolite particles are complicated and difficult, poorly reproducible, and limitedly able to realize an appropriate particle size. The drawbacks of these methods of synthesizing seed particles having a DDR structure make it difficult to produce a continuous DDR zeolite membrane with the seed growth method using the same.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The literature on methods of synthesizing zeolite particles having a DDR structure and previously reported methods teach that it is difficult to synthesize reproducible zeolite particles having a DDR structure (den Exter et al., Stud. Surf. Sci. Catal., 1994, 84, 1159-1166; Gucuyener et al., J. Mater. Chem., 2011, 21, 18386-18397; Kim et al., Chem. Commun., 2013, 49, 7418-7420). In addition, even when seed particles having a DDR structure are synthesized through a conventional method, a number of literature report that zeolite membranes having a DDR structure produced through seed growth using synthesized DDR particles have very low carbon dioxide/nitrogen separation performance.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Korean Patent No. 10-1927889 discloses a membrane having a DDR structure. In addition, U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,901,882, 6,953,493 and 7,282,082 disclose a CHA or DDR zeolite membrane produced using zeolites, wherein the crystal structure of the seed particles is the same as the crystal structure of the membrane formed thereon. This method uses DDR zeolite seed particles which are difficult and complicated to synthesize into the same structure as the membrane using a conventional seed growth method to produce a membrane having a DDR structure, thus having the difficulty of producing a zeolite membrane.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, as a result of extensive efforts to solve these problems, the present inventors found that a heterogeneous zeolite membrane having both CHA and DDR zeolite crystal structures produced by using zeolite particles having a CHA structure, which are a representative zeolite crystal structure, are highly reproducible and can be easily synthesized, as seed particles, and by growing the seed particles into a crystal structure different from that of the zeolite membrane is more effective for carbon dioxide separation than a conventional zeolite membrane, and particularly exhibits high CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>and CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>separation performance even under wet conditions.

In general, the nomenclature used herein is well-known in the art and is ordinarily used.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In an attempt to overcome the problem of the difficulty of producing a reproducible DDR zeolite membrane with high separation performance due to the difficulty of producing seed particles having a DDR structure in the production of zeolite membranes, a heterogeneous zeolite membrane having both CHA and DDR zeolite crystal structures is produced by using zeolite particles having a CHA structure, which are a representative zeolite crystal structure, are highly reproducible and can be easily synthesized, as seed particles, and growing the seed particles into a crystal structure different from that of the zeolite membrane and the heterogeneous zeolite membrane is found to be more effective for carbon dioxide separation than a conventional zeolite membrane, and particularly exhibit high CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>and CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>separation performance even under wet conditions.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Therefore, in one aspect, the present invention provides a method of preparing a heterogeneous zeolite membrane comprising: (a) forming a seed layer by depositing zeolite particles having a CHA structure on a support; and (b) producing a DDR@CHA heterogeneous zeolite membrane by performing hydrothermal synthesis on the support having the seed layer in the presence of a DDR precursor solution.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Therefore, in another aspect, the present invention provides a method of preparing a heterogeneous zeolite membrane comprising: (a) forming a seed layer by depositing zeolite particles having a DDR structure on a support; and (b) producing a CHA@DDR heterogeneous zeolite membrane by performing hydrothermal synthesis on the support having the seed layer in the presence of a CHA precursor solution.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The heterogeneous zeolite membrane is represented by &#x201c;membrane structure@seed particle structure&#x201d; using the symbol &#x201c;@&#x201d; throughout the specification of the present invention. For example, a heterogeneous zeolite membrane having a DDR membrane using seed particles having a CHA structure may be represented by &#x201c;DDR@CHA&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A schematic diagram showing a method for producing a DDR@CHA heterogeneous zeolite membrane including a membrane having a DDR structure which is effective for carbon dioxide separation using seed particles having a CHA structure according to the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The secondary growth method for forming the zeolite membrane refers to the entire process including depositing zeolite seed particles on the surface of a porous support and filling the gaps between the seed particles through hydrothermal treatment. However, the stringent conditions for epitaxial growth into the same type of crystals as the seed layer limit the type of high levels of zeolite membrane. In consideration of this, for the first time, deposition and growth between heterogeneous crystals were attempted by producing a ZSM-58 (DDR type zeolite) membrane containing a high amount of silica on the SSZ-13 (CHA type zeolite) seed layer. This is due to the structural similarity of CHA and DDR zeolites. The resulting membrane has excellent CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance selectivity. In addition, the heterogeneous zeolite membrane mainly includes DDR zeolites containing a high amount of silica, thus efficiently maintaining high CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance selectivity even in the presence of water vapor.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The present invention provides a method capable of reproducibly synthesizing a DDR@CHA heterogeneous zeolite membrane having high separation performance using, as seeds, SSZ-13 particles that are relatively easily synthesized and have a simple CHA structure, unlike a conventional production method using seed particles having the same DDR structure as the crystal structure of the membrane.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In addition, the present invention provides a method capable of reproducibly synthesizing a continuous CHA@DDR heterogeneous zeolite membrane by inducing a CHA structure from a seed layer composed of seed particles having a DDR structure in the opposite direction. That is, a heterogeneous zeolite membrane in which CHA and DDR zeolite structures coexist in one zeolite membrane can be produced.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Representative advantages of the use of CHA type seed particles for heterogeneous zeolite membranes are as follows.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">(1) The hydrothermal synthesis time (7 days) of SSZ-13 seed particles is shorter than the hydrothermal synthesis time (25 days) of DDR seed particles. This confers an economic advantage because hydrothermal synthesis reactions require high temperatures.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">(2) The solution for the synthesis of DDR seed particles contains two organic structure derivatives and thus is not economically efficient compared to SSZ-13 seed particles which require one organic structure derivative.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">(3) DDR seed particles with low reproducibility waste organic structure derivatives and reduce economical efficiency because organic structure derivatives are required for the synthesis of seed particles.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">(4) The synthetic solution for the production of DDR seed particles involves a preparation process at 95&#xb0; C., which is a high temperature, whereas the synthetic solution for SSZ-13 seed particles enables the overall preparation process at room temperature.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">(5) Seed particles for the production of membranes should be small and uniform. It is difficult to control the particle size of DDR seed particles, while it is easy to control the particle size of SSZ-13 seed particles.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In an embodiment of the present invention, a synthetic solution having a Si/Al ratio of 5 to &#x221e; is used to synthesize seed particles having SSZ-13 zeolite with a CHA structure or to synthesize a membrane to be formed.

Conventional SSZ-13 particles (&#x2dc;0.7 &#x3bc;m and &#x2dc;5 &#x3bc;m) are not only too large in size for use as seed particles, but also have two particle size distributions, and seed particles having a small and uniform size should be used to form a uniform seed layer.

For this reaction, 200 mL of ethanol was first poured into a 500 mL round-bottom flask connected to a reflux condenser. Then, 50 g of tropine was dissolved in ethanol while stirring with a magnetic bar. Prior to the reaction, the flask was wrapped with aluminum foil to provide a dark environment, and argon was supplied to the flask to ensure an inert environment. Then, 51 g of iodomethane was added dropwise to the flask while stirring with a magnetic bar. After completion of addition, the reaction was carried out at room temperature for 3 days. During the reaction, the solution was continuously stirred using a magnetic bar and the flask was sealed with Teflon tape to maintain the inert conditions. The resulting product was obtained as a white powder, filtered by vacuum filtration and washed with a large amount of ethanol to obtain a highly pure product.

Then, a silica raw material (LUDOX&#xae; HS-40 colloidal silica, 40 wt % suspension in H<sub>2</sub>O, Sigma-Aldrich) was quickly added to the MTI solution dissolved in water. The solution was thoroughly mixed in a mixer for 12 hours. For convenience, this solution is called &#x201c;solution A&#x201d;. At the same time, a predetermined amount of sodium hydroxide (=98% pellet, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in distilled water and further mixed with a shaking box for about 12 hours. This solution is called &#x201c;solution B&#x201d;. The prepared solutions A and B were mixed and then allowed to stand in the shaking box for an additional period of approximately 12 hours until the opaque mixture observed immediately after mixing became a clear solution. The final molar composition of the synthetic solution was 70 SiO<sub>2</sub>: 23 NaOH: 17.5 MTI: 2800 H<sub>2</sub>O. The molar ratio of distilled water to the synthetic solution of ZSM-58 (DDR-type zeolite) is solution A:solution B of 1:4. About 30 mL of the prepared synthetic solution was poured into a Teflon liner (45 mL) containing an &#x3b1;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>disc coated with seed particles. The seed-coated surface of the &#x3b1;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>disc was directed downwards at an incline using a Teflon holder. The Teflon liner containing the disc was placed in a stainless-steel autoclave and the autoclave was transferred to an oven preheated to 130&#xb0; C. The reaction was carried out under static conditions. The hydrothermal secondary growth process was performed for different periods of time (4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 days respectively). After completion of the reaction, the autoclave was removed and rapidly cooled with tap water. The disc sample was taken out and then the synthesized membrane was washed with a sufficient amount of distilled water and further dried in an oven (HYSC, DO-42) at 100&#xb0; C.

Interestingly, the decrease in CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance due to water vapor was greater than the permeance of other components that penetrate very slowly, resulting in a decrease of the corresponding separation factor in the temperature range of 30 to 75&#xb0; C. under wet conditions. Nevertheless, even when water vapor is present, the CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance selectivity of DDR@CHA_10d is very high. When taking into consideration the fact that the CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>separation factor is 9.1&#xb1;3.6, the CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>separation factor is 78&#xb1;9 at 50&#xb0; C., and flue gas and biogas from coal-burning thermal power plants contain water vapor at a pressure up to &#x2dc;12 kPa in the temperature range of about 50 to 60&#xb0; C. (D. Singh et al., <i>Energy Convers. Manag. </i>44, 3073-3091 (2003); T. C. Merkel et al., <i>J. Membr. Sci. </i>359, 126-139 (2010); E.

Biotechnol. </i>85, 849-860 (2010)), the hydrophobic DDR@CHA_10d has reliable CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance selectivity and thus can be expected to be applied in this field. In addition, the more realistic separation performance of DDR@CHA_10d in the exhaust gas conditions after combustion is almost the same as the values shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>. DDR@CHA_10d shows a nearly linear response to carbon dioxide partial pressure change in the mixed gas due to the linear adsorption behavior of CO<sub>2 </sub>molecules (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b> and <b>19</b></figref>). This supports the reliable and flexible availability of DDR@CHA_10d with regard to various or varying molar compositions of CO<sub>2 </sub>molecules.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Thickness and contact angle of water</entry></row><row><entry>droplet of DDR@CHA membranes</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="70pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Contact angle of</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>Sample&#x2009;<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00001" he="1.44mm" wi="1.44mm" file="US20230001361A1-20230105-P00001.TIF" alt="custom-character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> </entry><entry>Thickness (&#x3bc;m)&#x2009;<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00002" he="1.44mm" wi="1.44mm" file="US20230001361A1-20230105-P00001.TIF" alt="custom-character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> </entry><entry>water droplet (&#xb0;)&#x2009;<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00003" he="1.44mm" wi="1.44mm" file="US20230001361A1-20230105-P00001.TIF" alt="custom-character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> </entry><entry><img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00004" he="1.44mm" wi="1.44mm" file="US20230001361A1-20230105-P00001.TIF" alt="custom-character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> </entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>DDR@CHA_4d&#x2009;<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00005" he="1.44mm" wi="1.44mm" file="US20230001361A1-20230105-P00001.TIF" alt="custom-character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> </entry><entry>2.8 &#xb1;

In the robustness experiment, DDR@CHA_10d was exposed to the same concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>at 50&#xb0; C. and 75&#xb0; C., which are typical flue gas temperatures under wet conditions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref>). There was neither deactivation nor degradation in performance in DDR@CHA_10d at each temperature for 3 days, which indicates the robustness of the membrane. In addition, the effect of relative humidity on the performance of DDR@CHA_10d was determined (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>B</figref>). Specifically, after measuring for 6 hours at 50&#xb0; C. under dry conditions (i.e., 0% relative humidity) with a simulated flue gas composition of CO<sub>2</sub>:N<sub>2</sub>=15:85, separation performance depending on relative humidity (&#x2dc;26%, &#x2dc;60%, &#x2dc;100%) was measured for 12 hours at 50&#xb0; C. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>B</figref>). At each relative humidity, the CO<sub>2 </sub>permeability and CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>separation factor through DDR@CHA_10d were well maintained, which shows that the hydrophobic zeolite membrane has the desirable properties. In addition, the CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance selectivity of DDR@CHA_10d was determined for flue gas under actual wet conditions similar to those of coal-burning thermal power plants having a water vapor pressure of &#x2dc;12 kPa (relative humidity 100%) at 50&#xb0; C. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref>). Initial experiments for up to two days show reliable CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance selectivity and the corresponding CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>separation factor of 17. In addition, an attempt was made to accelerate deactivation by conducting the experiment at an increased temperature of 200&#xb0; C. for 2 days. Nevertheless, the CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance selectivity of DDR@CHA_10d was maintained well for an additional 2 days (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref>), strongly suggesting high long-term stability. In the same way, the permeance selectivity of DDR@CHA_10d was measured at 50&#xb0; C. for a CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>mixture of the same concentration under wet conditions having a water vapor pressure of &#x2dc;12 kPa (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>F</figref>)). This long-term stability experiment clearly demonstrates the robustness of DDR@CHA_10d, which is essential for reliable use in actual separation processes.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0087">Permeance experiments of DDR@CHA_10d were conducted on, in addition to the CO<sub>2</sub>/nitrogen composition at equimolar concentrations, other CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>mixing ratios (CO<sub>2</sub>:N<sub>2</sub>=15:85 and CO<sub>2</sub>:N<sub>2</sub>=5:95) which are similar to those of flue gas emissions from power plants through coal and natural gas combustion (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>). It should be noted that the permeance behavior of CO<sub>2 </sub>and N<sub>2 </sub>molecules under both dry and wet conditions is similar to those observed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>, which indicates a linear response of DDR@CHA_10d to the partial pressure change of CO<sub>2 </sub>and N<sub>2 </sub>molecules. In particular, the highest CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>separation factor at 30&#xb0; C. under dry conditions is 17.0&#xb1;1.0 for the composition of CO<sub>2</sub>:N<sub>2</sub>=15:85 and is 20.0&#xb1;1.3 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>C</figref>) for the composition of CO<sub>2</sub>:N<sub>2</sub>=5:95, compared to 15.2&#xb1;0.4 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>) for the composition of CO<sub>2</sub>:N<sub>2</sub>=50:50 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>A</figref>). As the partial pressure of the CO<sub>2 </sub>molecule decreased, the CO<sub>2 </sub>permeability increased slightly and the maximum CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>separation factor gradually increased. The reason for this is considered that as the slope of the adsorption isotherm increases when the CO<sub>2 </sub>partial pressure is low, the adsorption capacity favoring CO<sub>2 </sub>increases (E. Kim et al., <i>Chem. Eng. J. </i>306, 876-888 (2016); S. Himeno et al., <i>Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. </i>46, 6989-6997 (2007)). Similarly, the CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>separation factor is 13.9&#xb1;1.3 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>B</figref>) for CO<sub>2</sub>:N<sub>2</sub>=15:85, and is 16.5&#xb1;3.1 for CO<sub>2</sub>:N<sub>2</sub>=5:95&#xb1;3.1 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>D</figref>) at 50&#xb0; C. under wet conditions, typical flue gas conditions.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> shows the molar flux and the permeance of CO<sub>2 </sub>and N<sub>2 </sub>molecules in accordance with the molar ratio composition of the CO<sub>2 </sub>molecules in the feed mixture at 30&#xb0; C. along with the corresponding CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>separation factors. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the feed mixture increased, but the molar flux of carbon dioxide did not increase greatly. Thus, the corresponding CO<sub>2 </sub>permeability decreased monotonously under dry conditions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>A and <b>19</b>C</figref>). In contrast, the molar flux of N<sub>2 </sub>molecules increases with increasing partial pressure, and N<sub>2 </sub>molecules have nearly constant permeability under dry conditions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>A and <b>19</b>C</figref>). This can be attributed to the high adsorption behavior of CO<sub>2 </sub>at the low pressure mentioned above, whereas the adsorption isotherm of N<sub>2 </sub>always follows a linear behavior up to 1 bar in accordance with Henry's law (E. Kim et al., <i>Chem. Eng. J. </i>306, 876-888 (2016)). The molar flux of CO<sub>2 </sub>molecules under wet conditions is lower than under dry conditions, but increases linearly as the partial pressure increases so that the carbon dioxide molecules have a constant permeability (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>B and <b>19</b>D</figref>). In contrast, the molar flux of N<sub>2 </sub>molecules is nearly constant, the permeability at low compositions of CO<sub>2 </sub>molecules is decreased, and at the same time, the CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>separation factor is increased (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>B and <b>19</b>D</figref>). Although CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>separation factors are various at various concentrations of carbon dioxide molecules, the use of hydrophobic DDR@CHA membranes can provide high CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>separation factors (equal to or greater than 10) at a saturated steam pressure and at 30&#xb0; C.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Example 3: Determination of Defect Structure of DDR@CHA Membrane</heading><p id="p-0091" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows SEM and FCOM images of the cross-sections and tops of DDR@CHA_6d and DDR@CHA_10d. In particular, DDR@CHA_6d and DDR@CHA_10d showed significant differences in CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance selectivity under dry conditions, so these two membranes were selected for FCOM analysis (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>B and <b>17</b>D</figref>). Fluorescein sodium salts having a size of about 1 nm (J. Choi et al., <i>Science </i>325, 590-593 (2009); S. Hong et al., <i>Chem. Mater. </i>30, 3346-3358 (2018)) cannot penetrate zeolite pores (smaller than about 1 nm), but can intactly access defects in zeolite membranes (E. Kim et al., <i>J. Mater. Chem. A </i>5, 11246-11254 (2017); S. Hong et al., <i>Chem. Mater. </i>30, 3346-3358 (2018); G. Bonilla et al., <i>J. Membr. Sci. </i>182, 103-109 (2001)). Clearly, both DDR@CHA_6d and DDR@CHA_10d have defects that extend to the interface between the DDR@CHA membrane and the &#x3b1;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>disc. Regarding the appearance of these defects, DDR@CHA_6d is remarkable in terms of density and frequency, which means that DDR@CHA_6d is more defective than DDR@CHA_10d. This behavior is more evident in the top FCOM image of DDR@CHA_6d and DDR@CHA_10d of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. In fact, the density of defects is directly related to the CO<sub>2 </sub>selective separation performance shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>17</b></figref>. DDR@CHA_10d has fewer defects than DDR@CHA_6d and thus shows much higher CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>SF under dry conditions (DDR@CHA_10d: &#x2dc;15.2 vs. DDR@CHA_6d: &#x2dc;6.0). For comparison, the FCOM results (DDR@CHA_8d and DDR@CHA_12d) of the different membranes are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b> and <b>22</b></figref> along with the results of DDR@CHA_6d and DDR@CHA_10d. As the secondary growth time increased from 6 days to 12 days, the membrane thickness increased monotonously and reached a saturation state after 10 days, but the degree of defects tended to decrease monotonously, and steadily decreased up to 10 days and eventually did not change. This indicates that the further increased thickness due to the additional intergrowth of DDR grains in the DDR@CHA composite structure is preferable to avoid crack formation after the calcination process.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Example 4: Evaluation of Separation Performance of DDR@CHA 10d</heading><p id="p-0092" num="0090">The CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>and CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>separation performance of DDR@CHA_10d measured at about 50 to 60&#xb0; C. is shown along with other zeolite membranes reported in the literature (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref>). In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows the performance of the zeolite membrane measured under both dry (closed) and wet (open) conditions. DDR@CHA_10d produced through heterogeneous epitaxial growth shows excellent separation performance under both dry and wet conditions. In addition, DDR@CHA_10d exhibits separation performance superior or similar to CHA type zeolite membranes grown as single crystals (CHA: S. Hong et al., <i>Chem. Mater. </i>30, 3346-3358 (2018); S. Hong et al., <i>Chem. Mater. </i>30, 3346-3358 (2018); SSZ-13: N. Kosinov et al., <i>J. Mater. Chem. A </i>2, 13083-13092 (2014); SAPO-34: Y. Chen et al., <i>J. CO</i><sub>2 </sub><i>Util. </i>18, 30-40 (2017); DDR: L. Wang et al., <i>J. Membr. Sci. </i>539, 152-160 (2017); ZSM-58: E. Kim et al., <i>J. Mater. Chem. A </i>5, 11246-11254 (2017); and FAU type: X. H. Gu et al., <i>Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. </i>44, 937-944 (2005)). This shows the reliability of the composite membrane formation method used in the present invention. In dry conditions, DDR@CHA_10d showed similar or better separation performance than CHA and DDR zeolite-type membranes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>). In contrast, FAU-type zeolite (NaY) membranes having high hydrophilicity show slightly higher CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>separation factors under dry conditions, but significantly worsened CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>separation factors under wet conditions. The clear reason for this is that water vapor adsorption is preferred over CO<sub>2 </sub>molecule adsorption. Although the use of highly hydrophilic FAU zeolites as membrane components is a preferred approach under dry conditions, such membranes are not suitable for ensuring high CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance selectivity under wet conditions. More preferably, the hydrophobic DDR@CHA_10d obtained through effectively heterogeneous epitaxial growth shows high performance even in an actual flue gas composition (water vapor pressure thereof is &#x2dc;12 kPa in a composition of CO<sub>2</sub>:N<sub>2</sub>=15:85 at 50&#xb0; C.) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0093" num="0091">In addition, DDR@CHA_10d showed a very high CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>separation factor of 238 (at 50&#xb0; C.) under dry conditions at the actual biogas temperature of 50 to 60&#xb0; C. compared to other zeolite membranes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>). This strongly indicates that the composite DDR@CHA membrane was formed reliably. As observed during the CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>separation, DDR@CHA_10d maintained a high CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>separation factor at 50&#xb0; C. under wet conditions (78 at a water vapor pressure of &#x2dc;3 kPa, and 145, which is higher, at a water vapor pressure of &#x2dc;12 kPa) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> clearly shows that DDR@CHA_10d exhibits CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>separation performance superior to that of other zeolite membranes, and supports the reliability of the method according to the present invention for securing hydrophobicity in the synthesis of membranes. In addition, DDR@CHA_10d shows the best CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>separation at a saturation water vapor pressure (&#x2dc;12 kPa) and at 50&#xb0; C. Nevertheless, the current CO<sub>2 </sub>permeability through DDR@CHA_10d under wet conditions associated with the size of the membrane module should be increased by at least one order of magnitude for practical application. As inferred from the minor change in CO<sub>2 </sub>permeability between DDR@CHA_xd (x=6, 8, 10, 12) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>F</figref>, the final permeability of the DDR@CHA membrane series is greatly influenced and limited by the support resistance. Therefore, the next step towards practical application is to produce a DDR@CHA composite membrane on a support having high permeability.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0092">Overall, the concept of heterogeneous epitaxial growth has proven effective for the continuous production of zeolite membranes having high performance. In particular, this is considered a first alternative and reliable method for obtaining CO<sub>2</sub>-permeance-selective DDR@CHA composite membranes. Unlike conventional methods, the heterogeneous epitaxial growth of the SSZ-13 (CHA-type zeolite) seed layer together with the synthetic solution that induces the synthesis of the DDR-type zeolite is a highly reproducible method capable of forming a composite membrane including a main part of the DDR phase. In particular, the structural similarity between CHA- and DDR-type zeolites is key to the growth of heterogeneous epitaxial growth membranes. Preferably, the composite membrane produced in the present invention showed excellent CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance selectivity for the CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>and CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>binary mixtures. Since the surface of the membrane is highly hydrophobic, the membrane maintained high CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance selectivity even under wet conditions. The performance is the highest among the separation performance of conventional zeolite membranes, showing particularly high performance with regard to mixed gas separation under wet conditions during an actual separation process.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading><p id="p-0095" num="0093">The heterogeneous zeolite membrane according to the present invention has high carbon dioxide/nitrogen and carbon dioxide/methane separation performance under both dry and wet conditions compared to conventional zeolite membranes.
