BEAMS, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates combining multiple laser beams for use, for example, in a lithographic apparatus.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A lithographic apparatus applies a desired pattern onto a substrate such as a wafer of semiconductor material, usually onto a target portion of the substrate. A patterning device, which is alternatively referred to as a mask or a reticle, may be used to generate a circuit pattern to be formed on an individual layer of the wafer. Transfer of the pattern is typically accomplished by imaging onto a layer of radiation-sensitive material (resist) provided on the substrate. In general, a single substrate will contain adjacent target portions that are successively patterned.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Lithographic apparatus include so-called steppers, in which each target portion is irradiated by exposing an entire pattern onto the target portion at one time, and so-called scanners, in which each target portion is irradiated by scanning the pattern through a radiation beam in a given direction (the &#x201c;scanning&#x201d; direction) while synchronously scanning the substrate parallel or anti-parallel to this direction. It is also possible to transfer the pattern from the patterning device to the substrate by imprinting the pattern onto the substrate. Herein, for the sake of simplicity, both steppers and scanners will be referred to simply as scanners.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The light source used to illuminate the pattern and project it onto the substrate can be of any one of a number of configurations. Deep ultraviolet excimer lasers commonly used in lithography systems include the krypton fluoride (KrF) laser at 248 nm wavelength and the argon fluoride (ArF) laser at 193 nm wavelength.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There may be instances where it is desired to use multiple, for example two, laser beams. As an example, it may be desirable to have the capability of changing wavelength between pulses. In another instance, it may be desirable to increase the power and/or repetition rate of the laser system by combining two laser beams so they deliver power simultaneously or on alternating pulses. Here and elsewhere, &#x201c;combining&#x201d; is used to connote causing the beams to propagate in a common direction either collinearly or parallel to one another</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In other words, wafer throughputs can be increased if the need for additional exposure passes can be avoided. It would also be beneficial to be able to increase the amount of power (dose) delivered to the wafer past the limits of what a single laser can provide. This can theoretically be accomplished by using two lasers with overlaid beams feeding the scanner, thus permitting multiple wavelength exposure to be accomplished in a single pass. Combining each KrF laser at a maximum power, higher total power could be achieved.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The following presents a simplified summary of one or more embodiments in order to provide a basic understanding of the embodiments.

The present invention is defined by the claims appended hereto.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The embodiment(s) described, and references in the specification to &#x201c;one embodiment&#x201d;, &#x201c;an embodiment&#x201d;, &#x201c;an example embodiment&#x201d;, etc., indicate that the embodiment(s) described may include a particular feature, structure, or characteristic, but every embodiment may not necessarily include the particular feature, structure, or characteristic. Moreover, such phrases are not necessarily referring to the same embodiment. Further, when a particular feature, structure, or characteristic is described in connection with an embodiment, it is understood that it is within the knowledge of one skilled in the art to effect such feature, structure, or characteristic in connection with other embodiments whether or not explicitly described.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Before describing embodiments in more detail, it is instructive to present an example environment in which embodiments of the present invention may be implemented. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a functional block diagram of a conventional two-chamber laser system <b>10</b>. In this embodiment a laser beam is provided at the input port of a lithography machine <b>12</b> such as a stepper or scanner machine. The main components of the laser system <b>10</b> may be installed below the floor <b>14</b> on which the scanner <b>12</b> is installed as shown. The laser system <b>10</b> includes a beam delivery unit <b>16</b>, which provides an enclosed beam path for delivering the laser beam to the input port of scanner <b>12</b>. The particular light source system illustrated includes a master oscillator <b>18</b> and a power amplifier <b>20</b> and is a type of laser system known as master oscillator power amplifier or MOPA system. The laser system <b>10</b> also includes various components for control of the spectral characteristics of the pulses, shaping the pulses, and so on which are generally indicated as optics <b>22</b> and optics <b>24</b>. The master oscillator <b>18</b> produces a first laser beam which is amplified by two passes through the power amplifier <b>20</b> to produce an output laser beam as indicated by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. A single MOPA configuration as just described is merely an example. It will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the principles elucidated herein are also applicable to laser systems having other configurations such as MOMO, and multiple MOPA configurations.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to an aspect of an embodiment, the need to subject the wafer to multiple passes is avoided by exposing the wafer to two beams. In the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a first resonant charger <b>40</b> supplies electrical energy to a first commutator <b>42</b> and a second commutator <b>44</b>. The first commutator <b>42</b> supplies a pulse to the first compression head <b>46</b>. The second commutator <b>44</b> supplies a pulse to a second compression head <b>48</b>. The first compression head <b>46</b> causes a discharge in the first laser chamber module <b>50</b>. The second compression head <b>48</b> causes a discharge in the second laser chamber module <b>52</b>. Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> are optics for conditioning the laser beams such as a first line narrowing module <b>54</b> and second line narrowing module <b>56</b>, a first optical coupler <b>58</b> and a second optical coupler <b>60</b> and a first stabilization module <b>62</b> and a second stabilization module <b>64</b>. The beams produced by the laser chamber modules are line narrowed to produce a bandwidth much smaller than the natural bandwidth of the gas discharge system. A control circuit <b>70</b> may control the first line narrowing module <b>54</b> and the second line narrowing module <b>56</b> so that the bandwidth and wavelength of the light beams generated by the first laser chamber module <b>50</b> and the second laser chamber module <b>52</b> may be different from one another.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Various triggering arrangements could be employed. For example, one trigger could be used to fire both chambers, with or without a delay between the time of the trigger and the discharge for either or both of the chambers. Alternatively, the triggers may be generated separately, that is, by separate circuitry so that the two chambers would have distinct voltage/energy commands.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Also generally indicated by <b>68</b> are various system components that can be used in common by the first laser chamber module <b>50</b> and the second laser chamber module <b>52</b> such as gas handling systems, control systems, interfaces, power distribution systems, cooling water systems, power for the chamber filters and blowers, and beam path purge systems. Thus, in the arrangement shown, the two laser chambers can share use of these components, and it is unnecessary to have two of each of them.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> also includes a control circuit <b>70</b> capable of operating two lasers with independent energy, controlling relative firing times, bandwidth, and wavelength, and a scanner interface capable of dividing energy/pulse commands between two lasers.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one embodiment the first laser chamber module <b>50</b> may generate laser radiation at a first wavelength while the second laser chamber module <b>52</b> generates laser radiation at a second wavelength different from the first wavelength. Thus, in this case the two chambers cooperate to produce radiation at different wavelengths having different focal planes on the wafer and operating at different depths.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a first metrology unit <b>72</b> arranged to measure parameters, including the wavelength, of the light beam generated by the first laser chamber module <b>50</b>. The arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> also includes a second metrology unit <b>74</b> arranged to measure parameters, including the wavelength, of the light beam generated by the second laser chamber module <b>52</b>. A third metrology unit <b>76</b> is arranged to measure parameters, including the wavelength, of the combined beam, that is, parameters of the combination of the light beam from the first laser chamber module and the light beam from the second chamber module. It will be understood that there may be times when the combined beam is simply the beam from one of the laser chambers if the other chamber is not firing. The metrology units supply the results of their measurements to the control circuit <b>70</b>. The metrology units as shown can measure the wavelength independently of the light from the two laser chamber modules and of the combined beam. The control unit <b>70</b> can use the measurements to control the wavelength of the light beam produced by each laser chamber module.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The firing of the two chambers can be interleaved to achieve an effective doubled repetition rate. The beams from the two lasers can be combined to achieve an effective repetition rate that is twice the repetition rate of either of the two lasers as shown in the bottom timing diagram. As mentioned, any one of a number of arrangements can be used to combine the beam paths of the multiple lasers.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The firing sequences of the two (or more) laser chamber modules can be set to any one of a variety of patterns. For example, the sequences can be set so that the chambers alternate firing shot-by-shot. Alternatively the sequences can be set so that the first laser chamber module fires for a first number of shots and then the second chamber fires for a second number of shots, where the first and second number may or may not be equal. These sequences can be adopted with laser chamber modules generating light of the same wavelength or of different wavelengths. Also, the laser chamber modules generating light at two different wavelengths can be fired at substantially different repetition rates to create a spectrum with different energy content in each of the two wavelength beams. The second discharge rate may, for example, be an integral multiple of the first discharge rate, so that the discharge rates may be, for example, in a ratio of 2:1. The relationship of the first and second discharge rates may also be a ratio of two integers such as 3:2.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">For the foregoing embodiments a timing differential &#x394;t between the firing of the two lasers can essentially be set at any value including zero (assuming the optics can withstand a doubled instantaneous power level) or small enough that the two pulses occur not simultaneously but one immediately after the other (that is, during the same exposure) thus doubling effective dosing. Thus the beams from the two lasers can be generated one immediately after the other as shown to combined to achieve an effective dosing that is twice the dosing of either of the two lasers as shown in the bottom timing diagram.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The beam from the first laser chamber module <b>50</b> and the beam from the second laser chamber module <b>52</b> are combined by a beam combiner <b>66</b>. Another way to combine the two beams, if they have different wavelengths, is to use a dichroic mirror. The dichroic mirror works in such a way that one wavelength (short-pass) gets transmitted and another wavelength gets reflected. This technology, however, works only to combine beams having differing wavelengths.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A technology for combining two laser beams having the same or differing wavelength involves the use of a pick-off mirror. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, a beam <b>100</b> is reflected off of pick-off mirror <b>110</b> to go in a first direction A and a second beam <b>120</b> propagates close to the edge of the pick-off mirror <b>110</b> also in direction A. The direction A is taken as the direction in which the beam(s) propagate for further use. Because of manufacturing limitations in placing the reflective coating <b>130</b> on the face of the mirror <b>110</b> there is a space B (exaggerated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> which is an enlarged version of what is shown in the dashed box in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>) between the edge <b>112</b> of the mirror <b>110</b> and the edge <b>132</b> of the coating <b>130</b>. There is also a spacing C between coating <b>130</b> on top surface <b>114</b> of the mirror and back surface <b>116</b> of the mirror. The coating <b>130</b> is typically applied to within 1 mm from the edge of the mirror <b>110</b>, i.e., distance B, and has a thickness of about 10 mm. The space B and thickness of the mirror <b>110</b>, evidenced by spacing C, contribute to the thickness of a gap G between the two beams <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> having a width on the order of 10 mm. This gap G may cause problems in downstream optics, and it may desirable for some applications from an engineering standpoint to reduce the width of the gap G as much as possible.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">To combine two beams <b>100</b> and <b>120</b> to minimize the gap between them an arrangement such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> may be used. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> a beveled mirror <b>150</b> is cut as shown in the figure to allow beam <b>120</b> to propagate without hitting any mirror surfaces. An adjustable aperture may be positioned and dimensioned to help ensure that beam <b>120</b> propagates without hitting any mirror surfaces. Beam <b>100</b> is reflected off beveled mirror <b>150</b> close to the edge of beveled mirror <b>160</b>. The resulting combined beam profile has a reduced gap compared to the gap G, for example, on the order of about 1 mm. The beam <b>100</b> and the beam <b>120</b> are caused to propagate parallel to one another in the direction A, adjacent to one another and one translated with respect to the other in a direction transverse to the direction A.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Another arrangement for combining two beams <b>100</b> and <b>120</b> to minimize the gap between them is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>. As shown in in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> a reflective coating <b>130</b> is applied on a portion, for example, a portion of a mirror <b>180</b> (independent of the mirror shape). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, laser beam <b>100</b> is reflected off of the reflective coating <b>130</b> while laser beam <b>120</b> propagates through the portion of mirror <b>180</b> having no coating. The two beams can be combined with a gap having a width that can be reduced essentially to zero.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Another arrangement for combining two beams <b>100</b> and <b>120</b> to minimize the gap between them is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref>, such arrangement especially useful in systems in which beams <b>100</b> and <b>120</b> are not fired simultaneously, but rather in alternate pulses. Solid lines are active beams and dashed lines show the position of the mirrors and beams when they are in the other position The beams propagate in such a way that an angle between them is &#x3b8;. The beams <b>100</b> and <b>120</b> strike a mirror <b>200</b> in a first position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> in which the beam <b>100</b> propagates in a direction A, that is, the direction of use while the second beam <b>120</b> propagates in a direction B. Then as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> mirror <b>200</b> rotates by an amount &#x3b8;/2 to a second position such that the beam <b>120</b> propagates in direction A while the beam <b>100</b> propagates in a direction C. The mirror <b>200</b> is rotated, that is, dithered, between the first position and the second position by an actuator <b>210</b> in accordance with a control signal applied by a controller <b>220</b>. If beam <b>100</b> and beam <b>120</b> are fired as alternate pulses with a given repetition rate, and the mirror is dithered at the same repetition rate, then the beams can be propagated collinearly in direction A, essentially combining the two beams. The same effect can be achieved by keeping the mirror <b>200</b> stationary and dithering the propagation direction of one or both of beams <b>100</b> and <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">It is to be appreciated that the Detailed Description section, and not the Summary and Abstract sections, is intended to be used to interpret the claims.
