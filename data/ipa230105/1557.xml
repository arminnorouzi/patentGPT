The above identified patent application is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety to provide continuity of disclosure.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a tool for applying leverage, such as a prybar or similar leverage tool, for example. More specifically, the present invention provides a leverage tool that includes hammer claw anchors that can removably engage a hammer claw or similar structure, such that a hammer or similar tool can provide additional leverage and impart greater force to the leverage tool.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Tools such as pry bars, crowbars, and the like are utilized for various tasks that require a force to be imparted to a work surface or object. One common use for such tools is as a simple lever to impart force to an area. The simple lever may be used for demolition projects, for lifting or otherwise repositioning heavy objects, or for many other tasks. To apply leverage, the working end of the pry bar, crow bar, or other leverage tool acts as a fulcrum, while the elongated portion of the leverage tool acts as a lever arm as the user applies force to the handle end of the leverage tool. The lever action allows a greater force to be imparted than what a person could accomplish without the use of such a tool.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">While leverage tools are useful for applying force to an object or area, they are not without their drawbacks, and require improvement. For example, there are scenarios where a user along is not able to apply enough force alone, even with the additional leverage provided by the pry bar or other leverage tool, to accomplish a particular task. For example, very hard-stuck fasteners or materials that must be removed may require a greater amount of force be imparted for their removal. An individual may not be able to impart this force with their strength and body weight alone, and may need additional help to apply greater force, which is not always available. In order to address these concerns, the present invention provides a leverage tool that includes a hammer claw anchor, which allows a hammer claw or similar item to grasp the leverage tool. The hammer can then be utilized as a second lever arm that acts on the first lever arm of the leverage tool, allowing a single user to impart a greater amount of force to complete their task.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In light of the devices disclosed in the known art, it is submitted that the present invention substantially diverges in design elements from the known art and consequently it is clear that there is a need in the art for an improvement to existing leverage tools such as prybars and crowbars, particularly due to the common need to impart additional force to the tool. In this regard the present invention substantially fulfills these needs.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of leverage tools now present in the prior art, the present invention provides a tool with a hammer claw anchor, wherein the same can be utilized to provide an optional second lever arm for imparting greater force to the tool as needed.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In general, the tool includes a body having a first end and a second end. A first tool head is disposed on the first end of the body. A second tool head may be disposed on the second end of the body. At least one anchor is affixed to the body. The anchor is adapted to engage a slot of a hammer claw, such that the hammer can be utilized to impart greater forces by acting as a second lever arm. There may be a pair of anchors to provide additional attachment points, allowing additional leverage to be applied no matter the current angle or positioning of the tool. In some embodiments, the tool includes a first tool head having a first pair of jaws disposed on the first end of the body and a second tool head having a second pair of jaws disposed on the second end of the body. A first pair of anchors is affixed to the first end of the body and a second pair of anchors is affixed to the second end of the body. The first pair of anchors are positioned on a first pair of opposing sides of the body and the second pair of anchors are positioned on a second a pair of opposing sides of the body, such that the first pair of anchors align with the first pair of jaws, and such that the second pair of anchors align with the second pair of jaws. This particular orientation ensures that leverage can be applied effectively no matter which end of the tool is being used as the active working end or first lever arm.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent given the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Although the characteristic features of this invention will be particularly pointed out in the claims, the invention itself and manner in which it may be made and used may be better understood after a review of the following description, taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a perspective view of a first embodiment of the tool with hammer claw anchor.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a perspective view of a first embodiment of the tool with hammer claw anchor in use.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a perspective view of a first embodiment of the tool with hammer claw anchor in use.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a perspective view of a second embodiment of the tool with hammer claw anchor.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a perspective view of a third embodiment of the tool with hammer claw anchor.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a perspective view of a third embodiment of the tool with hammer claw anchor in use.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a perspective view of a third embodiment of the tool with hammer claw anchor in use.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Reference is made herein to the attached figures. For the purposes of presenting a brief and clear description of the present invention, the preferred embodiment will be discussed as used for providing a tool with a hammer claw anchor that can be utilized as an attachment point for imparting additional leverage to the tool with a hammer or the like. The figures are intended for representative purposes only and should not be considered to be limiting in any respect.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, there is shown a perspective view of a first embodiment of the tool with hammer claw anchor. In general, the tool includes a body <b>11</b> having a first end and a second end. The first end comprises a first tool head <b>12</b>, such that the tool includes at least one working end. In the shown embodiment, the first tool head <b>12</b> includes a pair of spaced jaws <b>14</b> defining a central opening therebetween. In the shown embodiment, the tool further includes a second tool head <b>13</b> having a second pair of jaws <b>15</b> disposed on the second end of the body <b>11</b>, which differs in structure and positioning from the first tool head <b>12</b> in order to provide additional uses for the tool. For example, the first tool head <b>12</b> extends in-line with the body <b>11</b>, while the second tool head <b>13</b> extends perpendicularly outwardly from the opposing second end of the body <b>11</b>. This imparts additional utility to the tool and allows the tool to be used at various angles and for various purposes. In other embodiments, the tool heads <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> can have different shapes and configurations, and the overall shape and structure of the body portion can vary.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">At least one anchor <b>19</b> is affixed to the body. Each anchor <b>19</b> is adapted to engage a slot of a hammer claw. In the shown embodiment, a first pair of anchors <b>19</b> are affixed to the first end of the body <b>11</b>, and a second pair of anchors <b>19</b> are affixed to the second end of the body <b>11</b>. The first pair of anchors <b>19</b> are positioned on a first pair of opposing sides <b>16</b> of the body <b>11</b> and the second pair of anchors <b>19</b> are positioned on a second a pair of opposing sides <b>17</b> of the body <b>11</b>, such that the first pair of anchors <b>19</b> align with the first pair of jaws <b>14</b>, and such that the second pair of anchors <b>19</b> align with the second pair of jaws <b>15</b>. In this way, two pairs of anchors <b>19</b> are formed, with one pair of anchors <b>19</b> oriented perpendicularly to the other pair of anchors <b>19</b>. In this way, the user has many mounting points to apply leverage as needed and increase force in a particular direction.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, there are shown perspective views of a first embodiment of the tool with hammer claw anchor in use. The tool <b>11</b> is being utilized with additional leverage being applied by a hammer <b>30</b>, which has a hammer claw <b>32</b> on the rear portion of the hammer head <b>31</b>. In the shown embodiment, each anchor <b>19</b> includes a tab affixed to an outer end of a post <b>20</b>, such that the tab provides an engagement surface which contacts the hammer claw <b>32</b>, similar to when a hammer claw <b>32</b> is utilized to pull out a nail fastener. The tab <b>19</b> is shown to be rounded or circular, but the tab <b>19</b> may include any suitable shape.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">While a hammer claw <b>32</b> is utilized here, other similar tools that can engage the post and tab elements of the anchor <b>19</b> can be utilized. In operation, the user can use whichever end of the tool is suitable for a current task that requires an application of leverage to increase the force the user can impart on a workpiece. Depending on the orientation of the tool head that is being use, one of the anchors <b>19</b> should be facing in a desired direction and in an appropriate location along the length of the tool. The operator can select an anchor <b>19</b> to engage with the hammer claw <b>32</b>, which can engage the post <b>20</b> and tab of the anchor <b>19</b> similar to how the hammer claw would engage a hardware nail for removal. This allows the user to essentially select the fulcrum or moment arm for a second lever arm. In this way, the user can selectively use the hammer claw to apply additional leverage as needed. Afterward, the user can simply remove the hammer claw from the anchor <b>19</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, there is shown a perspective view of a second embodiment of the tool with hammer claw anchor. In this embodiment, each anchor <b>19</b> comprises a tab that is integrally formed with the body. The tab is tapered, such that each anchor <b>19</b> comprises a first end with a first height that tapers inwardly to a second end with a second height that is lower than the first height. This configuration provides an ideal engagement surface for a hammer claw or similar object. In the shown embodiment, the anchors <b>19</b> are positioned on the end of the tool body <b>11</b> opposite the second, perpendicular tool head <b>13</b>, which also includes a pair of jaws <b>15</b> for additional utility. This allows the first, parallel tool head <b>12</b> to be utilized as a handle end while applying leverage to the perpendicular second tool head <b>14</b> for prying or similar actions. The hammer claw can then be used with the anchors <b>19</b> at the handle end to provide additional leverage as needed.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, there is shown a perspective view of a third embodiment of the tool with hammer claw anchor. In this embodiment, the anchors <b>19</b> include a rod that has opposing ends affixed to opposing side edges of the body <b>11</b>, forming a loop that receives the hammer claw. The shown embodiment includes a pair of anchors <b>19</b>, with one extending from a first side <b>51</b> of the body <b>11</b> and the other extending from a second side <b>52</b> of the body. This provides additional mounting points for applying leverage with the hammer claw when either tool head <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> is utilized.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, there is shown a perspective view of a third embodiment of the tool with hammer claw anchor in use. In this embodiment, the hammer's <b>30</b> claw <b>32</b> is inserted through the loop defined by the anchor <b>19</b>, such that the rod retains the hammer claw <b>32</b> and contacts the lower side of the hammer claw <b>32</b>. In the shown embodiment, the two tool heads <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> have opposite curvature so either end can be utilized depending on the surface or other operational considerations. The two anchors <b>19</b> are positioned such that leverage can be applied by the hammer claw <b>32</b> no matter which end of the tool is being utilized. In this way, the user has multiple options for applying additional leverage and can select both the first lever arm and second lever arm depending on the task being completed.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">It is therefore submitted that the present invention has been shown and described in what is considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiments.
