In the case of a battery, the energy storage management system is often referred to as a battery management system, or BMS.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The BMS, as well as energy storage management systems for other electrical energy storage devices such as energy storage capacitors, may include a microcontroller. The microcontroller may be powered by the very energy storage device (e.g., battery) it is managing.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To reduce battery power consumption, as well as other reasons, the BMS may have a standby mode of operation, such as which may be actuated during shipment of the battery. The standby mode may be actuated through use of a status switch, such as a push-button switch, which may be mounted on the case of the battery. While the standby mode may reduce the overall power consumption of the BMS, some power may still be consumed by the microcontroller, because the microcontroller may be required to remain active to monitor the status switch.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention is provided to address this and other problems.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an object of the present invention to reduce the standby power to a minimum value, which may extend the shelf life of a battery when being shipped, stored, or otherwise placed in standby for future use.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with the present invention, a circuit is provided which can disconnect power from the BMS, while continuing to monitor the state of the status switch or for a connection of a charger to power terminals of the battery.

The bistable latch <b>42</b> may have two states, which may be controlled by the status switch <b>32</b>, the BMS <b>24</b>, and the charger detect circuit <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the first state, power may be supplied to the power supply circuit <b>26</b> of the BMS <b>24</b>, though the power switch circuit <b>46</b> (i.e., Q<b>3</b>). In this state, the power switch circuit <b>46</b> is turned on, providing power to the power supply circuit <b>26</b>, and thereby turning on the controller <b>25</b>.
