The AP usually connects to a router (directly or indirectly via a wired network) as a standalone device, but it can also be an integral component of the router itself. Several APs may also work in coordination, either through direct wired or wireless connections, or through a central system, commonly called a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) controller. An AP is differentiated from a hotspot, which is the physical location where Wi-Fi access to a WLAN is available.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Prior to wireless networks, setting up a computer network in a business, home, or school often required running many cables through walls and ceilings in order to deliver network access to all of the network-enabled devices in the building. With the creation of the wireless AP, network users are able to add devices that access the network with few or no cables. An AP connects to a wired network, then provides radio frequency links for other radio devices to reach that wired network. Most APs support the connection of multiple wireless devices. APs are built to support a standard for sending and receiving data using these radio frequencies.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this disclosure, illustrate various embodiments of the present disclosure.

Furthermore, features and/or variations may be provided in addition to those described. For example, embodiments of the disclosure may be directed to various feature combinations and sub-combinations described in the example embodiments.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers are used in the drawings and the following description to refer to the same or similar elements. While embodiments of the disclosure may be described, modifications, adaptations, and other implementations are possible. For example, substitutions, additions, or modifications may be made to the elements illustrated in the drawings, and the methods described herein may be modified by substituting, reordering, or adding stages to the disclosed methods. Accordingly, the following detailed description does not limit the disclosure. Instead, the proper scope of the disclosure is defined by the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A collection of features was developed in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11ax specification targeted specifically for the 6 GHz Wi-Fi band. Among these features is the optional transmission of complete, unsolicited, broadcast probe responses every 20 Time Units (TUs) or less by a 6 GHz Access Point (AP). This feature may eliminate the need by client devices to probe APs in order to find out the operating parameters of Basic Service Sets (BSSs). By residing on an APs primary channel for, for example, 20TUs, a client device may be expected to receive a probe response and thus may not be required to send a probe request.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">While this process may be effective in reducing air time used by client device probe requests, a probe response carrying complete information about an AP (e.g., including all its Virtual APs (VAPs)) may take a significant amount of time. Consequently, there may be a trade-off made network-wide if the aforementioned feature is to be switched on or off. Additionally, the implementer the aforementioned feature may be left with several possible probe response modes, some of which may contradict one another, with no tool to choose the most effective mode. Embodiments of the disclosure may provide processes, for example, for an automated selection of a most efficient unsolicited probe response mode, based on client device and cell conditions.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Due to the existence of a large number of channels in the 6 GHz band, the IEEE 802.11ax specification may have provided processes for client devices to discover a 6 GHz AP by only scanning in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. Accordingly, any AP that carries both 6 GHz and 2.4/5 GHz radios may advertise the existence of the 6 GHz AP in alternate bands (i.e., 2.4/5 GHz). Once a client device receives information about the existence of a Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID) in 6 GHz, the client device may then probe the BSSID in 6 GHz to receive the complete BSS operation information.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The reporting of co-located 6 GHz radios by 2.4/5 radios may reduce the wildcard broadcast probing in 6 GHz in search of nearby APs, and may help maintain cleaner and better-managed channels. 6 GHz probing may not disappear completely. For example, a client device that has discovered an AP, but may need to receive complete BSS operation information may still probe the 6 GHz AP directly. In order to address this unicast probing behavior, the IEEE 802.11ax specification may offer the option for an AP operating in 6 GHz to send broadcast Unsolicited Probe Responses (UPRs) at, for example, 20 Time Unit (TU) intervals. For example, a TU may be equal to 1,024 microseconds. With this scheme, a client device may wait on channel for 20 TUs and receive the desired probe response automatically without having sent a request. When the 20 TU transmission of UPR is enabled on all APs operating in a channel in a vicinity, then the co-located 2.4/5 GHz APs may signal the activation of the UPR transmission in their neighbor reports. As a result, a client device that receives information about the 6 GHz BSSIDs may know not to send probe requests when scanning the 6 GHz channels that have UPR activated on all APs. A transmitting AP may send the UPRs individually in Physical Layer Protocol Data Units (PPDUs), or it may combine to send them in High Efficiency (HE) Down Link (DL) Multi-User (MU) frames by assigning them to a broadcast Resource Unit (RU).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The UPR mode may be useful, but may also waste airtime when activated in a network with few entering client devices. In a deployment where efficiency is primary, the UPR mode may defeat its own purpose. When sending a probe request on a channel as part of a scanning operation, a client device may be expected to set a &#x201c;minimum channel time&#x201d; field. This field may indicate how long a client device may remain on a channel where it sent the probe request before potentially jumping to scan another channel. While the IEEE 802.11ax specification may provide no limits for minimum channel time, typical values used by vendors may range between 5 TUs to 20 TUs. The minimum channel time field may inform the AP of the amount of time it has to send a probe response, or to potentially satisfy the request with the next scheduled beacon.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an operating environment <b>100</b> for providing automated activation of unsolicited probe responses.

Coverage environment <b>110</b> may comprise, but is not limited to, a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) comprising a plurality of Access Points (APs) that may provide wireless network access (e.g., access to the WLAN for client devices). The plurality of APs may comprise a first AP <b>115</b>, a second AP <b>120</b>, a third AP <b>125</b>, a fourth AP <b>130</b>, and a fifth AP <b>135</b>.

As such, the 6 GHz radios may be complaint with the IEEE 802.11ax specification and may offer the option for sending broadcast UPRs.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Controller <b>105</b> may comprise a Wireless Local Area Network controller (WLC) and may provision and control coverage environment <b>110</b> (e.g., a WLAN). Controller <b>105</b> may allow first client device <b>140</b>, second client device <b>145</b>, and third client device <b>150</b> to join coverage environment <b>110</b>. In some embodiments of the disclosure, controller <b>105</b> may be implemented by a Digital Network Architecture Center (DNAC) controller (i.e., a Software-Defined Network (SDN) controller) that may configure information for coverage environment <b>110</b> in order to provide automated activation of unsolicited probe responses.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The elements described above of operating environment <b>100</b> (e.g., controller <b>105</b>, first AP <b>115</b>, second AP <b>120</b>, third AP <b>125</b>, fourth AP <b>130</b>, fifth AP <b>135</b>, first client device <b>140</b>, second client device <b>145</b>, or third client device <b>150</b>) may be practiced in hardware and/or in software (including firmware, resident software, micro-code, etc.) or in any other circuits or systems. The elements of operating environment <b>100</b> may be practiced in electrical circuits comprising discrete electronic elements, packaged or integrated electronic chips containing logic gates, a circuit utilizing a microprocessor, or on a single chip containing electronic elements or microprocessors. Furthermore, the elements of operating environment <b>100</b> may also be practiced using other technologies capable of performing logical operations such as, for example, AND, OR, and NOT, including but not limited to, mechanical, optical, fluidic, and quantum technologies. As described in greater detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the elements of operating environment <b>100</b> may be practiced in a computing device <b>400</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flow chart setting forth the general stages involved in a method <b>200</b> consistent with embodiments of the disclosure for providing automated activation of unsolicited probe responses. Method <b>200</b> may be implemented using controller <b>105</b> or any one of the plurality of APs as described in more detail above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Ways to implement the stages of method <b>200</b> will be described in greater detail below.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Method <b>200</b> may begin at starting block <b>205</b> and proceed to stage <b>210</b> where controller <b>105</b> may receive probe traffic data. For example, in each 6 GHz Basic Service Set (BSS), the following criteria (i.e., probe traffic data) may be measured or estimated: i) probe request air time (e.g., both intra-BSS and inter-BSS); ii) probe response air time (e.g., both intra-BSS and inter-BSS); and iii) Down Link (DL) Multi-User (MU) Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) frame transmission rate. Other probe traffic data may be used and embodiments of the disclosure are not limited to the aforementioned probe traffic data.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">From stage <b>210</b>, where controller <b>105</b> receives the probe traffic data, method <b>200</b> may advance to stage <b>220</b> where controller <b>105</b> may determine a plurality of probe traffic cost metrics based on the probe traffic data. Each one of the plurality of probe traffic cost metrics may be respectively associated with a plurality of Unsolicited Probe Response (UPR) modes. For example, embodiments of the disclosure may dynamically select a best of three possible UPR modes of UPR transmission in an infra WLAN deployment. The UPR mode may change dynamically as cell (e.g., coverage environment <b>110</b>) conditions change. While three UPR modes may be illustrated, embodiments of the disclosure are not limited to the illustrated three modes and may comprise any number of modes. Notwithstanding, three UPR modes of operation may comprise: UPR disabled, limited UPR, and full UPR as discussed in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">With UPR disabled, no UPRs may be transmitted. If the AP (e.g. first AP <b>115</b>) is 6 GHz only, Fast Initial Link Setup (FILS) discovery frames may be transmitted, but for complete Basic Service Set (BSS) information, client devices may have to probe. Limited UPR may comprise UPR without signaling. For example, one or more APs may choose to send UPRs temporarily in order to address a burst of probe traffic. Because not all on-channel APs regularly send UPRs, this activation may not be signaled by co-located 2.4/5 GHz APs. Client devices may still send probe requests, but their responses may be aggregated to the extent that their minimum channel times allow. The frequency of UPR transmission may be configurable to allow for more aggregation. With full UPR, this mode may be signaled. All APs in a locality operating on a channel activate UPRs and may regularly transit them. The activation of UPRs may be signaled by out-of-band APs.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Probe traffic cost metrics based on the probe traffic data may then be computed for each UPR mode of operation as per-BSS air time. With the UPR disabled mode, for example, the probe traffic cost metric may comprise the sum of probe request times and response times (e.g., inter and intra) over all co-channel BSS's in a locality (e.g., coverage environment <b>110</b>). In limited UPR mode, for example, the probe traffic cost metric may comprise the sum of probe request and response times, counting one response for all requests whose min channel time meets the next UPR transmission at configured interval. In full UPR mode, for example, the probe traffic cost metric may comprise the probe response time per a predetermined number of TUs (e.g., 20 TUs) counted once for each transmitting AP. With respect to the limited UPR mode and the full UPR mode, because UPRs may be sent in broadcast RUs of DL MU frames, the air time considered may be reduced when the DL MU OFDMA frame transmission rate is high enough such that UPRs may be expected to be aggregated. With aggregation, an estimation made be made of how much the DL MU bundling of the UPR has added to channel air time of the DL MU frame for example.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Once controller <b>105</b> determines the plurality of probe traffic cost metrics based on the probe traffic data in stage <b>220</b>, method <b>200</b> may continue to stage <b>230</b> where controller <b>105</b> may operate an AP (e.g., first AP <b>115</b>) in a one of the plurality of UPR modes that has a respective probe traffic cost metric that indicates a lowest probe traffic cost of the plurality of probe traffic cost metrics. For example, the plurality of APs as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may start operating in UPR disabled mode while performing the probe traffic measurements. When probe traffic passes a minimum threshold, the probe traffic cost metric determinations (e.g., calculations) as described above may be performed. For limited UPR mode, the probe traffic cost metric may be calculated for a number of candidate intervals in a limited range, such as 5 TUs to 20 TUs for example. When probe traffic is limited, the probe traffic cost metrics may point to continuing in the UPR disabled mode. When probe traffic is higher, but isolated and with a high response-to-request ratio, the probe traffic cost metrics may point to the limited UPR mode. When probe traffic is higher and not isolated, or with a high request-to-response ratio, the probe traffic cost metrics may point to the full UPR mode.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Consistent with embodiments of the disclosure, when deciding between limited UPR mode and full UPR mode, bursty probe traffic may be addressed separately from a consistently high probing scenario (e.g., attendees entering a conference room versus an airport gate area). As such, embodiments of the disclosure may switch to the full UPR mode if probe traffic cost metrics point to this option for more than a predetermined number of consecutive measurement intervals. With the full UPR mode, the probe traffic that would have been present in absence of UPRs may not be predicted. Accordingly, embodiments of the disclosure may revert to the limited UPR mode after a period of time to re-evaluate the probe traffic cost metrics.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Predictive activation may be used with embodiments of the disclosure. For example, predictive activation of the limited UPR mode or full UPR mode may be performed based on multiple factors. One factor may comprise a burst of probe traffic in one or more co-located radios in alternate bands from clients that are 6 GHz capable. Other factors may comprise a burst of probe traffic in an adjacent set of APs (e.g., passengers exiting a train) hard-coded timing based on prior knowledge (e.g., match end time in a stadium, train or subway schedules, configured or learned, for example, one wave each 90 minutes between 6:00 AM and 8:30 AM). Yet other factors may comprise a percentage increase in new 6 GHz capable stations being monitored by a central entity (i.e., such as master AP in coverage environment <b>110</b> or controller <b>105</b>). For example, if the central entity detects the presence of a significant increase in new registered users, it may propagate UPR enablement on the collocated access points.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an example use case that may be consistent with embodiments of the disclosure showing probe traffic air time as a percentage of air time for each of the aforementioned UPR modes. The gains from this scheme may vary depending on scenarios, device implementation, and deployment factors. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a computation of airtime consumption for each UPR modes from a sample density scenario (e.g., airport gate area, stadium walkways, etc.) and based on device probing behaviors observed in some commonly available consumer devices:</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Number of channels: 20</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Scan dwell per channel: 20 msec</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Probe requests per scan dwell: 2</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Scan cycles: 5</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Scan interval: 20 seconds</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Probe request duration (&#x2212;6 mbps): 200 microsec</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Probe response duration (&#x2212;6 mbps): 400 microsec</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Number of VAPs per radio: 2</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Probe Request Channel Wait Time: 10 msec</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Air time consumption may grow linearly with the number of clients in UPR disabled mode, while in full UPR mode, a constant amount of air time may be consumed. In limited UPR mode, the number of probe requests shows the same linear trend, while the number of responses may asymptotically approache a constant due to the ability to limit the number of responses. The results in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> are shown for one BSS.
