In neurons, electrical activity, the restoration of ion gradients across the plasma membrane, as well as synaptic transmission are examples of biological processes that require high levels of energy supply. The brain is therefore strongly dependent on the continuous provision of glucose as neurons do not store glycogen and arc unable to oxidize fats as an alternative fuel source.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Glucose metabolism is initiated in the glycolytic pathway that forms ATP, NADH and either of two end-products pyruvate or lactate. In a second step, pyruvate oxidized in the mitochondrial matrix is required to initiate the synthesis of the large majority of ATP molecules to maintain energy homeostasis. The ability of cells of the central nervous system to generate sufficient amounts of energy is essential for brain function. In the aging brain, glucose metabolism is reduced, which may explain declining cognitive function as we get older. Glucose hypometabolism has also been observed in individuals at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease long before clinical symptoms are detected. Interventions improving brain energy metabolism can be used as an approach to prevent cognitive decline during normal aging or neurological diseases.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition to glucose, neurons are able to oxidize other fuels such as amino acids (mainly glutamate and glutamine), ketone bodies, lactate and pyruvate. During fasting for instance, ketone bodies serve as an important fuel source gradually replacing glucose during the transition from fasting to starvation. Lactate is a particularly important mitochondrial substrate. It is dehydrogenated to pyruvate, which can then be fully oxidized by mitochondria to form CO<sub>2</sub>. Oxidative metabolism of pyruvate is coupled to mitochondrial electron transport and respiration resulting in ATP synthesis. In the central nervous system, lactate also has a signaling function, stimulating for example hypoxia-induced factor 1&#x3b1; and down-stream signaling causing transcriptional changes in brain cells.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The source of lactate can be several fold. When neurons are electrically active, they accelerate their glycolytic pathway to the extent that mitochondria are no longer able to keep up with pyruvate oxidation. Instead, pyruvate is transiently converted to lactate in a process which has been termed aerobic glycolysis. In this situation, the accumulating lactate may exert its signaling role in neurons stabilizing for example hypoxia-induced factor 1&#x3b1; or inducing the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which is important for neuronal survival and long-term memory. A second and even more important source of lactate are astrocytes. This cell type is metabolically closely linked both to neurons and cerebral blood vessel capillaries. A main function of astrocytes is to sense synaptic activity and regulate the uptake as well as transfer of nutrients from the blood stream to neurons. Astrocytes are highly glycolytic. Their metabolism of glucose therefore mainly ends in the formation of lactate with only a fraction of pyruvate entering mitochondria for oxidation. Lactate synthesized by astrocytes is exported and taken up by neighboring neurons via monocarboxylate transporters. Here lactate serves as a fuel for neuronal mitochondria. This metabolic connection has been termed the astrocyte neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A third source of lactate for the brain is the direct uptake from the periphery. During exercise systemic blood concentrations of lactate increase and cross the blood brain barrier to be metabolized by neurons. In this way, peripherally generated lactate contributes to brain energy metabolism. Exercise has been shown to improve memory function. Lactate may be an important metabolite explaining this effect of exercise on learning.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The importance of lactate on learning has been convincingly demonstrated when studying the ANLS. Lowering the expression of specific monocarboxylate transporters impairs the transfer of lactate from astrocytes to neurons and thereby long-term memory formation.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Modulation of lactate levels in the brain therefore has the potential to improve cognitive function. At the same time lactate either as a signaling molecule or as a fuel for mitochondria may influence neurological diseases where chronic or acute energy deficits need to be corrected.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Currently, there is no cure for AD. Only symptomatic treatments exist, and these exert their beneficial effects mainly by restoring lowered neurotransmitter levels. Hypometabolism of glucose is a metabolic alteration likely occurring early during AD progression. Correction of brain metabolism is a promising approach to delay disease progression. Restoration of brain energy homeostasis was also found to restore mild cognitive impairment in the elderly.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Epilepsy is the fourth most common neurological disorder. Up to 30% of children with epilepsy continue to have seizures despite anticonvulsant treatment. Ketogenic diets successfully lower the frequency of seizures in children with intractable epilepsy. However, these diets are very high in fat and therefore highly unpalatable.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In epilepsy, local excessive electrical activity may result in the inability of neurons to cope with their energy load and the rapid provision of mitochondrial fuel may be beneficial. Transient formation of peripheral lactate or enhanced provision through the ANLS could be protective for neurons during recovery from a seizure.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Stroke is the most common cause of handicap and the third most common cause of death in adults worldwide. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is the only Federal Drug Administration-approved treatment for ischemic stroke. The drawback of this treatment is that it can be effective only when administered during a short time window (within 3 hours) after ischemia. Endovascular procedure can be used to remove the clot blocking the artery but only after tPA treatment and within 6 hours of the ischemia. Strict criteria determine the eligibility of a patient for this procedure. Considering that only very limited treatment options exist, there is a need for new stroke treatments.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Targeting brain metabolism may prove useful in stroke for rapid restoration of energy supply as neurons are transiently deprived of oxygen and nutrients. In a preclinical model of stroke (transient middle cerebral artery occlusion), lactate has been successfully tested for its ability to prevent neuronal loss.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Taken together, modulating metabolism to enhance the availability of lactate for neurons may have beneficial effects in mild cognitive impairment during aging or neurological diseases with suspected energy deficits in neurons.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The inventors of the present application have identified unsaturated polyketides and macrocyclic lactones as bioactives that promote lactate secretion from astrocytes. These active compounds affect the astrocyte neuron lactate shuttle or stimulate lactate release from other tissues and may thereby be beneficial for brain energy homeostasis and neuronal health by counteracting the negative effects of impaired metabolism.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Definitions</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As used in this disclosure and the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.

Two hydroxyl groups and two acids were available to form an ester. Because of its downfield chemical shift the hydroxymethine H-3 at &#x3b4;H5.11 was preferred to that at &#x3b4;H4.58 (H-11). The formation of an ester between C-1 and H-3 was unlikely, as it will give a four membered ring. A cyclisation between H-3 and the acid in C-19 was thus proposed, illustrated herein as compound A. A HMBC correlation between H-3 and C-19 was expected but even after the recording of a longer HMBC spectrum with 64 scans (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>G</figref>) no crosspeak was observed.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0107">In an attempt to observe hydroxyl group, the compound was dried and solubilized in 60 uL of DMSO-d<sub>6</sub>.
