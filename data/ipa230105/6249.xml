id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">Ionic cyclic nitroxyl radical oligomers, methods of making the ionic cyclic nitroxyl radical oligomers, and electrochemical cells, such as aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) that use the ionic nitroxyl radical oligomers as catholytes are provided. The oligomers are larger than individual cyclic nitroxyl radical molecules, but maintain a high density nitroxyl radical groups within the molecule. As a result, when the oligomers are used as catholytes in an AORFB, they are able to reduce catholyte permeation through the ion-conducting membrane, while providing a high volumetric capacity and cycling stability.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="99.23mm" wi="155.87mm" file="US20230006250A1-20230105-D00000.TIF"

id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">An increasing number of renewable energy sources are being integrated into the electric grid in the US and around the world. In addition to environmental and health concerns regarding emissions of dirty fuels and the reliability issues surrounding importing fossil fuels, the development of low cost solar and wind power generation has been the main driving force. However, as intermittent wind and solar begin to approach more than a quarter of grid energy production, significant energy storage technology must be employed to mitigate the unbalanced energy production and demand on the grid.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One approach to grid energy storage is the use of redox flow batteries (RFBs), which have decoupled energy and power scaling because the capacity can be enlarged by simply expanding the size of the storage tanks. This decoupling of capacity and power allows for simplified design of long-storage-duration devices by increasing the amount of active energy storage materials without concurrently needing to increase the electrode sizes. Despite this practical advantage, RFBs have only been commercially implemented in a handful of experimental grid applications. This is partially due to the high and volatile cost of active materials in most commercial RFBs. Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries (AORFBs) are a promising approach to utilizing the scalability of liquid-state energy storage while reducing the materials cost by utilizing organic redox molecules. However, developing organic redox active species that are simultaneously aqueous soluble, chemically stable, membrane compatible, and cost effective remains difficult.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Charge-bearing cyclic nitroxyl radical oligomers and methods of making the oligomers are provided.

Thus, the oligomers include cyclic nitroxyl radical dimers, trimers, tetramers, pentamers, hexamers, and higher order oligomers. The oligomers further include a core to which the two or more cyclic nitroxyl radical groups are covalently bonded. The core may by uncharged, positively charged, negatively charged, or may be zwitterionic&#x2014;carrying both positive and negative charges. For oligomers bearing a positive charge, the core includes at least one cationic nitrogen atom. The cationic nitrogen atom may be, for example, the nitrogen of a cationic quaternary ammonium group or a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic cation. In some embodiments of the oligomers, the core is itself a cationic quaternary ammonium group or a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic cation. In other embodiments, the core is a larger organic group that includes one or more cationic quaternary ammonium groups and/or one or more nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic cations.

For some applications, including applications where a low viscosity is desired, it is advantageous to use oligomers having a low charge density per redox active electron. Therefore, some embodiments of the present ionic oligomers, have an average of one or fewer positive charges per nitroxyl radical group, as determined when the nitroxyl radical groups are in a reduced state. This includes ionic oligomers having an average of 0.25 to 0.75 positive charges per nitroxyl radical group, when the nitroxyl radical groups are in a reduced state.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The cationic quaternary ammonium groups may be aliphatic quaternary ammonium groups, cyclic quaternary ammonium groups, or a combination thereof. Aliphatic quaternary ammonium groups include alkyl quaternary ammonium groups, such as dimethyl quaternary ammonium groups. The cyclic quaternary ammonium groups and nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic cations may be monovalent (containing one cationic nitrogen atom) or divalent (containing two cationic nitrogen atoms). Examples of nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic cations include imidazolium groups, pyridinium groups, and bipryridinium groups. Examples of cyclic quaternary ammonium groups include 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1,4-diium groups, aziridinium groups, azetidinium groups, pyrrolidinium groups, piperidinium groups, and morpholinium groups, and further include piperazinium groups, and imidazolidinium groups. The quaternary ammonium groups and nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic cation groups may be substituted or unsubstituted. For example, the carbon atoms of an alkyl chain of an aliphatic quaternary ammonium group or the ring carbons of a cyclic quaternary ammonium group or a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic cation may have hydroxyl substituents or anionic substituents, such as sulfonate, phosphonate, or carboxylate substituents. The anionic substituents may be directly bonded to a ring carbon, or may be bonded via an organic group, such as an alkyl chain.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The heterocyclic rings of the nitroxyl radical groups are non-conjugated and, therefore, have weak intermolecular interactions. The use of non-conjugated cyclic nitroxyl radical groups is advantageous because non-conjugated rings do not promote aggregation, which can lead to an undesirable increase in the viscosity of an electrolyte. In addition, non-conjugated nitroxyl radical groups tend to have good water miscibility when attached to a hydrophilic ionic group. Examples of non-conjugated cyclic nitroxyl radical groups include piperidine radical groups, pyrrolidine radical groups, and imidazolidine radical groups, the structures of which are shown below.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="61.21mm" wi="50.72mm" file="US20230006250A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0069" num="0000">where R<sub>4</sub>, R<sub>5</sub>, R<sub>6</sub>, and R<sub>7 </sub>are independently selected from alkyl groups having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, including alkyl groups having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or where R<sub>4 </sub>and R<sub>5 </sub>together with the ring carbon to which they are attached form a cycloaliphatic ring or a heterocyclic ring, and/or where R<sub>6 </sub>and R<sub>7 </sub>together with the ring carbon to which they are attached form a cycloaliphatic ring or a heterocyclic ring.

As previously discussed, the cationic quaternary ammonium groups may be aliphatic quaternary ammonium groups and/or cyclic quaternary ammonium groups. The nitrogen atom of an aliphatic quaternary ammonium bonding group can be directly bonded to one, two, or three cyclic nitroxyl radical groups. The nitrogen atom of a cyclic quaternary ammonium bonding group can be directly bonded to one or two cyclic nitroxyl radical groups, depending upon the cyclic quaternary ammonium group being used. The cationic nitrogen atom of a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic cation bonding group can be directly bonded to one cyclic nitroxyl radical group.

For non-phenyl ring containing TEMPO dimers, their solubility in pure water ranged from 1.7 M to 2.5 M, corresponding in 3.4 M to 5 M redox active electron concentrations. Each of these saturated dimer solutions measured on average a 1.25 g&#xb7;mL<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>density, resulting in a range of 1 to 20 estimated water molecules per TEMPO dimer (Table 3). This heightened theoretical maximum capacity of dimers ultimately results from increasing the size of the TEMPO core at the 4-position with redox active mass (i.e., other TEMPO cores) without significantly increasing electron averaged mass (M/n). These are in contrast with extended TEMPO monomer strategies that inflate the mass with redox inert functionalization. The resultant high intramolecular coordination environment between water and i-TEMPODs not only delivers maximized theoretical solubility but also extends the voltage window of water, which is especially relevant for catholytes with highly positive formal potential, such as TEMPO. OER is deterred with the WiC strategy as there are limited water molecules in solution and the intramolecular force between the redox molecule salt and the solvating water molecules must be broken, creating kinetic barriers to the oxidation of water at the positive electrode. These WiC phenomena contribute to the concurrently high capacity and high stability RFB cycling of i-TEMPODs.</p><p id="p-0281" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00003" num="00003"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 3</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Experimental solubilities and densities of select</entry></row><row><entry>i-TEMPODs to determine number of coordinated water.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Water</entry><entry/><entry># Coordinated</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>i-TEMPOD-</entry><entry>Solubility</entry><entry>Density</entry><entry>H<sub>2</sub>O per</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>#</entry><entry>(M)</entry><entry>(g/mL)</entry><entry>TEMPOD</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="49pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="70pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>1</entry><entry>2.1</entry><entry>1.23</entry><entry>11</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>2</entry><entry>2.1</entry><entry>1.27</entry><entry>9</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>3</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>1.26</entry><entry>10</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>4</entry><entry>2.5</entry><entry>1.25</entry><entry>3</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>9</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>1.28</entry><entry>6</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>11</entry><entry>1.5</entry><entry>1.21</entry><entry>20</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>17</entry><entry>1.8</entry><entry>1.22</entry><entry>4</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>18</entry><entry>1.7</entry><entry>1.24</entry><entry>13</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>19</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>1.25</entry><entry>1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0282" num="0227">When determining the maximum cycling concentration with the water-miscible i-TEMPODs, the active molecule solubility no longer limits volumetric capacity as the interaction between the dissolved species and the water molecules are very thermodynamically favorable, and each TEMPO dimer is able to dissolve with a minimal amount of coordinated water. Instead, the cycling concentration will be limited by the electrolyte viscosity and its relation to pumping energy cost. The viscosity of representative TEMPO monomer and dimer solutions was experimentally measured at various volumetric capacities in their reduced (uncharged) states. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b>A</figref> compares the viscosity of the i-TEMPODs to previously known TEMPO monomers, which are designated &#x201c;OH&#x201d;, &#x201c;Nine&#x201d;, and &#x201c;TMAP&#x201d;. Descriptions of these monomers can be found in: T. Liu, X. Wei, Z. Nie, V. Sprenkle, W.

These data provide valuable insight into designing water-miscible TEMPO dimers with optimized energy density. The smallest dimer, N+TEMPOD, had nearly equal viscosity at a given volumetric capacity to the state-of-the-art extended monomer, TMAP-TEMPO. It is also worth noting that for all TEMPO species, viscosity is expected to increase upon oxidation (charging) because of the additional positive charge in the oxoammonium form.</p><p id="p-0284" num="0229">The permeability of N+TEMPOD, Eth-N+TEMPOD, N+N+TEMPOD, and Eth-DABLO-TEMPOD through a low ionic-conductivity (AMVN) anion-exchanged membrane was measured, and even the smallest N+TEMPOD displayed compatibility and no detectible crossover with the AMVN membrane. Crossover of the TEMPO species is critical to RFB lifetime as it lowers the catholyte capacity through material loss and the anolyte capacity through chemical/electrochemical side reactions. Additionally, when cycled with the AMVN membrane, none of the four TEMPO dimers demonstrated observable decay. Even at a high concentration of 2 M N+TEMPOD (4 M electron concentration), which corresponds to no capacity decay was shown after over 100 days of cycling.</p><p id="p-0285" num="0230">For AORFBs with kinetically facile redox species, such as TEMPO, the device resistance and power capability are mainly limited by membrane resistance. For example, for the high concentration N+TEMPOD flow battery, the high-frequency resistance was 97% of the DC resistance at 50% state-of-charge (SOC). However, the TEMPO monomers&#x2014;OH-TEMPO, Ne-TEMPO, and TMAP-TEMPO&#x2014;all displayed high permeability through the high-power DSVN membrane (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b>B</figref> and Table 4), and extended TEMPO monomer RFB cycling demonstrations have been with low-power, highly selective AMV/AMVN anion-exchange membranes in literature. In contrast, even the smallest TEMPO dimer, N+TEMPOD, showed minimal crossover with the lower resistance DSVN membrane, enabling high-power, high-energy efficiency RFB devices. To showcase this important but often overlooked metric for evaluating TEMPO performance, a systematic comparison of the RFB power and cycling performances with AMVN and DSVN membranes for the TEMPO monomers and dimers was conducted. The high frequency area specific resistance of DSVN flow cells was 42% that of AMVN at 50% SOC. As a result, the DSVN high concentration N+TEMPOD flow battery displayed an energy efficiency of 87% at 60 mA-cm<sup>2 </sup>while AMVN exhibited an energy efficiency of 68% at identical conditions. This is unprecedented for pH neutral AORFBs. High-concentration N+TEMPOD cycling demonstrated remarkable capacity retention in RFB cycling with DSVN after 24 days of continuous cycling. This confirms high cycling stability, high power, and high volumetric capacity can be simultaneously obtained with the i-TEMPOD WiC design.</p><p id="p-0286" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00004" num="00004"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 4</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Permeabilities of TEMPO species through DSVN and AMVN anion-</entry></row><row><entry>exchange membranes.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry>DSVN</entry><entry>AMVN</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>TEMPO</entry><entry>(cm<sup>2 </sup>&#xb7; s)</entry><entry>(cm<sup>2 </sup>&#xb7; s)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Monomers</entry><entry>OH</entry><entry>6.1E&#x2212;10</entry><entry>1.4E&#x2212;10</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Nme</entry><entry>2.3E&#x2212;10</entry><entry>NA</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>TMAP</entry><entry>9.2E&#x2212;11</entry><entry>1.9E&#x2212;11</entry></row><row><entry>i-</entry><entry>N+</entry><entry>2.5E&#x2212;11</entry><entry>Below 1E&#x2212;13</entry></row><row><entry>TEMPODs</entry><entry>N+ N+</entry><entry>1.4E&#x2212;11</entry><entry>Below 1E&#x2212;13</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Eth-N+</entry><entry>2.1E&#x2212;11</entry><entry>Below 1E&#x2212;13</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Eth-</entry><entry>3.1E&#x2212;11</entry><entry>Below 1E&#x2212;13</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>DABCO</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0287" num="0231">This overall ideal catholyte performance&#x2014;voltage, volumetric capacity, and stability&#x2014;is unprecedented in AORFB systems.</p><p id="p-0288" num="0232">The word &#x201c;illustrative&#x201d; is used herein to mean serving as an example, instance, or illustration.
