One known method for cleaning the nozzle surface involves using a combination of sheet-like wipers such as a nonwoven fabric and a woven fabric.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Patent Document 1 describes a wiper that prevents deterioration of a water-repellent film on a nozzle surface. This wiper includes a first layer that contacts the nozzle surface and a second layer provided on the opposite side of the nozzle surface relative to the first layer. The first layer absorbs and introduces the dispersion medium of liquid droplets present on the nozzle surface to the second layer by the capillary action, and at the same time, captures the dispersoid in the voids of the first layer.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, this wiper wipes the nozzle surface without the dispersoid being sandwiched between the nozzle surface and the wiper, so that deterioration of the water-repellent film on the nozzle surface is prevented.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent Document 2 proposes a maintenance fluid for an inkjet printer, which contains a glycol ether.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">[PTL 1]</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2014-188900</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">[PTL 2]</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Japanese Patent No. 5566741</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The maintenance fluid of Patent Document 2 exhibits a high cleaning performance when being fresh. However, after the maintenance fluid has been left for a while, the wiping performance lowers because the maintenance fluid itself is easy to evaporate. To maintain the wiping performance, it is necessary to supply the fresh maintenance fluid constantly, which results in a large consumption of the maintenance fluid.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">An object of the present invention to provide a wiping method for wiping a nozzle surface of a liquid discharge head using a wiper that is capable of holding a cleaning fluid even after being left for a while and of keeping the initial wiping performance during supply of the cleaning fluid.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The above-described problem can be solved by the following wiping method according to an embodiment of the present invention. The wiping method is for wiping a nozzle surface of a liquid discharge head. The wiping method includes the step of relatively moving the liquid discharge head and a wiper impregnated with a cleaning fluid. The cleaning fluid contains a lactone compound in an amount of 5% by mass or more. The wiper includes a first layer configured to contact the nozzle surface and one or more layers other than the first layer. The first layer has a thickness of t<b>1</b>, the one or more layers other than the first layer have a total thickness of t<b>2</b>, and t<b>1</b> is smaller than t<b>2</b>. The void ratio of the first layer is smaller than the void ratio of at least one of the one or more layers other than the first layer.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the wiping method according to an embodiment of the present invention, the wiper is capable of holding a cleaning fluid even after being left for a while and of keeping the initial wiping performance during supply of the cleaning fluid. This is because the first layer well scrapes off the fixedly-adhered ink while the second layer secures ink absorptivity of the wiper and the cleaning fluid is less easy to evaporate.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The accompanying drawings are intended to depict example embodiments of the present invention and should not be interpreted to limit the scope thereof.

The nonwoven fabric may be comprised of either one type of fiber or multiple types of fibers mixed. Examples of the porous bodies include, but are not limited to, polyurethane, polyolefin, and PVA. In producing nonwoven fabrics, web forming may be performed by wet, dry, spunbond, meltblown, or flash spinning methods, and web bonding may be performed by spunlace, thermal bond, chemical bond, or needle punch methods.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">When the thickness of the first layer is smaller than the total thickness of the layers other than the first layer and the void ratio of the first layer is smaller than that of at least one of the layers other than the first layer, the ability for scraping off fixedly-adhered ink is improved, and wiping property for removing fixedly-adhering ink is improved. Here, the void ratio is calculated by the following formula (1).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mrow>      <mi>VOID</mi>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mtext>   </mtext>      <mi>RATIO</mi>     </mrow>     <mo>=</mo>     <mrow>      <mn>1</mn>      <mo>-</mo>      <mfrac>       <mrow>        <mi>APPARENT</mi>        <mo>&#x2062;</mo>        <mtext>   </mtext>        <mi>DENSITY</mi>       </mrow>       <mrow>        <mi>TRUE</mi>        <mo>&#x2062;</mo>        <mtext>   </mtext>        <mi>DENSITY</mi>       </mrow>      </mfrac>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mi>FORMULA</mi>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mtext>   </mtext>     <mrow>      <mo>(</mo>      <mn>1</mn>      <mo>)</mo>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">In a case in which the wiper comprises a sheet-like nonwoven fabric, the &#x201c;true density&#x201d; represents the true density of the fiber forming the sheet, and the &#x201c;apparent density&#x201d; is calculated by dividing the basis weight of the sheet-like material by the thickness thereof.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">The ability of the wiper for scraping off fixedly-adhered ink becomes higher as the thickness becomes smaller and the void ratio becomes smaller. However, when the thickness is small and the void ratio is small, it becomes difficult for the wiper to hold liquid components such as ink and cleaning fluid, and as a result, the cleaning property becomes insufficient with a single layer. For this reason, the effect of the present invention is exerted when a layer capable of holding liquid components is provided other than the first layer and the layers of the wiper satisfy the above-described relations.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057">The void ratio of the first layer is preferably from 0.60 to 0.85, and more preferably from 0.75 to 0.80. When the void ratio of the first layer is from 0.60 to 0.85, wiping property for removing fixedly-adhered ink is improved, and the wiper is improved in liquid permeability without becoming a film-like shape.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">The void ratio of at least one of the layers other than the first layer is preferably from 0.80 to 0.99. When the void ratio of at least one of the layers other than the first layer is within the above range, liquid absorptivity is improved. As the first layer is combined with such a layer other than the first layer, both the ability for scraping off fixedly-adhered ink and the liquid absorptivity are achieved at the same time, and thus wiping property is improved.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059">The thickness of the wiper is preferably from 0.1 to 3 mm, more preferably from 0.2 to 0.7 mm. When the thickness of the wiper is 0.1 mm or more, the saturated water absorption amount for liquid per unit area of the wiper is sufficient to sufficiently absorb the ink to be wiped off. When the thickness of the wiper is 3 mm or less, the liquid component of the ink is suitably transferred from the first layer to the layers other than the first layer without impairing the liquid absorptivity of the layers other than the first layer, thus making it possible to downsize the apparatus.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">Preferably, at least the first layer of the wiper is comprised of a nonwoven fabric.
