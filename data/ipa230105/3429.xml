Further, as an example of the permanent magnet synchronous motor (referred to also as a DC brushless motor), an open-windings motor configured in such a manner that a plurality of phase windings are placed in a mutually unconnected state is known.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The refrigeration cycle apparatus including the open-windings motor (abbreviated as a motor) further includes a first inserter configured to control application of electric power to one end of each phase winding of the motor, second inverter configured to control application of electric power to the other end of each phase winding of the motor, and switches connected between the other ends of the phase windings and, in the apparatus, a star-connection mode in which the phase windings are connected to each other to form a star connection (referred to also as an star-shaped connection) by closing of the switches, whereby switching of the first inverter is separately carried out, and open-windings mode in which the phase windings are brought into an unconnected state by opening of the switches, whereby switching operations of the first and second inverters are carried out in coordination with each other are selectively set.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the open-windings mode, it is possible to apply approximately twice the voltage at the time of the star-connection mode to each phase winding. In consideration of this point, in the refrigeration cycle apparatus, in the low-rotational-speed range (referred to also as a low-and-middle rotational speed range) in which the rotational speed of the motor is less than a threshold, the switches are closed, whereby the star-connection mode is set and separate switching of the first inverter is controlled in such a manner that the rotational speed of the motor becomes the target rotational speed corresponding to the load. In the high-rotational-speed range in which the rotational speed of the motor is greater than or equal to the threshold, the switches are opened, whereby the open-windings mode is set and coordinated switching of the first and second inserters is controlled in such a manner that the rotational speed of the motor becomes the target rotational speed corresponding to the load. By switching between the star-connection mode and open-windings mode during an operation of the motor without stopping the motor, it is possible to carry out a highly efficient operation within a wide rotational-speed range from the low-rotational-speed range to the high-rotational-speed range.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Switches such as relays or the like used to switch between the star-connection mode and open-windings mode each have a lifetime corresponding to the number of times of operations. This lifetime becomes shorter with an increase in the number of times of switching between the star-connection mode and open-windings mode. Further, when switching between the star-connection mode and open-windings mode is carried out during an operation of the motor, it is also necessary to switch between the separate switching of the first inverter and coordinated switching of the first and second inverters at appropriate timing and, depending on the load variation of the motor or power-source state, there is a possibility of an unstable state occurring at the time of the changeover, and hence it is hopefully desirable that the number of times of switching between the star-connection mode and open-windings mode be smaller.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments described herein aim to provide a refrigeration cycle apparatus capable of reducing the number of times of operations of a switch to the extent possible and, thereby capable of realizing improvement in the lifetime of the switches and carrying out stable motor drive.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram showing the configuration of an air conditioner according to each embodiment.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram showing the configuration of each embodiment.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a view showing variations in the rotational speed at the time of startup of the motor, and mode-selection condition in the normal operation of the motor in a first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flowchart showing control of a motor controller in the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flowchart showing control of a motor controller in a second embodiment.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flowchart showing control of a motor controller in a third embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In general, according to one embodiment, a refrigeration cycle apparatus of claim <b>1</b> comprising: a refrigeration cycle in which compressor, condenser, pressure reducer, and evaporator are connected to each other, whereby a refrigerant is circulated through the refrigeration cycle; a motor which includes a plurality of phase windings in a mutually unconnected state and drives the compressor; a first inverter which controls application of electric power to one ends of the phase windings; a second inverter which controls application of electric power to the other ends of the phase windings; switches connected between the other ends of the phase windings; and a motor controller which selectively sets one of an open-windings mode in which the other ends of the phase windings are placed in an unconnected state by opening of the switches, and switching operations of the first and the second inverters are carried out in coordination with each other, and a star-connection mode in which the other ends of the phase windings are connected to each other by closing of the switches, and thereby switching of the first inverter is carried out.
