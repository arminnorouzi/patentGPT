First, providing one integrated passive device with multiple capacitor capabilities may mean having to provide less separate integrated passive device. This can result in space savings, as a single integrated passive device will take up less space than two separate and discrete integrated passive devices. Second, providing a single integrated passive device may be more cost effective than providing multiple integrated passive devices. Third, putting multiple capacitors in a single integrated passive device allows the capacitors to be closer to each other, and ultimately allows the capacitors to be closer to integrated devices. This will ultimately provide a package with improved power distribution network performance. In some implementations, the use of a single integrated passive device with multiple capacitors coupled to different power may result in about 15%-35% voltage droop improvement.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an integrated passive device <b>300</b> with multiple capacitors.

Likewise, the term &#x201c;aspects&#x201d; does not require that all aspects of the disclosure include the discussed feature, advantage or mode of operation. The term &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; is used herein to refer to the direct or indirect coupling (e.g., mechanical coupling) between two objects. For example, if object A physically touches object B, and object B touches object C, then objects A and C may still be considered coupled to one another&#x2014;even if they do not directly physically touch each other. An object that is coupled to another object may be coupled to at least part of the another object. The term &#x201c;electrically coupled&#x201d; may mean that two objects are directly or indirectly coupled together such that an electrical current (e.g., signal, power, ground) may travel between the two objects. Two objects that are electrically coupled may or may not have an electrical current traveling between the two objects. The use of the terms &#x201c;first&#x201d;, &#x201c;second&#x201d;, &#x201c;third&#x201d; and &#x201c;fourth&#x201d; (and/or anything above fourth) is arbitrary. Any of the components described may be the first component, the second component, the third component or the fourth component. For example, a component that is referred to a second component, may be the first component, the second component, the third component or the fourth component. The term &#x201c;encapsulating&#x201d; means that the object may partially encapsulate or completely encapsulate another object. The terms &#x201c;top&#x201d; and &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; are arbitrary. A component that is located on top may be located over a component that is located on a bottom. A top component may be considered a bottom component, and vice versa. As described in the disclosure, a first component that is located &#x201c;over&#x201d; a second component may mean that the first component is located above or below the second component, depending on how a bottom or top is arbitrarily defined. In another example, a first component may be located over (e.g., above) a first surface of the second component, and a third component may be located over (e.g., below) a second surface of the second component, where the second surface is opposite to the first surface. It is further noted that the term &#x201c;over&#x201d; as used in the present application in the context of one component located over another component, may be used to mean a component that is on another component and/or in another component (e.g., on a surface of a component or embedded in a component). Thus, for example, a first component that is over the second component may mean that (1) the first component is over the second component, but not directly touching the second component, (2) the first component is on (e.g., on a surface of) the second component, and/or (3) the first component is in (e.g., embedded in) the second component. A first component that is located &#x201c;in&#x201d; a second component may be partially located in the second component or completely located in the second component. The term &#x201c;about &#x2018;value X&#x2019;&#x201d;, or &#x201c;approximately value X&#x201d;, as used in the disclosure means within 10 percent of the &#x2018;value X&#x2019;.
