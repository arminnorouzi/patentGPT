Many medical devices come in contact with whole blood or are inserted into the vascular system. When foreign objects are inserted into a vein or artery a thrombus (i.e., a blood clot) can form. Thrombus formation is problematic because sometimes it can create an embolus (a blot clot traveling through the blood stream) which can move to the brain and cause a stroke, to the heart and cause a myocardial infarction (heart attack), or to other organs to cause organ dysfunction. In certain circumstances, chemical agents are injected into the bloodstream, e.g. blood thinners, to prevent coagulation; however, these pharmaceuticals have other potentially undesirable consequences and/or side effects as well.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">According to an aspect, embodiments of the present disclosure relate to a method for affecting thrombi formation on an indwelling catheter.

As will be described below, the illumination system includes a light diffusing element inserted into the intravenous catheter. The light diffusing element is optically coupled to a therapeutic light source that emits light having a wavelength that hinders or promotes the formation of thrombi. By hindering the formation of thrombi, such thrombi are prevented from developing in the first place, which avoids the possibility of emboli formation. By promoting the formation of thrombi, the size of the thrombi can be reduced by completing the clotting reaction quicker, and further, the thrombi can be made stronger, which helps ensure that the thrombi do not break away from the intravenous catheter. Advantageously, the light diffusing element, such as a light diffusing fiber, can be reversibly inserted into the intravenous catheter without modification of the catheter, and the light diffusing element can provide targeted treatment of thrombi. Conventionally, thrombi were treated using pharmaceuticals, such as blood thinner medications, which may have undesired consequences (such as difficulty with wound healing in other parts of the body). Applicant believes that treatment of thrombi with the light diffusing element will avoid such undesired consequences. These and other advantages will be described more fully below in relation to the exemplary embodiments discussed herein and shown in the figures. These embodiments are presented by way of illustration and not by way of limitation.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic depiction of an illumination system <b>100</b> for an intravenous catheter <b>102</b>. The intravenous catheter <b>102</b> is shown schematically within a patient's body <b>103</b> in a blood vessel <b>104</b>. In an embodiment, the intravenous catheter <b>102</b> is an in-dwelling catheter, meaning that the catheter is configured to spend an extended period of time in the blood vessel <b>104</b> (i.e., it is not removed between uses). In this way, the catheter <b>102</b> can be used to deliver treatments to a patient <b>103</b> via the patient's blood stream, or the catheter <b>102</b> can be used to periodically withdraw samples from the patient's body <b>103</b> via the patient's blood stream. In this regard, the intravenous catheter <b>102</b> has a first end <b>102</b>a that is exterior to a patient's body <b>103</b> a second end <b>102</b>b that is interior to the blood vessel <b>104</b> within a patient's body <b>103</b>. The illumination system <b>100</b> is configured such that the possibility of thrombi forming on or in the intravenous catheter <b>102</b> or an emboli breaking free from the intravenous catheter <b>102</b> is reduced.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The illumination system <b>100</b> includes a therapeutic light source <b>106</b> optically coupled to a light diffusing element <b>108</b>. In embodiments, the light diffusing element <b>108</b> is a glass or plastic light-diffusing optical fiber (LDF). In other embodiments, the light diffusing element <b>108</b> may consist of periodically spaced light emitting diodes (LED) along a wire. In embodiments, the therapeutic light source <b>106</b> may comprise any light source structurally configured to emit light, for example, a laser light source, a light emitting diode (LED), a laser diode, an incandescent lamp, an ultraviolet light source, such as an ultraviolet LED, an ultraviolet lamp, or the like. In an embodiment, the light diffusing element <b>108</b> is optically coupled directly to the light source <b>106</b>. In other embodiments, the light diffusing element <b>108</b> is optically coupled to a transmission fiber <b>110</b>, which is coupled to light source <b>106</b>. In embodiments, the transmission fiber <b>110</b> is optically coupled to the light diffusing element <b>108</b> using an optical coupling <b>112</b> (e.g., a mechanical or fusion splice). Further, in embodiments, the illumination system may comprise additional therapeutic light sources, for example, a second therapeutic light source <b>107</b> such that the light diffusing element <b>108</b> may be selectively optically coupled to different light sources <b>106</b>, <b>107</b> outputting different wavelengths of light.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a cross-section of the blood vessel <b>104</b> containing the light diffusing element <b>108</b> within the intravenous catheter <b>102</b>. The blood vessel <b>104</b> has blood <b>114</b> running therethrough. For the purposes of this discussion, the blood <b>114</b> is comprised of red blood cells <b>116</b> and platelets <b>118</b> (in reality, blood <b>114</b> contains other components, such as white blood cells and plasma, which are not specifically depicted). Platelets <b>118</b> initiate the clotting action of blood <b>114</b> by aggregating at a wound site. In particular, the aggregated platelets <b>118</b> form a mesh of cross-linked fibrin protein with the red blood cells <b>116</b>. Generally, this clotting action takes place to stem the flow of blood from a wound in tissue. However, the platelets <b>118</b> may also bind to an indwelling catheter, such as the intravenous catheter <b>102</b>, and form a thrombus <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The intravenous catheter <b>102</b> has an interior surface <b>122</b> and an exterior surface <b>124</b>. The interior surface <b>122</b> defines an internal bore <b>126</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the light diffusing element <b>108</b> is shown disposed within the internal bore <b>126</b>. However, in other embodiments, the light diffusing element <b>108</b> may be embedded in the catheter <b>102</b> in the material between the interior surface <b>122</b> and the exterior surface <b>124</b>. Further, in embodiments, the light diffusing element <b>108</b> or elements <b>108</b> may be attached to the interior surface <b>122</b> and/or exterior surface <b>124</b> of the catheter <b>102</b>. Thrombi <b>120</b> can develop on the interior surface <b>122</b> or exterior surface <b>124</b> of the intravenous catheter <b>102</b>. The formation of thrombi <b>120</b>, especially small thrombi <b>120</b>, is not necessarily, in and of itself, the ultimate concern. Instead, a potentially dangerous condition occurs if a thrombus <b>120</b> forms to a large size and breaks away from the intravenous catheter <b>102</b>, which is referred to as embolus. The embolus can block blood vessels <b>104</b>, leading to stroke, heart attack, or other organ dysfunctions depending on where the embolus lodges.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the present disclosure, the light diffusing element <b>108</b> attached to, embedded in, or inserted into the catheter <b>102</b> emits light of a wavelength that affects (i.e., promotes or hinders) the formation of thrombi <b>120</b>. For example, the light may hinder the formation of thrombi <b>120</b> so that they do not develop at all, or the light may promote the formation of thrombi <b>120</b> so that the thrombi <b>120</b> harden quickly and not break away from the intravenous catheter <b>102</b>. In particular, the light diffusing element <b>108</b> irradiates the interior surface <b>122</b> of the intravenous catheter <b>102</b> to promote or hinder the formation of thrombi <b>120</b> on the interior surface <b>122</b> of the intravenous catheter <b>102</b>. Further, in embodiments, the intravenous catheter <b>102</b> is made from a material that is transparent to the light diffused from the light diffusing element <b>108</b>. Thus, the light diffusing element <b>108</b> may irradiate the exterior surface <b>124</b> with light transmitted through the intravenous catheter <b>102</b> from the interior surface <b>122</b> to the exterior surface <b>124</b>, or vice versa.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As will be discussed below, the emitted light can affect thrombi formation <b>120</b> in a variety of different ways. In operation, the therapeutic light source <b>106</b> may emit light that is diffused by the light diffusing element <b>108</b>. In embodiments, the emitted light has a wavelength between about 200 nm and about 2000 nm, for example between about 200 nm and 400 nm, between about 800 nm and 2000 nm, between about 400 nm and 800 nm, or between about 400 nm and 1310 nm. In embodiments, the particular wavelength of light may be selected to directly affect the reactions leading to the formation of thrombi <b>120</b>. In other embodiments, the therapeutic light source <b>106</b> may emit light configured to be diffused from the light diffusing element <b>108</b> at wavelengths that activates, alters, or otherwise reacts with one or more photo-active pharmaceuticals, i.e., photosensitizers, or that activates, alters, or otherwise reacts with a photo-active coating or coatings.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further, the therapeutic light source <b>106</b> may emit a pulsed light. In embodiments, the pulses correspond to a differences between peak intensity and average intensity of the light emitted from the light diffusing element <b>108</b>. For example, the pulsed light may be pulsed at frequency within a frequency range comprising between about 70 Hz and 80 Hz, between about 145 Hz and 155 Hz, between about 290 Hz and 300 Hz, between about 585 Hz and 595 Hz, between about 1170 Hz and about 1180 Hz, between about 2345 Hz and about 2355 Hz, or between about 4695 Hz and about 4705 Hz. Further, the treatment frequency range may encompass one or more of the Noiger frequencies, for example, 73 Hz, 147 Hz, 294 Hz, 587 Hz, 1174 Hz, 2349 Hz, 4698 Hz, or the like.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a particular embodiment, the light diffusing element <b>108</b> emits ultraviolet (UV) light, such as light having a wavelength of about 200 nm to about 400 nm. Because UV light is a high energy form of light, it has the ability to form and break bonds. In embodiments, UV light is used to locally prevent or pre-break bonds between platelets <b>118</b> to prevent formation of large thrombi <b>120</b>. In other embodiments, UV light is used to locally promote and propagate biomolecule polymerization to create a stronger thrombi <b>120</b> that would be less likely to break down over time, thus reducing the risk of an embolism (the occlusion of a blood vessel <b>104</b> by an embolus).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In another particular embodiment, the light diffusing element <b>108</b> is configured to emit infrared (IR) light, such as light having a wavelength of about 800 nm to about 2000 nm, which has been shown to have wound healing capabilities. Thus, in embodiments, the wound healing capabilities decrease the thrombus <b>120</b> formation by speeding up the healing process, which reduces the size of the thrombus <b>120</b> developed. Additionally, in embodiments, the IR light is used to strengthen the thrombus <b>120</b> bond formation and prevent emboli migration and embolism formation.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In still another particular embodiment, the light diffusing element <b>108</b> is configured for photodynamic therapy (PDT). In PDT, a light-activated biomolecule, or photosensitizer, is injected, ingested, or applied to a region of interest and illuminated with a certain wavelength of light. For example, Photofrin&#x2122; is a photosensitizer that may be activated by emitted light having wavelengths between about 600 nm and about 680 nm, or wavelengths near UV wavelengths, such as between about 370 nm and about 420 nm. Other photosensitizers usable with the light diffusing element <b>108</b> include 5-aminolaevulinic acid, verteporfin, tin ethyl etiopurpurin (Purlytin&#xae;), temoporfin (Foscan&#xae;), lutetium texaphyrin (Lutex&#xae;), ATMPn (9-acetoxy-2,7,12,17-tetrakis-(&#x3b2;-methoxyethyl)-porphycene), zinc phthalocyanine, and napthalocyanines, among others. The photosensitizer photo-reacts to the light from the light diffusing element <b>108</b> and releases a highly reactive form of oxygen which kills/damages the nearest cell, tissue, or structure. In embodiments, PDT is used to prevent the formation of thrombi <b>120</b> by breaking early-formed bonds and potentially destroying molecules or cells which create platelets <b>118</b>. In embodiments, PDT is performed with light having a wavelength of from about 350 nm to about 800 nm.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In yet another particular embodiment, the light diffusing element <b>108</b> is configured for photobiomodulation (PBM), also known as low level laser therapy (LLLT). While the specific mechanism of PBM is not fully understood, low levels of laser light (e.g., having an intensity of 5 to 500 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) have been demonstrated to have positive effects on a wide variety of biological functions, including wound healing, joint health, lung health, and brain health. By delivering the low levels of laser light locally, thrombi <b>120</b> and emboli can be prevented from forming. In embodiments, PBM is performed using light having a wavelength of from about 400 nm to about 1310 nm.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In still yet another particular embodiment, the light diffusing element <b>108</b> can be configured to activate a coating <b>128</b> containing a photo-active substance on the interior surface <b>122</b>, the exterior surface <b>124</b>, or both, or the intravenous catheter <b>102</b> can be impregnated with a photo-activated substance. When illuminated, the photo-activated substance can either prevent thrombi <b>120</b> formation or strengthen the bonds of the thrombi <b>120</b> to keep them from breaking away. In an embodiment, the photo-activates substance is a luminescent material. In embodiments, the luminescent material is fluorescent or phosphorescent. For example, upon being contacted by light having a first wavelength from the light diffusing element <b>108</b>, the luminescent photo-active substance can emit light having a second wavelength. More particularly, in embodiments, the second wavelength can be UV or IR to provide the effects described above, and in other embodiments, the second wavelength can be configured for PDT or PBM. In another example, the photo-active substance can make the coating hydrophobic or hydrophilic. In embodiments, the coating is an oxide, e.g., an inorganic oxide, such as ZnO, TiO<sub>2</sub>, or SnO<sub>2</sub>. In other embodiments, the coating is a polymer that includes such functional groups as azobenzene, spiropyran, salicylideneaniline, or derivatives thereof. In general, the surface wettability of the coating is transitioned from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, or vice versa, by exposing the coating to UV light (e.g., in the range of 200 nm to 400 nm) or visible light (e.g., in the range of 400 nm to 800 nm). In this way, the thrombi <b>120</b> are prevented from attaching to the surface of the intravenous catheter <b>102</b> or are strongly held to the surface of the catheter so that emboli do not break free.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts a flow diagram of a method <b>130</b> of preventing or strengthening thrombi <b>120</b>.

In a second step <b>134</b>, light is emitted from the light diffusing element <b>108</b> to affect the formation of thrombi <b>120</b>, either to hinder formation of the thrombi <b>120</b> or to promote the formation of thrombi <b>120</b> (in terms of speed of reaction and/or strength of bonds) to prevent them from breaking away from the intravenous catheter <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Advantageously, the method <b>130</b> and illumination system <b>100</b> can be used to decrease morbidity and mortality of existing medical devices that are commonly used to treat, prevent, or diagnose disease.
