Chinese Patent Application No. 201911274296.5, filed with the China National Intellectual Property Administration on Dec. 12, 2019 and entitled &#x201c;CONTENT OBTAINING METHOD AND SYSTEM, USER TERMINAL, AND CONTENT SERVER&#x201d;, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">This application belongs to the field of terminal technologies, and in particular, relates to a content obtaining method, a content obtaining system, a user terminal, and a content server.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">With continuous development of terminal technologies, a user increasingly obtains content by using a user terminal. To be specific, the user terminal continuously sends content obtaining requests to a content server, and the content server continuously returns corresponding content to the user terminal based on the content obtaining requests sent by the user terminal.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To optimize user experience, a conventional user terminal usually requests a plurality of pieces of content in one content obtaining request, and continues to send a next content obtaining request when there is still undisplayed content. A content obtaining speed can be increased in this manner of requesting a plurality of pieces of content at a. time and requesting content in advance. However, because the content server has not received an exposure event of the undisplayed content when receiving the next content obtaining request, the content server determines that the undisplayed content is not exposed, and re-pushes the undisplayed content. However, when the undisplayed content is re-pushed, the undisplayed content may have been exposed or is about to be exposed, thereby causing repeated exposure of content on the user terminal, and degrading user experience.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of this application provide a content obtaining method, a content obtaining system, a user terminal, and a content server, to resolve a problem of repeated exposure of content during conventional content obtaining.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect, an embodiment of this application provides a content obtaining method, applied to a. user terminal. The content obtaining method includes:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">obtaining user behavior data corresponding to the user terminal and to-be-displayed content on the user terminal;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">determining an exposure probability of the to-be-displayed content based on the user behavior data;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">sending the exposure probability to a content server; and</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">receiving target content fed back by the content server, where the target content is determined based on the exposure probability, and the target content is triggered by the content server after the content server receives a content obtaining request sent by the user terminal.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It should be noted that the to-be-displayed content on the user terminal is content that is returned by the content server to the user terminal in response to a content obtaining request of the user terminal but has not been displayed on a display screen of the user terminal. The user behavior data includes but is not limited to browsing behavior data and operation behavior data. The browsing behavior data includes but is not limited to a browsing time, browsing duration, and other data. The operation behavior data includes but is not limited to data corresponding to a swipe-up scrolling behavior, data corresponding to a swipe-down refreshing behavior, and the like.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a possible implementation of the first aspect, before the determining an exposure probability of the to-be-displayed content based on the user behavior data, the method includes:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">obtaining historical user behavior data corresponding to the user terminal; and</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">determining, based on the historical user behavior data, first browsing duration corresponding to the user terminal in each preset time period.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">It should be understood that the historical user behavior data includes historical browsing behavior data of content browsing performed by a user on the user terminal, and the historical browsing behavior data may include a historical browsing time, historical browsing duration, and the like. Herein, the historical browsing behavior data may be browsing behavior data of the user on the user terminal in the last week, month, or year.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Herein, the preset time period may be determined based on a specific case. For example, based on the historical browsing time, 0:00 to 7:00 may he determined as a first preset time period, 7:00 to 12:00 may be determined as a second preset time period, 12:00 to 18:00 may be determined as a third preset time period, and 18:00 to 24:00 may be determined as a fourth preset time period, The first browsing duration may be determined based on historical browsing duration corresponding to each preset time period. For example, average browsing duration of historical browsing duration corresponding to each preset time period may be determined as first browsing duration corresponding to the preset time period. Alternatively, a weight may be set for historical browsing duration based on an interval between a current moment and a historical browsing time corresponding to each historical browsing behavior, and then weighted summation may be performed on historical browsing duration corresponding to each preset time period to obtain first browsing duration corresponding to the preset time period.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Optionally, the user behavior data includes a current browsing time and second browsing duration, and the determining an exposure probability of the to-be-displayed content based on the user behavior data includes:</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">determining, based on the current browsing time, a target time period to which the user terminal currently belongs, where the target time period is any one of the preset time periods; and</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">determining the exposure probability of the to-be-displayed content based on the second browsing duration and first browsing duration corresponding to the target time period.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Specifically, the determining the exposure probability of the to-be-displayed content based on the second browsing duration and first browsing duration corresponding to the target time period includes:</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">determining, based on the current browsing time and the second browsing duration, an initial browsing time corresponding to the user terminal and a preset browsing time corresponding to the to-be-displayed content; and</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">determining the exposure probability of the to-be-displayed content based on the initial browsing time, the preset browsing time, and the first browsing duration corresponding to the target time period.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">For example, average browsing duration corresponding to content may be determined based on the second browsing duration and a quantity of browsed content corresponding to the second browsing duration. In addition, the preset browsing time corresponding to the to-be-displayed content may be predicted based on a quantity of content existing before the to-be-displayed content, the average browsing duration, and the initial browsing time.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">It should be understood that duration required for displaying, the to-be-displayed content on the user terminal may be calculated based on the preset browsing time and the initial browsing time, and the exposure probability of the to-be-displayed content may be determined based on a magnitude relationship between the required duration and the first browsing duration corresponding to the target time period. If the required duration is more less than the first browsing duration corresponding to the target time period, it is determined that the exposure probability of the to-be-displayed content is higher. If the required duration is more greater than the first preset duration corresponding to the target time period, it is determined that the exposure probability of the to-be-displayed content is lower.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a possible implementation of the first aspect, the user behavior data includes operation behavior data, and the determining an exposure probability of the to-be-displayed content based on the user behavior data includes:</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">determining an operation mode corresponding to the operation behavior data and a display mode corresponding to the to-be-displayed content; and</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">determining the exposure probability of the to-be-displayed content based on the operation mode and the display mode.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">It should he noted that the display mode corresponding to the to-be-displayed content is a mode in which content is displayed on the user terminal, and the display mode may be a swipe-up scrolling mode, a swipe-down refreshing mode, or the like. The swipe-up scrolling mode is a mode in which content on the display screen of the user terminal is refreshed downward through swiping from bottom to top on the screen. To be specific, content returned by the content server to the user terminal may be arranged from top to bottom according to a display order corresponding to the content, that is, content with a higher display order is arranged closer to the top, and content with a lower display order is arranged closer to the bottom. Therefore, when the user swipes up on the display screen of the user terminal, content with a higher display order can be seen by the user earlier. The swipe-down refreshing mode is a mode in which content on the display screen of the user terminal is refreshed upward through swiping from top to bottom on the screen. To be specific, content returned by the content server to the user terminal may be arranged from bottom to top according to a display order corresponding to the content, that is, content with a higher display order is arranged closer to the bottom, and content with a lower display order is arranged closer to the top. Therefore, when the user swipes down on the display screen of the user terminal, content with a higher display order can be seen by the user earlier,</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Optionally, before the receiving target content fed back by the content server, the method includes:</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">obtaining an exposure status of current content on the user terminal, and sending the content obtaining request to the content server based on the exposure status.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to a second aspect, an embodiment of this application provides a content obtaining method, applied to a content server. The content obtaining method includes:</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">obtaining an exposure probability of to-be-displayed content sent by a user terminal;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">determining, based on the exposure probability, target content to be returned to the user terminal, where the target content includes the to-be-displayed content, or the target content does not include the to-be-displayed content; and</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">when a content obtaining request sent by the user terminal is received, returning the target content to the user terminal according to the content obtaining request.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a possible implementation of the second aspect, the determining, based on the exposure probability, target content to be returned to the user terminal includes:</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">if the exposure probability is less than a preset threshold, determining first preset content as the target content to be returned to the user terminal, where the first preset content includes the to-be-displayed content; or</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">if the exposure probability is greater than or equal to the preset threshold, determining second preset content as the target content to be returned to the user terminal, where the second preset content does not include the to-be-displayed content.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">It should be noted that the content server may set a unified preset threshold for different user terminals (that is, different users). To be specific, the content server may determine, based on the unified preset threshold and exposure probabilities sent by different user terminals, whether to-be-displayed content is to be displayed on a display screen of a corresponding user terminal, to increase a preset threshold obtaining speed by using the unified preset threshold, and improve efficiency of determining target content.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">For example, the content server may obtain historical user behavior data collected by each user terminal and an exposure result corresponding to the historical user behavior data, and may perform data analysis on all historical user behavior data and all exposure results to determine the preset threshold.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">It should be understood that the content server may alternatively set different preset thresholds for different user terminals (that is, different users), to improve accuracy of setting a preset threshold through differentiated settings of preset thresholds, and improve accuracy of determining target content. Herein, each specified preset threshold may be stored in a memory of the content server in association with a device identifier of a user terminal corresponding to the preset threshold.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In a possible implementation of the second aspect, the determining, based on the exposure probability, target content to be returned to the user terminal includes:</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">obtaining currently displayed content on the user terminal; and</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">determining, based on the exposure probability and the currently displayed content, the target content to be returned to the user terminal.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Specifically, the target content returned by the content server may be content similar to the currently displayed content on the user terminal or the to-be-displayed content corresponding to the exposure probability, to determine the target content based on viewing interest of the user, and improve user experience. Certainly, the target content returned by the content server may be alternatively most popular content (for example, content with a highest click-through rate or most views) or latest content on the content server.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Optionally, when a plurality of pieces of target content are included, the returning the target content to the user terminal according to the content obtaining request includes:</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">obtaining a display order corresponding to each piece of target content and a current operation mode corresponding to the user terminal;</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">determining a display manner of the target content based on the current operation mode and the display order; and</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">returning each piece of target content to the user terminal based on the display manner and according to the content obtaining request.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">It should be understood that the display order corresponding to each piece of target content may be determined by the content server. For example, the content server may determine, based on an association relationship between target content, the display order corresponding to each target content; or may determine the display order corresponding to each piece of target content based on popularity corresponding to the target content, where a display order corresponding to more popular target content is higher, and a display order corresponding to less popular target content is lower; or may determine the display order corresponding to each piece of target content based on a publishing time corresponding to the target content, where a display order corresponding to target content with a later publishing time is higher, and a display order corresponding to target content with an earlier publishing time is lower.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">According to a third aspect, an embodiment of this application provides a user terminal, including:</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">a behavior data obtaining module, configured to obtain user behavior data corresponding to the user terminal and to-be-displayed content on the user terminal;</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">an exposure probability determining module, configured to determine an exposure probability of the to-be-displayed content based on the user behavior data;</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">an exposure probability sending module, configured to send the exposure probability to a content server;

When the content server receives the second content obtaining request, because no exposure event of the content B has been received, the content server directly determines that the content B is in an unexposed state, and therefore re-pushes the content B, where the exposure event is used to identify whether the content B is in an exposed state or in the unexposed state, and the exposed state is a state in which the content B has been displayed on the display screen of the user terminal. However, when the content B is re-pushed, the content B obtained by the first content obtaining request may have been displayed or is about to be displayed, thereby causing repeated exposure of the content B on the user terminal, and degrading user experience.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In a conventional technology, after returning content according to a content obtaining request sent by a user terminal, a content server may record a content list corresponding to the returned content, and return different content to the user terminal based on the content list when receiving a next content obtaining request, to resolve a problem of repeated exposure of content on the user terminal. However, the content server usually returns a plurality of screens of corresponding content to the user terminal in a fixed mode. For example, the content server returns a plurality of screens of corresponding content in a swipe-up scrolling mode or returns a plurality of screens of corresponding content in a swipe-down refreshing mode. The swipe-up scrolling mode is a mode in which content on a screen is refreshed downward through swiping from bottom to top on the screen.

In this embodiment of this application, an application program APP capable of obtaining content is installed on the mobile phone, and a user may obtain content from a content server corresponding to the APP on the mobile phone by using the APP. Specifically, when the user uses the APP on the mobile phone, the APP on the mobile phone may request content from the content server based on an operation performed by the user in the APP, and the content server may return corresponding content to the APP according to the request, where the returned content may be displayed in the APP. The content may be news, an advertisement, and/or the like. In addition, the content may be content in a form of a picture, content in a form of a video, or content in a form of a text. This is not limited in this embodiment of this application.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">It should be understood that the APP may collect user behavior data of the user in a process of using the APP by the user. The user behavior data includes but is not limited to browsing behavior data and operation behavior data. The browsing behavior data includes but is not limited to a browsing time, browsing duration, and other data. The operation behavior data includes but is not limited to data corresponding to a swipe-up scrolling behavior, data corresponding to a swipe-down refreshing behavior, data corresponding to a tap-to-switch behavior, and the like. In other words, the operation behavior data is behavior data corresponding to an operation performed by the user on a screen of the APP.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">It should be noted that the content obtaining method provided in this embodiment of this application is preferably applicable to a scenario in which the APP has obtained content from the content server and is displaying the content. To be specific, when the user starts the APP on the mobile phone, the APP may send a first content obtaining request to the content server based on an operation performed by the user in the APP (that is, send a content obtaining request to the content server for the first time), and the content server may directly return corresponding first content to the APP according to the first content obtaining request. The first content may include a plurality of screens of content, and the screen corresponds to a display screen of the APP on the mobile phone. When returning the plurality of screens of content, the content server may also determine a display order corresponding to each screen of content.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">For example, when the first content includes an advertisement A and an advertisement B, and the advertisement A needs to be preferentially displayed before the advertisement B, the content server may set the advertisement A on a first screen, and may set the advertisement B on a second screen. When the content server returns the first content to the APP, the APP may preferentially display the first screen (namely, the advertisement A), and then display the second screen (namely, the advertisement B).</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">Herein, when the APP displays the advertisement A, the advertisement B is in an unexposed state. In this case, the advertisement B is to-be-displayed content in the APP on the mobile phone. To be specific, to-be-displayed content on the mobile phone is content that is returned by the content server to the mobile phone in response to a content obtaining request of the APP but has not been displayed in the APP on the mobile phone.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">S<b>602</b>: The user terminal determines an exposure probability of the to-be-displayed. content based on the user behavior data.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">It should be understood that the exposure probability of the to-be-displayed content is a probability of displaying the to-he-displayed content on the display screen of the APP to be viewed by the user. Whether the to-be-displayed content is to be displayed on the display screen of the APP is usually related to a behavior of using the APP by the user. Therefore, the APP may predict, based on the user behavior data of using the APP by the user, the exposure probability of displaying the to-be-displayed content on the display screen of the APP.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">Optionally, the APP may obtain historical user behavior data corresponding to the APP and may determine, based on the historical user behavior data, first browsing duration corresponding to the APP in each preset time period. The historical user behavior data includes historical browsing behavior data of content browsing performed by the user in the APP. The historical browsing behavior data may include a historical browsing time, historical browsing duration, and the like. Herein, the historical browsing behavior data may be browsing behavior data of the user in the APP in the last week, month, or year.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">Herein, the preset time period may be determined based on a specific case. For example, based on the historical browsing time, 0:00 to 7:00 may be determined as a first preset time period, 7:00 to 12:00 may be determined as a second preset time period, 12:00 to 18:00 may be determined as a third preset time period, and 18:00 to 24:00 may be determined as a fourth preset time period. The first browsing duration may be determined based on historical browsing duration corresponding to each preset time period. For example, average browsing duration of historical browsing duration corresponding to each preset time period may be determined as first browsing duration corresponding to the preset time period. Alternatively, a weight may be set for historical browsing duration based on an interval between a current moment and a historical browsing time corresponding to each historical browsing. behavior, and then weighted summation may be performed on historical browsing duration corresponding to each preset time period to obtain first browsing duration corresponding to the preset time period.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">In a possible implementation, the user behavior data obtained by the APP may include a current browsing time and second browsing duration. The current browsing time is a moment at which the user is currently browsing the APP, and the second browsing duration is duration in which the user has been browsing the APP. In this case, the APP may determine, based on the current browsing time, a target time period to which the user terminal currently belongs, where the target time period is any one of the preset time period; and may determine the exposure probability of the to-be-displayed content based on the second browsing duration and first browsing duration corresponding to the target time period.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">Specifically, the APP may determine, based on the current browsing time and the second browsing duration, an initial browsing time corresponding to the user terminal and a preset browsing time corresponding to the to-be-displayed content, and may determine the exposure probability of the to-be-displayed content based on the initial browsing time, the preset browsing time, and the first browsing duration corresponding to the target time period.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">For example, average browsing duration corresponding to content may be determined based on the second browsing duration and a quantity of browsed content corresponding to the second browsing duration. In addition, the preset browsing time corresponding, to the to-be-displayed content may be predicted based on a quantity of content existing before the to-be-displayed content, the average browsing duration, and the initial browsing time.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">For example, duration required for displaying the to-be.-displayed content may be calculated based on the preset browsing time and the initial browsing time, and the exposure probability of the to-be-displayed content may be determined based on a magnitude relationship between the required duration and the first browsing duration corresponding to the target time period. If the required duration is more less than the first browsing duration corresponding to the target time period, it is determined that the exposure probability of the to-be-displayed content is higher. If the required duration is more greater than the first preset duration corresponding to the target tinge period, it is determined that the exposure probability of the to-be-displayed content is lower.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">For example, when the first preset duration corresponding to the target time period is 10 minutes and it is learned through calculation that required duration for to-be-displayed content A is 4 minutes, required duration for to-be-displayed content B is 6 minutes, required duration for to-be-displayed content C is 9 minutes, and required duration for to-be-displayed content D is 12 minutes, the APP may determine that an exposure probability of the to-be-displayed content A is 90%, an exposure probability of the to-be-displayed content B is 80%, an exposure probability of the to-be-displayed content C is 65%, and an exposure probability of the to-be-displayed content D is 40%.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">In another possible implementation, the user behavior data obtained by the APP may include operation behavior data. In this case, the APP may determine an operation mode corresponding to the operation behavior data and a display mode corresponding to the to-be-displayed content, and determine the exposure probability of the to-be-displayed content based on the operation mode and the display mode.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">It should be noted that the display mode corresponding to the to-be-displayed content is a mode in which content is displayed in the APP on the mobile phone, and the display mode may be a swipe-up scrolling mode, a swipe-down refreshing mode, or the like. The swipe-up scrolling mode is a mode in which content on the display screen of the APP is refreshed downward through swiping from bottom to top on the screen. To be specific, content returned by the content server to the APP may be arranged from top to bottom according to a display order corresponding to the content, that is, content with a higher display order is arranged closer to the top, and content with a lower display order is arranged closer to the bottom. Therefore, when the user swipes up on the display screen of the APP, content with a higher display order can be seen by the user earlier. The swipe-down refreshing mode is a mode in which content on the display screen of the APP is refreshed upward through swiping from top to bottom on the screen. To be specific, content returned by the content server to the APP may be arranged from bottom to top according to a display order corresponding to the content, that is, content with a higher display order is arranged closer to the bottom, and content with a lower display order is arranged closer to the top. Therefore, when the user swipes down on the display screen of the APP, content with a higher display order can be seen by the user earlier.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">For example, the display mode may be determined by the APP based on a current operation behavior of the user, that is, may be determined based on a current operation behavior performed by the user in the APP when the APP obtains to-be-displayed content in the APP. The current operation behavior may be an operation behavior performed by the user in the APP when the APP obtains to-be-displayed content in the APP, or may be an operation behavior most recently performed by the user in the APP when the APP obtains to-be-displayed content in the APP. Herein, the current operation behavior may include a behavior of swiping up on the screen and a behavior of swiping down on the screen.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">Specifically, when the APP determines that the current operation behavior is the behavior of swiping up on the screen, the APP may determine that the display mode corresponding to the to-be-displayed content is the swipe-up scrolling mode. Therefore, after obtaining content returned by the content server and a display order corresponding to the content, the APP may arrange the content from top to bottom according to the display order, so that content that needs to be displayed on the display screen of the APP earlier is arranged closer to the top, and content that needs to be displayed on the display screen of the APP later is arranged closer to the bottom.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">Specifically, when the APP determines that the current operation behavior is the behavior of swiping down on the screen, the APP may determine that the display mode corresponding to the to-be-displayed content is the swipe-down refreshing mode. Therefore, after obtaining content returned by the content server and a display order corresponding to the content, the APP may arrange the content from bottom to top according to the display order, so that content that needs to be displayed. on the display screen of the APP earlier is arranged closer to the bottom, and content that needs to be displayed on the display screen of the APP later is arranged closer to the top.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">Optionally, the display mode may he alternatively determined by the content server based on a current operation behavior of the user. To be specific, when obtaining to-be-displayed content in the APP, the APP may also obtain a current operation behavior performed by the user in the APP, and may upload the current operation behavior to the content server; and the content server may arrange content based on the current operation behavior and a display order corresponding to the content, and may send the arranged content to the APP, so that the APP can directly display the content based on the received content without re-arranging the content, thereby increasing a speed of displaying content in the APP, and improving user experience.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">It should be understood that the operation mode may include a swipe-up mode, a swipe-down mode, and the like, Herein, the APP may determine, based on whether a real-time operation mode of the user matches the display mode corresponding to the to-be-displayed content, the exposure probability of displaying the to-be-displayed content on the display screen of the APP.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">For example, when the display mode of the to-he-displayed content is the swipe-up scrolling mode, if the user prefers to operate the APP in the swipe-down mode, it may be determined that the exposure probability of displaying the to-be-displayed content on the display screen of the APP is relatively low. For example, when the display mode of the to-be-displayed content is the swipe-down refreshing mode, if the user prefers to operate the APP in the swipe-up mode, it may be determined that the exposure probability of displaying the to-be-displayed content on the display screen of the APP is relatively low. For example, when the display mode of the to-be-displayed content is the swipe-up scrolling mode, if the user prefers to operate the APP in the swipe-up mode, it may be determined that the exposure probability of displaying the to-be-displayed content on the display screen of the APP is relatively high. For example, when the display mode of the to-be-displayed content is the swipe-down refreshing mode, if the user prefers to operate the APP in the swipe-down mode, it may be determined that the exposure probability of displaying the to-be-displayed content on the display screen of the APP is relatively high.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">For example, when the display mode of the to-he-displayed content is the swipe-up scrolling mode, if the user prefers to operate the APP in the swipe-up mode, or when the display mode of the to-be-displayed content is the swipe-down refreshing mode, if the user prefers to operate the APP in the swipe-down mode, the current browsing time and the second browsing duration corresponding to the APP may be obtained, and the target time period to which the APP currently belongs may be determined based on the current browsing time, to determine the exposure probability of the to-be-displayed content based on the second browsing duration and the first browsing duration corresponding to the target time period.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">S<b>603</b>: The user terminal sends the exposure probability to the content server.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">Herein, after predicting the exposure probability of the to-be-displayed content, the APP on the mobile phone may send the exposure probability to the content server. It should be understood that, when sending the exposure probability to the content server, the APP may also send, to the content server, a content identifier of the to-be-displayed content corresponding to the exposure probability. When there are a plurality of pieces of to-be-displayed content in the APP on the mobile phone, the APP may predict an exposure probability of each piece of to-be-displayed content. Therefore, when the APP on the mobile phone sends each exposure probability to the content server, to enable the content server to learn of to-be-displayed content corresponding to the exposure probability, the APP may also send, to the content server, a content identifier that corresponds to the to-be-displayed content corresponding to the exposure probability. For example, a correspondence between an exposure probability and a content identifier of to-be-displayed content may be sent to the content server; or each exposure probability may be associated with a content identifier of corresponding to-be-displayed content, and then both the exposure probability and the content identifier are sent to the content server.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">It should be understood that the content server usually may be communicatively connected to a plurality of mobile phones through a network. Therefore, when sending the exposure probability to the content server, the APP on the mobile phone may also send a device identifier corresponding to the mobile phone to the content server, so that after determining target content based on the exposure probability, the content server may accurately send the target content to the corresponding mobile phone based on the device identifier.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">The content server determines, based on the exposure probability, target content to be returned to the user terminal, where the target content includes the to-be-displayed content, or the target content does not include the to-be-displayed content.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">It should be understood that, after obtaining an exposure probability of specific to-be-displayed content (for example, the advertisement B), the content server may determine, based on the exposure probability, whether the advertisement B is to be exposed in the APP of the mobile phone, to determine whether to return the advertisement B to the APP again when responding to a next content obtaining request of the APP. To be specific, when determining, based on the exposure probability, that the advertisement B is not to be exposed in the APP, the content server may return the advertisement B to the APP again when responding to a next content obtaining request of the APP, to avoid missing exposure of the advertisement B; or when determining, based on the exposure probability, that the advertisement B is to be exposed in the APP, the content server does not return the advertisement B to the APP again when responding to a next content obtaining request of the APP, to avoid repeated exposure of the advertisement B and improve user experience.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">Herein, the content server may set a preset threshold to determine whether specific to-be-displayed content (for example, the advertisement B) is to be exposed in the APP on the mobile phone. Specifically, if the exposure probability of the advertisement B is less than the preset threshold, it may be considered that the advertisement B is not to be exposed in the APP on the mobile phone. In this case, the content server may determine first preset content as the target content to be returned to the mobile phone, where the first preset content may include the advertisement B. If the exposure probability of the advertisement B is greater than or equal to the preset threshold, it may be considered that the advertisement B is to be exposed in the APP on the mobile phone. In this case, the content server may determine second preset content as target content to be returned to the mobile phone, where the second preset content does not include the advertisement B.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">It should be noted that the content server may set a unified preset threshold for different mobile phones (that is, different users). To he specific, the content server may determine, based on the unified preset threshold and exposure probabilities sent by APPs on different mobile phones, whether to-be-displayed content is to be displayed in an APP on a corresponding mobile phone, to increase a preset threshold obtaining speed by using the unified preset threshold, and improve efficiency of determining target content.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0185">For example, the content server may determine, based on the preset threshold and an exposure probability A of to-be-displayed content (for example, the advertisement B) that is sent by an APP on a mobile phone A, whether the advertisement B is to be exposed in the APP on the mobile phone A; the content server may determine, based on the preset threshold and an exposure probability B of the advertisement B that is sent by an APP on a mobile phone B, whether the advertisement B is to be exposed in the APP on the mobile phone B; and the content server may determine, based on the preset threshold and an exposure probability C of the advertisement B that is sent by an APP on a mobile phone C, whether the advertisement B is to be exposed in the APP on the mobile phone C.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0186">For example, the content server may obtain historical user behavior data collected by an APP on each mobile phone and an exposure result corresponding to the historical user behavior data, and may perform data analysis on all historical user behavior data and all exposure results to determine the preset threshold.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0187">It should be understood that the content server may alternatively set different preset thresholds for different mobile phones (that is, different users), to improve accuracy of setting a. preset threshold through differentiated settings of preset thresholds, and improve accuracy of determining target content. Herein, each specified preset threshold may be stored in a memory of the content server in association with a device identifier of a mobile phone corresponding to the preset threshold.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">For example, the content server may set a preset threshold A for the mobile phone A, set a preset threshold B for the mobile phone B, and set a preset threshold C for the mobile phone C. To be specific, after obtaining the exposure probability A of the advertisement B that is sent by the APP on the mobile phone A, the content server may obtain a device identifier corresponding to the mobile phone A, find, based on the device identifier corresponding to the mobile phone Al the preset threshold A corresponding to the mobile phone A, and then determine, based on the preset threshold A and the exposure probability A, whether the advertisement B is to be exposed in the APP on the mobile phone A; after obtaining the exposure probability B of the advertisement B that is sent by the APP on the mobile phone B, the content server may obtain a device identifier corresponding to the mobile phone B, find, based on the device identifier corresponding to the mobile phone B, the preset threshold B corresponding to the mobile phone B, and then determine, based on the preset threshold B and the exposure probability B, whether the advertisement B is to be exposed in the APP on the mobile phone B; and so on.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0189">For example, the content server may separately obtain historical user behavior data collected by an APP on each mobile phone and an exposure result corresponding to the historical user behavior data, and separately perform data. analysis on each piece of historical user behavior data and each exposure result to determine a preset threshold corresponding to each mobile phone,</p><p id="p-0191" num="0190">For example, the content server may obtain historical user behavior data A collected by the APP on the mobile phone A and an exposure result A corresponding to the historical user behavior data A, and may perform data analysis on the historical user behavior data A and the exposure result A to determine the preset threshold A corresponding to the mobile phone A; and the content server may obtain historical user behavior data B collected by the APP on the mobile phone B and an exposure result B corresponding to the historical user behavior data B, and may perform data analysis on the historical user behavior data B and the exposure result B to determine the preset threshold B corresponding to the mobile phone B.

Alternatively, the user may set, in the APP on the mobile phone, a preset quantity of content requested by each content obtaining request. When determining to-be-returned target content based on the exposure probability, the content server may first determine a preset quantity corresponding to the mobile phone, and then may determine target content based on the preset quantity.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0193">For example, in a specific application scenario, when the user sets, in the APP on the mobile phone, the preset quantity of content requested by each content obtaining request to three screens, the content server may obtain the preset quantity of three screens from the APP on the mobile phone when determining to-be-returned target content based on the exposure probability, and may obtain three screens of target content based on the exposure probability and use the three screens of target content as target content to be returned to the mobile phone.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0194">It should be noted that the content server may determine, based on currently displayed content in the APP on the mobile phone or the to-be-displayed content corresponding to the exposure probability, target content to be returned to the mobile phone.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0195">Specifically, the target content returned by the content server may be content similar to the currently displayed content in the APP on the mobile phone or the to-be-displayed content corresponding to the exposure probability, to determine the target content based on viewing interest of the user, and improve user experience.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0196">It can be understood that the target content returned by the content server may be alternatively most popular content (for example, content with a highest click-through rate or most views) or latest content on the content server, This is not limited in this embodiment of this application.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197">Optionally, after determining a plurality of pieces of target content to be returned to the mobile phone, the content server may obtain a display order corresponding to each piece of target content and an operation mode corresponding to the APP on the mobile phone, and may determine, based on the operation mode and the display order, a display manner corresponding to the target content, to return the target content to the APP on the mobile phone based on the display manner.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0198">The display order corresponding to each piece of target content may be determined by the content server. For example, the content server may determine, based on an association relationship between target content, the display order corresponding to each target content; or may determine the display order corresponding to each piece of target content based on popularity corresponding to the target content, where a display order corresponding to more popular target content is higher, and a display order corresponding to less popular target content is lower; or may determine the display order corresponding to each piece of target content based on a publishing time corresponding to the target content, where a display order corresponding to target content with a later publishing time is higher, and a display order corresponding to target content with an earlier publishing time is lower.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0199">For example, the operation mode may include a swipe-up mode and a swipe-down mode.

To be specific, content with a higher display order is arranged closer to the top, and content with a lower display order is arranged closer to the bottom. In this way, when the user obtains new content in the swipe-up mode, content with a higher display order can be seen by the user earlier.

Specifically, the content obtaining request may be sent to the content server when the exposure status of the current content meets a preset condition. The current content is all content obtained by the APP by using a previous content obtaining request. The exposure status includes an exposed state and an unexposed state. The exposed state means that the content has been displayed on the display screen of the APR The unexposed state means that the content has not been displayed on the display screen of the APP. The preset condition may be that a quantity of content in an exposed state reaches a first preset value, or may be that a quantity of content in an unexposed state reaches a second preset value.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">It should be noted that the first preset value is less than N, where N is a total quantity of content obtained by the APP by using the previous content obtaining request, or the second preset value is greater than 0, to ensure that the content obtaining request may be sent in advance when there is still undisplayed content in the APP, to obtain subsequent to-be-displayed target content from the content server in advance. In this way, when displaying the target content, the APP may not need to load the target content in real time from the content server, thereby reducing a waiting delay of content display in the APP, increasing a display speed of content display, and improving user experience.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">Herein, the first preset value and the second preset value may be determined based on a specific case. For example, the first preset value and/or the second preset value may be determined based on target duration required by the APP to obtain the target content from the content server, average duration of displaying each screen of content by the APP, and a total quantity of screens of content obtained by a previous content obtaining request. For example, the first preset value and/or the second preset value may be determined based on the following: a quantity of remaining screens of previously obtained content&#xd7;the average duration&#x2264;the target duration, The quantity of remaining screens of previously acquired content is a quantity of screens of content, of the previously obtained content, that has not been displayed on the display screen of the APP.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206">Alternatively, the first preset value and/or the second preset value may be determined based on user-defined settings in the APP. For example, if the user sets, in the APP, that a content obtaining request is to be sent to the content server when three screens of previously obtained content have not been displayed on, the APP may set the second preset value to 3; or if the user sets, in the APP, that a content obtaining request is to be sent to the content server when two screens of content in content previously obtained each time are displayed in the APP, the APP may set the first preset value to 2.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207">It should be understood that, an initial exposure status of content obtained by the APP from the content server may be an unexposed state by default, and when specific content is displayed on the display screen of the APP, the APP may change an exposure status of the content from an unexposed state to an exposed state.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0208">In another possible implementation, the APP on the mobile phone may obtain display duration of current content in the APP, and may send a content obtaining request to the content server based on the display duration of the current content. Specifically, the content obtaining request may be sent to the content server when the display duration of the current content reaches preset duration. The preset duration may be determined based on target duration required by the APP to obtain the target content from the content server, average duration of displaying each screen of content by the APP, and a total quantity of screens of content obtained by a previous content obtaining request. For example, the preset duration may be determined based on the following: the preset duration+the target duration&#x2264;the average duration&#xd7;the total quantity of screens. It should be understood that the preset duration may he alternatively customized by the user in the APP.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0209">It should be noted that the exposure probability of the to-be-displayed content may be sent to the content server before the content obtaining request is sent, so that the content server may determine in advance the target content to be returned to the user terminal, and the content server may return the target content to the user terminal in a timely manner after when receiving the content obtaining request of the user terminal, thereby increasing a content obtaining speed on the user terminal. Certainly, the exposure probability of the to-be-displayed content may be alternatively sent to the content server together with the content obtaining request. To be specific, after the user terminal determines the exposure probability of the to-be-displayed content, when sending the content obtaining request to the content server, the user terminal may send the exposure probability of the to-be-displayed content to the content server together with the content obtaining request.
