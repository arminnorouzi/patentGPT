The URLLC is more demanding on transmission reliability and delay than other scenarios, and NR Release (R) 16 has introduced various priorities to support these scenarios. Once there is a conflict between transmissions of various priorities, a low-priority transmission will be dropped to guarantee the performance of a high-priority transmission. The URLLC's requirements on the transmission reliability and delay may differ from any other scenario by a couple of orders of magnitude, thus leading to the difference between designs of a physical layer data channel and a physical layer control channel requested by each application scenario.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Inventors find through researches that in order to reduce the performance loss of low-priority transmission, different priorities of data can be multiplexed on a same channel on the condition that high-priority transmission is not influenced. Therefore, there is an urgent issue to be solved, that is, how to design a rational multiplexing scheme to optimize low-priority transmission while ensuring the performance of high-priority transmission and meanwhile avoid resource wastes.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Inventors find through researches that a more precise channel and interference estimation shall be provided to make sure that URLLC scenario meets the needs of high reliability and low delay. So, how to enhance the Channel State Information (CSI) feedback mechanism to further improve the feedback accuracy remains a problem to be solved.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To address the above problems, the present disclosure provides a solution. It should be noted that though the present disclosure only took the URLLC scenario and transmission based on multiple priorities for example in the statement above, it is also applicable to other communication scenarios of eMBB, mMTC, single-priority-based transmission, Carrier Aggregation (CA) or V2X, where similar technical effects can be achieved. Additionally, the adoption of a unified solution for various scenarios (including but not limited to URLLC, eMBB, mMTC, multi-priority transmission, single-priority transmission, CA and V2X) contributes to the reduction of hardcore complexity and costs. If no conflict is incurred, embodiments in a first node in the present disclosure and the characteristics of the embodiments are also applicable to a second node, and vice versa.

The layer 1 (L1) is the lowest layer which performs signal processing functions of various PHY layers. The L1 is called PHY <b>301</b> in the present disclosure. The layer 2 (L2) <b>305</b> is above the PHY <b>301</b>, and is in charge of the link between the first communication node and the second communication node, or between two UEs via the PHY <b>301</b>.

All the three sublayers terminate at the second communication nodes. The PDCP sublayer <b>304</b> provides varied radio bearers and multiplexing between logical channels, and also provides securing by packet encryption, as well as support for handover of a first communication node between second communication nodes. The RLC sublayer <b>303</b> provides higher-layer packet segmentation and reassembling, retransmission of a lost packet, and also packet reordering so as to compensate for disordered reception caused by Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ).
