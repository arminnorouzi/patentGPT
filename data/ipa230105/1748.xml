In a first step <b>3002</b>, the monitoring system <b>10</b>, specifically the processing apparatus <b>120</b>, obtains the vehicle information <b>95</b>. In some examples, the vehicle information <b>95</b> obtained may be the acceleration a<sub>v </sub>of the vehicle <b>12</b> in the longitudinal, lateral and vertical directions of the vehicle <b>12</b>. In one example, the first step <b>3002</b> is repeated by the processing apparatus <b>120</b> at various time intervals, such as but not limited to no more than about every 10 seconds, in some cases no more than about every 9 seconds, in some cases no more than about every 8 seconds, in some cases no more than about every 7 seconds, in some cases no more than about every 6 seconds, in some cases no more than about every 5 seconds, in some cases no more than about every 4 seconds and in some cases even less. In another example, the vehicle information <b>95</b> is continuously obtained by the processing apparatus <b>120</b> at step <b>3002</b>, in which case the vehicle information <b>95</b> obtained is subsequently filtered by the processing apparatus <b>120</b>, as further described below.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0151">It will be readily appreciated that, a time interval that is too short will include some noise in the vehicle information <b>95</b> obtained, while a time interval that is too long will include unwanted vehicle information <b>95</b> (for example, unwanted acceleration data that is unrelated to the true acceleration a<sub>v </sub>of the vehicle <b>12</b>, data pertaining to turns and other events occurring during the use of the vehicle <b>12</b>, etc.). A time interval that is too short may also lead to the identification of &#x201c;false&#x201d; acceleration events, for example when the vehicle <b>12</b> is decelerating rather than accelerating. As such, by setting a suitable time interval at step <b>3002</b>, noise in the vehicle information <b>95</b> obtained is avoided while at the same time ensuring that changes in the vehicle information <b>95</b> obtained (and measured) are representative of an actual change in the state (e.g., motion) of the vehicle <b>12</b>. In some examples, by using a suitable time interval minute variations in the acceleration a<sub>v </sub>of the vehicle that can be observed when the vehicle <b>12</b> is operated at a constant speed v<sub>v </sub>(i.e., when there is no true acceleration a<sub>v </sub>of the vehicle <b>12</b>&#x2014;which in other words constitutes noise in the acceleration data) will not be considered and &#x201c;filtered out&#x201d; by the processing apparatus <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0152">It will also be readily appreciated that what a suitable time interval is may very well vary according to the type and usage of the vehicle <b>12</b> and as such the values provided above are in no way limiting and any other suitable time interval may be used in other examples. In other examples, the vehicle information <b>95</b> may be obtained at step <b>3002</b> at a first time interval and the vehicle information <b>95</b> so obtained may optionally be filtered at step <b>3003</b> at a second time interval that is greater than the first time interval. In other words, this enables the monitoring system <b>10</b> to obtain vehicle information <b>95</b> of a high temporal granularity and then only after filter out unwanted data from the vehicle information <b>95</b> to reduce and/or eliminate any noise originally present in the vehicle information obtained at step <b>3002</b>. It will be readily appreciated that when the vehicle information <b>95</b> is continuously obtained at step <b>3002</b>, the vehicle information <b>95</b> is filtered at step <b>3003</b> at a suitable time interval to ensure that any noise in the acceleration data is not further considered.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0153">In a second step <b>3004</b>, the monitoring system <b>10</b> determines whether the vehicle <b>12</b> has reached a &#x201c;zero-speed&#x201d; state based on the vehicle information <b>95</b> obtained at step <b>3002</b>. The &#x201c;zero-speed&#x201d; state can be defined in a number of ways. In one example, the &#x201c;zero-speed&#x201d; state can be defined as a state during which the acceleration of the vehicle <b>12</b> a<sub>v </sub>is below a pre-determined threshold in the longitudinal, lateral and vertical directions of the vehicle <b>12</b> for a pre-determined time period. In some examples, the pre-determined acceleration threshold in the longitudinal, lateral and vertical directions of the vehicle <b>12</b> may be no more than about 0.5 g, in some cases no more than about 0.25 g, in some cases no more than about 0.2 g, in some cases no more than about 0.1 g, in some cases no more than about 0.05 g, in some cases no more than about 0.025 g and in some cases even less. In some examples, the pre-determined time period may be no more than about 1 second, in some cases no more than about 500 ms, in some cases no more than about 250 ms, in some cases no more than about 200 ms, in some cases no more than about 100 ms, in some cases no more than about 50 ms, in some cases no more than about 25 ms, in some cases no more than about 20 ms, in some cases no more than about 10 ms, in some cases no more than about 5 ms, in some cases no more than about 4 ms, in some cases no more than about ms, in some cases no more than about 2 ms, in some cases no more than about 1 ms and in some cases even less. It will be readily appreciated that in this example the acceleration a<sub>v </sub>of the vehicle <b>12</b> must have been obtained over the course of a sufficient period of time at step <b>3002</b> for the monitoring system <b>10</b> to make a determination as to whether the pre-determined time period has been reached or not. The second step <b>3004</b> is also repeated at various time intervals, which may or may not be the same as the time intervals at which the vehicle information <b>95</b> is obtained at step <b>3002</b>. The &#x201c;zero-speed&#x201d; state can be defined in any other suitable manner&#x2014;in some examples, the &#x201c;zero-speed&#x201d; state can be defined as a state during which the acceleration of the vehicle <b>12</b> a<sub>v </sub>is below a pre-determined threshold in the longitudinal, lateral and vertical directions of the vehicle <b>12</b>. In this example, the &#x201c;zero-speed&#x201d; state can therefore be reached irrespective of the length during which the acceleration of the vehicle <b>12</b> a<sub>v </sub>is below the pre-determined threshold in the longitudinal, lateral and vertical directions. In other examples, when the wheel sensor <b>90</b> and the vehicle sensor <b>129</b> comprising the IMU <b>109</b> are both integral with the vehicle <b>12</b>, the data acquired by the wheel sensor <b>90</b> and the IMU <b>109</b> may be synchronized. In this case, the determination of whether the &#x201c;zero-speed&#x201d; state has been reached may be based at least in part upon information regarding the wheel assembly <b>20</b>, specifically a rotation speed of the wheel assembly <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0154">For as long as no determination is made at step <b>3004</b> to the effect that the &#x201c;zero-speed&#x201d; state has been reached by the vehicle <b>12</b>, the process <b>3000</b> reverts to step <b>3002</b> and steps <b>3002</b> and <b>3004</b> are repeated. Once a determination is made by the monitoring system <b>10</b> at step <b>3004</b> that the &#x201c;zero-speed&#x201d; state has been reached, at step <b>3006</b> the IMU <b>109</b> is optionally recalibrated. Recalibration generally refers to the process of compensating for errors and/or noise in the acquisition/measure of the vehicle information <b>95</b> (e.g., the acceleration of the vehicle <b>12</b> a<sub>v </sub>by the accelerometer, the gyroscope and/or the magnetometer). This improves the accuracy of the vehicle information <b>95</b>, specifically the accuracy of the acceleration a<sub>v </sub>of the vehicle <b>12</b> that is measured/acquired by the vehicle sensor <b>129</b>, and ensures that the vehicle information <b>95</b> is as representative as possible of the &#x201c;true&#x201d; vehicle information (e.g., that the acceleration of the vehicle <b>12</b> a<sub>v </sub>acquired/measured by the vehicle sensor <b>129</b> is as close as possible to the &#x201c;real&#x201d; acceleration of the vehicle <b>12</b>).</p><p id="p-0147" num="0155">Operation of the System</p><p id="p-0148" num="0156">In one embodiment, the monitoring system <b>10</b> is configured to monitor at least one physical aspect relating to the wheel assembly <b>20</b> via the wheel assembly sensor <b>90</b> and then communicate the wheel assembly sensor information <b>84</b> resulting therefrom to the processing apparatus <b>120</b> to derive vehicle information <b>95</b> regarding the vehicle <b>12</b>, including information regarding the wheel assembly <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0157">As described above, notably depending on the type of sensing element <b>92</b> implemented in the wheel assembly sensor <b>90</b>, the wheel assembly sensor information <b>84</b> may include information related to the rotational speed of the wheel assembly <b>20</b>, the rotational acceleration of the wheel assembly <b>20</b>, the pressure in the wheel assembly <b>20</b> (specifically, the pressure at the interface between the rim <b>45</b> of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> and the tire <b>34</b>), the temperature of the wheel assembly <b>20</b>, the profile of the underlying surface <b>15</b> and the likes.

Without wishing to be bound by theory, as the tire <b>34</b> wears, there is less elastomeric material of the tire <b>34</b> to deform under load from the vehicle <b>12</b>, such that the pressure at the interface between the wheel body <b>32</b> and the tire <b>34</b> increases as the amount of elastomeric material of the tire <b>34</b> decreases. It is therefore possible to correlate the pressure measured at the interface between the wheel <b>32</b> and the tire <b>34</b> to the outer diameter D<sub>T </sub>of the tire, and ultimately to the wear of the tire <b>34</b>. As such, in a first step <b>1910</b>, the pressure at the interface between the wheel <b>32</b> and the tire <b>34</b> is measured, with an exemplary graph of pressure=f (time) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b><i>a</i></figref>. It will be readily appreciated that, since the pressure exerted onto the tire <b>34</b>, specifically onto the outer surface <b>37</b>/tread <b>40</b> of the tire <b>34</b>, is detected as it is exerted substantially along the radial direction corresponding to that of the pressure transducer (or other type of sensing device capable of sensing pressure), as described above, the detection of the pressure by the pressure transducer is periodic as the tire <b>34</b> rolls on the underlying surface <b>15</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b><i>a</i></figref>, the period being correlated to the speed of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> and/or the vehicle <b>12</b>. Also, the pressure measured during each period exhibits a pressure peak, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b><i>a</i></figref>, that corresponds to an angle of about 0&#xb0; between the radial direction corresponding to that of the pressure transducer at the interface between the rim <b>45</b> and the tire <b>34</b> and the normal of the force exerted onto the outer surface <b>37</b>/tread <b>40</b> of the tire <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0186">At step <b>1920</b>, the pressure measured by the pressure transducer is correlated to a reference pressure. For example, it may be known that when the tire <b>34</b> shows no wear (i.e., is new), the maximum pressure at the interface between the rim <b>45</b> and the tire <b>34</b> using the vehicle <b>12</b> at a prescribed load may be a maximum pressure Po. The deviation between Po and the (maximum) pressure measured at step <b>1910</b> may then be used to determine the wear of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> at step <b>1930</b> (with the vehicle <b>12</b> at the same prescribed load). For example, with further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b><i>b</i></figref>, it can be shown that a new tire <b>34</b> (i.e., exhibiting no wear, i.e. no loss of elastomeric material) experiences a maximum pressure P<sub>0a </sub>at a first load of 60% and a maximum pressure P<sub>0b </sub>at a load of 120%, while the maximum pressure at the two loads is in each case higher when the tire exhibits wear. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b><i>b</i></figref>, a wear of 7 mm (i.e., a loss of elastomeric material corresponding to a decrease of about 7 mm in the outer diameter D<sub>T </sub>of the tire) translates into an increase in the measured maximum pressure of about 10% at 60% load and of about 10% at 120% load when compared to the maximum pressure P<sub>0a </sub>and P<sub>0b </sub>at the prescribed load. Using this information, it may therefore be possible to derive a specific decrease of the outer diameter D<sub>T </sub>of the tire <b>34</b> based on the maximum pressure measured at step <b>1910</b>&#x2014;assuming a linear relationship between the increase of the measured maximum pressure and the decrease of the outer diameter D<sub>T </sub>of the tire <b>34</b>, in the example above an increase in the measured maximum pressure of about 5% would translate in an estimated wear of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> of about 3.5 mm (i.e., about 50% of the wear observed with the increase in the measured maximum pressure of about 10%). However, the relationship between the increase of the measured maximum pressure and the decrease of the outer diameter D<sub>T </sub>of the tire <b>34</b> may not be linear, for example depending on a tread pattern of the tread <b>40</b>, the elastomeric material that constitutes the tire <b>34</b> and the likes. Much like in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, the user may then be notified at step <b>1940</b> or the operation of the vehicle <b>12</b> may be modulated at step <b>1950</b> (for example, based on the wheel assembly <b>20</b> and/or vehicle <b>12</b> speed/acceleration data) such that the wear of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> may be limited after the implementation of the modulation. While in the example above the (maximum) pressure is measured at step <b>1910</b> and then used at step <b>1920</b> to determine a wear of the tire at step <b>1930</b>, any other suitable pressure-derived data may be used in other examples to derive a wear of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> at step <b>1930</b>. For example, a width of a pressure peak as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A</figref> and B, as well as the surface area under the pressure peak may be used. In yet further examples, an entire data set of pressure data (i.e., comprising all data acquired by the sensing device <b>92</b>, i.e. within a pressure peak and outside the pressure peak) may be used to derive a wear of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> at step <b>1930</b>.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0187">In yet further examples, the wear of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> may be assessed on the basis of the pressure history data (at a prescribed load) at the interface between the wheel <b>32</b> and the tire <b>34</b>.

In this embodiment, the monitoring system <b>10</b> assesses the wear of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> at least in part based on the vehicle information <b>95</b> that is acquired by the sensing device <b>91</b> of the vehicle sensor <b>129</b>, for example the speed and/or acceleration of the vehicle <b>12</b>, as further described below. Without wishing to be bound by theory, as the outer diameter D<sub>T </sub>of the tire <b>34</b> decreases when the tire <b>34</b> experiences wear as it rolls on the underlying surface <b>15</b> (i.e., there is degradation of the elastomeric material of the tire <b>34</b>), the rotational (or angular) speed of the tire <b>34</b> v<sub>t </sub>increases even though the velocity of the vehicle v<sub>v </sub>remains the same (i.e., the tire <b>34</b> has to undergo more rotations for the vehicle <b>12</b> to travel a pre-determined distance). The corollary is that the acceleration of the vehicle a<sub>v </sub>remains the same, however the acceleration of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> a<sub>w </sub>increases. As such, it is possible to correlate a decrease in the acceleration of the vehicle <b>12</b> a<sub>v </sub>relative to the acceleration of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> a<sub>w </sub>with an increase in the wear of the wheel assembly <b>20</b>. The ratio of the acceleration of the vehicle a<sub>v </sub>to the acceleration of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> a<sub>w </sub>is therefore a function of the wear of the wheel assembly <b>20</b>. Without wishing to be bound by theory, as the acceleration a<sub>v </sub>of the vehicle <b>12</b> is generally independent from the outer diameter D<sub>T </sub>of the tire <b>34</b>, this means that to maintain the same acceleration a<sub>v </sub>of the vehicle <b>12</b> the acceleration of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> a<sub>w </sub>should increase as the wear of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> increases.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0189">As such, in a first step <b>2110</b>, the rotational speed (and/or acceleration in other examples) of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> is measured by the sensing device <b>92</b>. Where applicable, the rotational acceleration of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> is optionally derived at step <b>2120</b> (for example, when the sensing device <b>92</b> measures the rotational speed of the wheel assembly <b>20</b>) and the vehicle information <b>95</b>, specifically the acceleration of the vehicle <b>12</b>, is then measured by the sensing device <b>91</b> at step <b>2130</b>. At step <b>2140</b>, the wear of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> is determined by correlating the acceleration of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> with that of the vehicle <b>12</b>, with an increase in the acceleration of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> relative to the acceleration of the vehicle a<sub>v </sub>being correlatable with an increase in the wear of the wheel assembly <b>20</b>. The determination of the wear of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> may be performed directly at the level of the processing apparatus <b>120</b>, however it may also be performed at the level of the remote computer <b>140</b> in other examples. Much like in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b> and <b>19</b></figref>, the user may then be notified at step <b>2150</b> or the operation of the vehicle <b>12</b> may be modulated at step <b>2160</b> such that the wear of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> may be limited after the implementation of the modulation.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0190">In yet further examples, the wear of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> may be assessed on the basis of the rotational acceleration history data and/or the distance history data of the wheel assembly <b>20</b>.

In the instance in which the vehicle <b>12</b> comprises at least a front wheel assembly and a rear wheel assembly, the front wheel assembly being a driving wheel assembly and the rear wheel assembly being a free-rolling wheel assembly, the wear of the rear free-rolling wheel assembly may be estimated by computing the ratio of the revolution speed of the front and rear wheel assemblies. In some cases, the revolution speed of the front and rear wheel assemblies is a maximum revolution speed of the front and rear wheel assemblies. In other cases, the revolution speed of the front and rear wheel assemblies is a first percentile of revolution speed of the front and rear wheel assemblies, the first percentile being in some cases a 50<sup>th </sup>percentile, in some cases a 55<sup>th </sup>percentile, in some cases a 60<sup>th </sup>percentile, in some cases a 65<sup>th </sup>percentile, in some cases a 70<sup>th </sup>percentile, in some cases a 75<sup>th </sup>percentile, in some cases a 80<sup>th </sup>percentile, in some cases a 85<sup>th </sup>percentile, in some cases a 90<sup>th </sup>percentile, in some cases a 95<sup>th </sup>percentile and in some cases even more.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0192">In yet further examples, the wear of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> may be assessed on the basis of the acceleration a<sub>v </sub>of the vehicle <b>12</b> that is acquired via the vehicle sensor <b>129</b>. Without wishing to be bound by theory, as the tire <b>34</b> wears down both the speed v<sub>v </sub>and the acceleration a<sub>v </sub>of the vehicle <b>12</b> decrease in a manner that is proportional to a reduction of the circumference of the tire <b>34</b>. In other words, a vehicle with &#x201c;new&#x201d; tires <b>34</b> exhibits higher speed and acceleration compared to a vehicle with &#x201c;worn&#x201d; tires <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0193">An embodiment of a process <b>3100</b> for measuring wear of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> (e.g., the tire <b>34</b>) using the acceleration a<sub>v </sub>of the vehicle <b>12</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b>A</figref>. In a first step <b>3102</b>, the monitoring system <b>10</b>, specifically the processing apparatus <b>120</b>, obtains the vehicle information <b>95</b>. In some examples, the vehicle information <b>95</b> obtained may be the acceleration a<sub>v </sub>of the vehicle <b>12</b> and the vehicle information <b>95</b> may have been obtained at a suitable time interval, for example as described above in relation to the process <b>3000</b>.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0194">In a second step <b>3104</b>, reference information is obtained. Reference information refers to a type of vehicle information <b>95</b> in which the vehicle <b>12</b> is the same as the vehicle <b>12</b> for which the vehicle information <b>95</b> is obtained at step <b>3102</b>. The reference information also refers to vehicle information <b>95</b> regarding a vehicle similar to the one for which the vehicle information <b>95</b> is being obtained (e.g., a forklift), with new, i.e. unworn, wheel assemblies <b>20</b> (e.g., new, unworn tires <b>34</b>) and that is operated in a manner that is generally similar to that of the vehicle for which the vehicle information <b>95</b> is being obtained at step <b>3102</b>, as further described below. In some examples, where the vehicle <b>12</b> is a forklift used to move equipment between two locations of a warehouse along a generally linear path, the reference information may preferably refer to vehicle information <b>95</b> for a forklift with new, i.e. unworn wheel assemblies and that is also generally used to carry similar equipment along a generally linear path.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0195">The reference information <b>95</b> for the vehicle <b>12</b> may be generated in a number of ways. In one example, the acceleration a<sub>v </sub>of the vehicle <b>12</b> may be acquired in the driving direction of the vehicle <b>12</b>, and a threshold may be set such that the acceleration a<sub>v </sub>of the vehicle is recorded only when the measured acceleration a<sub>v </sub>remains above a pre-determined threshold for a prescribed amount of time, for example at least about 0.3 s, in some cases at least about 0.4 s, in some cases at least about 0.5 s, in some cases at least about 0.6 s, in some cases at least about 0.7 s, in some cases at least about 0.8 s, in some cases at least about 0.9 s, in some cases at least about 1 s, in some cases at least about 2 s, in some cases at least about 3 s, in some cases at least about 4 s, in some cases at least about 5 s and in some cases even more. This ensures for example that fluctuations in the acceleration a<sub>v </sub>of the vehicle are not recorded. Another threshold may also be set such that the acceleration a<sub>v </sub>of the vehicle <b>12</b> is recorded only when the measured acceleration a<sub>v </sub>occurs at a prescribed amount of time from an event, for example at least about 0.3 s from the event, in some cases at least about 0.4 s from the event, in some cases at least about 0.5 s from the event, in some cases at least about 0.6 s from the event, in some cases at least about 0.7 s from the event, in some cases at least about 0.8 s from the event, in some cases at least about 0.9 s from the event, in some cases at least about 1 s from the event and in some cases even more. This ensures for example that &#x201c;false&#x201d; acceleration periods (which are too close temporally from the event) are not considered. The acceleration a<sub>v </sub>recorded in this manner is recorded in a reference database, for example on the remote computer <b>140</b>, and constitutes the reference information that is associated to the vehicle <b>12</b>. In other words, at least some of the data acquired by the vehicle sensor <b>129</b> is gradually saved in the reference database as the reference information, for as long as it meets the thresholding criteria defined above and the additional criteria further described below. The reference database may also include, for a set of vehicle acceleration data, information regarding the usage of the vehicle <b>12</b> for which the vehicle acceleration a<sub>v </sub>has been measured, such as but not limited to the type of vehicle, the load (if applicable), etc. In some examples, the size of the reference database may also be managed so as to ensure a suitable calculation speed at step <b>3106</b>, as further discussed below.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0196">As further acceleration data is acquired by the vehicle sensor <b>129</b> over time and meets the thresholding criteria defined above, the reference database may be complemented with this further acceleration data, at which point a decision needs to be made as to whether the further acceleration data is to complement and/or refine the reference information. To this end, in one embodiment the further acceleration data measured can be normalized and integrated and the resulting speed increase correlated against the acceleration and speed increase data from the reference database (i.e., the reference information). When the correlation is lower than a prescribed threshold value, the further acceleration data may be added to the reference information in the reference database. In other embodiments, the average acceleration over a prescribed time period or machine learning and support vector machines may be used to determine whether the further acceleration data may be added to the reference information. It will be readily appreciated that acceleration data representative of events appearing more frequently (for example when the vehicle <b>12</b> repeats the same pattern over time) may be prioritized in the reference database. This also ensures that as the usage of the vehicle <b>12</b> is modified and/or evolves over time, and consequently as the nature and type of events appearing during the usage of the vehicle <b>12</b> more frequently changes, the reference information will be modified and/or updated accordingly.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0197">For example, as a change in the load of the vehicle <b>12</b> may influence the acceleration a<sub>v </sub>of the vehicle <b>12</b>, the reference information may need to be re-assessed on a regular basis. To this end, the reference information stored in the reference database may include distinct subsets of reference information, for example an &#x201c;older&#x201d; relating to the usage of the vehicle <b>12</b> with a first load, and another &#x201c;more recent&#x201d; subset relating to the usage of the vehicle <b>12</b> with a second load. It will be readily appreciated that in this example the second subset of the reference information may be preferred at step <b>3106</b> when the vehicle information <b>95</b> is compared to the reference information as it may be more representative of the current usage of the vehicle <b>12</b>. As the size and the variety of the reference information increases over time, the reliability of the reference information is not compromised even as the application/use of the vehicle <b>12</b> or the driver of the vehicle <b>12</b> changes.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0198">In another example, the acceleration data acquired by the vehicle sensing device <b>129</b> may exhibit a profile substantially similar to that of the reference information, however the magnitude of the acceleration data between both may be different. In this example, it may be useful (a) to consider the largest acceleration values within the shortest time scale and (b) to include in the reference information a prescribed time period of acceleration data before and after the largest acceleration values. Without wishing to be bound by theory, given that it is more difficult to maintain a constant speed after the vehicle <b>12</b> has performed an acceleration to half its maximum speed compared to maintaining a constant (maximum) speed after the vehicle <b>12</b> has performed a full acceleration to its maximum speed, using this additional acceleration data before and after the largest acceleration values a difference may be made by the monitoring system <b>10</b> between profiles that are substantially similar but with distinct magnitudes of the acceleration data.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0199">In yet another example, the reference information <b>95</b> may be generated without relying on any data acquired by the monitoring system <b>10</b>. With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b>B</figref> there is shown an exemplary plot of acceleration=f (time) that is generally representative of a &#x201c;true&#x201d; acceleration event and that can be used as the reference information <b>95</b> at step <b>3104</b>. It will be readily appreciated that a variety of other suitable plots may be generated and used as reference information <b>95</b> in the process <b>3100</b> depending on the type of vehicle <b>12</b>, the operation and usage of the vehicle <b>12</b> and the likes.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0200">The acceleration data of the vehicle acquired by the vehicle sensor <b>129</b> is compared to the reference information at step <b>3106</b>, as further described below.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0201">At step <b>3106</b>, the vehicle information <b>95</b> obtained at step <b>3102</b> and the reference information obtained at step <b>3104</b> are compared. The comparison can be done in a number of ways. For example, assuming the vehicle information <b>95</b> contains a first data set and that the reference information contains a second data set, a reference timeframe may first be identified between the first and the second data sets. This would ensure, for example, that the comparison between the first and the second data sets is done over a substantially identical time period and that the comparison begins with the same event (e.g., the vehicle <b>12</b> being set in motion). At step <b>3108</b>, the wear of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> (e.g., the tire <b>34</b>) may be derived by calculating a ratio (called an acceleration ratio) between the first and the second data sets which is generally representative of the wear of the wheel assembly <b>20</b>. For example, the acceleration ratio may be calculated by performing a linear regression of the first data set versus the second data set. The closer the ratio is to 1, the closer is the data from the first data set to the data from the second data set and therefore the closer is the wheel assembly <b>20</b> to a new, unworn wheel assembly. As the acceleration ratio deviates from 1, and assuming a linear relationship between the decrease of the diameter of the tire <b>34</b> and the acceleration a<sub>v </sub>of the vehicle <b>12</b>, the wear of the wheel assembly can be estimated. For example, an acceleration ratio of about 0.9 means that the wheel assembly <b>20</b> has experienced a wear of about 10% of its diameter compared to a new, unworn wear assembly. It will be readily appreciated that the acceleration data that is being compared at step <b>3106</b> can include an average of acceleration data over a prescribed period of time, as well as an integral of the acceleration data over time. The wear of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> (e.g., the tire <b>34</b>) may also be derived in any suitable other suitable manner at step <b>3108</b>, for example by comparing the acceleration data between the reference information and the vehicle information over a prescribed period of time.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0202">In one example, the acceleration of a vehicle was measured during the initial acceleration of the vehicle over two separate runs and the results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b>A</figref>. The acceleration of the vehicle was measured at a time interval of about 10 ms&#x2014;due to the granularity of the acceleration measurements this data set is considered &#x201c;unfiltered&#x201d; and therefore includes some noise. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b>A</figref> shows that the vehicle begins to accelerate at about 700 ms and reaches a constant speed (i.e., the acceleration becomes generally null) at about 1700 ms&#x2014;in other words, the vehicle reaches a constant speed over the course of about 1000 ms. A comparison of the acceleration data obtained for both runs between 700 ms and 1800 ms is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b>B</figref>. A good correlation is found between the acceleration data of the <b>2</b> runs (acceleration ratio of 1.013). A comparison of the filtered acceleration data obtained for both runs between 700 ms and 1800 ms is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b>B</figref>. The correlation found with the filtered acceleration data is better (acceleration ratio of 0.995) that with the unfiltered data.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0203">It will be readily appreciated that the acceleration ratio may be used to assess the wear of driving wheel assemblies <b>20</b>. In a hypothetical case in which the vehicle <b>12</b> comprises both driving (for example the front) and free-rolling (for example the rear) wheel assemblies and in which the driving wheel assembly experiences no substantial wear, the acceleration ratio may remain around 1, however the ratio of the maximum revolution speed of the driving and &#x201c;free-rolling&#x201d; wheel assemblies may change as the &#x201c;free-rolling&#x201d; wheel assembly experiences wear. In another hypothetical example in which the driving wheel assembly experiences substantial wear while the &#x201c;free-rolling&#x201d; wheel assembly experiences no substantial wear, the acceleration ratio may be substantially identical to the ratio of the maximum revolution speed of the front and rear wheel assemblies.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0204">In another embodiment, the monitoring system <b>10</b> assesses the wear of the wheel assembly <b>20</b>, specifically assesses the comparative wear of at least one front vs. at least one rear wheel assembly <b>20</b>, at least in part based on the vehicle information <b>95</b> pertaining to the speed v<sub>v </sub>of the vehicle <b>12</b>. A frequency analysis is performed on the subset of the speed data of the vehicle <b>12</b> that corresponds to temporal regions associated with constant speeds of the vehicle <b>12</b>. A constant speed v<sub>v </sub>of the vehicle <b>12</b> may be defined in any suitable manner, for example the speed v<sub>v </sub>of the vehicle <b>12</b> may be constant when it does not change by more than about 0.1%, in some cases more than about 0.5%, in some cases more than about 1%, in some cases more than about 1.5%, in some cases more than about 2%, in some cases more than about 2.5%, in some cases more than about 5% and in some cases even more over a prescribed period of time. In the context of the vehicle <b>12</b> having at least one front and at least one rear wheel assembly <b>20</b>, a deviation in the frequency analysis of the constant speeds performed over time (that is, performed over multiple instances of the vehicle <b>12</b> reaching a constant speed v<sub>v</sub>) indicates that one of the at least one front and at least one rear wheel assembly <b>20</b> experiences more wear than the other. In this case, the deviation in the frequency analysis of the constant speeds can also be indicative of a reduction in the speed of the vehicle <b>12</b> v<sub>v</sub>. When the vehicle <b>12</b> has front and rear wheel assemblies <b>20</b> having a tire <b>34</b> with a tread <b>40</b> of a known tread profile (e.g., number of blocks, etc.), the speed of the vehicle <b>12</b> can also be derived from the frequency analysis of the constant speeds of the vehicle <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0205">In another embodiment, the monitoring system <b>10</b> may be used to assess a wear of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> through an assessment of a tilting of the vehicle <b>12</b> relative to the underlying surface <b>15</b>. In this embodiment, the monitoring system acquires acceleration data during a &#x201c;zero-speed&#x201d; state of the vehicle <b>12</b>, the &#x201c;zero-speed&#x201d; state being defined as a state during which the speed of the vehicle <b>12</b> v<sub>v </sub>is below a pre-determined threshold in the longitudinal, lateral and vertical directions of the vehicle <b>12</b> for a pre-determined time period. In other words, the &#x201c;zero-speed&#x201d; state corresponds to a state of &#x201c;standstill&#x201d; of the vehicle <b>12</b> and any acceleration measured during such state is representative of a tilting of the vehicle <b>12</b> relative to the underlying surface <b>15</b>, specifically of an angle of the vehicle <b>12</b> relative to a horizontal plane (assuming that the underlying surface is generally horizontal). Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the angle of the vehicle <b>12</b> relative to the horizontal plane is a function of the slope of the underlying surface <b>15</b>, the load of the vehicle <b>12</b> as well as the wear of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> (i.e., the wear of the tire <b>34</b>). Over time, changes in the slope of the underlying surface <b>15</b> or the load of the vehicle <b>12</b>, as the vehicle <b>12</b> is being used, are randomized (i.e., they may result in tilting of the vehicle <b>12</b> at various time points, however the tilting will not be constant over time and will not be in a single specific direction, but rather in a plurality of directions). Changes in the wear of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> over time will result in a tilting of the vehicle <b>12</b> in one specific direction, and therefore in an increase in the acceleration of the vehicle <b>12</b> in that specific direction over time during the &#x201c;zero-speed&#x201d; state. In this embodiment, the monitoring system <b>10</b> can derive a wear of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> based on the acceleration data acquired during the &#x201c;zero-speed&#x201d; state of the vehicle <b>12</b>. In one example, the monitoring system <b>10</b> can derive a wear of the wheel assembly based on data representative of the tilting of the vehicle <b>12</b> in one specific direction, including data representative of an increase in the tilting of the vehicle <b>12</b> in one specific direction over time.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0206">Load on the Wheel Assembly <b>20</b></p><p id="p-0184" num="0207">In another embodiment, the monitoring system <b>10</b> may be used to assess a load on the wheel assembly <b>20</b>. That is, in this example, instead of measuring and/or comparing pressure at the interface between the wheel <b>32</b> and the tire <b>34</b> at a prescribed load to assess wear, the pressure at the interface between the wheel <b>32</b> and the tire <b>34</b> may be measured and/or compared at a prescribed wear to assess load. As such, in this example, differences in measured pressure is representative of distinct loads on the wheel assembly <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0208">Generally, variations in the wear of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> occur over extended periods of time (e.g., over several days, several weeks, several months, etc.), while variations in the load on the wheel assembly <b>20</b> occur over shorter periods of time (e.g., as the vehicle <b>12</b> is loaded/unloaded during use&#x2014;over several minutes, several hours, etc.). As such, as the pressure data is acquired by the sensing device <b>92</b>, the load on the wheel assembly <b>20</b> may be assessed on a first time scale during which the wear of the wheel assembly <b>20</b>, i.e. the tire <b>34</b>, does not change or does not substantially change, and the wear of the tire may be assessed on a second time scale which is greater than the first time scale and during which the wear of the wheel assembly <b>20</b>, i.e. the tire <b>34</b>, changes, while relying on the same pressure data being acquired over time. In other examples, instead of relying on pressure data, the load on the wheel device <b>20</b> may also be assessed based on deflection data acquired by an optical sensor, the deflection experienced by the wheel assembly <b>20</b>, i.e. the tire <b>34</b>, being correlatable to the load on the wheel assembly <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0209">In another embodiment, the acceleration a<sub>v </sub>of the vehicle <b>12</b> may also be used by the monitoring system <b>10</b> to estimate the load on the wheel assembly <b>20</b> during operation of the vehicle <b>12</b>. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the vehicle <b>12</b> (such as a forklift) shows Eigenfrequencies when excited dynamically, which is notably the case as the vehicle <b>12</b> is being driven. Those Eigenfrequencies are depending on the spring, damping and mass characteristics and as such a first shift in Eigenfrequencies over a prescribed period of time may be used to estimate the wear of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> (i.e., the tire <b>34</b>), while a second shift may also be used to indicate the modification of the load of the vehicle <b>12</b> (i.e., the load on the wheel assembly <b>20</b>). In one non-limiting example, the first shift may be observed at a frequency peak that is greater than a frequency peak at which the second shift is observed. It will be readily appreciated that, using Eigenfrequencies, the wear of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> and the load on the wheel assembly <b>20</b> can be estimated separately or concurrently. The Eigenfrequency is represented by the following formula:</p><p id="p-0187" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mi>f</mi>  <mo>=</mo>  <mrow>   <mfrac>    <mn>1</mn>    <mrow>     <mn>2</mn>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mi>&#x3c0;</mi>    </mrow>   </mfrac>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <msqrt>    <mfrac>     <mi>k</mi>     <mi>m</mi>    </mfrac>   </msqrt>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0188" num="0000">with k being the stiffness and m the mass. As an example, if the total mass of the vehicle <b>12</b> is increased by 25% as a result of an increase in the load transported by the vehicle <b>12</b>, a shift of &#x2212;10.5% in Eigenfrequencies may be expected in the short term.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0210">Detecting Floor Conditions</p><p id="p-0190" num="0211">In yet further embodiments, floor conditions may be assessed by the monitoring system <b>10</b>. For example, the shocks and/or impacts experienced by the wheel assembly <b>20</b>, as they could be measured by the pressure transducer in some examples, may also be used to derive data representative of the environment of the wheel assembly <b>20</b>, specifically of the underlying surface <b>15</b>. Alternatively, the shocks and/or impacts may be assessed based on acceleration data measured in the vertical direction by an accelerometer positioned on the wheel assembly <b>20</b> and/or on vehicle <b>12</b>. It may be known that for a particular state of wear of the wheel assembly <b>20</b>, a vertical shock experienced by the wheel assembly <b>20</b> (for example, an impact experienced by the wheel assembly <b>20</b> as the wheel assembly <b>20</b> encounters a rock or any other type of debris as it rolls on the underlying surface <b>15</b>) of a prescribed magnitude may result in a 50% chance of crack failure of the wheel assembly <b>20</b>, specifically of the tire <b>34</b>. As such, the user may be notified by the monitoring system <b>10</b> when such shocks are encountered that a risk of crack failure of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> exists. In other examples, data related to vertical shocks experienced by the wheel assembly <b>20</b> may be used to derive information about the environment of the wheel assembly <b>20</b>, for example the underlying surface <b>15</b> on which the wheel assembly rolls <b>20</b> (e.g., whether the vehicle <b>12</b> is operated indoor, outdoor, etc.).</p><p id="p-0191" num="0212">Comfort Determination</p><p id="p-0192" num="0213">In yet further embodiments, the monitoring system <b>10</b> may be used to estimate a comfort level experienced by the driver of the vehicle <b>12</b>. Using the acceleration a<sub>v </sub>of the vehicle <b>12</b> acquired by the vehicle sensor <b>129</b>, the ISO2631 filtering (or any other filtering suitable for comfort determination) may be implemented to estimate a vibration experienced by the vehicle <b>12</b> as well as monitor the influence of the wear of the wheel assembly <b>20</b> on the vibrations of the vehicle <b>12</b>. Using the acceleration data, corrective actions may be taken when the wear assembly <b>20</b>. For wheel assemblies <b>20</b> have a tire <b>34</b> with a clear tread profile, the initial appearance and later disappearance of tread pattern induced vibrations (at frequencies dictated by the tread pitch, with one frequency peak for the front tires and another frequency peak for the rear tires) may also be further used to confirm the wear level of the wheel assembly <b>20</b>, specifically the tire <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0214">Complete Indoor Tracking</p><p id="p-0194" num="0215">In yet further embodiments, the monitoring system <b>10</b> comprising the IMU <b>109</b> may also be used as an indoor navigation system, in which case the trajectories and maneuvers of the vehicle <b>12</b> may be estimated via the IMU <b>109</b>. The reliance on the data acquired by the IMU may also translate into less reliance on the data acquired by the wheel assembly sensor <b>90</b>, and as such the wheel assembly sensor <b>90</b> may be reduced in both size and battery requirements. The IMU <b>09</b> may be used to estimate the trajectories and maneuvers of the vehicle <b>12</b> in a number of ways. In some examples, various machine learning algorithms may be used, such as but not limited to robust IMU double integration (RIDI), Robust Neural Inertial Navigation and the likes. Data gathered by the IMU <b>109</b> may also be used to estimate, for example, the curvature of the trajectories and the number of turns of the vehicle <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0216">While in the embodiments considered above the vehicle <b>12</b> is a forklift, the monitoring system <b>10</b> may be used in respect of any other type of vehicle in other embodiments.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0217">For example, in other embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b>-<b>25</b></figref>, the material-handling vehicle <b>12</b> may be a baggage tractor for transporting baggage (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>), a reach stacker for moving containers (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>) or a pushback tractor for moving aircraft (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>).
