In one type of these dehydration apparatuses, disclosed, for example, in WO 2009/049409 published Apr. 23, 2009 and WO 2014/085897 published Jun. 12, 2014, organic materials are dehydrated by transporting the materials through a vacuum microwave chamber in a rotating container. In the apparatus disclosed in WO 2014/085897, a pair of rotatable rollers is arranged to support and rotate the container of materials about its horizontal axis and a chain drive is provided to transport the container along the rollers through the length of the chamber. This type of prior art machine is mechanically complicated: the double rollers must maintain synchronization, the transmission mechanism for operating the rollers is highly complex, and the relative alignment of the rollers (e.g., the distance and angle between them) must precisely correspond with the diameter of the rotatable containers to permit proper engagement of the rollers with the containers. The required level of precision for proper operation of this type of machine can be difficult to achieve in a microwave dehydration process since the containers will expand and eventually become distorted over time with the high operating temperatures.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">There is a need in the dehydration industry for a vacuum microwave dehydration apparatus with a simpler and more robust mechanism for transporting rotatable containers. The present invention is directed to an improved vacuum microwave drying apparatus.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention provides an apparatus for dehydrating organic material. A vacuum chamber has an input end for the introduction of a container of the material to be dehydrated and a discharge end for removal of the container of dehydrated material. The container has spur gear teeth extending along part or all of its outer circumferential surface, and is supported on a single roller, extending longitudinally along a length of the vacuum chamber, with spur gear teeth extending along part or all of its outer circumferential surface. The spur gear teeth of the roller mesh with the spur gear teeth of the container such that driving the rotation of the roller about its longitudinal axis rotates the container about its longitudinal axis. The apparatus includes means for reducing the pressure in the vacuum chamber, means for rotating the roller about its longitudinal axis, means for holding the rotating container on the roller, and means for moving the rotating container through the vacuum chamber along the roller from an input zone to a discharge zone. The apparatus also includes a microwave generator arranged for transmission of microwave radiation from the generator into the vacuum chamber.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another aspect of the invention provides a method for dehydrating an organic material. An organic material to be dehydrated is loaded into a container. The container is introduced into a vacuum chamber, the chamber being at a pressure less than atmospheric. The container is supported on a single roller within the vacuum chamber, with the spur gear teeth on the roller meshing with the spur gear teeth on the container. The container is rotated inside the vacuum chamber by the rotation of the roller through the engagement of the pairs of spur gear teeth. The rotating container is moved through the vacuum chamber while applying microwave radiation to dehydrate the organic materials. The container of dehydrated organic material is then removed from the vacuum chamber.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further aspects of the invention and features of specific embodiments of the invention are described below.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Exemplary embodiments are illustrated in referenced figures of the drawings.

The containers abut one another on the roller <b>42</b>, such that each downstream container is pushed by the adjacent upstream container.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The dehydrating apparatus <b>20</b> includes the components conventionally required for the operation of vacuum microwave driers. As illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a vacuum pump <b>98</b> is operatively connected through a condenser <b>100</b> and via a vacuum distributor <b>102</b> to vacuum ports in the vacuum chamber <b>22</b>. The condenser condenses water vapor produced during dehydration of the organic material. A refrigeration unit <b>104</b>, comprising a compressor, cooling fan and refrigerant pump, conveys refrigerant to the condenser <b>100</b> to maintain the condenser at a desired temperature. A water load system <b>106</b> may be provided in the vacuum chamber <b>22</b> to absorb excess microwave energy, by means of a water pump and conventional piping within the vacuum chamber. The dehydration apparatus <b>20</b> includes a programmable logic controller (PLC) <b>110</b>, programmed and connected to control the operation of the system, including controlling the drive motors <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> to rotate the roller <b>42</b>, the microwave generators <b>76</b>, the vacuum pump <b>98</b>, the refrigerant pump, the airlock doors <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>37</b>, and the pushing and pulling cylinders <b>64</b>, <b>66</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The dehydrating apparatus <b>20</b> operates according to the following method. The vacuum pump <b>98</b>, refrigerant pump, water pump, microwave generators <b>76</b> and the motors <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> to rotate the roller are actuated, all under the control of the PLC. The vacuum chamber <b>22</b> is brought to reduced pressure. Operating pressures may be in the range, for example, of about 30 to 300 Torr (3.9 to 39.9 kPa), or 0.1 to 30 Torr (0.13 to 4.0 kPa). A container <b>24</b> of organic material to be dehydrated is loaded into the loading module <b>30</b>, whose pressure is then equalized with the vacuum chamber <b>22</b>. The airlock door <b>34</b> lifted, and the container <b>24</b> is pushed by the piston <b>68</b> through the opening <b>90</b> of the end support frame <b>86</b> at the input end <b>26</b> into the vacuum chamber <b>22</b>, supported by and moving along the rotating roller <b>42</b>. The container <b>24</b> rotates about its longitudinal axis within the vacuum chamber <b>22</b> by engagement of the spur gear teeth <b>60</b> on its outer circumferential surface with the spur gear teeth <b>46</b> on the outer circumferential surface of the rotating roller <b>42</b>, tumbling the material in the container <b>24</b> as the material is being dehydrated. Longitudinally-extending guide members <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> hold the container <b>24</b> in position on the roller <b>42</b> as it moves along the length thereof. The spur gear teeth <b>46</b>, <b>60</b> mesh during the movement of the container <b>24</b> along the roller <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the illustrated example embodiment, the container <b>24</b> is loaded into the loading module <b>30</b> through airlock door <b>33</b>. The loading module <b>30</b> is sealed and its pressure equalized with the vacuum chamber <b>22</b>. Airlock door <b>34</b> is then opened, and actuation of the pushing cylinder <b>64</b> moves the piston <b>68</b> into the loading module <b>30</b>, pushing the container <b>24</b> from the loading module <b>30</b> into the vacuum chamber <b>22</b>. The airlock door <b>34</b> is then closed and the piston <b>68</b> is retracted. The second container is loaded in the same manner as the first container. Once the second container is in the loading module <b>30</b>, the airlock door <b>34</b> is opened, and the piston <b>68</b> pushes it onto the rotating roller <b>42</b>. This pushes the second container against the first container, displacing the first container farther down the vacuum chamber <b>22</b> towards the discharge end <b>28</b> by the length of one container. The process is repeated by loading additional containers in the same manner, each container displacing the previously-loaded ones in the vacuum chamber <b>22</b>. Once the first container is at or near the discharge end <b>28</b>, the airlock door <b>36</b> is opened, and the pulling cylinder <b>66</b> is actuated to move the piston <b>70</b> into the vacuum chamber <b>22</b> through the discharge end <b>28</b>, and pull the first container into the discharge module <b>32</b>. The airlock door <b>36</b> is then closed, and the piston <b>70</b> is retracted. The discharge module <b>32</b> is brought to atmospheric pressure and the first container is removed through airlock door <b>37</b>. The discharge module <b>32</b> is then sealed and its pressure equalized with the vacuum chamber <b>22</b>. The process is again repeated by removing additional containers from the vacuum chamber <b>22</b> in the same manner. The apparatus is operated on a continuous-throughput basis.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Throughout the foregoing description and the drawings, in which corresponding and like parts are identified by the same reference characters, specific details have been set forth in order to provide a more thorough understanding to persons skilled in the art.
