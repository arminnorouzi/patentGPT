However, such electricity generating systems are particularly expensive and theft-sensitive.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The document US 2007 163 256 is known, which describes an installation allowing reducing the pressure in a natural gas pipeline and comprising a flow rate converter and an electricity generator mechanically connected to said converter to transform the energy resulting from the pressure drop into electrical energy.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The document FR 3 045 726 is also known, which describes a device for extracting and recovering the expansion energy of a gas comprising a turbomachine including a freely rotating shaft to produce an expansion, said shaft being connected to an electric generator configured to convert the mechanical rotational energy produced by the turbomachine into electricity.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, such systems are particularly difficult to implement and particularly expensive. In addition, such systems are intrusive and generate pressure losses, a significant drop in temperature, as well as noise pollution. Their maintenance is also relatively a difficult maintenance,</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">There is therefore a need to supply electricity to the different systems of a fluid installation, in particular gas, in an autonomous, theft-insensitive manner, and without emitting CO2 and natural gas CH4 emissions.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention therefore relates to a fluid plant, in particular for a fluid installation, comprising an expansion system capable of converting the high-pressure fluid into low-pressure fluid.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The fluid plant can be a fluid delivery plant or another shutoff plant provided with an expansion system.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Moreover, the fluid can be any gas, preferably natural gas.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The fluid plant comprises an electricity generating system disposed in parallel with the expansion system and comprising a double-acting cylinder connected upstream of the expansion system and downstream of said expansion system and comprising two supply ports alternately supplied by the high-pressure fluid.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The electricity generating system further comprises a hydraulic system connected to said double-acting cylinder and configured to transform the mechanical translational energy of said cylinder into a mechanical rotational energy; and</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">an electric generator connected to the hydraulic system and configured to convert the mechanical rotational energy of the hydraulic system into electrical energy.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The term &#x201c;double-acting cylinder&#x201d; means a cylinder with two working directions.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Thus, the electricity generating system is strictly dependent on the pressure of the fluid, for example natural gas, and therefore does not release CO2 and natural gas CH4 into the atmosphere.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Thanks to the electricity generating system using only gas pressure, electricity of at least 30W, for example 100W, is generated without polluting the environment.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Advantageously, the fluid plant comprises an electronic control unit configured to supply fluid to the double-acting cylinder. Said electronic control unit being supplied with direct current by the electric generator.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The fluid plant preferably comprises an electrical energy accumulator, such as for example an electric battery, mounted downstream of the electric generator and configured to store the direct current from said generator. Thus, before the start of the electricity generating system, the electricity is transmitted by the energy accumulator which is then continuously recharged by the electric generator.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to one embodiment, the fluid plant comprises two three-way solenoid valves controlled by the electronic control unit to alternately supply high-pressure fluid to the two supply ports of the double-acting cylinder.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to another embodiment, the fluid plant comprises at least one multiway distribution valve movable between a position for supplying the double-acting cylinder with high-pressure fluid taken upstream of the expansion system and a position for injecting the low-pressure fluid exiting said cylinder downstream of the expansion system, said position of the distribution valve is controlled by the electronic control unit to alternately supply high-pressure fluid to the two supply ports of the double-acting cylinder.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to another embodiment, the fluid plant comprises two multiway distribution valves movable between a position for supplying the double-acting cylinder with high-pressure fluid taken upstream of the expansion system and a position for injecting the low-pressure fluid exiting said cylinder downstream of the expansion system. Said distribution valve positions are controlled by the electronic control unit to alternately supply high-pressure fluid to the two supply ports of the double-acting cylinder.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The distribution valves are, for example, of the 3/2 type.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">For example, the double-acting cylinder comprises a cylindrical cylinder casing delimiting an internal volume and a piston movable in translation in said casing and separating the internal volume into two isolated chambers, said piston being secured to a substantially rigid rod connected to the hydraulic system in order to transmit the mechanical energy of the piston to said hydraulic system.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Advantageously, the expansion system is configured to allow maintaining the pressure downstream of said system at a threshold value, for example less than or equal to 5 bars. The threshold value is defined so as to be sufficient to allow the expansion system to absorb possible overpressure.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">For example, the fluid plant comprises a metering device disposed downstream of the expansion system and upstream of a low-pressure fluid distribution network, said metering device being supplied with direct current by the electricity generating system.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">For example, the fluid plant comprises a high-pressure line connecting the expansion system to the transport network and a low-pressure line connecting the expansion system to the metering device.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The electricity generating system is connected to the high-pressure line, through which high-pressure fluid is taken to be injected into the double-acting cylinder, and to the low-pressure line, through which low-pressure fluid from the cylinder is injected into said low-pressure main line.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The fluid plant is for example a natural gas delivery plant.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to one second aspect, the invention relates to a natural gas installation comprising a high-pressure natural gas transport network, for example at a pressure in the range of 40 to 80 bars, a distribution network receiving a low-pressure natural gas, for example in the range of 4 to 15 bars, preferably less than 5 bars, and intended to supply industrial infrastructures, and at least one delivery plant as previously described connecting the transport network to the distribution network.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Other aims, features and advantages of the invention will appear on reading the following description, given solely by way of non-limiting example, and made with reference to the indexed drawings on which:</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically illustrates a gas installation comprising an electricity generating system according to one first embodiment of the invention;</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a detail view of an electricity generating system for a gas installation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> according to one second embodiment, in a first position;
