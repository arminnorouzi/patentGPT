Neurons are the building blocks of the nervous system. The loss or dysfunction of neurons in patients with neurodegenerative disease can affect body movement and brain function because neurons do not usually reproduce or replace themselves when they become damaged or die. Common neurodegenerative diseases include but are not limited to Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, Prion disease, motor neuron disease, spinocerebellar ataxia, and spinal muscular atrophy. The symptoms of advanced neurodegenerative diseases can be devastating, with patients losing their memory, control over their movements, and their personality.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The pathogenesis of these conditions remains unclear, making it difficult to find targets for new treatments. There are currently no cures for neurodegenerative diseases and treatments predominantly focus on treating the symptoms associated with the diseases. These treatments typically confer negative side effects to the patient that further deteriorate their quality of life. Recent clinical trials have shown some early promise of immunotherapy to slow disease progression; however, this therapy is both in early development and highly expensive.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recent studies suggest that the pathophysiology of some neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS and Parkinson's disease may be linked to the gastrointestinal tract. The gut microbiota is sometimes referred to as the second brain. It affects brain activity through the gut-microbiota-brain axis (Martin, et al., <i>Cell Mol Gastroenterol Hepatol, </i>6:133-148 (2018)). Gut microbes communicate to the central nervous system through nervous, endocrine, and immune signaling mechanisms. Several microbially derived molecules play an important role in nervous system modulation, namely short-chain fatty acids, secondary bile acids, and tryptophan metabolites. These molecules propagate signals primarily through interaction with intestinal epithelial cells such as enteroendocrine cells and enterochromaffin cells, and the mucosal immune system, but some cross the intestinal barrier, enter systemic circulation, and may cross the blood-brain barrier. Small intestinal dysbiosis and increased intestinal permeability are common in patients with some neurodegenerative diseases (Fang, X, <i>Int J Neurosci, </i>126:771-776 (2016)). Following intestinal epithelial barrier disruption, gut microbiota-derived products, such as LPS and other neurotoxins, can cross the intestinal barrier into the blood stream. LPS and other neurotoxins cause systemic inflammatory responses which are thought to play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, repairing or protecting the intestinal barrier, or neutralizing pathogens in circulation could prevent the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, it is an object of the invention to provide compositions and methods of treating and preventing the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Bacterial compositions and methods of their use for treating and preventing the progression of neurodegenerative diseases are provided herein.

Alzheimer's Disease</heading><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Alzheimer's disease is a progressive disorder that causes brain cells to degenerate and eventually die. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia&#x2014;a continuous decline in thinking, behavioral and social skills that disrupts a person's ability to function independently. Symptoms of Alzheimer's disease include but are not limited to memory loss, impairment in thinking and reasoning abilities, difficulty in making judgments and decisions, and changes in personality and behavior. While the exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is not fully understood, it is believed that the core problem is dysfunctionality in brain proteins which disrupt neuronal function and unleash a series of toxic events. The damage most often starts in the region of the brain that controls memory, but the process begins years before the first symptoms. The loss of neurons spreads in a somewhat predictable pattern to other regions of the brains. By the late stage of the disease, the brain has shrunk significantly. Beta-amyloid plaques and tau protein tangles are most often attributed with the bulk of the damage and dysfunctionality of neurons in Alzheimer's disease.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">One embodiment provides a method of treating Alzheimer's disease in a subject by administering a bacterial composition including at least one predatory bacteria to the subject in an amount effective to reduce systemic inflammation and protect motor neurons.

Prebiotic Compositions</heading><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some embodiments, the bacterial composition includes a prebiotic. Prebiotics are selectively fermented ingredients that stimulate the growth and/or activity of one or a limited number of bacteria in the gastrointestinal flora that confers benefits upon host well-being and health. Examples of prebiotics include but are not limited to inulin, arabinoxylan, xylose, soluble fiber dextran, soluble corn fiber, polydextrose, lactose, N-acetyl-lactosamine, glucose, galactose, fructose, rhamnose, mannose, uronic acids, 3&#x2032;-fucosyllactose, 3&#x2032;-sialylactose, 6&#x2032;-sialyllactose, lacto-N-neotetraose, 2&#x2032;-2&#x2032;-fucosyllactose, trans-galactooligosaccharides, glucooligosaccharides, isomaltooligosaccharides, lactosucrose, polydextrose, pectin, soybean oligosaccharides, and arabinose, cellobiose, fructose, fucose, galactose, glucose, lactose, lactulose, maltose, mannose, ribose, sucrose, trehalose, xylobiose, xylooligosaccharide, D-xylose, and xylitol.

Pharmaceutical Compositions</heading><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The disclosed bacterial compositions can be formulated as pharmaceutical compositions. The pharmaceutical compositions containing the bacterial compositions can be formulated for enteral administration including oral or rectal routes of administration. The disclosed bacterial compositions are typically administered to a subject in a therapeutically effective amount. As used herein the term &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; or &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; means a dosage sufficient to treat, inhibit, or alleviate one or more symptoms of the disorder being treated or to otherwise provide a desired pharmacologic and/or physiologic effect. The precise dosage will vary according to a variety of factors such as subject-dependent variables (e.g., age, immune system health, etc.), the disease, and the treatment being effected.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">For the disclosed bacterial compositions, as further studies are conducted, information will emerge regarding appropriate dosage levels for treatment of various conditions in various patients, and the ordinary skilled worker, considering the therapeutic context, age, and general health of the recipient, will be able to ascertain proper dosing. The selected dosage depends upon the desired therapeutic effect, on the route of administration, and on the duration of the treatment desired. For the disclosed bacterial compositions, the bacterial concentrations also depend on the type of bacterium. For the disclosed bacterial compositions, generally dosage levels of 10<sup>8</sup>-10<sup>12 </sup>CFU daily are administered to mammals.</p><heading id="h-0018" level="1">1. Formulations for Enteral Administration</heading><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Oral solid dosage forms are described generally in Remington Essentials of</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Pharmaceutics, 1st Ed. 2013 (Pharmaceutical Press, London) at Chapter 30. Solid dosage forms include tablets, capsules, pills, troches or lozenges, cachets, pellets, powders, or granules or incorporation of the material into particulate preparations of polymeric compounds such as polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, etc. or into liposomes. Such compositions may influence the physical state, stability, rate of in vivo release, and rate of in vivo clearance of the disclosed. See, e.g., Remington Essentials of Pharmaceutics, 1st Ed. 2013 (Pharmaceutical Press, London) Chapter 37 which are herein incorporated by reference. The compositions may be prepared in liquid form, or may be in dried powder (e.g., lyophilized) form. Liposomal or proteinoid encapsulation may be used to formulate the compositions. Liposomal encapsulation may be used and the liposomes may be derivatized with various polymers (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,108,863) In general, the formulation will include the bacterial composition and inert ingredients which protect peptide in the stomach environment, and release of the biologically active material in the intestine.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Another embodiment provides liquid dosage forms for oral administration, including pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, and syrups, which may contain other components including inert diluents; adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents; and sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Controlled release oral formulations are also provided. The bacterial compositions can be incorporated into an inert matrix which permits release by either diffusion or leaching mechanisms, e.g., gums. Slowly degenerating matrices may also be incorporated into the formulation. Another form of a controlled release is based on the The osmotic-controlled release oral delivery system (OROS&#x2122;) (Alza Corp.), i.e., the drug is enclosed in a semipermeable membrane which allows water to enter and push drug out through a single small opening due to osmotic effects.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">For a bacterial to successfully exert its benefit on the host's gut microbiota it should be able to remain viable during storage and also be capable of surviving, and potentially colonizing, the host's intestinal environment. Therefore, the bacterial composition should contain a concentration of live bacteria that is effective in causing benefits in the subject. Additionally, the capsule, pill, tablet, or syrup for oral administration should be stored in a manner so as to preserve its efficacy. Methods of storage include but are not limited to refrigeration, freezing, or storing at room temperature. If stored at room temperature, the bacterial should be stored in an air tight container.</p><heading id="h-0019" level="1">2. Targeted Delivery</heading><p id="p-0067" num="0066">For enteral formulations, the location of release may be the small intestine (the duodenum, the jejunum, or the ileum), or the large intestine. The contents will be delivered via a method that ensures proper transit and survival to the targeted portion of the GI tract, depending on the targeted disease or disorder. For example, any products designed to treat or prevent <i>Clostridium difficile </i>infection will be formulated in a colon-targeted capsule, such as DRcaps&#x2122; from Capsugel&#xae;. Probiotics exert their main effect in the intestinal tract so in some embodiments, the release will avoid the deleterious effects of the stomach environment, either by protection of the agent (or derivative) or by release of the agent (or derivative) beyond the stomach environment. To ensure full gastric resistance, a coating impermeable to at least pH 5.0 is essential. Examples of common inert ingredients that are used as enteric coatings are cellulose acetate trimellitate (CAT), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate (HPMCP), HPMCP 50, HPMCP 55, polyvinyl acetate phthalate (PVAP), Eudragit L30D&#x2122;, Aquateric&#x2122;, cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), Eudragit L&#x2122;, Eudragit S&#x2122;, and Shellac&#x2122;. These coatings may be used as mixed films.</p><heading id="h-0020" level="1">a. Delayed Release Formulation</heading><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Delayed release formulations can be created by coating a solid dosage form with a polymer film, which is insoluble in the acidic environment of the stomach, and soluble in the neutral environment of the small intestine.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The delayed release dosage units can be prepared, for example, by coating a drug or a drug-containing composition with a selected coating material. The drug-containing composition may be, e.g., a tablet for incorporation into a capsule, a tablet for use as an inner core in a &#x201c;coated core&#x201d; dosage form, or a plurality of drug-containing beads, particles or granules, for incorporation into either a tablet or capsule. Preferred coating materials include bioerodible, gradually hydrolyzable, gradually water-soluble, and/or enzymatically degradable polymers, and may be conventional &#x201c;enteric&#x201d; polymers. Enteric polymers, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, become soluble in the higher pH environment of the lower gastrointestinal tract or slowly erode as the dosage form passes through the gastrointestinal tract, while enzymatically degradable polymers are degraded by bacterial enzymes present in the lower gastrointestinal tract, particularly in the colon. Suitable coating materials for effecting delayed release include, but are not limited to, cellulosic polymers such as hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxymethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate succinate, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate, methylcellulose, ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate trimellitate and carboxymethylcellulose sodium; acrylic acid polymers and copolymers, preferably formed from acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate and/or ethyl methacrylate, and other methacrylic resins that are commercially available under the tradename Eudragit&#xae; (Rohm Pharma; Westerstadt, Germany), including Eudragit&#xae; L30D-55 and L100-55 (soluble at pH 5.5 and above), Eudragit&#xae; L-100 (soluble at pH 6.0 and above), Eudragit&#xae; S (soluble at pH 7.0 and above, as a result of a higher degree of esterification), and Eudragits&#xae; NE, RL and RS (water-insoluble polymers having different degrees of permeability and expandability); vinyl polymers and copolymers such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone, vinyl acetate, vinylacetate phthalate, vinylacetate crotonic acid copolymer, and ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer; enzymatically degradable polymers such as azo polymers, pectin, chitosan, amylose and guar gum; zein and shellac. Combinations of different coating materials may also be used. Multi-layer coatings using different polymers may also be applied.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The preferred coating weights for particular coating materials may be readily determined by those skilled in the art by evaluating individual release profiles for tablets, beads and granules prepared with different quantities of various coating materials. It is the combination of materials, method and form of application that produce the desired release characteristics, which one can determine only from the clinical studies.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The coating composition may include conventional additives, such as plasticizers, pigments, colorants, stabilizing agents, glidants, etc. A plasticizer is normally present to reduce the fragility of the coating, and will generally represent about 10 wt. % to 50 wt. % relative to the dry weight of the polymer. Examples of typical plasticizers include polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, triacetin, dimethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, dibutyl sebacate, triethyl citrate, tributyl citrate, triethyl acetyl citrate, castor oil and acetylated monoglycerides. A stabilizing agent is preferably used to stabilize particles in the dispersion. Typical stabilizing agents are nonionic emulsifiers such as sorbitan esters, polysorbates and polyvinylpyrrolidone. Glidants are recommended to reduce sticking effects during film formation and drying, and will generally represent approximately 25 wt. % to 100 wt. % of the polymer weight in the coating solution. One effective glidant is talc. Other glidants such as magnesium stearate and glycerol monostearates may also be used. Pigments such as titanium dioxide may also be used. Small quantities of an anti-foaming agent, such as a silicone (e.g., simethicone), may also be added to the coating composition.</p><heading id="h-0021" level="1">i. Time Controlled Capsules</heading><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In one embodiment, the bacterial compositions are formulated into time controlled capsules. The capsules may be manufactured using erodible capsule coating or specialized internal fillings so that the contents are released following transit of the capsule from the stomach to the upper or lower intestines. Time controlled release systems utilize measurements of gastric emptying and intestinal motility to ensure that the active ingredient stays protected until the capsule has cleared the stomach.</p><heading id="h-0022" level="1">ii. pH Controlled Capsules</heading><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In one embodiment, the bacterial compositions are formulated into pH controlled capsules. The pH in the stomach ranges from 1 to 2 during fasting but increases after eating. In the small intestine, the pH is around 6.5 in the proximal regions and increases to about 7.5 in the distal portions. From there, the pH declines significantly as intestinal contents reach the cecum and then the colon, pH 6.4 and 5.7 respectively. These pH differences between portions of the GI tract can be utilized for the formulation of encapsulations based on polymers that are insoluble in low pH environments (e.g., the stomach) and soluble in higher pH environments (e.g. the lower digestive tract) (Philip &#x26; Philip, <i>Oman Medical Journal, </i>25:79-87 (2003)).</p><heading id="h-0023" level="1">iii. Enzyme Controlled Capsules</heading><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some embodiments, the bacterial compositions are formulated into enzyme controlled capsules. Microbes that are specific to different portions of the GI tract are constantly fermenting the contents of their environment to generate the energy needed for their survival. Byproducts of the fermentation process include enzymes that can be specific to the microbe and the substance they are fermenting. As a result, capsules that will degrade only in the presence of site-specific enzymes can be designed (Philip &#x26; Philip, <i>Oman Medical Journal, </i>25:79-87 (2003)).</p><heading id="h-0024" level="1">IV. Co-Therapies</heading><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The disclosed bacterial compositions can be administered with a second therapeutic that is selected based on the subject's disease state. The second therapeutic can be a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. Current treatments for Alzheimer's disease include but are not limited to cholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine; memantine; antidepressants such as citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, and trazadone; anxiolytics such as lorazepam and oxazepam; and antipsychotics such as aripiprazole, clozapine, haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In another embodiment, the additional therapeutic agent can be a treatment for ALS. There are currently two FDA approved treatments for ALS, riluzole and edavarone. Both drugs have been shown to slow down the progression of ALS. In addition to riluzole and edavarone, subjects with ALS can also be treated with drugs that target a specific symptom of the disease. Exemplary drugs include but are not limited to drugs to reduce spasticity such as antispastics like baclofen, dantrolene, and diazepam; drugs to help control nerve pain such as amitriptyline, carbamazepine, duloxetine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, milnacipran, nortriptyline, pregabalin and venlafaxine; and drugs to help patients swallow such as trihexyphenidyl or amitriptyline.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In one embodiment, the additional therapeutic agent can be a treatment for Parkinson's disease. Current treatments for Parkinson's disease include but are not limited to carbidopa-levodopa; dopamine agonists such as pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine; MAO B inhibitors such as selegiline, rasagiline, and safinamide; catechol O-methyltransferase inhibitors such as entacapone and tolcapone; anticholinergics such as bentztropine and trihexyphenidyl; and amantadine.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The second therapeutic agent can be a treatment for Huntington's disease. Current treatments for Huntington's disease include but are not limited to tetrabenazine; antipsychotics such as haloperidol, chlorpromazine, risperidone, and quetiapine; amantadine; levetiracetam; clonazepam; antidepressants such as citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, and sertraline; and anticonvulsants such as valproate, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine.</p><heading id="h-0025" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><heading id="h-0026" level="1">Example 1. <i>Bdellovibrio </i>Decreased in Microbiome of ALS Patients</heading><heading id="h-0027" level="1">Materials and Methods</heading><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Stool samples and saliva samples were collected from 15 patients with Spinal onset ALS disease, 6 patients with Bulbar-onset ALS disease and 7 controls.
