The only way in nature in which these compounds are produced is by the cannabis plant. <i>Cannabis </i>is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cannabaceae, comprising the species <i>Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica, </i>and <i>Cannabis ruderalis </i>(sometimes considered as part of <i>Cannabis sativa</i>).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><i>Cannabis </i>plants comprise a highly complex mixture of compounds. At least 568 unique molecules have been identified. Among these compounds are cannabinoids, terpenoids, sugars, fatty acids, flavonoids, other hydrocarbons, nitrogenous compounds, and amino acids.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Cannabinoids exert their physiological effects through a variety of receptors including, but not limited to, adrenergic receptors, cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2), GPR55, GPR3, or GPR5. The principle cannabinoids present in <i>Cannabis </i>plants are cannabinoid acids &#x394;9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (&#x394;9-THCA) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) with small amounts of their respective neutral (decarboxylated) cannabinoids. In addition, <i>Cannabis </i>may contain lower levels of other minor cannabinoids. &#x201c;Chemical composition, pharmacological profiling, and complete physiological effects of these medicinal plants, and more importantly the extracts from <i>Cannabis</i>, remain to be fully understood.&#x201d; Lewis, M. M. et al., ACS Omega, 2, 6091-6103 (2017).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Crude extracts from <i>Cannabis </i>plants containing CBD have been used by patients suffering from diseases and disorders. However, such crude products are unsuitable for use in pharmaceutical formulations. Those seeking to prepare more consistent CBD preparations for use in treating diseases or disorders have made a concerted effort to either prepare CBD synthetically or attempt to remove all compounds other than CBD, particularly psychoactive compounds such as THC, from plant derived cannabinoids. See for example US 2014/0298511.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention encompasses the surprising discovery that a metabolite of CBD has therapeutic efficacy. This compound, 6-hydroxy cannabidiol (6-OH CBD) can be produced synthetically and may be used in a purified form.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Cannabinoids are a class of compounds which many of which can be derived naturally from the cannabis plant or produced synthetically via chemical synthesis.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">More than 100 different cannabinoids produced by <i>Cannabis </i>have been identified. These cannabinoids can be split into different groups as follows: phytocannabinoids; endocannabinoids and synthetic cannabinoids (which may be novel cannabinoids or synthetically produced versions of phytocannabinoids or endocannabinoids).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Phytocannabinoids are cannabinoids that originate from nature and can be found in the <i>Cannabis </i>plant. Phytocannabinoids can be isolated from plants to produce a highly purified extract. Phytocannabinoids may be obtained as either the neutral (decarboxylated form) or the carboxylic acid form depending on the method used to extract the cannabinoids from plant material. For example, it is known that heating the carboxylic acid form will cause most of the carboxylic acid form to decarboxylate into the neutral form. Phytocannabinoids can only be produced from plants, however versions of phytocannabinoids may be produced synthetically via chemical synthesis.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Endocannabinoids are endogenous lipid-based retrograde neurotransmitters that bind to cannabinoid receptors, and cannabinoid receptor proteins that are expressed throughout the mammalian central nervous system (including the brain) and peripheral nervous system. The endocannabinoid system is involved in regulating a variety of physiological and cognitive processes including fertility, pregnancy, during pre- and postnatal development, appetite, pain-sensation, mood, and memory, and in mediating the pharmacological effects of <i>Cannabis. </i></p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Synthetic cannabinoids are compounds that have a cannabinoid-like structure and are manufactured using chemical means rather than by the plant.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Certain cannabinoids are described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Cannabidiol (CBD) is a major cannabinoid constituent of <i>Cannabis </i>species, such as the hemp plant (<i>Cannabis sativa</i>). Unlike other cannabinoids, such as THC, cannabidiol does not bind CB1 or CB2, or its binding to the receptors is negligible in terms of inducing a pharmacological effect. Thus, cannabidiol does not cause the central or peripheral nervous system effects mediated by the CB1 or CB2 receptors. CBD has little or no psychotropic (cannabimimetic) activity and its molecular structure and properties are substantially different from those of other cannabinoids.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Cannabidiol administration has been the subject of research in an attempt to provide an alternative treatment for various diseases and disorders which may respond to such treatment.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">There have been many studies done in animals to determine the metabolism of CBD. The pharmacokinetics of CBD are complex, mainly due to a substantial first pass effect. This in turn causes the bioavailability of oral CBD to be poor in humans and other species.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The most abundant metabolites of CBD are hydroxylated 7-carboxy derivatives of CBD which include: 2&#x2033;-OH-7-COOOH,3&#x2033;,4&#x2033;,5&#x2033;-trinor CBD; CBD-glucuronide; 4&#x2033;-OH-7-COOH CBD; 2&#x2033;-OH-7-COOH CBD; 10-OH-7-COOH CBD; 3&#x2033;-OH-7-COOH CBD; 7-OH-3&#x2033;-COOH,4&#x2033;,5&#x2033;-dinor CBD; 7-COOH-8,9-dihydro-8,9-diOH CBD; 1&#x2033;-OH-7-COOH CBD; 6-OH-42-COOH,5&#x2033;-nor CBD; 6-OH-3&#x2033;-COOH,4&#x2033;,5&#x2033;-dinor CBD; 7-COOH CBD; 7-OH-4&#x2033;-COOH,5&#x2033;-nor CBD; 4&#x2033;-COOH,5&#x2033;-nor CBD; 7-OH CBD; 8,9-dihydro-7,8,9-triOH CBD; cannabinol; 3&#x2033;-COOH,4&#x2033;,5&#x2033;-dinor CBD; 2&#x2033;-COOH,3&#x2033;,4&#x2033;,5&#x2033;-trinor CBD; 2&#x2033;,6-diOH,3&#x2033;,4&#x2033;,5&#x2033;-trinor CBD6,7-diOH CBD; 7-OH-1&#x2033;-COOH,2&#x2033;,3&#x2033;,4&#x2033;,5&#x2033;-tetranor CBD; 6-OH CBD; 7-OH-5&#x2033;-COOH CBD; 1&#x2033;-COOH,2&#x2033;,3&#x2033;,4&#x2033;,5&#x2033;-tetranor CBD; 6-OH-1&#x2033;-COOH,2&#x2033;,3&#x2033;,4&#x2033;,5&#x2033;-tetranor CBD and 6-OH-5&#x2033;-COOH CBD (Ujvary and Hanus, 2016).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The U.S. Pat. No. 6,630,507 describes numerous analogues of cannabidiol. The compound 6-OH CBD is detailed in the document however there are no data presented to provide evidence that this compound may have any efficacy as a therapeutic agent.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis. THC is a partial agonist at the CB1 and CB2 receptors. Synthetic THC or dronabinol is approved for the treatment of loss of appetite in AIDS patients and nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Of the over 100 natural cannabinoids identified in <i>Cannabis sativa</i>, seven have been classified as CBD-type compounds, these cannabinoids have the same absolute configuration as CBD. These are: CBD, Cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), Cannabidivarin (CBDV), Cannabidivarin acid (CBDVA), Cannabidiol-C1 (CBD-C1), Cannabidiol-C4 (CBD-C4), Cannabidiol-C6 (CBD-C6) and Cannabidiol monomethyl ether (CBDM).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) is the main form in which CBD exists in the cannabis plant. It is converted into CBD after decarboxylation.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Cannabidivarin (CBDV) is a homolog of CBD, with the sidechain shortened by two methylene bridges. CBDV is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid and has been shown to have anti-convulsant activity in a mouse model of epilepsy.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Cannabidiol-C1 (CBD-C1) also known as cannabidiorcol is a homolog of CBD, with the sidechain shortened by four methylene bridges. CBD-C1 occurs naturally in plants producing CBD but has not been shown to have any therapeutic effects.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Cannabidiol-C4 (CBD-C4) also known as nor-cannabidiol is a homolog of CBD, with the sidechain shortened by one methylene bridge.
