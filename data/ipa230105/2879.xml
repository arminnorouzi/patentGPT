id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention concerns a crucible assembly for physical vapor deposition of a material layer on a surface, for example on an ophthalmic lens. The invention further concerns a method for physical vapor deposition using such kind of crucible assembly.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Layer deposition is a process applied in many industries to form coating so as to protect surfaces and/or to impart a variety of desired properties to said surfaces. For example, in optics, an antireflective or anti-reflection (AR) layer is a type of optical layer applied to the surface of lenses or other optical devices to reduce reflection.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Physical Vapor Deposition is a well-known process performed under vacuum in which a target consisting of a material is bombarded with an energy beam. The energy beam causes atoms from the target to transform into the gaseous phase. These atoms then precipitate into solid form, coating simultaneously the plurality of substrates in a vacuum container with a layer of the material.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Material to be vaporized is generally disposed in a material container, lodged in a cavity of a crucible. Said crucible is configured to cool the material container along with the material so as to dissipate the large amount of heat generated by the energy beam bombarding. In use, the material is bombarded with the energy beam to be vaporized and then deposited onto a surface. When a container has not enough material therein, the container is manually removed from the crucible by an operator, cleaned and filled with new material. This replacement operation entails significant costs, especially because the layer deposition machine has to be stopped during this operation. Furthermore, the replacement operation may be risky due to the high temperatures of the crucible and the container.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A problem that the invention aims to solve is to provide a crucible assembly for physical vapor deposition allowing to improve the efficiency of the process while making it safer for the operator.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To solve this problem, the invention provides a crucible assembly for physical vapor deposition on a surface comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">a base to support and drive in rotation a crucible around a rotational axis, the base comprising a base upper surface having a first alignment relief,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0008">a crucible comprising:        <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0009">at least one cavity for receiving a material to be vaporized by an electron beam gun on the surface, the at least one cavity being disposed at a peripheral area of the crucible with regard to the rotational axis,</li>            <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0010">a crucible bottom surface intended to contact the base upper surface of the base, the crucible bottom surface having a second alignment relief which is complementary shaped with regard to the first alignment relief so as to align both the base and the crucible with regard to the rotational axis when the crucible bottom surface contacts the base upper surface and the first and second alignment reliefs are brought one into the other, the second alignment relief being disposed at a central area of the crucible with regard to the rotation axis .</li>        </ul>        </li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0008" num="0011">Providing the crucible and the base with alignment reliefs that are disposed at a central area of the crucible near the rotational axis allows to increase the number of cavities that can be provided to the crucible for a same external dimension of the crucible.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0012">It has been observed that the maximum external dimension of the crucible (maximum diameter when the crucible is circular) available to provide the cavities depends on the location of the alignment reliefs. Indeed, cavities formed in the crucible generally have a depth which is close to the thickness of the crucible. Since an alignment relief may be at least partly formed as a depression, an alignment relief may prevent a cavity to be provided at the same position. For a given external diameter of the crucible, the maximum available diameter to provide the cavities is thus greater when the alignment reliefs are provided at the central area of the crucible compared to providing this alignment reliefs at a peripheral area.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0013">Hence, the crucible is arranged such that the peripheral area is free from alignment reliefs allowing to provide cavities at a greater distance from the rotational axis. Therefore, more cavities of a given diameter may be provided in a crucible with the alignment reliefs at the central area.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0014">A crucible with a greater number of cavities allows to load more material within the crucible. This reduces the number of replacement operations that have to be performed during the operation of the machine thereby allowing to improve the efficiency of the process. Furthermore, reducing the number of replacement operations allows to make the process less risky for the operator.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0015">Known crucibles generally comprise six to eight cavities whereas a crucible with ten cavities has been accomplished with alignment reliefs disposed at the central area of the crucible. This is particularly relevant with regard to new anti-reflective coating processes which require ten or more successive layers of material. A greater number of cavities allows to prevent the same material to be used several times and to thus improve the colorimetric stability of the coating, notably when the material is silica.</p><p

The crucible cover <b>52</b> is configured to cover all the cavities <b>24</b> which are not in a position in which the material therein is in a position to be bombarded by the electron beam gun. In other words, the crucible cover <b>52</b> is configured to make only one cavity reachable by the electron beam. Alternatively, the crucible cover <b>52</b> may be configured to make a plurality of cavities <b>24</b> reachable by the electron beam when a plurality of cavities <b>24</b> are provided along a same radius with regard to the rotational axis A.
