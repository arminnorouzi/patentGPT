The location of the vehicle may be tracked as it traverses between various bays/stations of the EOL testing location using, for example, location data from global navigation satellite system (GNSS) sensors. However, GNSS sensors may be inaccurate in a manufacturing environment and, more particularly, indoor manufacturing environments.

It should be understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals indicate like or corresponding parts and features.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present disclosure provides a method for determining a location of a vehicle using location tags that identify position coordinates and that are positioned throughout the manufacturing environment. As an example, when various conditions of the vehicle are satisfied (e.g., a key cycle transition condition, a vehicle gear transition condition, among other vehicle conditions), the vehicle obtains an image of the location tag and provides the image to a central computing system. In response to receiving the image, the central computing system compares the image to a previous image obtained by the vehicle to determine a location parameter of the vehicle, such as a location of the vehicle, or determining whether the vehicle has moved from a first location to a second location. Furthermore, the central computing system may determine a vehicle time period based on a timestamp associated with the image and timestamps associated with one or more previous images. The central computing system may selectively validate a manufacturing routine (e.g., an EOL testing routine) based on the location parameter and the vehicle time period. For example, the central computing system may validate that a given EOL testing routine is operating properly in response to the vehicle moving from a first location to a second location and the determined time vehicle time period between images captured at the first and second locations being less than a threshold value. As such, the central computing system can track and monitor the vehicle without GNSS sensors as it traverses, for example, various EOL testing stations to verify that the respective EOL testing routines are sufficiently being performed.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a manufacturing environment <b>5</b> is provided and generally includes vehicles <b>10</b>, predefined areas <b>20</b>, location tags <b>30</b>, and a central computing system <b>40</b>.

As used herein, the &#x201c;non-parked state&#x201d; refers to when the vehicle is not in the parked state (e.g., the vehicle <b>10</b> is moving and/or the vehicle <b>10</b> is set to drive, reverse, or neutral).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one form, the communication module <b>14</b> is configured to broadcast image data obtained by the image sensors <b>12</b> to the central computing system <b>40</b> when the key cycle transition condition and the vehicle gear transition condition are satisfied. As an example, the image data may include the image and a timestamp associated with the image. Accordingly, the communication module <b>14</b> may include various components for performing the operations described herein, such as, but not limited to, transceivers, routers, and/or input/output interface hardware.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one form, the central computing system <b>40</b> obtains the image data from the communication module <b>14</b> and determines a location parameter and a vehicle time period of the vehicle <b>10</b> based on the image and a previous image obtained by the respective image sensors <b>12</b> of the vehicle <b>10</b>. Furthermore, the central computing system <b>40</b> may validate a manufacturing routine of the vehicle <b>10</b> when the location parameter satisfies a location condition and when the vehicle time period satisfies a time condition. Further details regarding the validation of the manufacturing routine are provided below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

As an example, the decode module <b>52</b> employs known digital image recognition techniques to decode the 2D barcode, text, and/or images of the location tag <b>30</b> and therefore determine the position indicia of the location tag <b>30</b>. The decode module <b>52</b> then determines the predefined position coordinate of the location tag <b>30</b> based on the corresponding indicia-position coordinate entry from the position indicia database <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one form, the determination module <b>54</b> is configured to determine a location parameter of the vehicle <b>10</b> based on the predefined position coordinate of the location tag <b>30</b> detected in the image and a previous image obtained by the image sensors <b>12</b> and stored in the image database <b>90</b>.

As an example, the validation module <b>80</b> determines the location condition is satisfied when the location parameter indicates that the vehicle <b>10</b> has moved from a first location to a second location. As another example, the validation module <b>80</b> determines the location condition is satisfied when the vehicle <b>10</b> has moved to a predefined location. It should be understood that the location condition may be satisfied based on other criteria associated with the location parameter and is not limited to the examples described herein.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one form, the validation module <b>80</b> is configured to determine whether the vehicle time period satisfies a time condition. As an example, the validation module <b>80</b> determines the time condition is satisfied when the vehicle time period indicates that the difference between the timestamp (i.e., most recent timestamp) and a previous timestamp is less than a threshold value. It should be understood that the time condition may be satisfied based on other criteria associated with the vehicle time period and is not limited to the example described herein.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one form, the validation module <b>80</b> is configured to validate a manufacturing routine (e.g., an EOL testing routine) when the location parameter satisfies the location condition and the vehicle time period satisfies the time condition. As used herein, &#x201c;validating the manufacturing routine&#x201d; refers to determining that the manufacturing routine is being performed in accordance with acceptable and predefined tolerances, states, conditions, and/or values. As an example, validating the manufacturing routine may include determining that a production routine and/or inspection routine of the vehicle <b>10</b> is proper as a result of the vehicle <b>10</b> traversing the manufacturing environment <b>5</b> in accordance with predefined cycle times associated with the predefined areas <b>20</b>. As another example, validating the manufacturing routine may include determining that a vehicle diagnostic routine and/or EOL routine of the vehicle <b>10</b> is properly completed as a result of the vehicle <b>10</b> traversing the manufacturing environment <b>5</b> in accordance with a given time period associated with performing the vehicle diagnostic/EOL routines at the predefined areas <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one form, the validation module <b>80</b> is configured to validate the manufacturing routine when the operational parameter data module <b>70</b> determines that an operational parameter of the vehicle <b>10</b> satisfies an operation condition. In one form, the operation condition may include whether sensor data, diagnostic/EOL testing data, state data, and/or other data of the vehicle <b>10</b> corresponds to a predetermined value and/or state. As such, the operational parameter data module <b>70</b> may obtain various operational information from the vehicle subsystems <b>18</b> via the communication module <b>14</b> to determine whether the operational parameter satisfies the operation condition. As an example, the operational parameter data module <b>70</b> determines the operation condition is satisfied when the operational data indicates a diagnostic trouble code (DTC) of the vehicle <b>10</b> is remedied during an EOL testing routine that is performed at one of the predefined areas <b>20</b>. Accordingly, the validation module <b>80</b> may validate the manufacturing routine when the location parameter satisfies the location condition, the vehicle time period satisfies the time condition, and the operational parameter satisfies an operation condition.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one form, the central computing system <b>40</b> is configured to broadcast a command to a notification device <b>110</b> to output an alarm, an alert, and/or a notification based on the determination of the validation module <b>80</b>.
