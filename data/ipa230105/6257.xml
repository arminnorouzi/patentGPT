A non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes a wound electrode assembly <b>14</b> formed by winding a positive electrode <b>11</b> and a negative electrode <b>12</b> with a separator <b>13</b> interposed therebetween, a non-aqueous electrolyte solution, insulating plates <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> respectively disposed above and below the electrode assembly <b>14</b>, and a battery case <b>15</b> housing the above-described members.

Instead of the wound electrode assembly <b>14</b>, another form of electrode assembly such as a stacked electrode assembly in which a positive electrode and a negative electrode are alternately stacked with a separator interposed therebetween may be applied. Examples of the battery case <b>15</b> include metal exterior cans having a cylindrical shape, a rectangular shape, a coin shape, a button shape, or the like, and a pouch exterior body formed by laminating a resin sheet and a metal sheet.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The case body <b>16</b> is, for example, a bottomed cylindrical metal exterior can.

The case body <b>16</b> has, for example, a protruding portion <b>22</b> which supports the sealing assembly <b>17</b> and in which a part of a side surface portion extends inward.

The internal porosity of the graphite particle A may be 5% or less, but is preferably 1% to and more preferably 3% to 5%, from the viewpoint of suppressing the amount of swelling of the battery due to gas generation during high-temperature storage. The internal porosity of the graphite particle B may be 8% to 20%, but is preferably 10% to 18%, and more preferably 12% to 16%, from the viewpoint of suppressing the amount of swelling of the battery due to gas generation during high-temperature storage. Here, the internal porosity of the graphite particle is a two-dimensional value obtained from the ratio of the area of the internal void <b>34</b> of the graphite particle to the cross-sectional area of the graphite particle. The interval porosity of the graphite particle is determined by the following procedure.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Method for Measuring Internal Porosity</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029">(1) The cross section of the negative electrode active material layer is exposed. Examples of the method for exposing the cross section include a method in which a part of the negative electrode is cut out and processed by an ion milling apparatus (for example, IM 4000 PLUS, manufactured by Hitachi High-Tech Corporation) to expose the cross section of the negative electrode active material layer.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">(2) A reflected electron image of the cross section of the exposed negative electrode active material layer is taken using a scanning electron microscope. The magnification at the time of taking the reflected electron image is 3,000 times to 5,000 times.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">(3) The cross-sectional image obtained as described above is taken into a computer, and binarized using image analysis software (for example, ImageJ, manufactured by National Institutes of Health, USA.) to obtain a binarized image in which the particle cross section in the cross-sectional image is converted into black and voids present in the particle cross section are converted into white.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">(4) Graphite particles A and B having a particle size of 5 &#x3bc;m to 50 &#x3bc;m are selected from the binarized image, and the area of the cross section of the graphite particle and the area of internal voids present in the cross section of the graphite particle are calculated. Here, the area of the cross section of the graphite particle refers to the area of a region surrounded by the outer periphery of the graphite particle, that is, the area of the entire cross section portion of the graphite particle. In addition, for voids having a width of 3 &#x3bc;m or less among voids present in the cross section of the graphite particle, it may be difficult to determine whether the voids are internal voids or external voids in image analysis, and thus voids having a width of 3 &#x3bc;m or less may be considered to be internal voids. Then, the internal porosity of the graphite particle (the area of the internal voids of the cross section of the graphite particle&#xd7;100/the area of the cross section of the graphite particle) is calculated from the calculated area of the cross section of the graphite particle and area of the internal voids of the cross section of the graphite particle. The internal porosities of the graphite particles A and B are an average value of 10 graphite particles A and graphite particles B.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The graphite particles A and B are produced, for example, as follows.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Graphite Particles A Having Internal Porosity of 5% or Less</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0034">For example, coke (precursor) as a main raw material is pulverized into a predetermined size, the pulverized coke is aggregated with a binder, and then the coke is fired at a temperature of 2,600&#xb0; C. or higher to be graphitized and sieved to obtain graphite particles A having a desired size. Here, the internal porosity can be adjusted to 5% or less depending on the particle size of the precursor after pulverization, the particle size of the precursor in an aggregated state, and the like. The average particle size (volume-based median diameter D50) of the precursor after pulverization is preferably in the range of 12 &#x3bc;m to 20 &#x3bc;m, for example.

Then, the height of the central portion of the can bottom in the height direction of the battery based on the outer peripheral end portion of the can bottom of the case body was measured using a laser type displacement meter, and this was taken as the height of the central portion of the can bottom after storage.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Then, the amount of swelling of the battery was obtained by subtracting the height of the central portion of the can bottom before storage from the measured height of the central portion of the can bottom after storage, and summarized in Table 1. Here, the swelling of the battery is mainly caused by gas generation due to decomposition of the non-aqueous electrolyte solution during high-temperature storage. Therefore, as the amount of swelling of the battery obtained is small, gas generation during high-temperature storage is suppressed.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="98pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="77pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Mass ratio of graphite particles</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>A to graphite particles B</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Half region</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>Half region</entry><entry>on negative</entry><entry/><entry>Amount of</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>on outer</entry><entry>electrode current</entry><entry>Diisocyanate</entry><entry>swelling</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>surface side</entry><entry>collector side</entry><entry>compound</entry><entry>of battery</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Example 1</entry><entry>A:B = 40:55</entry><entry>A:B = 0:100</entry><entry>Present</entry><entry>0.029 mm</entry></row><row><entry>Comparative</entry><entry>A:B = 0:100</entry><entry>A:B = 0:100</entry><entry>Absent</entry><entry>0.042 mm</entry></row><row><entry>Example 1</entry></row><row><entry>Comparative</entry><entry>A:B = 0:100</entry><entry>A:B = 0:100</entry><entry>Present</entry><entry>0.040 mm</entry></row><row><entry>Example 2</entry></row><row><entry>Comparative</entry><entry>A:B = 40:55</entry><entry>A:B = 0:100</entry><entry>Absent</entry><entry>0.038 mm</entry></row><row><entry>Example 3</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0082" num="0080">As can be seen from Table 1, the amount of swelling of the battery of Example 1 was smaller than those of Comparative Examples 1 to 3.
