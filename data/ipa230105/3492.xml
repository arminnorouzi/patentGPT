id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">Various embodiments generally relate to an eco-friendly smart indoor live ammunition shooting range facility system, and more particularly, to an eco-friendly smart indoor live ammunition shooting range facility system capable of quickly and reliably discharging a harmful substance containing a heavy metal, such as lead (lead fume) and copper, generated due to live ammunition shooting, realizing various shooting training situations by providing a smart target different from an existing simple fixed type target, and forming an eco-friendly live ammunition shooting range by recovering an original bullet head as it is in a beaten zone.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Due to the nature of their works, military units or police stations that handle firearms such as rifles and pistols have been continuously conducting shooting training for these individual firearms in order to cultivate shooting ability required in case of emergency and maintain combat power.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Shooting training using these individual firearms is mainly conducted at indoor or outdoor zero point shooting ranges and real shooting ranges. Since there is a problem in that heavy metals contained in bullet heads fired at such live ammunition shooting ranges seriously pollute the surrounding environment, there exist considerable difficulties in disposing of the bullet heads. In other words, a bullet head fired from a firearm collides with the iron plate of a shooting range to generate lead fume and dust, and as the fine powders thereof are scattered into the air, there arises a problem in that air pollution occurs severely.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Actually, in an indoor live ammunition shooting range operated by the military, bullet heads fired from firearms such as pistols and rifles collide with the iron plate of a beaten zone or walls and facilities near the beaten zone to generate loud noise and dust. In particular, there arise various problems such as polluting the indoor air as heavy metal components scatter from the bullet heads crushed due to the collision.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the case of an indoor shooting range, waste tires or tire chips are placed behind a target to absorb the impact of bullet heads. However, since heavy metal components such as lead and cadmium contained in the waste tires are scattered as dust into the air due to collision with the bullet heads, there is caused a disadvantage of further increasing indoor air pollution, and as a result, it came to the point that the operation of indoor live ammunition shooting ranges for military units and police stations is stopped.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, as such, as, in the indoor shooting range, the bullet heads of live ammunitions hit the iron plate of the beaten zone or a surrounding concrete barrier or facility and are broken and scattered, a problem is caused in that heavy metal components such as lead contained in the bullet heads are accumulated in the air and soil as they are, thereby polluting the qualities of the air, soil and water. According to a recent investigation, there is a case where lead component has been detected up to <b>1200</b> times a standard value in the soil near a live ammunition shooting range of a military unit.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In particular, there is a problem in that exhaust gas generated from a barrel at a shooting lane where a shooter is positioned directly exerts an influence on the shooter.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, in order to solve the above problems and quickly normalize the operation of indoor shooting ranges installed in military units and police training centers, it should be possible to prevent the pollution of air by heavy metals due to shooting of live ammunitions.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the meantime, a conventional live ammunition shooting range has a disadvantage in that an operation of replacing a target is cumbersome because a shooting target device should replace the target every time a shooting trainee is changed.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, in the conventional art, in a process in which a shooting trainee performs shooting, in the case of long-distance shooting, it is difficult to clearly check with the naked eye which part of a target is penetrated by a fired bullet head. Therefore, a problem is caused in that the quality of actual shooting training is greatly reduced because measures such as correcting a shooting posture or correcting the gunsight of a gun cannot be taken during shooting even when, for example, a bullet head greatly deviates from a target or does not hit an intended part of a target.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Various embodiments are directed to an eco-friendly smart indoor live ammunition shooting range facility system capable of

situations by providing a smart target different from an existing simple fixed type target, and forming an eco-friendly live ammunition shooting range by recovering an original bullet head as it is in a beaten zone.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Objectives to be achieved by the present disclosure are not limited to those described above, and other objectives which are not described above may be clearly understood by those skilled in the art through the following description.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an embodiment, an indoor live ammunition shooting range facility system may include: a ventilation facility installed in an indoor live ammunition shooting range, and configured to ventilate air of the indoor live ammunition shooting range; a targeting device facility installed in the indoor live ammunition shooting range, and configured to provide a shooting target; a bulletproof facility installed to protect components

Effects</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The eco-friendly smart indoor live ammunition shooting range facility system according to the present disclosure provides the following effects.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">First, the present disclosure provides an effect that a harmful substance containing a heavy metal, such as lead (lead fume) and copper, generated in a live ammunition shooting range due to the use of a live ammunition may be efficiently and reliably discharged in conformity with the environment according to the live ammunition shooting range.</p><p id="p-0017"
