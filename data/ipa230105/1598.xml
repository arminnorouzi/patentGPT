In recent times, during the late 19<sup>th </sup>century, an art reform &#x26; social movement led by skilled tradesmen was slowly starting to be recognized by many people across America, Canada, Great Britain and Australia. This movement has often been referred to as the &#x201c;arts-and-crafts movement.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The so-called arts-and-crafts movement that began many years ago has continued to evolve today by many persons that may not necessarily be skilled in a particular trade. As such, it may be said that non-skilled persons may be involved in the arts-and-crafts as a social activity or hobby. In some circumstances, the activity or hobby may be practiced for any number of reasons ranging from, for example: economic gain, gifting, or simply to pass time while finding a sense of personal fulfillment, achievement, satisfaction, and expression.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">With advances in modern technology, the &#x201c;arts-and-Crafts Movement&#x201d; that began many years ago is susceptible to further advancements that may enhance or improve, for example, the way a skilled or non-skilled person may contribute to arts-and-crafts. Therefore, a need exists for the development of improved components, devices and the like that advance the art.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">One category of devices being developed and improved are electronic cutting machines, which may also be referred to as vinyl cutters, X-Y plotter cutters, or simply cutters in general. Currently available electronic cutting machines of the prior art fall short in a number of aspects affecting user experience and enjoyment.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, cutting machines of the prior art are typically configured to cut only a limited amount of material at a time. Most home-use cutting machines have a limited working area and require the use of relatively rigid cutting mats. Typically, a material to be cut is placed on the cutting mat and the mat is fed into the machine. The machine manipulates the cutting mat, rather than the material itself, and a tool, such as a cutting blade, impinges downward onto the material. In these machines, the cutting blade may cut through the material while the tougher cutting mat prevents the blade from penetrating the mat itself.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Cutting mats are typically more rigid and thicker than materials being cut, such as vinyl, iron-on materials, fabric, and paper/cardstock, and are thus easier to keep aligned while moving back and forth through the cutting machine during a project. When a user wants to cut a material, such as vinyl, the user puts the vinyl onto the cutting mat and then loads the mat into the cutting machine. The machine aligns the cutting mat, and thus the vinyl on the cutting mat, when cutting the vinyl during use.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, cutting mats are inherently limited in length because they are typically too thick and rigid to roll-up for shipping or storage, thus taking up too much space. Cutting mats are also more expensive than vinyl and paper materials being cut, due to the more robust construction and materials of the cutting mats. Thus, it is cost prohibitive to make and sell lengthy cutting mats.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">There are materials, such as vinyl or paper materials, which include backer layers that enable matless cutting within some electronic cutting machines. However, these materials are thinner and more flexible by nature, so a user repeatedly pauses the machine, releases the material, realigns the material by hand, and re-secures the material prior to cutting.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, there are a number of disadvantages in the art that can be addressed.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">This section provides a general summary of the disclosure, and is not a comprehensive disclosure of its full scope or all of its features.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Embodiments of the present disclosure relate generally to electronic cutting systems, methods, and apparatus.

level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The present disclosure relates generally to electronic cutting systems, methods, and apparatus. In particular, the present disclosure relates to matless cutting machines and provides technical solutions to a number of technical problems in the art discussed above.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">For example, in one aspect of the matless cutting machines disclosed herein, the machines are configured to receive a material to be cut and to feed that material back and forth through the cutting machine without placing the material on a cutting mat.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In addition, in one aspect of the cutting machines disclosed herein, the cutting machines automatically align the material being cut without the user manually releasing the material and aligning or realigning the material before and/or during a project. Again, the disclosed cutting machines may do so without the use of more rigid cutting mats.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Because cutting machines of the present disclosure do not require cutting mats, one aspect of the cutting machines described herein allow for an unlimited length of material to be cut. That is, because the cutting machines described herein do not require the use of cutting mats, the cutting machines are not restricted to cutting only the area provided by a cutting mat. Rather, matless materials of theoretically indefinite length can be fed into the cutting machines and continuously cut while maintaining automatic alignment throughout the project.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In general, there are four categories of features of cutting machines and materials used with matless cutting machines, as disclosed herein, that enable effective, easy-to-use, automatic alignment of an unlimited length of material without the use of cutting mats. These features allow an unlimited length of material to be fed into a self-aligning cutting machine without the need for cutting mats or manual alignment of material being cut by the user. These four general categories of features include: 1) physical material alignment features of cutting machines; 2) materials and geometries of certain roller system components, including upper and lower rollers, within cutting machines; 3) roller system pinch pressures; and 4) matless material construction and configuration. There are also other categories of features beyond these four listed, as disclosed herein, that enhance the functionality and user interface experience with matless cutting machines.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">One will appreciate, from the present disclosure, that any of the four categories of matless cutting features noted above and further described below may be employed individually, collectively, or in combination with any one or more other category of features, to enhance the matless cutting capabilities of an electronic cutting machine. As such, while some features may be described individually herein, any of the disclosed features and embodiments of matless cutting machines described may be combined with one or more other features or embodiments.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Example configurations will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings. Example configurations are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough, and will fully convey the scope of the disclosure to those of ordinary skill in the art. Specific details are set forth such as examples of specific components, devices, and methods, to provide a thorough understanding of configurations of the present disclosure. It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that specific details need not be employed, that example configurations may be embodied in many different forms, and that the specific details and the example configurations should not be construed to limit the scope of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref>, implementations of the present disclosure relate generally to an exemplary &#x201c;matless&#x201d; cutting machine <b>10</b>, components thereof, and methods of use. Although the term &#x201c;matless&#x201d; infers that the cutting machine <b>10</b> may operate without conventional cutting mats, which are very rigid, the cutting machine <b>10</b> is uniquely configured to operate with a non-conventional workpiece support material that is a component of a non-conventional workpiece (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A, <b>8</b>B, <b>9</b>, and <b>10</b></figref> illustrating a workpiece <b>36</b> including an upper layer <b>38</b> defining a workpiece material and a lower layer <b>40</b> defining a workpiece support material) that is non-rigid, flexible, rollable, or the like. Accordingly, the term &#x201c;matless&#x201d; can be construed to mean and be defined as including the workpiece support material layer <b>40</b> that is non-rigid, flexible, rollable, or the like. In other instances, the term &#x201c;matless&#x201d; should be construed to mean and be defined as a workpiece support material layer <b>40</b> that is &#x201c;consumable&#x201d; in the context that the workpiece <b>36</b> (that also includes the workpiece material layer <b>38</b> that is removably-secured to the workpiece support material layer <b>40</b>) may be deformed (e.g., cut C as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>A</figref>) after being interfaced with the cutting machine <b>10</b>. Accordingly, as seen at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b> and <b>17</b>A</figref>, after the workpiece material <b>38</b> is cut C, a first portion <b>381</b> of the workpiece material layer <b>38</b> may be subsequently removed from the workpiece support material layer <b>40</b> while a second portion <b>382</b> of the workpiece material layer <b>38</b> remains removably-secured to the workpiece support material layer <b>40</b>. As such, the workpiece support material layer <b>40</b> that forms a portion of the workpiece <b>36</b> may be configured for single use and disposal thereafter.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">As seen at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> the cutting machine <b>10</b> includes an outer housing <b>12</b> and a door <b>14</b>. The door <b>14</b> is may be arranged in an open configuration to allow material to be inserted into the cutting machine <b>10</b>. The door <b>14</b> may be selectively opened and closed via a hinge mechanism where door <b>14</b> connects to the outer housing <b>12</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref>, the door <b>14</b> is shown arranged in an open configuration in order to illustrate a plurality of internal cutting components of the cutting machine <b>10</b>. The plurality of internal cutting components may include, but are not limited to, a carriage <b>16</b>, a roller assembly <b>18</b>, and other components that will be described in more detail below with reference to other figures.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">When the door <b>14</b> is arranged in an open configuration, the workpiece <b>36</b>, which is fed into cutting machine <b>10</b>, may be at least partially supported on a working surface <b>22</b> of the cutting machine <b>10</b>. The combination of the workpiece material layer <b>38</b> and the workpiece support material layer <b>40</b> is hereinafter collectively referred to as a workpiece <b>36</b>. Thereafter, a tool <b>20</b> (e.g., a cutting blade) is configured to impinge into the workpiece <b>36</b> (see, e.g., the workpiece material layer <b>38</b> of the workpiece <b>36</b> at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A, <b>8</b>B, <b>9</b>, and <b>10</b></figref>). In some instances, an upwardly-facing surface of the door <b>14</b> (when arranged in an open configuration) may also at least partially define a portion of the working surface <b>22</b> that supports the workpiece <b>36</b> that is fed into and through the cutting machine <b>10</b>. In this regard, in some implementations, the upper surface of the door <b>14</b> is substantially parallel (e.g., +/&#x2212;10 degrees) to the working surface <b>22</b>. In some implementations, the upper surface of the door <b>14</b> is substantially coplanar with the working surface <b>22</b>. Additionally, or alternatively, in at least one embodiment, the cutting machine <b>10</b> may not include a door, but, rather, the working surface <b>22</b> may be otherwise extendable (e.g., in a telescoping arrangement) in order to increase the surface area of working surface <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">As the workpiece <b>36</b> is fed forward-and-backward by the roller assembly <b>18</b>, the carriage <b>16</b> manipulates the tool <b>20</b> for selectively impinging downwardly onto the workpiece material layer <b>38</b> of the workpiece <b>36</b>. The carriage <b>16</b> can also move back-and-forth across the workpiece <b>36</b> in order to form cuts in any region of the workpiece material layer <b>38</b>. Although the Figures illustrate the tool <b>20</b> including a cutting blade, the tool <b>20</b> being defined by a cutting blade is for exemplary purposes only, and, as such, one skilled in the art will appreciate that other tools (e.g., a scoring tool, an ink pen, or the like) may alternatively be secured and manipulated by the carriage <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The roller assembly <b>18</b> is said to move the workpiece <b>36</b> forward-and-backward in a Y-direction as the carriage <b>16</b> moves back-and-forth in an X-direction, as indicated by a reference coordinate system seen at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. As noted above, the carriage <b>16</b> houses the tool <b>20</b>; the tool <b>20</b> can be manipulated up-and-down vertically (i.e., a Z-direction) relative to the workpiece <b>36</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">A rear, top, left perspective view of cutting machine <b>10</b> is seen at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>; in this view, a rear side of the outer housing <b>12</b> forms a pass-through slot <b>24</b> that allows the workpiece <b>36</b> to pass through cutting machine <b>10</b> without limiting the length of workpiece <b>36</b> being interfaced with the cutting machine <b>10</b>. During operation, the workpiece <b>36</b> may pass into and out of the pass-through slot <b>24</b> as needed depending on, for example, one or both of: (1) the length of workpiece <b>36</b>; and (2) the pattern being cut into the workpiece material layer <b>38</b>. Thus, exemplary embodiments of the cutting machine <b>10</b> described here may include internal cutting components and other operating components such as, for example, motors, gears, belts, and other electronics, arranged so as to not interfere with the workpiece <b>36</b> passing all the way through the cutting machine <b>10</b> and through pass-through slot <b>24</b> during use.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a close-up view of an exemplary implementation of the matless cutting machine with the door <b>14</b> arranged in an open configuration whereby a first pair of workpiece guides <b>26</b> are shown extending away from the upwardly-facing surface of the door <b>14</b>. In some instances, the first pair of workpiece guides <b>26</b> may define upwardly extending walls oriented longitudinally in the Y-direction. Furthermore, the first pair of workpiece guides <b>26</b> may vary in height, length, and shape, so long as the first pair of workpiece guides <b>26</b> do not interfere with other components of the cutting machine <b>10</b> when the door <b>14</b> is arranged in either of the open configuration or the closed configuration.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Yet even further, the lateral distance in the X-direction between the first pair of workpiece guides <b>26</b> is not limited to the arrangement seen at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Accordingly, the first pair of workpiece guides <b>26</b> may be fixedly configured in a number of predetermined lateral distances or dynamically selectively spaced apart to a desired lateral distance in order to accommodate a variety materials having different widths that may be interfaced with the cutting machine <b>10</b> by being arranged over or upon the working surface <b>22</b>. As will be described in the following disclosure at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A, <b>8</b>B, <b>9</b>, and <b>10</b></figref>, various embodiments of workpiece support material layers <b>40</b> defining the workpiece <b>36</b> may be fed into the cutting machine <b>10</b> may be constrained laterally in the X-direction by the first pair of workpiece guides <b>26</b> as the roller assembly <b>18</b> feeds the workpiece <b>36</b> forward-and-backward in the Y-direction.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In addition to the first pair of workpiece guides <b>26</b> that are disposed on or extend away from the inner surface of the door <b>14</b>, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the cutting machine <b>10</b> may also include one or both of an optional second pair of workpiece guides <b>28</b> and an optional third pair of workpiece guides <b>30</b>. Each of the second pair of workpiece guides <b>28</b> and the third pair of workpiece guides <b>30</b> do not extend from or are disposed on the inner surface of the door <b>14</b>, but, rather, are disposed on or extend from the working surface <b>22</b> of the cutting machine <b>10</b> and may be spaced apart at a lateral distance in the X-direction in a substantially similar manner as that of the first pair of workpiece guides <b>26</b>. The view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> represents an exemplary close-up view of only one side of working surface <b>22</b> for illustrative purposes with various guide bars and belts of cutting machine <b>10</b> being removed in order to show an unobstructed view of the first, second, and third pairs of workpiece guides <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">As shown, the second pair of workpiece guides <b>28</b> and the third pair of workpiece guides <b>30</b> are aligned longitudinally in the Y-direction with the first pair of workpiece guides <b>26</b> in order to accommodate the same width of a workpiece <b>36</b> that is fed into cutting machine <b>10</b>. Each of the first paid of workpiece guides <b>26</b>, the second set of workpiece guides <b>28</b>, and the third set of workpiece guides <b>30</b> prevent a workpiece <b>36</b> from being fed into the cutting machine <b>10</b> from travelling too much laterally in the X-direction as the workpiece <b>36</b> is fed through cutting machine <b>10</b> forward-and-backward in the Y-direction by the roller assembly <b>18</b>. In effect, the first pair of workpiece guides <b>26</b>, the second paid of workpiece guides <b>28</b>, and the third pair of workpiece guides <b>30</b> act as bumpers that contact the side edges of the workpiece <b>36</b> that are arranged upon or over the working surface <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Accordingly, if a user (not shown) feeds the workpiece <b>36</b> into the cutting machine <b>10</b> in a misaligned orientation longitudinally in the Y-direction (or, furthermore, in some instances in a further rotated/skewed direction about the Z-axis), the first pair of workpiece guides <b>26</b>, the second pair of workpiece guides <b>28</b>, and the third pair of workpiece guides <b>30</b> push against the side edges of the workpiece <b>36</b> in order to align the workpiece <b>36</b> as it is fed into cutting machine <b>10</b> through the roller assembly <b>18</b>. Yet even further, if the workpiece <b>36</b> becomes misaligned during an ongoing project or during a cutting procedure, either due to the cutting machine <b>10</b> getting bumped or by way of the application of an external force that may knock or jar the workpiece <b>36</b> out of alignment, one or more of the first pair of workpiece guides <b>26</b>, the second pair of workpiece guides <b>28</b>, and the third pair of workpiece guides <b>30</b> protect the workpiece <b>36</b> from becoming misaligned, and, as a result, function in a manner that will automatically guide the workpiece <b>36</b> back into alignment. Accordingly, one or more of the first pair of workpiece guides <b>26</b>, the second pair of workpiece guides <b>28</b>, and the third pair of workpiece guides <b>30</b> automatically align and maintain alignment of the workpiece <b>36</b> that is fed into the cutting machine <b>10</b> during the initial feeding of the workpiece <b>36</b> into the cutting machine <b>10</b> that may occur, for example, during ongoing projects or during a cutting operation. As such, the function of automatic alignment of a workpiece <b>36</b> is effective without the user manually noticing a misalignment of the workpiece <b>36</b> and thereafter manually adjusting or successively readjusting the workpiece <b>36</b> before use of the cutting machine <b>10</b> or during use of the matless cutting machine.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">To further illustrate an exemplary implementation of how the first pair of workpiece guides <b>26</b>, the optional second pair of workpiece guides <b>28</b>, and the optional third pair of workpiece guides <b>30</b> work in concert in order to align the workpiece <b>36</b> fed into the cutting machine <b>10</b>, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a top view of an exemplary implementation of the cutting machine <b>10</b> is shown. As seen at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the first pair of workpiece guides <b>26</b> are disposed or arranged forwardly of or upstream of the tool <b>20</b>, whereas the third pair of workpiece guides <b>30</b> are disposed or arranged rearwardly of or downstream of the tool <b>20</b>, while the second pair of workpiece guides <b>28</b> are arranged between or intermediately (or generally at or near the position of the tool <b>20</b> in the Y-direction) with respect to both of the first pair of workpiece guides <b>26</b> and the third pair of workpiece guides <b>30</b>. Other exemplary implementations of the cutting machine <b>10</b> may include more than or less than the three workpiece guides <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> that are shown in the exemplary implementation of the cutting machine <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>; furthermore, each set of the three workpiece guides <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> may be disposed or arranged at other positions, either closer to one another or further apart than that shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Functionally, the first pair of workpiece guides <b>26</b>, the optional second pair of workpiece guides <b>28</b>, and the optional third pair of workpiece guides <b>30</b> effectively contribute to automatic alignment of the workpiece <b>36</b> (that is non-rigid, flexible, rollable, or the like) as a result of the workpiece <b>36</b> not being defined to have a rigid quality like conventional workpiece support mats. Accordingly, the first, second, and third pairs of workpiece guides <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> are sufficiently spaced far enough longitudinally (in the Y-direction) with respect to a predetermined width of the workpiece <b>36</b> that is to be guided through the cutting machine <b>10</b>. For example, a length L (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), is the longitudinal moment arm provided by one or more of the first, second, and third pairs of workpiece guides <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> for rotating/realigning a width W (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) of the workpiece <b>36</b> being fed through the cutting machine <b>10</b>. The longer the moment arm (i.e., the length L of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) provided, the automatic alignment and realignment of the workpiece <b>36</b> will be more effective. However, the longitudinal distance in the Y-direction that is available for one or more of the first, second, and third pairs of workpiece guides <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> is limited by the size of cutting machine <b>10</b>. In one aspect, as noted above, an exemplary arrangement of the first pair of workpiece guides <b>26</b> disposed on the upper surface of the door <b>14</b> or extendable working surface <b>22</b> as described herein increases the available moment arm of one or more of the first, second, and third pairs of workpiece guides <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> extending longitudinally in the Y-direction.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Along these lines, in some configurations, in order to achieve the function of automatic alignment of a workpiece <b>36</b> as noted above, in one or more embodiments, the total length L along which one, some, or all of the first, second, and third pairs of workpiece guides <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> extend longitudinally on the working surface <b>22</b> may be at least about 30% of the width W between one, some, or all of the first, second, and third pairs of workpiece guides <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> (or the approximate width W of the workpiece material layer <b>38</b> that is to be cut while being supported by the workpiece support material layer <b>40</b>). In some configurations, the total length L along which some, or all of the first, second, and third pairs of workpiece guides <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> extend longitudinally on the working surface <b>22</b> is at least about 40% or at least about 50% of the width W between one, some, or all of the first, second, and third pairs of workpiece guides <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>. In other configurations, the total length L along which one, some, or all of the first, second, and third pairs of workpiece guides <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> extend longitudinally on the working surface <b>22</b> is at least about 55% of the width W between one, some, or all of the first, second, and third pairs of workpiece guides <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>. In yet other configurations, the total length L of one, some, or all of the first, second, and third pairs of workpiece guides <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> that is/are disposed longitudinally on the working surface <b>22</b> is at least about 60% of the width W between one, some, or all of the first, second, and third pairs of workpiece guides <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Furthermore, in some configurations, one, some, or all of the first, second, and third pairs of workpiece guides <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> may be one, or a combination, of removable, retractable, and movable in order to accommodate situations when one or both of the workpiece material layer <b>38</b> and the workpiece support material layer <b>40</b> is/are wider than the width W such that the workpiece <b>36</b> can be fed into the cutting machine <b>10</b>. Such exemplary configurations enable the cutting machine <b>10</b> to be compatible with other non-standard dimensions of workpieces <b>36</b> and cutting mats, or, for example, when automatic alignment is not utilized and also to guide workpieces <b>36</b> defined by any number of widths.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a portion of the exemplary roller system <b>18</b> of the cutting machine <b>10</b> is shown. The roller assembly <b>18</b> is configured to feed the workpiece <b>36</b> backward-and-forward in the Y-direction through the cutting machine <b>10</b>. In some instances, the roller assembly <b>18</b> includes upper roller <b>32</b> and lower roller <b>34</b>, which are biased towards each other by a spring or other biasing mechanism (not shown). The upper roller <b>32</b> may be rigidly secured to an upper roller bar <b>35</b>, and the lower roller <b>34</b> may be rigidly secured to a lower roller bar (not shown). Alternatively, one or both of the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> may not be respectively fixed to a roller bar but otherwise fixed relative to one another as shown. As seen at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, in some configurations, the lower roller <b>34</b> may be driven by a motor (not shown) while the upper roller <b>32</b> is passive (i.e., the upper roller is not driven by a motor). However, in one or more embodiments, the upper roller <b>32</b> or both of the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> may be actively driven by a motor (not shown). In embodiments where only one of the upper roller <b>32</b> or the lower roller <b>34</b> is actively driven by, for example, a motor, the other of the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> is rotated due to the biasing of the upper roll <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> together. In some configurations, the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> are biased together with a large enough force to grip and actuate the workpiece <b>36</b> passing between the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> without slipping but with a small enough force to allow the workpiece <b>36</b> to pass there-between after being loaded into the cutting machine <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The material(s) and geometry of the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> at least partially dictate the biasing force provided by the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b>. For example, in general, the force provided by the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> acts as the normal force component of the friction between the workpiece <b>36</b> and the upper and lower rollers <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>; thus, the coefficient of friction of each of the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> determines the force necessary for precise and consistent actuation of the workpiece <b>36</b> (i.e., the higher the coefficient of friction of the lower roller <b>34</b> when the lower roller <b>34</b> is driven, for example, the lower the biasing force necessary to create sufficient friction with the workpiece <b>36</b> and vice versa).</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In addition, the higher the friction between upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> and the workpiece <b>36</b>, the less likely it will be that the workpiece <b>36</b> erroneously slips between the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b>. However, as noted above with reference to the exemplary configurations of the first, second, and third pairs of workpiece guides <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> located within cutting machine <b>10</b>, as the workpiece <b>36</b> could be potentially misaligned within the cutting machine <b>10</b> (i.e., either when initially fed between the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> or during cutting), one or more of the first, second, and third pairs of workpiece guides <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> function as &#x201c;bumpers&#x201d; to force the workpiece <b>36</b> back-and-forth in the X-direction and into alignment as the workpiece <b>36</b> is actuated forward-and-backward in the Y-direction. Accordingly, for the most effective automatic alignment of the workpiece <b>36</b> in the cutting machine <b>10</b>, when the workpiece <b>36</b> is pinched between the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b>, the workpiece <b>36</b> is preferably able to travel back and forth laterally in the X-direction as the roller assembly <b>18</b> draws the workpiece <b>36</b> forward-and-backward in the Y-direction between the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b>. Accordingly, the lateral travel of the workpiece <b>36</b> between the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b>, while small enough to not negatively affect the accuracy of a certain cut or operation of the tool <b>20</b>, allows one or more of the first, second, and third pairs of workpiece guides <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> to automatically maintain good material alignment.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In some configurations, the combination of the biasing force between the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> and the material(s) defining each of the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b>, including coefficients of friction thereof, may be balanced such that: 1) the coefficient of friction between the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> and the material are small enough (or that the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> are &#x201c;slick&#x201d; enough) to allow lateral movement (in the X-direction) of the workpiece <b>36</b> between the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> under the given biasing force; and 2) the biasing force creates enough friction to maintain precise actuation of the workpiece <b>36</b>, without slippage, in the Y-direction.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In other configurations, the roller assembly <b>18</b> may include an upper roller <b>32</b> made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-filled polycarbonate material having a static coefficient of friction against a workpiece <b>36</b> being actuated of less than 1 (e.g., in some configurations, the average coefficient of friction of the upper roller <b>32</b> may be between about 0.05 and 0.50 according to the ASTM D1984 friction test). In other configurations, the roller assembly <b>18</b> may include a biasing force between the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> of at least about 10 kg-f. In yet other configurations, the roller assembly <b>18</b> may include a biasing force between the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> between about 10 kg-f (+/&#x2212;10%) and 14 kg-f (+/&#x2212;10%). In further configurations, the roller assembly <b>18</b> may include a biasing force between the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> more than 14 kg-f.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Also, for example, in some configurations, the average coefficient of friction of the upper roller <b>32</b> is between about 0.10 and 0.26 according to the ASTM D1984 friction test. In some instances, the average coefficient of friction of the upper roller <b>32</b> is about 0.18 according to the ASTM D1984 friction test. In some instances, the roller assembly <b>18</b> may include a biasing force between the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> of at least about 10 kg-f. In other instances, the roller assembly <b>18</b> may include a biasing force between the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> between about 10 kg-f and 14 kg-f. In yet other instances, the roller assembly <b>18</b> may include a biasing force between the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> more than 14 kg-f. In some embodiments, similar materials having similar properties may also be employed, such as other hard plastics with similarly low static coefficients of friction and so forth. For example, in an exemplary configuration, the upper roller <b>32</b> (or either the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b>, if passive) may be formed of polycarbonate, TEFLON&#xae;, or a composite polycarbonate-TEFLON&#xae; material as noted above.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In some configurations, if a material defining one or more of the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> are defined by a softer, higher friction material, and, thus, a lower force, the lower roller <b>34</b> may be defined by a needle-like surface geometry. The needle-like geometry may provide a gripping characteristic that reduces slippage of the workpiece <b>36</b> between the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, a perspective view of an exemplary lower roller <b>34</b> used in the roller assembly <b>18</b> is shown. The lower roller <b>34</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is robust enough to withstand the higher forces (e.g., 10 kg-f or more) while maintaining a good grip on the workpiece <b>36</b>. The lower roller <b>34</b> may be defined by a generally cylindrical shape and further includes a textured surface having a plurality of robust, square pyramid-shaped protrusions; such protrusions may be manufactured/formed by milling, lathing, or using other manufacturing methods. One or more other exemplary protrusions shapes may be incorporated into the design of the lower roller <b>34</b>. In general, the lower roller <b>34</b> may include any desirable protrusion surface geometry that provides geometric features that improve gripping with the workpiece <b>36</b> while withstanding biasing forces from the opposing configuration of the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> of 10 kg-f (+/&#x2212;10%) or more without breaking with repeated use.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In other configurations, the upper roller <b>32</b> may be formed (e.g., milled) in a substantially similar manner as described above to define protrusions like that of the lower roller <b>34</b> while the lower roller <b>34</b> is formed from a slick plastic material and operates in a passive manner, so long as the passive roller (e.g., the lower roller <b>34</b>) includes the slick material described above and the actively driven roller (e.g., the upper roller <b>32</b>) includes the higher traction, contoured surface geometry noted above, without departing from the functionalities of the roller assembly <b>18</b> described herein.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Furthermore, in other configurations, the cutting machine <b>10</b> may include more rollers than the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> extending laterally across upper roller bar <b>35</b> and the lower roller bar (e.g., some configurations of the cutting machine <b>10</b> may include three lower rollers and three upper rollers, four lower rollers and four upper rollers, or more). In order to ensure the best automatic alignment of the workpiece <b>36</b> fed through the cutting machine <b>10</b>, however, multiple upper rollers <b>32</b> and lower rollers <b>34</b> may be defined by the same (or close to the same) diameter. For example, in at least one exemplary configuration, the diameter of each of a set of multiple lower rollers <b>34</b> may be configured to be about plus-or-minus about 5-microns of one another.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, a perspective view of an exemplary workpiece <b>36</b> that is configured for use with the cutting machine <b>10</b> is shown. The workpiece <b>36</b> may include an upper layer defining the workpiece material layer <b>38</b> and a lower backing layer defining the workpiece support material layer <b>40</b>. In some configurations, the tool <b>20</b> of the cutting machine <b>10</b> may be configured to impinge upon the workpiece material layer <b>38</b> but not the workpiece support material layer <b>40</b>. For example, in some instances, where the tool <b>20</b> is a cutting blade, the cutting tool <b>20</b> will cut through the workpiece material layer <b>38</b> but not the workpiece support material layer <b>40</b>. More details regarding the material properties and dimensions (including, e.g., a thickness) of the various layers of the workpiece <b>36</b> are described in the following disclosure, but, in general, the workpiece support material layer <b>40</b> may be configured to withstand the impinging force of the cutting tool <b>20</b> or other tools <b>20</b> while the workpiece material layer <b>38</b> may be a peelable vinyl or other material that may be configured to be penetrated by the cutting tool <b>20</b>, a scoring tool, or other tools, and subsequently removed from the workpiece support material layer <b>40</b> after being deformed by the tool <b>20</b>. In addition, in some instances, the workpiece support material layer <b>40</b> may be more rigid than the workpiece material layer <b>38</b> in order to promote automatic alignment of the workpiece <b>36</b> as the workpiece <b>36</b> is guided by material one or more of the first, second, and third pairs of workpiece guides <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> during use as described above.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>B</figref>, in some configurations, the workpiece material layer <b>38</b> may be narrower than the workpiece support material layer <b>40</b> such that side portions of the workpiece support material layer <b>40</b> extend beyond the workpiece material layer <b>38</b> on either edge of the workpiece <b>36</b>. In such exemplary configurations, the workpiece <b>36</b> is configured to be fed into the cutting machine <b>10</b> so that side portions of the workpiece support material layer <b>40</b> that extend laterally beyond the workpiece material layer <b>38</b>, as shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b> and <b>16</b>B</figref>, are the portions of the workpiece <b>36</b> that are pinched between the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> of the roller assembly <b>18</b>; in this way, the workpiece material layer <b>38</b> is not contacted by the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> and is less prone to separating or otherwise bunching, tunneling, or slipping from the workpiece support material layer <b>40</b> as side edges of the workpiece <b>36</b> contact one or more of the first, second, and third pairs of workpiece guides <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, and/or the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> during use.

The material defining the workpiece material layer <b>38</b> may vary depending on the needs or wants of the end user. For example, some materials defining the workpiece material layer <b>38</b> may be opaque, whereas other materials defining the workpiece material layer <b>38</b> may be transparent, and yet other materials defining the workpiece material layer <b>38</b> may be semi-transparent, or a combination thereof. In at least some configurations of the cutting machine <b>10</b> described herein, a material sensor (not shown) may be disposed above working surface <b>22</b>, which may detect the type and/or color of the material defining the workpiece material layer <b>38</b> being fed though the cutting machine <b>10</b>. In some configurations, such a material sensor may be disposed rearwardly of the tool <b>20</b>. In other configurations, such a sensor may be disposed elsewhere within the cutting machine <b>10</b>. In order to detect a range of materials defining the workpiece material layer <b>38</b>, including transparent or semi-transparent materials defining the workpiece material layer <b>38</b>, the material sensor may be disposed at an angle with respect to the working surface <b>22</b>. The specific angle of the material sensor may vary but is such that a wide range of transparencies can be detected by the sensor. In some examples, transparent materials defining the workpiece material layer <b>38</b> are more difficult to detect with the sensor aligned normal to the material defining the workpiece material layer <b>38</b> than opaque materials. However, the angle of the sensor and/or a light source detected by the sensor in relation to the material defining the workpiece material layer <b>38</b> being detected is optimized based on a range of transparent material properties, such as angle of incidence, to more effectively detect transparent and semi-transparent materials defining the workpiece material layer <b>38</b>.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In addition to the various embodiments of the first, second, and third pairs of workpiece guides <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, the roller assembly <b>18</b>, and the workpiece <b>36</b> described herein, other features of the cutting machine <b>10</b> may be utilized to enhance matless cutting and improve user experiences. For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, an exemplary material sensing mechanism <b>42</b> is shown disposed in front of the upper roller <b>32</b> and adjacent to a workpiece guide of the second pair of workpiece guides <b>28</b>. The sensing mechanism <b>42</b> may also be disposed elsewhere in one or more other embodiments, such as, for example, next to the upper roller <b>32</b> and the workpiece guide of the second pair of workpiece guides <b>28</b> or elsewhere within the cutting machine <b>10</b>. The sensing mechanism <b>42</b> may function in a manner that detects the presence and thickness of the workpiece <b>36</b> that is fed into the cutting machine <b>10</b> upon or over the working surface <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, a first end portion <b>48</b> of a rocker arm <b>44</b> is shown extending upwardly through an opening in working surface <b>22</b>. The first end portion <b>48</b> may be rounded in order to allow the workpiece <b>36</b> to be inserted between the first end portion <b>48</b> and an upper wall <b>46</b> of the workpiece guide of the second pair of workpiece guides <b>28</b>, thereby forcing the rocker arm <b>44</b> downward (e.g., Z-direction). With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the rocker arm <b>44</b> is shown disposed below the working surface <b>22</b>. The rocker arm <b>44</b> may be rotationally connected to a housing at a pivot point <b>52</b> such that when the workpiece <b>36</b> is inserted into the cutting machine <b>10</b> as described above, the first end portion <b>48</b> of the rocker arm <b>44</b> is pushed downwardly and then the second end portion <b>50</b> of the rocker arm <b>44</b> is rotated up. The second end portion <b>50</b> interfaces with a sensor near the second end portion <b>50</b>, which detects the movement and/or presence of the second end portion <b>50</b> relative to the sensor, thus detecting when the workpiece <b>36</b> has been fed into the cutting machine <b>10</b> as well as the thickness of the workpiece support material layer <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">The upper wall <b>46</b> that extends horizontally from the second material guide <b>28</b> is advantageously arranged so as to keep the workpiece <b>36</b> from raising off the working surface <b>22</b> during use. In some configurations, the rocker arm <b>44</b> may be disposed within the X-Z plane. In this way, regardless of whether the workpiece <b>36</b> is actuated forward or backward in the Y-direction, any risk of friction lock against the upper wall <b>46</b> is mitigated because the horizontal component (in the X-direction) of the rotation of the first end <b>48</b> of the rocker arm <b>44</b> is perpendicular to the Y-direction of the workpiece <b>36</b> traveling between the first end <b>48</b> of the rocker arm <b>44</b> and the upper wall <b>46</b>. In addition, the lateral disposition of the rocker arm <b>44</b> within the X-Z plane (e.g., for pivotal movement about an axis extending substantially (e.g., +/&#x2212;10%) parallel to the Y-axis) allows for a thinner form factor of the cutting machine <b>10</b> in the Y-direction in general, as compared to a rocker arm <b>44</b> extending in the Y-Z plane (e.g., for pivotal movement about an axis extending substantially parallel to the X-axis).</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Once the workpiece <b>36</b> is detected, the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> may be activated to auto-feed the workpiece <b>36</b> into the cutting machine <b>10</b>. The upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> or motor(s) (not shown) actuating one or both of the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> may also include one or more sensors (not shown) that detect resistance to rolling (e.g., if a user tries to pull the workpiece <b>36</b> out during an ongoing project, one or more of the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> may be activated in order to push the workpiece <b>36</b> out of the cutting machine <b>10</b>).</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In some configurations, the sensing mechanism <b>42</b> may include a rib <b>43</b> protruding downwardly from a lower surface of the upper wall <b>46</b>. The rib <b>43</b> may functionally decrease the space between the upper wall <b>46</b> and the working surface <b>22</b>, which allows for a shorter arm at the second end portion <b>50</b> of the rocker arm <b>44</b> that interfaces with the sensor. This allows for a smaller space provided for the sensor while maintaining a larger detecting range using easily moldable parts. In some configurations, the sensing mechanism <b>42</b> may be capable of detecting workpiece <b>36</b> ranging between about 0.18 mm thick to about 0.5 mm thick.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, other configurations of the cutting machine <b>10</b> may include a material roll holder <b>54</b>. As noted above, the workpiece <b>36</b> may be configured to be flexible enough to be efficiently packaged and shipped, for example in a roll. A roll (see, e.g., <b>36</b>R at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>-<b>17</b></figref>) of workpiece <b>36</b> allows large lengths of workpiece <b>36</b> to be stored in a small or reduced volume. However, long lengths of rolled workpiece <b>36</b> may be difficult to handle during cutting operations of the cutting machine <b>10</b>. By incorporating or associating the roll holder <b>54</b> with the cutting machine <b>10</b>, an end user can place a roll <b>36</b>R of workpiece <b>36</b> to be cut near the cutting machine <b>10</b> between sidewalls <b>58</b> of the material roll holder <b>54</b> and on top of roll guides <b>56</b> of the material roll holder <b>54</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>-<b>15</b></figref>, the roll <b>36</b>R of workpiece <b>36</b> can rotate in place on top of the roll guides <b>56</b> and between the sidewalls <b>58</b>; furthermore, in some configurations, the roll <b>36</b>R of workpiece <b>36</b> can rotate in place on top of the roll guides <b>56</b> and between the sidewalls <b>58</b> after a distal end <b>36</b>D is disposed within the cutting machine <b>10</b> such that the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> of the cutting machine <b>10</b> pull or reel a portion of the length (see, e.g., L<sub>36 </sub>at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>) of the roll <b>36</b>R of workpiece <b>36</b> into the cutting machine <b>10</b>. Accordingly, in some configurations, the reeled portion of the length L<sub>36 </sub>of the workpiece <b>36</b> from the roll <b>36</b>R of the workpiece <b>36</b> can be fed through a guide slot <b>60</b> of the material roll holder <b>54</b> in order to ensure horizontal alignment of the workpiece <b>36</b> with the working surface <b>22</b> of the cutting machine <b>10</b> as the workpiece <b>36</b> is reeled from the roll <b>36</b>R of the workpiece <b>36</b> for subsequent feeding into the cutting machine <b>10</b> by the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b>. In other configurations, the roll holder <b>54</b> may also include a razor blade <b>62</b> or other cutting mechanism guided by an upper wall of the guide slot <b>60</b> that permits easy and convenient cutting of a reeled length L<sub>36 </sub>of the workpiece <b>36</b> from the roll <b>36</b>R of the workpiece <b>36</b> when a project is finished.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In yet other configurations of the roll holder <b>54</b>, one or more damping mechanisms and/or springs (not shown) may be included in order to control a rate of rotation of the roll <b>36</b>R of the workpiece <b>36</b> that is reeled from the roll holder <b>54</b> during use. Damping mechanisms may, for example, prevent the workpiece <b>36</b> that is reeled from the roll <b>36</b>R of the workpiece <b>36</b> from over-rotation due to the inertia of the roll <b>36</b>R of the workpiece <b>36</b> being further rotated even after one or both of the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> has/have stopped feeding a desired amount of reeled length L<sub>36 </sub>the workpiece <b>36</b> from the roll <b>36</b>R of the workpiece <b>36</b> into the cutting machine <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Conversely, spring loaded mechanisms may also function to oppose forces from the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> so that the roll <b>36</b>R of the workpiece <b>36</b> extending from or being reeled from the roll holder <b>54</b> into the cutting machine <b>10</b> remains taut, particularly when the upper roller <b>32</b> and the lower roller <b>34</b> push the workpiece <b>36</b> back out toward the roll holder <b>54</b> during a cutting operation.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">As noted above, each of the embodiments described in the detailed description above may include any of the features, options, and possibilities set out in the present disclosure figures, including those under the other independent embodiments, and may also include any combination of any of the features, options, and possibilities set out in the present disclosure and figures.
