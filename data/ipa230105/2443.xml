including immunoglobulins (Ig) such as immunoglobulin G (IgG).</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">RELATED APPLICATION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">This application claims priority from Australian provisional application AU2019904386, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The demand for purified proteins such as specific antibodies has increased considerably. Such purified proteins can be used for therapeutic and/or diagnostic purposes.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Human blood plasma has been industrially utilized for decades for the production of widely established and accepted plasma-protein products such as human albumin (HSA), immunoglobulin (IgG), clotting factor concentrates (clotting Factor VIII, clotting Factor IX, prothrombin complex etc.) and inhibitors (antithrombin, C1-inhibitor etc.). In the course of the development of such plasma-derived drugs, plasma fractionation methods have been established, leading to intermediate products enriched in certain protein fractions, which then serve as the starting composition for plasma-protein product/s. Typical processes are reviewed in e.g. Molecular Biology of Human Proteins (Schultze H.E., Heremans J.F.; Volume I: Nature and Metabolism of Extracellular Proteins 1966, Elsevier Publishing Company; p. 236-317). These kinds of separation technologies allow for the production of several therapeutic plasma-protein products from the same plasma donor pool. This is economically advantageous over producing only one plasma-protein product from one donor pool, and has therefore been adopted as the industrial standard in blood plasma fractionation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One example of this type of fractionation process, cold ethanol fractionation of plasma, was pioneered by E.J Cohn and his team during World War II, primarily for the purification of albumin (Cohn EJ, et al. 1946, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 62: 459-475). The Cohn fractionation process involves increasing the ethanol concentration in stages, from 0% to 40%, while lowering the pH from neutral (pH 7) to about 4.8, resulting in the precipitation of albumin. Whilst Cohn fractionation has evolved over the past 70 years or so, most commercial plasma fractionation processes are based on the original process or a variation thereof (e.g. Kistler / Nitschmann), exploiting differences in pH, ionic strength, solvent polarity and alcohol concentration to separate plasma into a series of major precipitated protein fractions (such as Fractions Ito V in Cohn).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Variations to the Cohn Fractionation process have been developed with the aim of improving polyvalent IgG recovery. For example Oncley and co-workers used Cohn Fractions II+III as a starting material with different combinations of cold ethanol, pH, temperature and protein concentration to those described by Cohn, to produce an active immune globulin serum fraction (Oncley et al., (1949) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 71, 541-550). Today, the Oncley method is the classic method used for production of polyvalent IgG. Nevertheless, it is known that approximately 5% of gamma-globulins (antibody-rich portion) is co-precipitated with Fraction I and about 15% of the total gamma-globulin present in plasma is lost by the Fraction II+III step (See Table III, Cohn E J, et al. 1946, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 62: 459-475). The Kistler/Nitschmann method aimed to improve IgG recovery by reducing the ethanol content of some of the precipitation steps (Precipitation B vs Fraction III). The increased yield, however, is at the expense of the purity (Kistler &#x26; Nitschmann, (1962) Vox Sang. 7, 414-424).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Initially, immunoglobulin G (IgG) preparations derived from these fractionation processes were successfully used for the prophylaxis and treatment of various infectious diseases. However, as ethanol fractionation is a relatively crude process the IgG products contained impurities and aggregates to an extent that they could only be administered intramuscularly. Since that time additional improvements in the purification processes have led to IgG preparations suitable for intravenous (called IVIg) and subcutaneous (called SCIg) administration.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It has been estimated that approximately 30 million liters of plasma were processed worldwide in 2010, providing a range of therapeutic products including about 500 tonnes of albumin and 100 tonnes of IVIg. The IVIg market accounts for about 40-50% of the entire plasma fractionation market (P. Robert, Worldwide supply and demand of plasma and plasma derived medicines (2011) J. Blood and Cancer, 3, 111-120). Thus, with demands for IVIg remaining strong (along with increasing demands for SCIg) there remains a need to improve immunoglobulin recoveries from plasma and related fractions. Preferably, this must be achieved in a way that ensures the recovery of other plasma derived therapeutic proteins is not adversely affected.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">From a commercial perspective, the initial fractionation processes are critical to the overall production time and costs associated with the production of a therapeutic protein, particularly plasma derived proteins, since the subsequent purification steps will depend on the yield and purity of the protein(s) of interest within these initial fractions. Whilst several variations of the cold ethanol fractionation process have been developed for plasma derived protein in order to improve protein yield at lower operating costs, higher protein yields are typically associated with lower purity.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">There is a need for an improved method and system for the industrial scale production of proteins such as immunoglobulins from immunoglobulin-comprising precipitate material, for example derived from plasma or serum, which have to meet stringent safety standards. The currently used downstream technologies are relatively expensive and their yield is not optimal.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, there is a crucial need to develop more efficient and economic methods for the extraction and purification of proteins such as immunoglobulins from protein containing suspensions.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Reference to any prior art in the specification is not an acknowledgment or suggestion that this prior art forms part of the common general knowledge in any jurisdiction or that this prior art could reasonably be expected to be understood, regarded as relevant, and/or combined with other pieces of prior art by a skilled person in the art.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for extracting a protein of interest from a precipitate, comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0014">a) mixing the precipitate with a liquid in a first tank to form a first suspension having a first dilution factor;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0015">b) feeding the first suspension into a first filtration unit comprising a dynamic filter element adapted to produce a first retentate depleted for the protein of interest and a first permeate enriched with the protein of interest;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0016">c) diluting the first suspension in the first tank by adding liquid to a second dilution factor, optionally by streaming the first retentate into the first tank;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0017">d) recovering the first permeate enriched with the protein of interest in a second tank;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0018">e) precipitating one or more impurities in the first permeate enriched with the protein of interest to produce a second suspension;

In another example, the linear velocity of the permeate/filtrate enriched for the protein of interest can be 0.03 to 0.33 m/s. Linear velocity multiplied by the cross-sectional area gives the volumetric flow rate. In addition, a turbulence can be created in the first process unit as a result of the speed of the rotating filter discs, wherein the speed (sometimes referred to as tangential speed) can be between about 1 to 7 m/s.

Protein-comprising precipitate e.g. in form of a suspension, or in form of a paste or precipitate is suspended with liquid e.g. buffer. The compositions and concentration of the buffer are in accordance with the above described method in order to generate a starting composition such as a suspension having a first dilution factor e.g. between 3 to 10 (1:3 to 1:10). The suspension is housed in a first tank <b>1</b>. The suspension can be fed to a first filtration unit <b>5</b>, through the pump <b>2</b>, several type of pumps can be used (e.g. piston-; rotary-; centrifugal- and membrane pump) and flow-regulated valve <b>3</b> of a pipe <b>12</b>. The first filtration unit <b>5</b> is equipped with a rotating hollow shaft to which the filter discs are mounted (the filtrate flows from the outside to the inside of hollow shaft). The first filtration unit <b>5</b> is further set up with height adjustable scrapers to keep the filter cake thickness constant and thus achieve constant filtrate flow. The desired filtration pressure is controlled and regulated by overflow valve (unfiltered suspension outlet). The filter discs used can be a ceramic membrane, depth filter layers and sintered porous metal filter discs. Once the vessel of the first filtration unit <b>5</b> is filled with the suspension, a continuous pressure extraction and separation can be started. The first filtration unit <b>5</b>, which can comprise a pressure unit/vessel, is provided with suitable internal settings and conditions to simultaneously increase the extraction efficiency and filtration process. The extraction efficiency is increased through turbulence mixing in the unit <b>5</b> without having to involve a mixer. Nevertheless, it can be foreseen that an additional mixer may be provided to assist the extraction process by creating turbulences. Moreover, higher final dilution factor e.g. 40 or 70 disclosed in the present invention also increases the extraction efficiency, leading to high protein (e.g. IgG) yield. Of course, any other higher final dilution factor (higher than 70) can also be envisaged.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0165">The filtrate flows through a flowmeter <b>6</b> installed on pipe (or channel) <b>14</b> and is collected in the second tank <b>7</b>.

When a defined volume in the second tank <b>7</b> is reached, the UF <b>8</b> concentration process can be started in the second filtration unit.

The transmembrane pressure is set such that the permeate flow rate <b>17</b> is identical or almost identical to that with the first filtrate flow rate in pipe <b>14</b>. The permeate of the UF system <b>8</b> flows through pipe (or line or channel) <b>17</b> back to the first tank <b>1</b>, whereas the retentate of the UF system (=concentrated protein) flows through pipe <b>16</b> back to the second tank <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0166">In accordance with the invention, the first process unit <b>5</b> is provided with one or more rotating filter discs comprising one or more of the first filter element for turbulence mixing of the content of the first process unit <b>5</b> for producing the first retentate and the first permeate. The first retentate can be fed back to the first tank <b>1</b> through a channel <b>13</b> via a control valve <b>3</b> whereas the first permeate can be fed to a second tank <b>7</b> via another channel <b>14</b>. The first filter element can be a filtration membrane which is based on a ceramic material, having a pore diameter of between about 5 nm to 5000 nm, preferably between 20 nm to 100 nm or more preferably between 30 nm to 80 nm. It can also be foreseen that inorganic membranes or any other suitable membranes could also provide a similar effect as the ceramic based membrane. The first filtration unit <b>5</b> may be supplied with a pressure control device <b>4</b> such as a manometer in order to regulate the pressure within. Similarly, a flowmeter <b>6</b> can be installed in the system of the present invention for measuring the flow rate of the suspension or solution.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0167">Feedstream from the second tank <b>7</b> can then be fed to a second filtration unit <b>8</b> through a channel <b>15</b> for a second separation process to be carried out. The second separation process can be a continuous concentration process (e.g. UF). The second filtration unit <b>8</b> is provided with one or more second cross flow filter element/s, wherein the second cross flow filter element can comprise an ultrafiltration membrane having an average molecular weight cutoff value of less than 50 kDa. However, the membrane can also be less than 10 kDa or more preferably less than 5 kDa. The ultrafiltration membrane therefore produces a second retentate which is channeled back to the second tank <b>7</b> through a channel <b>16</b> whereas the second permeate is fed to the first tank <b>1</b> via a channel <b>17</b>. To this end, it is noted that the pressure of the second filtration unit <b>10</b> can be regulated during concentration step (ultrafiltration) such that the flow velocity of channels <b>14</b> and <b>17</b> are substantially equal.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0168"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic overview of a further system of the present invention, and is described in more detail below.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0125" num="0169">Reference will now be made in detail to certain embodiments of the invention.

On the contrary, the invention is intended to cover all alternatives, modifications, and equivalents, which may be included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the claims.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0170">One skilled in the art will recognize many methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein, which could be used in the practice of the present invention. The present invention is in no way limited to the methods and materials described. It will be understood that the invention disclosed and defined in this specification extends to all alternative combinations of two or more of the individual features mentioned or evident from the text or drawings. All of these different combinations constitute various alternative aspects of the invention.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0171">For purposes of interpreting this specification, terms used in the singular will also include the plural and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0172">The present invention relates to a system and a method for maximising protein recovery and yield by using a novel first process unit or further with a second process unit, and a precipitating step to remove one or more impurities. The combination of an extraction and separation method, in conjunction with a precipitating step is used in the present invention to process a solid protein-comprising precipitate i.e. an intermediate material (e.g. paste derived from a starting material) wherein the starting precipitate may be suspended in a liquid or diluent e.g. water or buffer, to form a suspension.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0173">One advantage of the methods of the present invention is that the total recovery of a protein of interest is maximized such that there is minimal loss of this protein during the steps required to remove impurities and other proteins which are not of interest. These advantages arise, in part, from the application of a continuous extraction filtration method, in combination with subsequent precipitation steps. The continuous extraction method facilitates downstream processing using conditions which minimize loss of the protein of interest, for example, by reducing the total amount of reagent required to precipitate impurities or proteins that are not of interest.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0174">Typical protein containing precipitates are formed during the purification of proteins after exposure to precipitants such as ethanol. The solid is often called the precipitate or paste. The precipitate can be mixed with liquid to form a suspension in which solid particles are distributed throughout the liquid. Under particular extraction conditions the protein contained in these particles can be progressively dissolved into the liquid phase.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0175">The dissolution ratio in industrial scaled manufacturing processes poses a problem because of the large volume of water or buffer required. For plasma fractionation processes used to manufacture proteins like albumin and immunoglobulins this step can involve many thousands of litres. Even when tanks are available to hold such large volumes to enable large dissolution ratios, the desired effect of higher yield can fail to materialize because of an equilibrium (Le Chatelier's principle) between protein dissolved in the solution and that remaining in the precipitate or paste. Such protein trapped in the precipitate may not be recoverable for further processing to final product. This phenomenon is related in part to the solubility equilibrium. As a known solubility equilibrium exists when a compound in the solid phase is in chemical equilibrium with the compound dissolved in the solution. The equilibrium is an example of a dynamic equilibrium in that some individual molecules migrate between the solid and liquid phases such that the rates of dissolution and precipitation are equal to one another.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0176">This invention aims to solve the problem of protein recovery from precipitates by (a) continuously shifting the solubility equilibrium, and (b) precipitating one or more impurities. Continuously shifting the solubility equilibrium is achieved by: 1) increasing the extraction efficiency (using dynamic filtration system which can incorporate hollow rotating disk filter elements) with built-in components to allow intimate phase contact in a repetitive way; 2) continuously removing dissolved protein from the protein containing precipitate (by applying Le Chatelier's principle&#x2014;when any system at equilibrium is subjected to change in concentration (e.g. volume), temperature, or pressure, then the system re-adjusts to counteract (partially) the effect of the applied change and a new equilibrium is established. This means by continuously increasing the volume at the resuspension site and continuously removing the dissolved protein through the dynamic filter, Le Chatelier's principle can be utilized to ensure maximum protein transfer from the precipitate into the liquid phase. In some instances, increased volume can be realized by recycling the permeate during a continuous concentration step of the protein, thereby reducing consumption of buffer. Further, precipitating one or more impurities is achieved by altering the solvation potential of the solvent, more specifically, by lowering the solubility of the one or more impurities by addition of a reagent and/or modulating the conditions (e.g. like pH or conductivity). The result is a greater recovery of a protein of interest with the same, substantially the same or reduced, nature and/or amount of impurities. In other words, the step of precipitating one or more impurities in the context of the invention results in a greater recovery of a protein of interest with the same, substantially the same or reduced, nature and/or amount of impurities, than if that precipitating step was not performed.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0177">In addition, the present invention also relates to the identification that significantly reduced amounts of reagent that lowers the solubility of one or more impurities can be used to precipitate the one or more impurities from a solution containing a protein of interest. In particular, the lower amounts of reagent can be used when the solution containing a protein of interest has certain characteristics. The advantage is that process costs can be reduced by using lower amounts of a reagent as well as a greater recovery of a protein of interest as the amount of protein of interest that is co-precipitated with the one or more impurities is reduced.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0178">Definitions</p><p id="p-0135" num="0179">The term &#x201c;protein-comprising precipitate&#x201d; is intended to refer to any material containing the protein of interest. In the context of immunoglobulin as the protein of interest, this term may refer to plasma, serum, precipitates produced from plasma or serum, fermentation broths, inclusion bodies, cell culture supernatants, or precipitates produced from such materials. Typically, in the context of the present invention, it refers to precipitates from plasma, such as Cohn or Oncley ethanol precipitates, or Kistler-Nitschmann precipitates.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0180">The term &#x201c;starting composition&#x201d; refers to a suspension or solution, produced from the protein-comprising precipitate, typically by dilution with water or buffer according to a (first) dilution factor. In some instances, if no dilution of the protein-comprising precipitate is required, the protein-comprising precipitate may be the starting suspension.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0181">By &#x201c;high yield&#x201d; it is meant that the yield of the protein of interest such as immunoglobulin G (as well as other proteins and immunoglobulins) is at least 95% of the amount of the protein of interest in the protein-comprising precipitate, preferably at least 96%, more preferably at least 98%, most preferably more than 98%.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0182">The concentration of immunoglobulin in a sample (e.g., in the precipitate or in a pharmaceutical-grade purified preparation thereof) can be measured by any means known to persons skilled in the art. It will be understood that the method used to measure immunoglobulin may depend on the nature of the sample. For example, it will be understood that, where the sample is an immunoglobulin-containing precipitate, it may be necessary to dissolve the precipitate (or a sample thereof) in a suitable buffer prior to the measurement. Examples of suitable assays for measuring a protein of interest include high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC; e.g., size exclusion HPLC), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and quantitative immunonephelometry.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0183">By &#x201c;about&#x201d; or &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; in relation to a given numerical value for percentage, pH, amount or a period of time or other references, it is meant to include numerical values within 10% of the specified value.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0184">Large or Industrial Scale Processes or Systems</p><p id="p-0141" num="0185">Large or industrial scale with regard to the present invention represents production procedures based on at least 200 L, preferably at least 500 L, even more preferably at least 2000 L of a starting material such as human plasma. For example typical commercial plasma donor pool sizes used in industrial scaled protein manufacture range from 2500 L to 6000 L of plasma per batch. In particular embodiments of the invention the precipitate is obtained from 2500 L to 6000 L of plasma. Some commercial manufacturing processes are capable of using even larger plasma donor pool sizes including up to 7500 L, up to 10000 L, and/or up to 15000 L of plasma.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0186">The method and system of the invention can also be used not only for large industrial scale applications but as a stand-alone system and/or method for smaller production scale applications (where the starting material may be less than 200 L).</p><p id="p-0143" num="0187">Precipitates and Proteins of Interest</p><p id="p-0144" num="0188">Many different methods can be used to selectively precipitate proteins from solution, for instance by the addition of salts, alcohols and/or polyethylene glycol with the combination of pH adjustment and/or a cooling step. It is therefore anticipated that the present invention will be applicable to most protein precipitates, such as immunoglobulin G-containing protein precipitates, regardless of how they are initially prepared. It should be noted that the present invention can also be implemented in separating other types of protein including albumin, immunoglobulins (Ig), such as IgA, IgD, IgE or IgM, either each type of immunoglobulin alone or a mixture thereof. It is foreseen that recombinant proteins are also suitable in this regard.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0189">To this end, it is noted that, if the method is applied to producing IgG, the protein-comprising precipitate can be any IgG-containing material (e.g. in form of a paste, precipitate, or inclusion bodies) or derived from a starting material such as a solution from which the IgG can be precipitated by for example one or more of the methods explained above, whether from plasma or serum of human or animal origin, fermentation broth, cell culture, protein suspension, milk or other original sources. The immunoglobulin-containing material or solution may contain monoclonal or polyclonal immunoglobulin(s). In some embodiments, the immunoglobulin-containing starting material is a solution comprising polyclonal antibodies. In other embodiments the starting material comprises a monoclonal antibody or a fragment thereof. It is therefore within the knowledge of a skilled person that the term &#x201c;immunoglobulin&#x201d; as used herein can also be identified as antibody including monoclonal antibody or polyclonal antibody, either natural or recombinant.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0190">For instance, the immunoglobulins (e.g. IgG) can be isolated from human or animal blood or produced by other means such as by recombinant DNA technology or hybridoma technology. In preferred embodiments, immunoglobulins are obtained from blood plasma, typically from a pool of blood plasma derived from many donors. In order to obtain the immunoglobulins from plasma, the plasma is usually subjected to alcohol fractionation, which may be combined with other purification techniques like chromatography, adsorption or precipitation. However, other processes can also be used. For instance, the protein-comprising precipitate can be the II+III precipitate according to the Cohn's methods such as the Method 6, Cohn et. al. J. Am; Chem. Soc., 68 (3), 459-475 (1946), the Method 9, Oncley et al. J. Am; Chem. Soc., 71, 541-550 (1946), or the I+II+III precipitate, the Method 10, Cohn et.al. J. Am; Chem. Soc., 72, 465-474 (1950); as well as the Method of Deutsch et.al. J. Biol. Chem. 164, 109-118 (1946) or the Precipitate-A of Nitschmann and Kistler Vox Sang. 7, 414-424 (1962); HeIv. Chim. Acta 37, 866-873 (1954). Alternative precipitates comprising the protein of interest include but are not limited to other immunoglobulin G-containing Oncley fractions, Cohn fractions, ammonium sulphate precipitates from plasma described by Schulze et al. in U.S. patent 3,301,842. Further alternative precipitates comprising the protein of interest include but are not limited to octanoic acid precipitates, as described, for example, in EP0893450.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0191">&#x201c;Normal plasma&#x201d;, &#x201c;hyperimmune plasma&#x201d; (such as hyperimmune anti-D, tetanus or hepatitis B plasma) or any plasma equivalent thereto can be used as a starting material in the cold ethanol fractionation processes described herein.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0192">The term rcryosupernatant' (also called cryo-poor plasma, cryoprecipitate depleted plasma and similar) refers to plasma (derived from either whole blood donations or plasmapheresis) from which the cryoprecipitate has been removed. Cryoprecipitation is the first step in most plasma protein fractionation methods in use today, for the large-scale production of plasma protein therapeutics. The method generally involves pooling frozen plasma that is thawed under controlled conditions (e.g. at or below 6&#xb0; C.) and the precipitate is then collected by either filtration or centrifugation. The supernatant fraction, known to those skilled in the art as a &#x201c;cryosupernatant&#x201d;, is generally retained for use. The resulting cryo-poor plasma has reduced levels of Factor VIII (FVIII), von Willebrand factor (VWF), Factor XIII (FXIII), fibronectin and fibrinogen. While the levels of FVIII are greatly reduced, levels of fibrinogen can be as much as 70% of original levels. Cryosupernatant provides a common feedstock used to manufacture a range of therapeutic proteins, including alpha 1-antitrypsin (AAT), apolipoprotein A-I (APO), fibrinogen, antithrombin III (ATM), prothrombin complex comprising the coagulation factors (II, VII, IX and X) , albumin (ALB) and immunoglobulins such as immunoglobulin G (IgG).</p><p id="p-0149" num="0193">The supernatant of the 8% ethanol-precipitate (method of Cohn et al.; Schultze et al. (see above), p. 251), precipitate II+III (method of Oncley et al.; Schultze et al. (see above) p. 253) or precipitate B (method of Kistler and Nitschmann; Schultze et al. (see Schultze above), p. 253) are examples of a source of IgG compatible with industrial scale plasma fractionation. The starting material for a purification process to gain IgG in high yield can alternatively be any other suitable material from different sources like fermentation and cell culture or other protein suspensions.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0194">In the Cohn fractionation method, the first fractionation step results in fraction I which comprises mainly fibrinogen and fibronectin. The supernatant from this step is further processed to precipitate out fraction II+III and then fractions III and II. Typically, fraction II+III contains approximately 60% IgG, together with impurities such as fibrinogen, IgM, and IgA. Most of these impurities are then removed in fraction III, which is considered a waste fraction and is normally discarded. The supernatant is then treated to precipitate out the main IgG-containing fraction, fraction II, which can contain greater than 90% IgG. The above % values refer to % purity of the IgG. Purity can be measured by any method known in the art, such as gel electrophoresis or immune-nephelometry. In the Kistler &#x26; Nitschmann method, fraction I is equivalent to fraction I of the Cohn method. The next precipitate/fraction is referred to as precipitate A (fraction A). This precipitate is broadly equivalent, although not identical, to Cohn fraction 11+111. The precipitate is then redissolved and conditions adjusted to precipitate out precipitate B (fraction B), which is equivalent to Cohn fraction III. Again, this is considered to be a waste fraction, and is normally discarded. The precipitate B supernatant is then processed further to produce precipitate II, which corresponds to Cohn Fraction II.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0195">Particular protein-comprising precipitates can comprise plasma proteins, peptide hormones, growth factors, cytokines and polyclonal immunoglobulins proteins, plasma proteins selected from human and animal blood clotting factors including fibrinogen, prothrombin, thrombin, prothrombin complex, FX, FXa, FIX, FIXa, FVII, FVIIa, FXI, FXIa, FXII, FXIIa, FXIII and FXIIIa, von Willebrand factor, transport proteins including albumin, transferrin, ceruloplasmin, haptoglobin, hemoglobulin and hemopexin, protease inhibitors including &#x3b2;-antithrombin, &#x3b1;-antithrombin, &#x3b1;-2-macroglobulin, Cl-inhibitor, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), heparin cofactor II, protein C inhibitor (PAI-3), Protein C and Protein S, &#x3b1;-1 esterase inhibitor proteins, &#x3b1;-1 antitrypsin, antiangionetic proteins including latent-antithrombin, highly glycosylated proteins including &#x3b1;-1-acid glycoprotein, antichymotrypsin, inter-&#x3b1;-trypsin inhibitor, &#x3b1;-2-HS glycoprotein and C-reactive protein and other proteins including histidine-rich glycoprotein, mannan binding lectin, C4-binding protein, fibronectin, GC-globulin, plasminogen, blood factors such as erythropoietin, interferon, tumor factors, tPA, &#x3b3;CSF.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0196">In particular embodiments the protein-comprising precipitate is used in the manufacture of therapeutic proteins derived from plasma including immunoglobulins such as immunoglobuilin G, albumin, fibrin, thrombin, prothrombin complex, fibrinogen, plasminogen, alpha 1-antitrypsin, C1-inhibitor, apolipoprotein A1, alpha acid glycoprotein, haptoglobin, hemopexin, transferrin and coagulation factors such as Factor VII, Factor VIII and Factor IX.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0197">Dynamic filter element</p><p id="p-0154" num="0198">In any aspect of the present invention, the dynamic filter element filtration unit adapted for removing impurities from the first suspension and or for removing precipitant from the second suspension, is a dynamic cross flow filter element.

Preferably the filter element contains more than one filter disc evenly spaced along at least one hollow central collection shaft. The filter discs can be arranged either horizontally or vertically. When in the horizontal orientation they are spaced along a vertically orientated hollow collection shaft. The collection shaft and discs are rotatable. The suspension in the pressure vessel can then penetrate the outer membrane of the rotating filter discs so as to pass through into a hollow central portion of the disc which is in turn channeled into the central collection shaft. Typically, the filtrate (i.e. the first permeate enriched in the protein of interest) can then be removed from the shaft portion of the first filtration unit via a flanged port.

Also it is shown in Table 2 that the IgG amount is lower at the first dilution factor (1:6 =61.7 g/kg) compared to the IgG amount at the end of the final (second) dilution factor (1:31 =78.9 g/kg).

The present invention utilizes the extraction process, wherein protein-comprising precipitate (e.g. paste) is in effect suspended with a high dilution factor (e.g. between 40 and 70; 1:40 and 1:70). As an example, 1 kg of protein-comprising precipitate (e.g. paste) is resuspended in 3 kg of liquid (e.g. buffer), resulting in a starting suspension with a first dilution factor of 4 (1:4). Recirculation of 66 kg of the feedstream of buffer results in a final dilution factor of 70 (1:70). The extraction process used in the present invention allows higher amounts of immunoglobulin G to be released into the suspension/solution, thus shifting the equilibrium (as will be discussed below), allowing for a more efficient separation of immunoglobulin G from the suspension.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0230">In a preferred embodiment, the crude immunoglobulin G-containing protein precipitate (i.e. the protein-comprising precipitate) is suspended in a buffer to yield the starting suspension.

The approximate distribution of the immunoglobulin G subclasses will typically resemble about the average subclass distribution in human plasma.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0232">Moreover, typically 1 kg of Precipitate A (protein-comprising precipitate) contains around 170 g of total protein (range: 150-190 g protein/kg precipitate). The total protein is made up of approximately 50% to 60% of IgG (thus ranging between 75-95 g/kg precipitate). According to the one method of the present invention, when a recovery rate of approximately 98% of IgG is achieved, that means a total amount of 73.5-93.1 g/kg of IgG are obtained from the protein-comprising precipitate (Precipitate A).</p><p id="p-0191" num="0233">The above method for calculating percentage IgG recovery can be further applied to the present invention, including by collecting the first filtrate in a second tank prior to precipitation and further subsequent continuous extraction and separation.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0234">In chemistry for instance in protein separation, Le Chatelier's principle or &#x201c;The Equilibrium Law&#x201d; can be used to predict the effect of a change in conditions on a chemical equilibrium. When any system at equilibrium is subjected to change in concentration, temperature, volume, or pressure, then the system readjusts itself to counteract (partially) the effect of the applied change and a new equilibrium is established. In other words, whenever a system in equilibrium is disturbed the system will adjust itself in such a way that the effect of the change will be nullified. For instance, at equilibrium, the concentrations of immunoglobulin in suspension on either side are constant. If at equilibrium a small amount of the immunoglobulin is taken out from the reaction, due to the changing of the immunoglobulin concentration, this will shift the equilibrium to the side that would reduce that change in concentration. According to Le Chatelier's principle the system will attempt to partially oppose the change affected to the original state of equilibrium. In turn, the rate of reaction, extent and yield of products will be altered corresponding to the impact on the system.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0235">If a system is at equilibrium and the concentration of one of the species involved in the reaction is increased, the system will readjust so as to decrease the concentration of that species. Thus, the reaction will proceed in such a manner so as to consume some of the increased concentration. Similarly, if the concentration of some substance is decreased, the reaction will proceed so as to make up the loss in the concentration.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0236">In other words, under constant removal of immunoglobulin (e.g. IgG) from the system and at the same time, reducing the concentration of immunoglobulin in the solvent of the suspension through dilution, this leads to the increase of removing immunoglobulin from one phase of the suspension, i.e. the precipitate to the liquid phase. Through repetition of this procedure essentially all immunoglobulin included in the precipitate of the suspension can be extracted from the protein-comprising precipitate, in particular present invention discloses a high final dilution factor of at least 30, preferably e.g. 40 (1:40) or higher, and can be further assisted by using for example the proposed buffer compositions, or additionally assisted by using a higher pH to maximise immunoglobulin G recovery from the protein-comprising precipitate. Compared to the prior art, the method and system of the present invention allows almost all immunoglobulin G to be recovered from the protein-comprising precipitate (e.g. paste or precipitate).</p><p id="p-0195" num="0237">The ultrafiltered product can later be subjected to further processing such as chromatography steps, virus inactivation steps, concentration and formulation so that the end product can be administered for example to the human body.

The first process unit may be provided with a dynamic rotation filtration element, for example comprising a ceramic-based membrane disc. The rotation filtration allows extreme cross flow velocity (due to its highly efficient cleaning of the filter surface) and has a very low energy consumption compared to conventional cross flow techniques. A cross flow effect (tangentially flow cleaning of the filter surface) is generated by the rotating of the filter discs and not by pumping of large volumes. The ceramic filter disc has better resistance to chemical and thermal stresses, high filtration flux and very long service life, and can be regenerated by backflushing or hot steam sterilization.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0239">Dynamic Cross Flow Filtration Unit and System</p><p id="p-0198" num="0240">Dynamic cross flow filtration such as rotational filtration provides maximum filter efficiency. The cross flow effect (tangential flow cleaning of the filter surface) is generated by rotating the filter discs and not by pumping large volumes across a fixed membrane as used in conventional (static) cross flow filtration systems. The extreme cross flow velocities generated at the surfaces of the rotating filter discs ensure a highly efficient cleaning of the filter surface, whilst consuming very low amounts of energy compared to conventional cross flow techniques.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0241">In the dynamic cross flow filtration units and systems of the invention, the rotating ceramic filter discs are typically assembled in a pressurised housing. The design of the discs shows drainage channels in the inside. The filtrate is transported from the outside to the inside of the discs. The rotation of the discs generates shear forces on the membrane surface. With this technique an increase of a filter cake is avoided resulting in a high filtration flux. Some of main parameters of the rotation filtration is the rotation speed for rotating the ceramic filter disc and solid content (concentration of liquids due to the removal of filtrate).</p><p id="p-0200" num="0242">The temperature has an effect on the viscosity of a protein solution and therefore also has an effect on the flux upon filtration with a membrane. The starting suspension to be used in the method of the invention will preferably have a temperature within the range from 0&#xb0; C. up to the temperature at which the protein concerned is denatured. The temperature is typically within the range of from about 10&#xb0; C. up to about 50&#xb0; C. In particular embodiments the temperature is within the range of from about 18&#xb0; C. up to about 35&#xb0; C. According to one preferred embodiment, the temperature of the second suspension tank (i.e., the tank comprising the fatty acid, preferably caprylic (octanoic) acid for precipitating one or more impurities in the first permeate of the first aspect of the invention or the second retentate of the second aspect of the invention, both enriched for the protein of interest) is at a temperature of between about 4&#xb0; C. to about 40&#xb0; C. More preferably, the fatty acid, preferably caprylic (octanoic) acid is combined with the first permeate of the first aspect of the invention or second retentate of the second aspect of the invention, in the second suspension tank at a temperature of between about 25&#xb0; C. to about 38&#xb0; C., optionally about 27&#xb0; C., about 32&#xb0; C. or about 37&#xb0; C. Optionally, both the permeate or retentate enriched for the protein of interest and the fatty acid are at a temperature of between about 4&#xb0; C. to about 40&#xb0; C., preferably about 25&#xb0; C. to about 38&#xb0; C., more preferably about 32&#xb0; C. when they are combined. In other words, while the permeate may be circulating in the filter units at one temperature, the temperature of the permeate may be increased prior to and/or during the period of incubation with the fatty acid in the second suspension tank.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0243">According to a further preferred embodiment, the temperature in the filter units is controlled, preferably between 2&#xb0; C. and 25&#xb0; C., more preferably at about 2&#xb0; C. to 10&#xb0; C. Such temperature ensures an optimum extraction process and separation process while maintaining the bio-reactivity of the protein of interest throughout the processes.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0244">Filtration is performed with a transmembrane filtration pressure that is the same as or below the level at which the membrane can withstand, depending on the material of the membrane to be used herein, for example with pressures of about 0.2 to about 3 bar. The transmembrane pressure is typically from 0.1 to 2.5 bar, preferably from 0.2 to 2.4 bar, more preferably from 0.4 to 2.0 bar, from 0.5 to 1.8 bar, from 0.6 to 1.6 bar, from 0.6 to 1.5 bar, from 0.7 to 1.5 bar, most preferably from 0.8 to 1.5 bar. According to another embodiment, a pressure of up to 2 bar, preferably between 0.1 to 2.0 bar, or about 1.5 bar, 1.0 bar or 0.5 bar is provided to filter units.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0245">According to another embodiment, the continuous extraction process in the filter units adapted to separate impurities/precipitant from the first and second suspensions, is further assisted by regulating the flow rate and/or the residence time of the suspension or the solution into the filter units and/or the flow rate of the retentate/raffinate comprising impurities/precipitant and/or the flow rate of the first permeate/filtrate enriched for the protein of interest. For instance, in one embodiment, the linear velocity of the suspension or the solution into the pressure vessel (filtration process unit) can be about 0.27 to 1.66 m/s. In another example, the linear velocity of the retentate comprising impurities/precipitant can be 0.25 to 1.33 m/s. In another example, the linear velocity of the permeate/filtrate enriched for the protein of interest can be 0.03 to 0.33 m/s. Linear velocity multiplied by the cross-sectional area gives the volumetric flow rate. In addition, a turbulence can be created in the first process unit as a result of the speed of the rotating filter discs, wherein the speed (sometimes referred to as tangential speed) can be between about 1 to 7 m/s. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the speed of the rotating disc filters is between 1 to 10 m/s. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the speed of the rotating disc filters is between 5 to 7 m/s. More preferably the speed of the rotating disc filters is 7 m/s at 60 Hertz (800 rpm). The rotating speed of the rotational cross-filter element is between about 600 rpm (50 Hz) and about 1600 rpm (100 Hz), preferably between about 800 rpm (60 Hz) and about 1200 rpm (80 Hz), preferably about 800 rpm (60 Hz), about 1000 rpm (70 Hz) or about 1200 rpm (80 Hz). As used herein, the rotating speed in Hz is intended to refer to the speed of the motor. This can be correlated with the speed in rpm using an appropriate calibration curve.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0246">This method allows a continuous extraction and a separation process to be realised for maximising the recovery of the protein of interest from the starting precipitate/material (i.e., the first suspension) or from the second suspension. Thanks to the extraction process, almost all the protein of interest is extracted from the protein-comprising precipitate and is recovered in subsequent stages. This method also allows the liquid or diluent e.g. buffer or water to be re-circulated in a closed system and hence the quantity of the liquid is maintained throughout the process while footprints (i.e. large tank volume) can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0247">In still further embodiments, the present invention includes a step of backflushing in conjunction with dynamic crossflow filtration, in order to flush contaminants that may have built up in the system. Typically, the methods and systems of the invention include alternating filtration and backflushing such that the filtration is temporarily paused (i.e., the feed pump is stopped) while a period of backflushing occurs, at regular intervals. where the flow of liquid into the filtration system is reversed,</p><p id="p-0206" num="0248">It will be understood that the frequency, duration and flow rate of the backflushing can be adjusted in order to maximize filtration efficiency and the period of filtration before backflushing is required.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0249">In certain preferred embodiments, the frequency of backflushing (and consequently, the period of filtration) is determined based on the total protein concentration or the number of impurities in the starting material. Consequently, it will be appreciated that backflushing will be required more frequently when filtering the first suspension compared to when the second suspension (which has relatively fewer impurities) is being filtered. In other words, as the total protein concentration and turbidity of the filtrate decreases, the frequency of the backflushing interval will also decrease (i.e. the period of time between backflushes increases and filtration can proceed for a longer period of time before a backflush is required).</p><p id="p-0208" num="0250">Protein concentration and turbidity of the filtrate can be monitored by various methods known in the art. In certain embodiments, the methods of the invention and systems of the invention include the use of an in-line detection unit that enables measurement of protein concentration and/or turbidity as the filtrate passes into and/or out of the filtration unit. In further embodiments, a dual wavelength photometer can be employed to facilitate simultaneous assessment of protein concentration (e.g., by detecting absorbance of the solution at a wavelength suitable to detecting protein concentration, such as in the range of 260-280 nm, preferably about 280 nm) and solution turbidity (e.g., by detecting absorbance of the solution at a wavelength suitable for detecting light scattering caused by the presence of particulate matter, such as absorbance at a wavelength in the range of 400 nm to 900 nm, preferably about 600 nm to about 880 nm). Dual wavelength photometric devices for use in conjunction with chromatographic and filtration units are well known in the art.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0251">In certain examples, the frequency of backflushing is at 15 second intervals, 30 second, 45 second, 60 second, 75 second, 90 second, 105 second, 120 second, 135 second, 150 second, 200 second, 230 second, 260 second, 300 second, 330 second, 360 second, 400 second, 1000 second, 2000 second, 3000 second, 4000 second or greater intervals.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0252">It will be appreciated that the duration of the backflushing interval will vary with the filtration area and number of discs requiring backflushing. The larger the filtration area, typically, the larger the volume of backflushing buffer that is required and therefore the duration of the backflushing will also be dictated by the flow rate during backflushing. The skilled person will be well able to determine suitable duration, frequency, and flow rates for backflushing, depending on the size of the system and number of discs being employed. In certain examples, the duration of backflushing is approximately 5 seconds, approximately 10 seconds, approximately 15 seconds, approximately 30 seconds, approximately 45 seconds, approximately 60 seconds, or longer.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0253">It will be appreciated that for practical reasons (and to maximize filtration efficiency) the duration of the backflushing interval is typically less than the duration of the filtration interval. In certain embodiments, the duration of the backflushing interval is at least one quarter, one eighth, one tenth, one sixteenth or smaller than the duration of the filtration interval.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0254">It will further be appreciated that the flow rate that is used during backflushing may be the same or different to the flow rate used for filtration. In certain embodiments, the flow rate during dynamic filtration is in the range of approximately 15 to 100 L/hour, preferably in the range of about 20 to 50 L/hour (about 200 ml/min to about 1 L/min, preferably about 300 to about 900 ml/min, more preferably about 300 to 600 ml/min). Preferably the flow rate of backflushing is lower than the flow rate used for filtration such that in certain embodiments, the flow rate of backflushing is in the range of about 100 to about 400 times slower than the flow rate used for filtration.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0255">In certain embodiment, the backflushing is performed with the same buffer comprised in the first or second suspensions. Alternatively, the backflushing may be performed using the permeate that is obtained during the concentration process (e.g., when using ultrafiltration coupled to dynamic cross flow filtration to concentrate the filtrate obtained from dynamic cross flow filtration).</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example 1</heading><p id="p-0214" num="0256">Process Step 1</p><p id="p-0215" num="0257">The starting material used to prepare the first suspension is either Precipitate I+II+III or Precipitate A. An optimal filtration is defined by the retention of filter aid in the suspension while IgG is fully extracted from the paste and recovered in the filtrate in the shortest amount of time. Process 1 results in a filtrate that is filter aid-free. However, impurities such as IgA, IgM, and albumin will still be present. These will be removed to a great extent using octanoic acid (OA) in Process Step 2.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0258">The starting material is resuspended in the desired buffer (1:5) using an impeller mixer and then transferred to tank 1 (the suspension tank). The suspension is pumped to the first processing unit to start the continuous extraction (CE) process. The unfiltered suspension returns to the suspension tank as retentate. This circulation is maintained while solubilized proteins are filtered across the ceramic discs. The filtrate containing IgG and various impurities is collected in a second tank (filtrate tank). When a defined volume in the second tank is reached, the concentration process is started using systems 2 and 3 (comprising ultrafiltration and diafiltration membranes). The transmembrane pressure (TMP) is regulated to ensure that the combined permeate flow from systems 2 and 3 equals the filtrate flow from system 1, ensuring a constant volume in the suspension tank during the extraction process. The filtration unit is stopped once the protein concentration in the filtrate is below a defined threshold. At this time point, the final dilution ratio of &#x2265;1:25 is reached. The concentration is continued until the protein concentration in the collection tank reaches 17-20 g/L.

The OA-suspension is pumped to the first processing unit to start the continuous extraction process. The unfiltered suspension returns to the suspension tank as retentate. This circulation is maintained while IgG is filtered across the ceramic discs. The OA-filtrate comprising IgG is collected in a second tank (filtrate tank). When a defined volume in the second tank is reached, the concentration process is started using systems 2 and 3 (comprising ultrafiltration and diafiltration membranes). The transmembrane pressure (TMP) is regulated to ensure that the combined permeate flow from systems 2 and 3 equals the filtrate flow from system 1, ensuring a constant volume in the suspension tank during the extraction process.

In order to reduce development costs and maximize IgG recovery, the minimum amount of OA required to precipitate impurities, while reducing the likelihood of IgG loss, must first be determined by laboratory experiments. For this reason, the first concentrate (step 1) was prepared as described in Example 1. The first concentrate obtained from the CE system was used as a starting material for OA Experiments at lab scale.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example 2</heading><p id="p-0221" num="0263">Reduction in Octanoic Acid (OA) for Impurity Removal and IgG Recovery</p><p id="p-0222" num="0264">This example describes the process for determining the minimum amount of OA required to remove impurities from filtered IgG compositions produced according to Process Step 1. Two important criteria for the minimum amount of OA used for precipitation are: 1) achieving a high IgG yield and 2) maintaining a high Quality Attribute (QAT).</p><p id="p-0223" num="0265">Experiment 1</p><p id="p-0224" num="0266">For this experiment Cohn I+II+III paste (2 kg containing 240 gram of Celpure C100) was suspended at a first dilution ratio of 1:6 in 10 mM sodium acetate and 10 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate, pH 4.3-4.4 buffer at 4&#xb0; C. in the first tank. The suspension in the first tank was stirred at 4&#xb0; C. with a paddle stirrer for approximately 4 hours. Prior to starting the experiments, the first filtration unit (containing six ceramic filter discs, AD 152 mm with 0.2 &#x3bc;m membranes; filter area=0.216 m<sup>2</sup>) was stored overnight in cold water (1&#xb0; C.). At the start of the experiment the water was drained from the unit and the suspension was fed into the unit. The suspension was then recirculated for several minutes between the first tank and the first process unit prior to beginning the filtration process. The ceramic filters in the first process unit were operated at 80 Hz, a rotation speed of 1200 rpm and a feed pressure of 2.2 bar; the over-flow pressure was 0.4-0.8 bar. The permeate from the first process unit was collected in a second tank and then fed into a second unit referred to as the (ultrafiltration/diafiltration) UF/DF unit. The UF/DF unit is a Novoflow dynamic filtration device containing 15 ceramic disks, with 7.0 nm membranes; filter area 0.5 m<sup>2</sup>. The permeate flow rate of the UF/DF system was 125-180 mL/min. The UF/DF system was started once the first filtrate was collected in the second tank. The retentate of the UF/DF system flows back into the second tank while the permeate flows back into the first tank. The volume of permeate fed back into the first tank contributes to the overall volume of liquid mixed with the paste (i.e. the final dilution factor). In this experiment, the overall recirculation volume was &#x2265;25 L per kg of paste (i.e. 1:25 final dilution factor).</p><p id="p-0225" num="0267">The first concentrate from this experiment has a conductivity of 1.2 mS/cm. The conductivity of the protein solution was adjusted to 8.0 mS/cm with 3.15 M sodium acetate (NaAc) buffer.

Briefly, the starting material (Precipitate I+II+III or Precipitate A) is resuspended in the resuspension buffer (1:5) using an impeller mixer, at a temperature between 18-22&#xb0; C., and then transferred to the suspension tank.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0296">The suspension is pumped to the first processing unit to start the continuous extraction process. The unfiltered suspension returns to the suspension tank as retentate. This circulation is maintained while solubilized proteins are filtered across the ceramic discs. The filtrate containing IgG is collected in a second tank (filtrate tank). When a defined volume in the second tank (filtrate tank) is reached, the concentration process is started using ultrafiltration and diafiltration membranes (systems 2 and 3). The transmembrane pressure (TMP) is regulated to ensure that the combined permeate flow from systems 2 and 3 is slightly higher than the filtrate flow from system 1, ensuring a constant volume in the suspension tank during the extraction process. The permeate is also used for filling the backflush tank. The filtration unit is stopped once the protein concentration in the filtrate is below a defined threshold.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0297">The first concentrate, (filtrate/concentrate) is adjusted to total protein concentration of between about 15-18 g/L).
