Therefore, an area that may be occupied by a capacitor in a unit cell is also reduced. For example, in a semiconductor device such as dynamic random access memory (DRAM), the area occupied by the unit cell is reduced as a degree of integration increases. Moreover, required capacitance is maintained or increases. Due to the reduced area and capacitance requirements, an aspect ratio of the lower electrodes configuring the capacitor significantly increases.
