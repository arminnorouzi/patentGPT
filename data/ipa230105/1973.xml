Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to a carrier, and more particularly, to a carrier having functions to form a wagon when connected to at least one identical carrier.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Related-art carriers include a flatbed trolley including a handle and a placement base. The handle extends vertically upward with respect to the placement base on which a load is to be placed.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">When a single related-art flatbed trolley is used, an area of a placement surface is sometimes insufficient. In order to expand the placement surface, a flatbed trolley having the following structure is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2009-61947. The flatbed trolley can be coupled to another identical flatbed trolley to achieve a large placement surface. The flatbed trolley includes a handle, which is a flatbed trolley accessory and is attached so as to be removable as needed. As exemplified in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2009-61947, however, the handle extends vertically upward with respect to the placement surface. Such a handle restricts a direction of connecting of the flatbed trolleys, allowing no flexibility in combination of the flatbed trolleys.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Further, it is not easy to carry the placement base alone without the handle. Thus, the placement surface may have grip holes for carrying the placement base as described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2009-61947. In this case, when the flatbed trolley is used to transport a load, the grip holes cannot be closed even temporarily so as to be able to function as a substitute for a handle as needed. Thus, a small load may be dropped through the grip hole.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of this, as means to solve the above-mentioned problem, according to the present invention, there is provided a carrier, including: a load-carrying platform having a plate-like shape with a flat upper surface and a lower surface; caster mounting portions formed on the lower surface of the load-carrying platform; a handle that extends outward from a first side edge portion of the load-carrying platform, and has an upper surface with an engaged portion being one of a recess and a through hole; and an engaging portion that projects downward from a lower surface of a second side edge portion opposed to the first side edge portion of the load-carrying platform and is engageable with the engaged portion.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is preferred that the load-carrying platform have pillar vertical installation holes formed on the upper surface and pillar-head insertion holes formed on the lower surface. A plurality of carriers are connected together with use of pillar members that are inserted into the pillar vertical installation holes of the load-carrying platform of the carrier arranged at a lower level and the pillar-head insertion holes of the load-carrying platform of the carrier arranged at an upper level, thereby forming a multi-tier assembly.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The pillar vertical installation holes of the load-carrying platform may be closable by caps.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The carrier may include: a second handle that extends outward from a third side edge portion that is perpendicular to the first side edge portion with the handle and a horizontal plane including the upper surface of the load-carrying platform when viewed from a center of the horizontal plane; and a second engaging portion that projects downward from a lower surface of a fourth side edge portion opposed to the third side edge portion.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The caster mounting portions may be classified into: a first caster mounting portion group including first caster mounting portions arranged in an annular pattern along a peripheral edge of the load-carrying platform; and a second caster mounting portion group including second caster mounting portions arranged in an annular pattern on an inner side of the first caster mounting portion group.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to one aspect of this disclosure, the carrier including the handle having functions and effects of enabling connection to another identical carrier can be achieved. Further, when a plurality of carriers according to the present invention are connected together by using the handle, the upper surfaces of the plurality of carriers connected together achieve an integral and flat placement surface.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another aspect of this disclosure, the engaging portion formed at the peripheral edge of the load-carrying platform and the engaged portion of the handle enable unrestricted connection of a plurality of load-carrying platforms in a horizontal direction and a fore-and-aft direction.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, a plurality of carriers can be assembled in a vertical direction to form a multi-tier wagon. A plurality of thus assembled wagons can also be connected together in the fore-and-aft direction and the horizontal direction through engagement between the engaging portions and the engaged portions.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a carrier when viewed from diagonally below.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a top view of the carrier.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a bottom view of the carrier.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a side view of the carrier.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective view for illustrating mounting of caps onto a placement surface of a load-carrying platform.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a perspective view for illustrating a state in which a plurality of carriers are assembled in a vertical direction with use of pillar members and casters into a multi-tier wagon.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a view for illustrating a plurality of carriers connected together in a horizontal direction.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a view for illustrating a plurality of carriers connected together in the horizontal direction and a fore-and-aft direction.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a view for illustrating a plurality of carriers connected together in the horizontal direction and the vertical direction.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a view for illustrating a plurality of carriers connected together in the horizontal direction, the fore-and-aft direction, and the vertical direction.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a bottom view of the plurality of carriers connected together in the horizontal direction.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a sectional view taken along the line A-A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a view for illustrating the pillar member.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref> is a top view of the pillar member, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref> is a bottom view of the pillar member.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a sectional view taken along the line B-B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a view of the cap.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is a view for illustrating a state in which boxes are placed on the placement surface.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENT</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Now, an embodiment of the present invention is described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Components having substantially the same functions and configurations are denoted by the same reference symbols in this specification and the drawings, and an overlapping description thereof is herein omitted.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a carrier <b>1</b> includes a load-carrying platform <b>2</b>, caster mounting portions <b>3</b>, and a handle <b>9</b>. The caster mounting portions <b>3</b> are formed on a lower surface of the load-carrying platform <b>2</b>. The handle <b>9</b> extends outward from a first side edge portion of the load-carrying platform <b>2</b>. The handle <b>9</b> has a through hole <b>7</b> that allows fingers to be inserted when the carrier <b>1</b> is to be moved. Further, an engaging portion <b>10</b> that projects downward is formed on a lower surface of a second side edge portion of the load-carrying platform <b>2</b>, which is opposed to the first side edge portion. When two carriers <b>1</b> are placed so that the load-carrying platforms <b>2</b> thereof are adjacent to each other, the engaging portion <b>10</b> formed on the load-carrying platform <b>2</b> of one of the carriers <b>1</b> is inserted into the through hole <b>7</b> of the handle <b>9</b> of another one of the carriers <b>1</b> to enable connection of the carriers <b>1</b>. At the time of connection, the through hole <b>7</b> functions as an engaged portion <b>6</b> that is engageable with the engaging portion <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The load-carrying platform <b>2</b> is formed in a plate-like shape having a flat upper surface as a placement surface <b>28</b>. According to this embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the load-carrying platform <b>2</b> has a rectangular shape in top view. The load-carrying platform <b>2</b> may be square or quadrilateral rectangular with opposed sides having the same length. When a plurality of carriers <b>1</b> are connected together, the rectangular shape of the load-carrying platform <b>2</b> enables side surfaces <b>26</b> of the load-carrying platforms <b>2</b> of the carriers <b>1</b>, which are adjacent to each other, to be brought into close contact with each other. As a result, the placement surfaces <b>28</b> of the load-carrying platforms <b>2</b> form an integral placement surface. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the load-carrying platform <b>2</b> has the side surfaces <b>26</b> that extend downward from upper ends of side edge portions of the load-carrying platform <b>2</b> when the load-carrying platform <b>2</b> is viewed from above. The side surfaces <b>26</b> are structural portions that form the side edge portions of the load-carrying platform <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the handle <b>9</b> extends outward beyond a lower end of one of the side surfaces <b>26</b> of the load-carrying platform <b>2</b>. The handle <b>9</b> has the engaged portion <b>6</b>, which is a recess or the through hole <b>7</b> formed in an upper surface. The handle <b>9</b> may be formed to extend beyond any of the side surfaces <b>26</b>. Specifically, the handle <b>9</b> extends horizontally outward beyond a lower end of one of the side surfaces <b>26</b> of the load-carrying platform <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Further, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a second handle <b>9</b><i>a </i>may also be formed. The second handle <b>9</b><i>a </i>extends outward beyond a lower end of the side surface <b>26</b> that is perpendicular to the side surface <b>26</b> with the handle <b>9</b> and a horizontal plane including the upper surface of the load-carrying platform <b>2</b> when viewed from a center of the plane of the load-carrying platform <b>2</b>. That is, the second handle <b>9</b><i>a </i>is formed to extend beyond the side surface <b>26</b> that is adjacent to the side surface <b>26</b> with the handle <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As another embodiment, the handle <b>9</b> may extend horizontally from an outer surface of one of the side surfaces <b>26</b>. In this case, it is preferred that a cutout be formed in a lower end of the side surface <b>26</b> that is opposed to the side surface <b>26</b> with the handle <b>9</b> so that a position of the cutout corresponds to a position of the handle <b>9</b>. This structure allows the handle <b>9</b> to be inserted into the cutout. The engaging portion <b>10</b> is formed on the lower surface of the load-carrying platform <b>2</b> so as to be located on an inner side of the cutout. As a result, a plurality of carriers <b>1</b> can be connected together.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Further, the handle <b>9</b> has the engaged portion <b>6</b> being the through hole <b>7</b>, which is formed by molding. The engaged portion <b>6</b> may have any shape that allows engagement with the engaging portion <b>10</b>, and is not required to be the through hole <b>7</b>. For example, the engaged portion <b>6</b> may be a recess formed in the upper surface of the handle <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The second handle <b>9</b><i>a </i>has a second engaged portion <b>6</b><i>a </i>being a second through hole <b>7</b><i>a</i>, which is formed by molding. The second engaged portion <b>6</b><i>a </i>may have any shape that allows engagement with a second engaging portion <b>10</b><i>a</i>, and is not required to be the second through hole <b>7</b><i>a</i>. For example, the second engaged portion <b>6</b><i>a </i>may be a recess formed in an upper surface of the second handle <b>9</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The engaging portion <b>10</b> is formed to project downward from the lower surface of the load-carrying platform <b>2</b>.

As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, the shaft portion <b>23</b><i>a </i>is formed to have a substantially L-like cross section. The first ends of the pillar members <b>22</b> are fitted into the pillar vertical installation holes <b>20</b> of the load-carrying platform <b>2</b> of the carrier <b>1</b> arranged at an upper level, and the second ends of the pillar member <b>22</b> are fitted into the pillar-head insertion holes formed on the load-carrying platform <b>2</b> of the carrier <b>1</b> arranged at a lower level to thereby assemble the carriers <b>1</b> in the vertical direction. Then, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, when a set of boxes <b>29</b>, which has substantially the same rectangular shape as that of the placement surface <b>28</b>, is placed on the placement surface <b>28</b> of the load-carrying platform <b>2</b> of the carrier <b>1</b> arranged at the lower level, lateral sides of each of four corners of the set of boxes <b>29</b> placed on the placement surface <b>28</b> and adjacent two sides of a corresponding one of the pillar members <b>22</b> are brought into contact with each other.

Further, the first ends of the pillar members (referred to as &#x201c;upper-level pillar members&#x201d;) <b>22</b> are inserted into the pillar vertical installation holes <b>20</b> of the load-carrying platform <b>2</b> of the carrier <b>1</b> arranged at the upper level. In this case, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the pillar vertical installation hole <b>20</b> and a corresponding one of the pillar-head insertion holes <b>21</b>, which is formed immediately below the pillar vertical installation hole <b>20</b>, form a single integral hole. Thus, the second end of the lower-level pillar member <b>22</b> and the first end of the upper-level pillar member <b>22</b> are fitted into two spaces in the single integral hole, which is separated by the rib <b>27</b>, respectively. The pillar vertical installation hole <b>20</b> and the pillar-head insertion hole <b>21</b> are formed to receive two ends of the pillar member <b>22</b>, respectively. Thus, both ends of the pillar member <b>22</b> are closely fitted into the pillar vertical installation hole <b>20</b> and the pillar-head insertion hole <b>21</b> without leaving a gap, respectively. As a result, when the carriers <b>1</b> are assembled with use of the pillar members <b>22</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, there is a reduced possibility that the pillar members <b>22</b> may sway, improving stability.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Next, how to use the cap <b>24</b> is described.

The cap <b>24</b> is fitted in such a manner that an outer frame of the cap <b>24</b> is fitted inside the frame defining the pillar vertical installation hole <b>20</b> without leaving a gap. As a result, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, when the carriers <b>1</b> are assembled together with use of the pillar members <b>22</b>, the load-carrying platform <b>2</b> of the carrier <b>1</b> located at the uppermost position provides a flat surface without recesses.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Now, a method of connecting the carriers <b>1</b> according to the present invention together in the horizontal direction for use is described.
