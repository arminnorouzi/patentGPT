Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Quantum computers are special computers that perform high-speed computations by using the unique physical properties of quantum in quantum mechanics, and operate based on the quantum mechanical phenomena such as quantum superposition and quantum entanglement.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As a concept in contrast to traditional classical computers, quantum computers in a broad sense may include omnipotent quantum computers, non-omnipotent quantum computers, and non-classical computers. All of the omnipotent quantum computers, the non-omnipotent quantum computers, and the non-classical computers may perform computations using quantum mechanical phenomena in common, but they may be different in terms of the presence or absence of error tolerance for correcting an error occurring during computations or a high level of error tolerance.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Moreover, quantum computers may be classified into an omnipotent type using a quantum circuit and a quantum gate based on a quantum circuit model and a specialized type performing annealing computation based on a model called quantum annealing.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The quantum computer may perform computations in a minimum unit called a qubit, and a qubit element for performing computations in the unit of a qubit may be physically implemented on a board of the quantum computer. A bit used in an information storage element of a classical computer may have a state of 0 or 1, whereas a qubit may have states of 0 and 1 at the same time based on a superposition phenomenon, and qubits may interact based on entanglement instead of being independently controlled, such that 2<sup>N </sup>information may be generated when N qubits are used.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, as the number of qubits included in the quantum computer increases, the amount of information processible by the quantum computer may exponentially increase.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Quantum computation may be processed in the order of initializing a qubit, performing quantum gate computation or annealing computation, and then finally reading a computation result, and in particular, a status of quantum stored in a cavity of a qubit is likely to be broken, such that a function to prevent an error of quantum computation and correct an already occurring error may be required.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A quantum computer including 1,000 computing qubit elements may need one billion error-correcting qubit elements. Moreover, the mainstream of the quantum computers may use a superconductor, and thus, hardware or a methodology for stably performing signal transmission or power supply to a qubit element at an extremely low temperature around an absolute zero point may be desired.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description.

In a process where the power source <b>1170</b> supplies power to a module included in the computer system <b>1100</b>, the n-port active circulator <b>1130</b> may operate to cut off power to some modules according to a port number connected to the power source <b>1170</b>.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0146">The active circulator described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>11</b></figref> may be manufactured in a way that the active filter and the power divider are serially connected to form a pair and pairs are connected to form a loop.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0147">The active circulator according to the present disclosure may be easily miniaturized, unlike a typical circulator in which a permanent magnet including a ferrite material is necessarily included. When the operating frequency of the typical circulator including the ferrite material increases, a biasing field required for an operation of the typical circulator becomes stronger, and thus a permanent magnet having a strong magnetic force is necessary for the circulator, and generally, the magnetic force of the magnet is proportional to the size of the magnet, such that the circulator including the ferrite material is limited in miniaturization. In contrast, the active circulator of one or more embodiments may be easily miniaturized, and thus, the active circulator of one or more embodiments may be manufactured as a single chip through an on-chip or on-board (printed circuit board (PCB)) scheme.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0148">The active circulator of one or more embodiments may have a loop form, and thus may be symmetric to all ports due to a symmetric structure. For example, 3-port active quasi circulators manufactured using the active filters may have asymmetric characteristics because a signal is transmitted from the port 2 to the port 3 or from the port 2 to the port 1, but a signal from the port 1 to the port 3 is blocked, whereas the active circulator of one or more embodiments may operate as a circulator due to a symmetric structure regardless of a port.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0149">Moreover, the active circulator of one or more embodiments may be implemented by combining the active filter having a gain or a transmission coefficient that is easily adjustable with the power divider, such that by adjusting the gain or the transmission coefficient of the active filter, the active circulator having proper isolation and transmission coefficient may be implemented. That is, the active filter may be manufactured based on a variable gain amplifier, such that the active circulator having narrow band or broad band characteristics may be easily manufactured.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0150">Moreover, the active circulator of one or more embodiments may be applied to a controller for quantum computation. When the active circulator according to the present disclosure is applied to a QRAM-based quantum computer, one more line necessary for QRAM may be reduced, thus reducing a hardware resource and significantly improving hardware complexity.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0151">The active circulator of one or more embodiments is extendable (wide extendability) from three ports to n ports, thus functioning as a module for selectively blocking power or a signal in a general computer system as well as a quantum computer system and at the same time, being configured to transmit/receive, thereby being applicable to a wideband full duplex radio system with a double-improved spectral efficiency.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0152">The circulator of one or more embodiments may be easy to miniaturize when compared to the typical circulator including the ferrite material.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0153">Moreover, the circulator of one or more embodiments may have a symmetric structure, thus implementing the same isolation for each port.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0154">The circulator of one or more embodiments may implement high isolation in a broad band when compared to an existing cascode-type circulator.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0155">Furthermore, the circulator of one or more embodiments may be included as a component to configure a system of a computer including a general radio frequency (RF) module as well as a quantum computer, thereby uniformly implementing isolations higher than a certain level for a plurality of ports.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0156">The QPUs, DAC/ADCs, multimode storage cavities, active circulators, qubits, structures, insulating layers, first electrode lines, second electrode lines, loop structures, Josephson junctions, dielectric layers, substrates, power sources, quantum computer systems, QRAMs, qubit elements, ports, power dividers, active filters, pairs, computer system <b>1100</b>, processors, n-port active circulators, memories, n bit elements, QPU <b>110</b>, DAC/ADC <b>115</b>, multimode storage cavity <b>130</b>, active circulator <b>150</b>, qubits QB<b>10</b>, structure LL<b>10</b>, insulating layer NL<b>10</b>, first electrode line E<b>10</b>, second electrode line E<b>20</b>, loop structure P<b>10</b>, Josephson junction J<b>10</b>, loop structure P<b>11</b>, insulating layer NL<b>11</b>, Josephson junction J<b>11</b>, loop structure P<b>11</b>, dielectric layer D<b>11</b>, active circulator <b>300</b>, substrate SUB<b>11</b>, power source V<b>11</b>, quantum computer system <b>400</b>, QPU <b>410</b>, circulator <b>430</b>, QRAM <b>450</b>, cavity <b>451</b>, qubit element <b>453</b>, power source <b>470</b>, port 1 <b>510</b>, port 2 <b>530</b>, port 3 <b>550</b>, power dividers <b>610</b>, <b>630</b>, and <b>650</b>, active filters <b>610</b> AF, <b>630</b> AF, and <b>650</b> AF, power dividers <b>810</b>, <b>830</b>, <b>850</b>, and <b>870</b>, and active filters <b>810</b>AF, <b>830</b> AF, <b>850</b> AF, and <b>870</b> AF, pair <b>1010</b>, computer system <b>1100</b>, processor <b>1110</b>, n-port active circulator <b>1130</b>, memory <b>1150</b>, power source <b>1170</b>, n bit elements <b>1151</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>1151</b>-<i>n</i>, and other apparatuses, devices, units, modules, and components described herein with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>11</b></figref> are implemented by or representative of hardware components.
