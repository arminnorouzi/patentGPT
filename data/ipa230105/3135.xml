The bushings are utilized to maintain alignment and/or control relative movement between components during operation. In some applications, bushings such as those utilized in variable stator vane assemblies in jet engine compressors or gas turbine engines, are often subjected to extreme operating conditions, such as extreme forces, pressures, and/or temperatures. To withstand these extreme operating conditions, these bushings are commonly formed from graphite or other high performance polymeric materials. However, these materials still present considerable temperature limitations. Further, oxidation of these materials can impact the coefficient of friction between components and negatively affect performance and reliability. Accordingly, the industry continues to demand improvements in bushing technology for such applications.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">So that the manner in which the features and advantages of the embodiments are attained and can be understood in more detail, a more particular description may be had by reference to the embodiments thereof that are illustrated in the appended drawings.

In some embodiments, the assembly <b>100</b> may be a jet engine compressor or a gas turbine engine. More particularly, in some embodiments, the assembly may be a variable stator vane assembly of a jet engine compressor or a gas turbine engine. The assembly <b>100</b> may generally comprise an outer component, such as a stator vane housing <b>102</b>, and an inner component, such as a movable or rotatable stator vane <b>104</b>. The housing <b>102</b> may generally be disposed annularly about the stator vane <b>104</b>. Further, in some embodiments, the housing <b>102</b> and/or the stator vane <b>104</b> may be formed from a metallic material. In some embodiments, the metallic material may comprise steel, stainless steel, titanium, or an alloy thereof.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">An annular bushing <b>150</b> may generally be at least partially disposed within the housing <b>102</b> and annularly about the stator vane <b>104</b>. The bushing <b>150</b> may comprise a flange <b>152</b>, a barrel <b>154</b> extending from the flange <b>152</b>, and a central aperture <b>156</b> extending through the flange <b>152</b> and the barrel <b>154</b>. More specifically, the bushing <b>150</b> may be disposed such that the barrel <b>154</b> is disposed within the housing <b>102</b> and radially between the housing <b>102</b> and the stator vane <b>104</b>, and the flange <b>152</b> is disposed adjacent an outer surface <b>106</b> of the housing <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, the flange <b>152</b> may substantially abut the outer surface <b>106</b> of the housing <b>102</b>.

In some embodiments, a sleeve <b>110</b> may be disposed about the barrel <b>154</b> and in contact with the housing <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, the sleeve <b>110</b> may be formed from a metallic material. In some embodiments, the metallic material of the sleeve <b>110</b> may substantially match the metallic material of the housing <b>102</b> and comprise steel, stainless steel, titanium, or an alloy thereof.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The bushing <b>150</b> may generally be configured to maintain alignment between the stator vane <b>104</b> and the bushing <b>150</b>, the housing <b>102</b> and the bushing <b>150</b>, the stator vane <b>104</b> and the housing <b>102</b>, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the bushing <b>150</b> may be configured to maintain an axial alignment and/or center the stator vane <b>104</b> within the housing <b>102</b>. To prevent temperature restrictions on operation, the bushing <b>150</b> may generally be formed from a high temperature resistant material, such as a ceramic material, that allows the bushing <b>150</b> to reach higher temperatures without sacrificing application requirements, such as controlling or preventing air leakage, minimizing friction, and minimizing degradation of the bushing <b>150</b> under higher temperature friction loads.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further, the bushing <b>150</b> may be designed to have beneficial tolerances between the barrel <b>154</b> of the bushing <b>150</b> and the housing <b>102</b>, the stator vane <b>104</b>, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the barrel <b>154</b> of the bushing <b>150</b> may comprise a substantially zero tolerance with the housing <b>102</b>, such that the bushing <b>150</b> comprises a press-fit installation with the housing <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, the barrel <b>154</b> of the bushing <b>150</b> may comprise a minimal tolerance with the housing <b>102</b>, such that the bushing <b>150</b> comprises minimal movement within the housing <b>102</b>.

Further, it will be appreciated that the tolerance between the barrel <b>154</b> of the bushing <b>150</b> and the housing <b>100</b> may be between any of these minimum and maximum values, such as at least 0.005% to not greater than 5%, or even at least 0.10% to not greater than 0.20%.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the minimal tolerance between the bushing <b>150</b> and the housing <b>102</b> and/or a low coefficient of friction (COF) between the bushing <b>150</b> and the housing <b>102</b> may reduce or minimize local forces applied to the bushing <b>150</b> by the stator vane <b>104</b> caused by movement of the stator vane <b>104</b> within the bushing <b>150</b>. This reduction or minimization of forces may prevent or substantially reduce bending moments applied to the bushing <b>150</b> resulting from radial and/or axial forces caused by operation of the gas turbine engine. Accordingly, the bushing <b>150</b> may comprise a longer life span than a traditional graphite or polymeric bushing, while also allowing the bushing <b>150</b> to operate at much higher temperatures than traditional graphite or polymeric bushings.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The bushing <b>150</b> may generally be formed from a ceramic material. In some embodiments, the bushing <b>150</b> may be formed from a ceramic material comprising a CTE equal to or lower than a CTE of the housing <b>102</b>, the stator vane <b>104</b>, or a combination thereof.
