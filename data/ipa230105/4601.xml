The calculations made by AM&#x26;V layer <b>412</b> may be based on building system energy models and/or equipment models for individual BMS devices or subsystems.

FDD layer <b>416</b> may use some content of the data stores to identify faults at the equipment level (e.g., specific chiller, specific AHU, specific terminal unit, etc.) and other content to identify faults at component or subsystem levels. For example, building subsystems <b>428</b> may generate temporal (i.e., time-series) data indicating the performance of BMS <b>400</b> and the various components thereof. The data generated by building subsystems <b>428</b> may include measured or calculated values that exhibit statistical characteristics and provide information about how the corresponding system or process (e.g., a temperature control process, a flow control process, etc.) is performing in terms of error from its setpoint.

System <b>600</b> is generally configured to generate a semantic site model for a BMS based on a BMS ontology data model. The BMS ontology data model generally describes objects in a BMS (e.g., equipment, spaces, points) and object relationships in a semantic or natural manner (e.g., using a semantic description schema). A BMS ontology data model can be applied to a BMS through the mapping or classifying of building metadata to the BMS ontology data model. In this regard, the BMS ontology data model may &#x201c;standardize&#x201d; a BMS (e.g., the BMS configuration data) according to the BMS ontology data model, to provide for improved monitoring, reporting, and commanding of the BMS with minimal user interaction.

Object definition generator <b>612</b> is generally configured to obtain unmapped object definitions (e.g., from an object database <b>620</b>), and to apply user preferences and an ontology data model to the unmapped object definitions. An unmapped object definition is generally an abstraction of an object associated with a BMS. For example, an unmapped object definition may include generic or unmodified parameters, identifiers, labels, etc., associated with a BMS object (e.g., equipment, a space, a point). In general, an unmapped object definition includes at least a name and an identifier. In some embodiments, the unmapped object definitions may be structured according to a first data schema (e.g., BACnet). Accordingly, the name and/or identifier for an unmapped object definition may not be in a semantic format. For example, the unmapped object definition may include parameters and/or identifiers in a machine language, or in a schema that is not configured to be human-readable.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0099">In some embodiments, an unmapped object definition also includes a set of point definitions typically associated with the BMS object reprinted by the unmapped object definition. For example, an unmapped object definition for a chiller type BMS object may include a plurality of point definitions corresponding to points typically associated with a chiller (e.g., outlet water temperature, pump speed, pressure, etc.). Object database <b>620</b> may include a library of previously defined BMS object definitions associated with a variety of objects commonly found in a BMS. For example, object database <b>620</b> may include a library of unmapped object definitions corresponding to any of the building equipment described above (e.g., building subsystems <b>428</b>), and to any of a plurality of spaces or points in a building site.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0100">Object definition generator <b>612</b> may obtain an ontology data model <b>622</b> in order to generate mapped object definitions from the unmapped object definitions. Ontology data model <b>622</b> is generally a common data model that defines BMS objects according to a semantic description schema. Ontology data model <b>622</b> may include standardized names, types, parameters, etc., for a variety of objects found in a BMS (e.g., spaces, equipment, and points). Ontology data model <b>622</b> can include a tag library comprising a set of tags that may be applied to unmapped object definitions. The tags may include semantic descriptions corresponding to each of the parameters of an object definition. For example, the tags may include semantic (i.e., plain language) labels, short names, search criteria, etc., that may be applied to an unmapped object definition. Ontology data model <b>622</b> may also define standardized parameters for each type of tag stored in the tag library. Further, ontology data model <b>622</b> may define relationships between tags. Accordingly, applying ontology data model <b>622</b> to unmapped object definitions may not only translate the unmapped object definitions into a common and/or semantic description schema, but ontology data model <b>622</b> may also define relationships between object definitions semantically. For example, ontology data model <b>622</b> may indicate that an object definition for a chiller &#x201c;serves&#x201d; an object definition for an air handler. In some embodiments, ontology data model <b>622</b> is retrieved from a semantic model database, as described in any of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/379,646, U.S. patent application Ser.

Based on the object name, object definition generator <b>612</b> may determine a corresponding tag or tag set from the ontology data model <b>622</b>, and may apply or map the tag or tag set to the unmapped object definition. In some embodiments, this also includes applying any user preferences to the unmapped object.

More specifically, classification engine <b>614</b> may classify BMS objects identified from the BMS configuration data by identifying one or more BMS objects that satisfy (i.e., match) a mapped object definition in the semantic model, and by classifying or mapping the one or more identified BMS objects to the mapped object definition. In this regard, any parameters of the mapped object definition (e.g., associated point definitions) may also be associated with the one or more identified BMS objects. For example, the one or more BMS object may be classified according to a model class assigned to the mapped object definition and/or the point definitions associated with the mapped object definition. A semantic site model may be generated for a BMS or a building site based on this classification of the BMS objects associated with the BMS or building site according to the mapped object definitions and assigned model classes. In some embodiments, the semantic site model is generated in a similar manner to the semantic models described in any of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/379,646, U.S. patent application Ser.

For example, classification engine <b>614</b> may mine a BMS to identify equipment (e.g., HVAC equipment) and to identify spaces served by the equipment. In this regard, classification engine <b>614</b> may be configured to generate and/or update the BMS configuration based on the identification of BMS objects.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0104">Memory <b>610</b> is also shown to include a fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) engine <b>616</b>.

In some embodiments, FDD engine <b>616</b> is structured in a similar manner to the fault detection system described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,788,097, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. FDD engine <b>616</b> may obtain fault detection or diagnostic rules from a user input, for example, or may obtain the rule by any other method (e.g., from a database).</p><p id="p-0107" num="0105">FDD engine <b>616</b> may also be configured to monitor operating data corresponding to equipment, spaces, and/or points of a BMS. Said data may include, for example, current operating states or parameters, sensor or meter readings, etc. FDD engine <b>616</b> can compare the received data with the fault detection and diagnostic rules to detect a fault condition. A fault condition may indicate that a particular BMS object meets one or more fault criteria, which may in turn indicate an issue with one or more BMS objects (e.g., equipment). As an example, a fault detection and diagnostic rule may define a desired temperature range for a space in a building site. If FDD engine <b>616</b> determines that the air temperature within the space exceeds a threshold corresponding to the desire temperature range (e.g., based on sensor data), FDD engine <b>616</b> may indicate a fault.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0106">In some embodiments, FDD engine <b>616</b> may utilize a previously generated semantic site model to identify BMS objects associated with a fault detection rule. Specifically, for each application or implementation of a fault detection rule, FDD engine <b>616</b> can determine one or more BMS object needed to evaluate the rule using the semantic site model. The BMS objects may be identified based on the fault criteria for each fault detection rule. For example, the fault criteria may require a particular type of sensor measurement, a particular value, etc. When the fault detection rule is applied to a particular space, equipment, or point of a BMS or a building, the semantic site model may be used to identify the particular BMS objects that are referenced to determine the fault criteria.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0107">In some embodiments, FDD engine <b>616</b> may also initiate automated corrective actions based on a detected fault condition. In some embodiments, a corrective action may be predetermined based on the type of fault condition, the fault detection rule, the BMS objects associated with the fault condition, etc. The corrective action may include, for example, controlling building equipment associated with the BMS objects in order to affect one or more parameters associated with the BMS objects.

BMS <b>740</b> may then classify BMS configuration data <b>708</b> according to mapped object definitions <b>706</b> in order to generate semantic site model <b>710</b>, as described above. Semantic site model <b>710</b> may be referenced by a user of BMS <b>740</b> in subsequent operations.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0121">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a flowchart of a process <b>800</b> for generating a semantic site model is shown, according to some embodiments. Process <b>800</b> can be implemented by system <b>600</b> in order to generate a semantic model of a building or site served by BMS <b>400</b> or BMS <b>500</b>, for example. As mentioned above, a semantic site model may beneficially &#x201c;standardize&#x201d; a BMS or building site according to a common data model. A standardized BMS may be easier for a user to understand and interact with, by describing BMS objects and object relationships semantically, and a semantic site model may decrease configuration time for new BMSs. Additionally, the semantic site model may classify BMS objects according to model classes to group BMS objects and to clearly identify BMS object relationships. It will be appreciated that certain steps of the process <b>800</b> may be optional and, in some embodiments, the process <b>800</b> may be implemented using less than all of the steps. In some embodiments, certain steps of process <b>800</b> may be performed by system configuration tool <b>720</b> and other steps may be performed by BMS <b>740</b>, as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>. For example, steps <b>802</b>-<b>806</b> can be performed by system configuration tool <b>720</b> while step <b>808</b>-<b>812</b> can be performed by BMS <b>740</b>.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0122">At step <b>802</b>, a BMS ontology data model is obtained. As described above, the BMS ontology data model is generally a common data model that defines BMS objects according to a semantic description schema. The BMS ontology data model may include a tag library for describing a variety of objects found in a BMS (e.g., spaces, equipment, and points). The BMS ontology data model may also include a plurality of BMS model classes that can be assigned to various BMS objects and/or to various point definitions associated with a BMS object. A BMS model class is generally a semantic identifier that can be applied to a BMS object. For example, a BMS model class may indicate a type of equipment, space, or point.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0123">At step <b>804</b>, unmapped BMS object definitions are obtained. The unmapped BMS object definitions may be obtained from a database, for example. The unmapped BMS object definitions can include equipment definitions for a variety of different types of building equipment and/or point definitions for a variety of points associated with building equipment. An unmapped BMS object definition may be an abstracted representation of a particular type of building equipment, for example, and the unmapped BMS object definition may include a plurality of point definitions typically associated with the particular type of building equipment. For example, and as described in greater detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>C</figref>, an unmapped BMS object definition for a VAV (e.g., VAV units <b>116</b>) may include point definitions for zone air temperature, zone air setpoint, and supply fan status points. In some embodiments, the unmapped BMS object definitions can also include space definitions for a variety of different spaces within a building site, and can include additional point definitions for points associated with the different spaces.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0124">At step <b>806</b>, a BMS model class is assigned to each of the unmapped BMS object definitions. As described above, a model class is generally a semantic identifier that can be applied to a BMS object definition. Model classes can be used to classify or otherwise indicate a type of equipment, space, or point. For example, the model class may be a text sting or a label that identifies a class for a particular unmapped object definition, or for an equipment or a point definition associated with an unmapped object definition. In some embodiments, the BMS model class is automatically assigned to one or more unmapped BMS object definitions based on one or more parameters of the unmapped BMS object definitions. For example, search criteria (e.g., search terms), a short name, a type, a label, etc., associated with the unmapped BMS object definition may be identified, and a model class may be assigned based on any of the identified parameters.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0125">In other embodiments, a user selection of a model class is received for each BMS object definition. For example, the user may select a model class from a list (e.g., based on the ontology data model) in order to assigned the selected model class to an unmapped BMS object definition. In some embodiments, a user may also defined one or more additional BMS object identifiers. In such embodiments, a user selection specifying one or more user-defined identifiers (e.g., short name, label, etc.) associated with a first unmapped BMS object definition may be received. The user selection of a model class and/or user defined identifiers for BMS object definitions is described in greater detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0126">In some embodiments, step <b>806</b> also includes applying the BMS ontology data model to the unmapped BMS object definitions. In some such embodiments, the BMS ontology data model is applied to the unmapped BMS object definitions concurrently with, or before or after, the model classes are assigned. As discussed above, mapped BMS object definitions are generated based on the assignment of model classes and/or the application of the BMS ontology data model. In other words, the previously unmapped BMS object definitions may be mapped to the BMS ontology data model in order to standardize the BMS object definitions, and the model classes are applied.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0127">At step <b>808</b>, a BMS is analyzed to identify BMS objects associated with a building site. In some embodiments, BMS configuration data can be mined, scanned, or otherwise analyzed to identify BMS object associated with a particular site. For example, the BMS configuration data is analyzed to determine the various spaces, points, and/or equipment associated with the building site and/or controlled by a BMS of the building site. BMS objects can include equipment entities representing specific instances of building equipment and point entities representing specific points in the BMS. BMS objects can also include space entities representing specific building spaces. In some embodiments, a BMS itself may be mined or analyzed in order to generate the configuration data.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0128">At step <b>810</b>, a semantic site model is generated by classifying the BMS objects based on the BMS object definitions and the model classes assigned to each of the BMS object definitions. In other words, the BMS object identified at step <b>808</b> may be classified or mapped to corresponding BMS object definitions, and thereby may be classified or mapped according to the model classes assigned to each BMS object definition. In some embodiments, BMS objects are classified according to an object identifier associated with each of the BMS object definitions. The object identifier may be a short name, a label, a number, or another type of identifier associated with each BMS object definition. For example, a first BMS object definition corresponding to a VAV type object may include a short name of &#x201c;SF-S,&#x201d; which corresponds to a supply fan status. The BMS objects identified at step <b>808</b> may be analyzed to detect any BMS objects that also include an identifier of &#x201c;SF-S.&#x201d; In some cases, search criteria may also be utilized to identify BMS objects. For example, the search criteria may include additional identifiers associated with a supply fan status. The BMS objects may also be analyzed to identify any BMS objects that include identifiers corresponding to the search criteria.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0129">At step <b>812</b>, building equipment is monitored and/or controlled based on the semantic site model. In some embodiments, the semantic site model is utilized to monitor equipment operations. In some embodiments, a user interface may be generated to present the semantic site model, or to present data associated with the semantic site model such as equipment or site operational data. In some embodiments, controlling the building equipment can include adjusting one or more operating parameters associated with the building equipment. For example, a setpoint may be modified for a particular building device. In any case, the semantic site model generated by process <b>800</b> may, advantageously, provide a user friendly method for interacting with a BMS. For example, the semantic site model defines BMS objects in a natural language that is easy for users to understand.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0130">Additionally, the classification of BMS objects based on model classes and the relationships between BMS objects defined in the semantic site model can aid in system analytics or querying. Instead of searching for a BMS object by a string of characters or manually tracing equipment relationships, for example, a user may query the system (e.g., system <b>600</b>) in a more natural way. For example, the user can ask the system simple questions, such as &#x201c;what are the temperatures of all meeting rooms on the fourth floor?&#x201d; Using the semantic site model, the system could search for BMS objects having a model class of &#x201c;Zone Air Temperature&#x201d; and could narrow the search to BMS objects related to spaces on the fourth floor of a building site. In this manner, the semantic site model may greatly increase user friendliness, and can also increase interoperability with other systems.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0131">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, a flowchart of a process <b>900</b> for fault detection and diagnostics using a semantic site model is shown, according to some embodiments. Process <b>900</b> can be implemented by system <b>600</b> in order to facilitate fault detection and/or diagnostics for a BMS, for example. Process <b>900</b> may utilize a semantic site model to identify BMS objects associated with fault detection and diagnostic rules. In this regard, process <b>900</b> does not necessarily require that fault detection and diagnostics rules reference a particular BMS object. Advantageously, process <b>900</b> may allow for generic or non-site specific fault detection and diagnostic rules to be implemented and evaluated across a range of building sites or BMSs. It will be appreciated that certain steps of the process <b>900</b> may be optional and, in some embodiments, the process <b>900</b> may be implemented using less than all of the steps.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0132">At step <b>902</b>, at least one fault detection rule is obtained. The fault detection rule generally includes one or more fault criteria that are evaluated using BMS data (e.g., operating data) to detect fault conditions. Unlike fault detections rules for certain other systems, the fault detection rule obtain at step <b>902</b> does not include fault criteria that reference to a particular BMS object. In other words, the fault criteria are defined without reference to a particular BMS object. This allows the fault detection rule to be applied to any number of different building sites or BMSs, because the fault criteria do not rely on a particular BMS object. Additionally, the fault detections rule may be structured more broadly than other rules that rely on a particular object, and may be defined in a more natural way.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0133">An example fault detection rule may include fault criteria such as &#x201c;IF zone temperature is greater than a threshold AND a VAV damper position is closed&#x201d; that, if true, may indicate a fault condition. In this example, the fault criteria variables of &#x201c;zone temperature,&#x201d; &#x201c;threshold,&#x201d; and &#x201c;VAV damper position&#x201d; can be defined in the fault detection rule without reference to the particular BMS object or objects that need to be analyzed in order to determine whether the fault detection rule is satisfied. For example, the particular temperature sensor corresponding to &#x201c;zone temperature&#x201d; and/or the particular VAV that supplies the &#x201c;zone&#x201d; or space do not need to be defined in the fault detection rule.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0134">At step <b>904</b>, a semantic site model (e.g., generated using process <b>800</b>) is used to identify the particular BMS objects needed to evaluate the fault criteria. For example, the fault detection rule may be applied to a particular space or equipment of a BMS, and the semantic site model may be used to identify BMS object associated with the particular space or equipment. As described above, a single fault detection rule may advantageously be applied to multiple different building spaces, devices, points, etc. Accordingly, for each implementation or application of the fault detection rule, a new set of BMS objects may be identified to evaluate the fault criteria.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0135">To continue the example above, the fault detection rule including fault criteria such as &#x201c;IF zone temperature is greater than a threshold AND a VAV damper position is closed&#x201d; could be applied to a particular building space (e.g., a room). The semantic site model could be used to identify a specific zone temperature sensor that provides the &#x201c;zone temperature&#x201d; for the particular space, a particular threshold value, and a particular VAV or damper that controls airflow to the particular space. In this case, the relationships defined by the semantic site model may be used to identify the zone temperature sensor and/or VAV associated with the space, and the threshold value may be a parameter associated with a BMS object representing the particular space.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0136">At step <b>906</b>, a fault condition is detected by evaluating the fault criteria using data related to the particular BMS objects. Said data may include, for example, operational data or other data received from BMS objects represented in the semantic data model. For example, the data could include values from sensors or equipment within a building represented by the semantic site model. The received BMS object data may be compared to a value or a threshold for each fault criteria to determine if the fault criteria are &#x201c;true&#x201d; or &#x201c;false.&#x201d; Depending on the particular fault detection rule, a fault condition may be detected if one or more of the fault criteria are &#x201c;true.&#x201d; In some cases, multiple fault criteria or even all of the fault criteria may need to be &#x201c;true&#x201d; in order for a fault condition to be detected.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0137">In the example above, the fault criteria may be evaluated by determining a reading (i.e., value) from the zone temperature sensor associated with the particular space, as identified using the semantic data model, and comparing the temperature sensor value to the threshold value obtained from the BMS object representing the particular space. Similarly, a value may be obtained from a sensor indicating a position of the damper for a VAV supplying the particular space, and the damper position may be analyzed to determine with the VAV damper position is &#x201c;closed,&#x201d; and therefore matches the fault criteria.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0138">At step <b>908</b>, an automated corrective action is initiated in response to detecting a fault condition. The automated corrective action may include one or more individual corrective actions. For example, the automated corrective action can include controlling building equipment. In some embodiments, equipment can be controlled by adjusting an operating parameter of the equipment, turning the equipment off, taking the equipment office, activating additional equipment, etc. Generally, the equipment are controlled to correct the detected fault condition. In other words, the equipment can be controlled to affect one or more parameters associated with the fault criteria. For example, if a zone temperature is above a threshold value, HVAC equipment may be operated to reduce the temperature of a space corresponding to the zone temperature.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0139">In some embodiments, the automated corrective action can include generating a work order and/or scheduling a maintenance activity for faulty equipment. The work order or maintenance request can be transmitted to a work order computer system, for example, or may be transmitted to a user device (e.g., associated with a maintenance or service technician). In some embodiments, automated corrective action includes presenting an indication of the fault condition to a user (e.g., of user device <b>632</b>). As an example, a notification or alert may be generated and transmitted to the user's device as a text message, an email, a voice call, a push notification, etc. In some embodiments, a fault indication is presented on a user interface of a BMS system (e.g., BMS <b>400</b>).</p><p id="p-0142" num="0140">In some embodiments, a diagnostic process may also be implemented to determine a cause of the fault condition. The diagnostic process may also rely on the semantic site model, and in particular may rely on the relationships between BMS objects as defined in the semantic site model. For example, while one or more BMS object may be directly associated with a fault condition (e.g., the BMS object identified at step <b>906</b>), additional BMS objects may also be identified that have some sort of impact on the detected fault condition. The semantic model may be analyzed to identify, based on the BMS object relationships, additional BMS objects that may be affected by the fault condition, or may have been at least partially responsible for causing the fault condition.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0141">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>C</figref>, an interface <b>1000</b> for viewing and modifying a BMS object definition is shown, according to some embodiments.
