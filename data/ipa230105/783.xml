INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present description concerns biocompatible nanoparticles for medical and diagnostic applications.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNOLOGICAL BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Nanomedicine is a branch of medicine that applies the knowledge and tools of nanotechnology to the prevention and treatment of disease. Nanomedicine involves the use of nanoscale materials, such as for example biocompatible nanoparticles.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One of the main challenges in successfully using nanoparticles for drug delivery and biomedical imaging is overcoming biological barriers.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The Mononuclear Phagocytic System (MPS) is certainly a major biological barrier to be overcame in successfully delivering sufficient payloads to the original biological target. Any nanoparticles, regardless of its material composition and physio-chemical properties, is subject to recognition, uptake and, eventually, removal from the blood stream by the MPS. This occurs mostly in liver and spleen, which are the organs with a high abundancy of resident macrophages. These cells, belonging to the body immune system, act as filters removing particulate from blood (noxious xenobiotic substances, cell debris and particulate substances in general, including systemically administered nanoparticles). Significant amounts of nanoparticles are generally uptaken by the hepatic Kupffer cells (often over 70% of the injected dose), followed by splenic macrophages.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The largest majority of the strategies so far proposed to reduce nanoparticle uptake by MPS is focused on modifying the nanoparticle surface with polymer chains that could generate a steric hindrance with the macrophage membrane. PEGylation is certainly one of the most popular strategies whereby chains of polyethylene glycol (PEG) are either covalently or non-covalently attached or amalgamated on the nanoparticle surface. PEG has only partially solved the issue. In addition, and most importantly, the exposure to dietary products containing PEG is increasing the percentage of individuals developing antibodies against PEG, thus reducing its stealth potential.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An alternative strategy developed by the Inventors of the instant application is based on tuning the deformability of nanoparticles. With this aim Discoidal Polimeric Nanoconstructs (DPNs) with tunable stiffness have been designed. Preliminary studies revealed that rigid DPNs are particularly suitable for lung delivery but their circulation half-life is relatively short. Conversely soft DPNs are more suitable for tumor targeting and possess extended circulation time as demonstrated in a preclinical model of cancer therapy. The extended circulation time depends on the reduced recognition by macrophages which always sense the surrounding environment to snag pathogens and debris and are in general more prone to internalize stiff materials. Nonetheless, not all kind of drug delivery platform could be designed with tunable stiffness.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An alternative to tuning particle deformability is to administer specific pretreatments before the inoculation of the nanoparticles that carry a therapeutic agents and/or and imaging agent for the treatment and/or detection of a disease (&#x201c;Secondary Administered Nanoparticles&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The aim of these pretreatments consist in transiently and reversibly reducing the phagocytic ability of macrophages, specifically residing in the liver and spleen. In this context, Gadolinium Chloride has been used as such a pretreatment. However, this compound is toxic and actually induce immune cell depletion rather than just inhibition. Gadolinium ions kills macrophages and other cells, as well. As such, the administration of this compound for this purpose is currently considered not feasible due to its effect on physiological functions and its intrinsic toxicity.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Also, studies are available on the possible use of glycine. However, it was never documented its use for improving the in-vivo performance of nanomedicines and, more importantly, the actual effect of this amino acid on macrophages is still disputed.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The administration of empty vectors is another investigated strategy; the strive of deviating drug loaded particles from ending up into liver macrophages in this case is based on stuffing resident macrophages using empty vector or reducing circulating opsonins. Commonly empty vector used are liposomes of diverse nature whose aim is to subtract opsonins from blood and/or physically fill these cells of particulate in order to avoid the uptake of other particulate secondarily administered (Secondary Administered Nanoparticles). The scientific publication Sun et al., (2017) &#x201c;Improved tumor uptake by optimizing liposome based RES blockade strategy&#x201d; <i>Theranostics </i>(2017), 319-328 discloses the effect of liposome administration in inhibiting the reticuloendothelial system (RES) clearance. The effects of the inhibition achieved by the liposome administration are temporary and reversible, and depend on the nature and amounts of lipids. In any case, the metabolism of these liposomes takes some time, the cell homeostasis is often restored over a long time frame and this administration could also result in macrophage activation. No active compound is used and no direct effect on phagocytic mechanisms is stroked.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In view of these premises, it is of considerable interest to identify new products or compositions that can have an immunomodulatory effect on macrophages achieving an improved transient inhibition of their phagocytic capacity. These product could be particularly useful, for example, i) to enhance accumulation of nanoparticles carrying active principles or a imaging agents secondarily administered (Secondary Administered Nanoparticles) within targeted pathological tissues and also ii) to be used in the treatment of diseases wherein an immunomodulatory effect on macrophages is desired (with consequent decrease in the phagocytic capacity).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The object of the present description is to provide nanoparticles comprising natural compounds designed to transiently and reversibly modulate the uptake function of Kupffer cells and other macrophages.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with the invention, the above object is achieved by means of the solution recalled specifically in the annexed claims, which constitute an integral part of the present description.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present description provides nanoparticles comprising methyl palmitate (MP) and at least one serum globular protein.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The at least one serum protein may be selected in the group consisting of albumin, plasmin, transferrin, hemoglobin, ferritin, more preferably albumin.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one or more embodiments, the nanoparticles consist of methyl palmitate (MP) and at least one serum globular protein, preferably selected in the group consisting of albumin, plasmin, transferrin, hemoglobin, ferritin, more preferably albumin.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one or more embodiments, the nanoparticles herein disclosed may have an average diameter size comprised between 180 nm and 240 nm, preferably between 200 nm and 220 nm.

The transient inhibition of the cell phagocytic activity upon administration, preferably by intravenous administration, of MPNs diverts particles carrying an active agent or an imaging agent (Secondary Administered Nanoparticles) from the liver to the actual biological target&#x2014;the pathological tissue (cancerous lesion, vascular plaque, blood clot, edematous tissue, inflamed tissue, and so on).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0068">A portion of MPNs accumulates in the Kupffer cells of the liver. Here, they can rapidly exert their inhibitory activity on the resident macrophages. MPNs act reversibly on the &#x3b1;-tubulin protein of macrophages. This limits the avidity of macrophages preventing the uptake of secondary administered nanoparticles which can then circulate longer and eventually reach in a higher number the pathological tissue. This effect is transient and full reversible between 12-24 h post MPNs treatment. During this time frame, circulating Secondary Administered nanoparticles are significantly less affected by MPS and thus their accumulation to the biological target can be enhanced.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0069">It is important to highlight the reversibility of the process, since a permanent inhibition would lead to an immunologic paralysis, exposing patients to pathogens over a long period of time.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0070">The nanoparticles herein disclosed, therefore, would apply and enhance the performance of any Secondary Administered Nanoparticles. Indeed, MPNs have been tested in conjunction with a broad variety of Secondary Administered Nanoparticles, causing a temporary inhibition of Mononuclear Phagocytic System. Evidence of a significant decrease in the sequestration activity of macrophages will be shown in the next sections.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0071">The results of in vivo tests are also provided in the following, conducted on rigid particles designed as Secondary Administered Nanoparticles for carrying an active agent or an imaging agent and for lung delivery, which heavily accumulate in the liver. The experiments reveals that the preliminary MPNs treatment is capable of reducing hepatic accumulation of such rigid particles as well as enhancing their natural tropism for the lungs. This means that the Secondary Administered Nanoparticles (rigid particles in this case) would be less uptaken by resident macrophages, thus circulate longer and accumulate more within their natural targeted organ (lungs in this case).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0072">To date, no treatment is capable to achieve this result without inducing significant toxicity or acting on specific mechanisms.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0073">The inhibition of the macrophage's phagocytic activity may be preparatory for subsequent systemic administration of active principles or imaging agent, for example contained in particles (nanomedicine). In such way, the active principles accumulate preferentially at the pathological site, in that their non-specific accumulation within the liver is inhibited; specifically, the phagocytic ability of macrophages is recovered while the particles containing the active principle or the imaging agent are already lodged within the pathological tissue.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0074">The description thus provides a method for increasing the bioavailability of an active principle and/or of a imaging agent in a subject, the method comprising the steps of:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0075">administering the nanoparticles comprising methyl palmitate and at least one globular serum protein, preferably albumin, or a composition comprising the same,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0076">administering the active principle and/or a imaging agent, wherein the active principle and the imaging agent are contained in at least one Secondary Administered Nanoparticle.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0071" num="0077">The treatment may preferably follow the following time line:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0078">Time 0 h: MPNs Administration (pretreatment)</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0079">Time 5 h-16 h: Administration of the active principle and/or a imaging agent.

A schematic of the experiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> reporting a representation of macrophages treated or not with MPNs. Macrophages pretreated with MPNs tend to internalize Secondary Administered nanoparticles at a minor extent with respect to untreated ones. Secondary Administered nanoparticles are all those particles that carry a therapeutic agents and/or and imaging agent for the treatment and/or detection of a disease. Examples of clinically approved secondary nanoparticles are Doxil and Myocet (liposomes loaded with the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin); DaunoXome (liposomes loaded with the anti-cancer drug daunorubicin); Margibo (liposomes loaded with the anti-cancer drug vincristine); and Genexol PM and Nanoxel M (micelles loaded with paclitaxel); Abraxane (serum proteins mixed with paclitaxel); iron oxide nanoparticles for MR imaging.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0104">As a proof of concept, the secondary nanoparticles tested in the study reported in the instant disclosure were the following: 750 nm and 200 nm Polystyrene Particles (P750 and P200), 2 &#x3bc;m rigid Discoidal Polymeric Particles (rDPNs), 200 nm Spherical Polymeric Particles (SPNs).

Bigger particle treatments were performed administering the nanoparticles of the instant disclosure (MPNs) and Secondary Administrated Nanoparticles (SAn) at the same time.

The loss of the microtubules architecture is associated to a reduced uptake of Secondary Administered Nanoparticles (reported above). This phenomenon is also evident from the images in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> where the same Secondary Administered Nanoparticles of previous experiments were administered according to the same conditions above described: P750 (<b>6</b><i>b</i>), rDPNs (<b>6</b><i>c</i>), P200 (<b>6</b><i>d</i>) and SPNs (<b>6</b><i>e</i>).

These findings apply equally to the entire population of analyzed cells. In summary, the data reveal that MPNs treated macrophages lose their phagocytic potential due to the impaired &#x3b1;-tubulin polymerization. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> it is also reported the reversibility of this effect (third raw). Macrophages which were treated for 16 h with MPNs and which underwent a 24 h recovery period were again able to internalize Secondary Administered Nanoparticles. Together with the recovery of the phagocytic activity cells resolved the microtubules alterations previously found. The fact that as the microtubules recover they architecture the cells recover the capability to internalize Secondary Administered Nanoparticles, strengthen the hypothesis that MPNs effect on particles internalization is mediated by temporary alterations of &#x3b1;-tubulin cycle.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0123">Flow Cytometry</p><p id="p-0116" num="0124">The recovery of internalization capability was also monitored by Flow Cytometry using 2 different MPNs dosing (0.25 mM and 0.50 mM).

Secondary particles were than administered respecting the same timing (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). Percent of cells positive for SPNs internalization for cells untreated and treated with MPNs were in line with previous findings indicated in the disclosure. Regarding the recovery of the phagocytic activity, data revealed a complete recover of this function for the 0.25 mM of MPNs condition.

This action is probably obtained by modulating Kupfer cells activity.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0134">The reduced uptake in the liver district grants for a longer circulating time and favors rDPNs tropism for the lung district. The reversibility of the treatment is demonstrated by increasing the pretreatment time to 16 h.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0135">In the animals which underwent 16 h pretreatment with MPNs, no significant difference was shown in the ratio lungs vs livers.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0136">This finding demonstrates that the frame of action of MPNs is relatively narrow and that its effect on macrophages is fully reversible in 16 h in vivo.

This activity may be exerted also on other kind of macrophages. The transient inhibition of the cell phagocytic activity upon administration of the nanoparticles allows secondary administered nanoparticles diverting from the liver to the actual biological target&#x2014;the pathological tissue.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0139">With respect to other strategies to obtain macrophage blockade, the key advantage herein shown is the use of nanoparticles comprising methyl palmitate as the active compound. In the scientific publication Sun et al., (2017) &#x201c;Improved tumor uptake by optimizing liposome based RES blockade strategy&#x201d; <i>Theranostics, </i>319-328, empty liposomes are used to inhibit the phagocytic activity of the macrophages. This strategy is not immunomodulatory and inhibits phagocytosis by filling up the cells and inducing a cellular quiescent state. Also, the strategy disclosed in such document induces the depletion of opsonins from blood leading possibly to immunodepression, as declared by the authors. De facto, liposomes used for pretreatment occupy space inside macrophages reducing phagocytic capacity and this strategy does not rely on any immunomodulatory effect. Also, as proved by the scientific publication Pervin et al. (2016) &#x201c;Transient effects of empty liposomes on hepatic macrophage populations in rats&#x201d;; J Toxicol Pathol, 139-144, the administration of empty liposomes could even activate these cells. As such, the conditions under which liposome-induced macrophage blockade works are still not clear.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0140">Very differently the nanoparticles herein disclosed (MPNs) exert an immunomodulatory effect and, as such, they can also be used for the treatment of diseases wherein macrophage activity may hamper tissue integrity and/or alter tissue functionality. The nanoparticles and the compositions comprising the nanoparticles herein disclosed may be used for example in the treatment of acute or chronic inflammation, wound healing, scar formation, generation of fibrotic tissue, transplant rejection, atherosclerosis, cancer.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0141">These are diseases usually associated with macrophages activation which is sometimes related to tissue damage (Oishi et al. (2018) &#x201c;Macrophages in inflammation, repair and regeneration&#x201d; International Immunology, Vol. 30, No. 11, pp. 511-528; Adhyatmike et al. (2015) &#x201c;The elusive Antifibrotic Macrophage&#x201d; Frontiers in Medicine, Vol. 2, Article 81; Mokos et al. (2017) &#x201c;Current Therapeutic Approach to Hypertrophic Scars&#x201d;, Frontiers in Medicine, Vol. 4, Article 83; Moore et al. (2013) &#x201c;Macrophages in atherosclerosis: a dynamic balance&#x201d; Nature Reviews, V13, 709-721; Ashleigh et al. (2018) &#x201c;Targeting Macrophages in Cancer: From Bench to Bedside&#x201d; Frontiers in Oncology, Vol. 8, Article 49). Beside their important function to defend the host from a broad spectrum of insults, macrophages play important roles in other processes: i) tissue homeostasis, ii) tissue development, iii) tissue regeneration. In the attempt to restore tissue homeostasis, these cells could contribute to the development of the pathology through the production of mediators and substances which ultimately could promote chronic inflammation, atherosclerosis, cancer; could hamper wound healing and alter the processes leading to scar formation through the generation of more fibrotic tissue; could promote transplant rejection.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0142">As such, modulating the macrophage activity the detrimental effect resulting from their functions may be prevented. Due to the immunomodulatory activity exerted by the nanoparticles comprising methyl palmitate on macrophages, they may be used to reduce acute and chronic inflammation, favoring the outcome of the pathologic conditions in which such inflammation occurs. This effect may be particularly relevant also in the processes of wound healing, in which the modulation of macrophages activity may be used to reduce the risk of the formation of large areas of fibrotic tissue. This may apply not only to the reparation of skin tissue but also of other tissues, like for example the heart. Maintaining heart elasticity is crucial for the restoration of its functionality after an insult.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0143">In addition, the immunomodulation is very relevant also in the prevention of transplant rejection. Macrophages are key players in the allograft response, their role is anyway divergent, some of them promote the acceptance of the graft some others promotes the rejection (Liu et al. (2016) &#x201c;Macrophages as Effectors of Acute and Chronic Allograft Injury&#x201d; Curr Transplant Rep, 303-312; Jiiang et al. (2014) &#x201c;Macrophages in solid organ transplantation&#x201d;, Vascular Cell, 6:5; Salehi et al. (2015) &#x201c;The Divergent Roles of Macrophages in Solid Organ Transplantation&#x201d; Curr Opin Organ Transplant, 446-453). The administration of the nanoparticles herein disclosed capable of blocking macrophages activity may be used to achieve a positive impact on the graft outcome.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0144">Naturally, while the principle of the invention remains the same, the details of construction and the embodiments may widely vary with respect to what has been described and illustrated purely by way of example, without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
