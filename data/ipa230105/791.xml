The two primary cannabinoids contained in <i>Cannabis </i>are cannabidiol, or CBD, and 49-tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. CBD lacks the psychoactive effects of THC. Studies have shown that CBD can be used to treat disorders such as epilepsy, arthritis, and cancer.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">22q11.2 deletion syndrome is caused by a hemizygous microdeletion of chromosome 22. The deletion of chromosome 22 occurs near the middle of the chromosome at a location designated as q11.2. The deletion results in the poor development of several body systems. The symptoms associated with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome vary in both the number of symptoms that are present in a human suffering from 22q11.2 deletion syndrome as well as the severity of each symptom. Prominent neuropsychiatric and phenotypic features include heart defects, poor immune system function (which can lead to recurrent infections), a cleft palate, complications related to low levels of calcium in the blood, and delayed development with both emotional and behavioral issues, cognitive impairment, anxiety, ADHD, and development of psychosis in late adolescent or early adulthood.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome can have developmental delays, which can include delayed speech, growth and learning disabilities. These developmental delays can cause behavioral and psychiatric symptoms such as irritability, social isolation, and anxiety. &#x201c;Later in life, they are at an increased risk of developing mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder.&#x201d; (Genetics Home Reference, U.S. National Library of Medicine, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/22q112-deletion-syndrome.)</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure relates to a method of treating one or more behavioral and/or psychiatric symptoms of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome in a subject. The method includes administering an effective amount of cannabidiol (CBD) to the subject wherein one or more behavioral symptoms of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are treated in the subject. Administering the CBD includes transdermally or orally administering.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, the CBD is (&#x2212;)&#x2212; CBD. The effective amount of CBD can be between about 50 mg to about 1000 mg daily. In some embodiments, the effective amount of CBD is initiated at about 50 mg daily and titrated up to about 500 mg daily dose or about 1000 mg daily. The effective amount of CBD can be initiated at about 50 mg daily and titrated up to about 250 mg daily. In some embodiments, the effective amount of CBD is initiated at 250 mg daily. The effective amount of CBD can be initiated at 500 mg daily. In some embodiments, the 500 mg daily dose and the 1000 mg daily dose is administered to patients that weigh greater than 35 kg. The CBD can be administered in a single daily dose or in two daily doses. In some embodiments, the effective amount of CBD can be 390 mg in divided daily doses.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The CBD can be formulated as a gel or an oil. In some embodiments, the CBD is formulated as a permeation-enhanced gel. The gel can contain between 1% (wt/wt) CBD to 7.5% (wt/wt) CBD. In some embodiments, the gel contains 4.2% (wt/wt) CBD. In some embodiments, the gel contains 7.5% (wt/wt) CBD.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the transdermal preparation can be a cream, a salve or an ointment. The CBD can be delivered by a bandage, pad or patch.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Alleviating one or more behavioral and/or psychiatric symptoms of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome can include treating or alleviating general anxiety. Anxiety is the symptom that caregivers of children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome found the most burdensome and desired treatment to relieve the anxiety, which can improve overall quality of life.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Other symptoms that can be alleviated include psychosis, mood disorders, emotional and behavioral issues, and/or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The CBD can be administered transdermally on the subject's upper arm and shoulder.

CBD includes, 2-[3-methyl-6-(1-methylethenyl)-2-cyclohexen-1-yl]-5-pentyl-1,3-benzenediol as well as to pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, metabolites (e.g., cutaneous metabolites), and metabolic precursors thereof. The synthesis of CBD is described, for example, in Petilka et al., <i>Helv. Chim. Acta, </i>52:1102 (1969) and in Mechoulam et al., <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </i>87:3273 (1965), which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As used herein, the term &#x201c;transdermally administering&#x201d; refers to contacting the CBD with the patient's or subject's skin under conditions effective for the CBD to penetrate the skin.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The Drug Product ZYN002 is a transdermal cannabidiol (CBD) gel. CBD is the primary non-euphoric cannabinoid in the <i>Cannabis sativa </i>L plant. The CBD contained within ZYN002 is a pharmaceutically produced Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) that is chemically identical to the CBD present in <i>Cannabis. </i></p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">CBD has a modulating effect on the endocannabinoid system and may help restore synaptic homeostasis by acting as a negative allosteric modulator of CB<sub>1</sub>, thereby attenuating CB<sub>1 </sub>receptor overstimulation, internalization, and desensitization. Moreover, CBD has effects on serotonin<sub>1A </sub>signal transduction, GABA<sub>A </sub>receptor signaling, and dopamine D<sub>2 </sub>and D<sub>3 </sub>receptor signaling, which may contribute to beneficial effects in patients with 22q.11.2 deletion syndrome. The expectation of a wide margin of safety in humans was founded on the results of well-controlled studies in which CBD has exhibited high tolerability across several modes of administration.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">ZYN002 is being developed as a clear, transdermal gel to provide consistent, controlled cannabidiol (CBD) delivery with twice daily (every 12 hours [Q12 H]) dosing. Because CBD is virtually insoluble in water, ethanol and propylene glycol are used as solubilizing agents and diethylene glycol monoethyl ether (brand name: Transcutol&#xae; HP) is used as a permeation enhancer.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">22q11.2 deletion syndrome (also referred to as 22qDS) is caused by a hemizygous microdeletion of chromosome 22. The deletion of chromosome 22 occurs near the middle of the chromosome at a location designated as q11.2. The deletion results in the poor development of several body systems. The most common symptoms of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are heart defects (74% of individuals), abnormalities with the development of the palate (69% of individuals), characteristic facial features (elongated face, almond-shaped eyes, wide nose, and small ears), learning difficulties (70-90% of individuals) including significant delay in the development of language (70% will have minimal words by 24 months of age), and immune system problems.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">22q11.2 deletion syndrome is the most common (yet under-diagnosed) microdeletion syndrome affecting 1 in 2,000 to 1 in 4,000 live births. Approximately 50 genes are affected resulting in effects on multiple body systems. 22q11.1DS is inherited as autosomal dominant but 90-95% cases are spontaneous (McDonald-McGinn et al, &#x201c;22q11.2 deletion syndrome&#x201d; Nat Rev Dis Primers; 1:15071.doi:10.1038/nrdp.2015.71, 2015). Patients usually harbor a 1.5 to 3 Mb hemizygous deletion at chromosome 22q11.2, resulting in pathognomonic T-Box Protein 1 (TBX1), adaptor protein CRKL and/or mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) haplo-insufficiency.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The clinical presentations of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are highly variable within and between families, even in identical twins. Each patient presents their own unique profile of symptoms and signs. Males and females are equally affected. Undiagnosed older children and adults are often only ascertained due to behavioral problems or school performance. In some cases, adults are only diagnosed when they have an affected child. Over 180 clinical features have been described in association with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, none of which in isolation is considered pathognomonic for the condition (Koczkowska et al, &#x201c;Genomic findings in patients with clinical suspicion of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome&#x201d; Journal Appl Genetics 2017 58:93-98).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The most common medical problems include congenital heart defects (primarily conotruncal abnormalities such as Tetralogy of Fallot), facial and palatal abnormalities, immunodeficiency, and hypocalcemia. There is a very wide range in the severity of these effects from life threatening to very minimal or symptomatic and undiagnosed. The neurocognitive profile is highly variable (both inter- and intra-individual). Typically, early in infancy motor delays (hypotonia) and speech and language delays are evident. The majority of patients fall into an IQ range of 70 to 84. These patients are also at an increased risk to develop ADHD, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), anxiety and mood disorders as well as psychotic disorders and schizophrenia. This complex behavioral/psychiatric phenotype changes across ages particularly with the risk of development of schizophrenia (Swillen, &#x201c;Developmental Trajectories in 22q11.2 deletion&#x201d; Am J Med Genet C Semin Med Genet June 2015).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In children, developmental delays are common, including mild intellectual delay and/or learning disability with an average IQ around 70.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The present disclosure relates to a method of treating one or more behavioral and/or psychiatric symptoms of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome in a subject by administering an effective amount of cannabidiol (CBD) to the subject wherein one or more behavioral symptoms of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are treated in the subject. Administering the effective amount of CBD includes transdermally or orally administering.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The present disclosure also relates to a method of treating a human suffering from 22q11.2 deletion syndrome by administering a therapeutically effective amount of synthetic or purified cannabidiol to the human suffering from the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome to effectively treat the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome in the human in need thereof. The cannabidiol can be administered transdermally or orally.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">CBD has a modulating effect on the endocannabinoid system, agonist effect on serotonin<sub>1a </sub>receptors, and positive allosteric modulator at GABA<sub>A </sub>receptors. Transdermal or oral administration of an effective amount of CBD gel can be an effective treatment for the behavioral and/or psychiatric phenotypes of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, for example, anxiety.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Anxiety in individuals can disrupt development and quality of life of individuals suffering from 22q11.2 deletion syndrome more than IQ. Anxiety, not IQ, can predict the adaptive functioning of individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Controlling anxiety in children, for example, in children six-years old to adolescent, the development of psychosis can be prevented or delayed. Addressing anxiety and mental health issues in patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome can improve quality of life of these individuals.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Other symptoms that can be treated include psychosis, mood disorders, emotional and behavioral issues, and/or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, transdermal delivery of cannabinoids (e.g., CBD) has benefits over oral dosing because it allows the drug to be absorbed through the skin directly into the bloodstream. This avoids first-pass liver metabolism, potentially enabling lower dosage levels of active pharmaceutical ingredients with a higher bioavailability and improved safety profile. Transdermal delivery also avoids the gastrointestinal tract, lessening the opportunity for GI related adverse events and the potential degradation of CBD by gastric acid into THC, which can be associated with unwanted psychoactive effects. Moreover, transdermal delivery of CBD reduces the intensity and frequency of somnolence adverse events, which are typically present in oral dosing of CBD. Transdermal delivery of CBD can avoid liver function adverse events, which are typically present in oral dosing of CBD. In some embodiments, transdermally administering an effective amount of CBD reduces an intensity of at least one adverse event by about 15% to about 95% relative to orally administering CBD.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The CBD can be in a gel form and can be pharmaceutically-produced as a clear, permeation-enhanced gel that is designed to provide controlled drug delivery transdermally or orally with once- or twice-daily dosing. The CBD gel can be between 1% (wt/wt) CBD to 7.5% (wt/wt) CBD. The CBD gel can have, for example, 4.2% (wt/wt) CBD or 7.5% (wt/wt) CBD). The CBD gel can be applied topically by the patient or caregiver to the patient's upper arm and shoulder, back, thigh, or any combination thereof. The CBD can be applied orally by the patient, the caregiver, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The CBD gel can include diluents and carriers as well as other conventional excipients, such as wetting agents, preservatives, and suspending and dispersing agents.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The CBD gel can include a solubilizing agent, a permeation enhancer, a solubilizer, antioxidant, bulking agent, thickening agent, and/or a pH modifier.

ASD is characterized by problems in social communication and social interaction, as well as restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. FXS is a rare genetic condition caused by CGG repeat expansion in the FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation 1) gene located on the X chromosome; behavioral symptoms can include social withdrawal, anxiety, avoidance of eye contact, sensory hypersensitivity, echolalia, and hand flapping. 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is one of the most common microdeletion syndromes and often involves behavioral symptoms of social limitations and difficulty in maintaining relationships with peers.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The socio-behavioral deficits seen in ASD and FXS have been attributed to dysregulation of the endocannabinoid systems, which is comprised of (1) two G-protein-coupled receptors (a) cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB<sub>1</sub>), located primarily in the CNS and (b) cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB<sub>2</sub>), located in multiple systems throughout the body; and (2) endogenous cannabis-like ligands (endocannabinoids) that bind to CB<sub>1 </sub>receptors and modulate synaptic transmission throughout the CNS; the two best described are anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-euphoric cannabinoid. CBD has a modulating effect on the endocannabinoid system, agonist effect on serotonin<sub>1a </sub>receptors, and positive allosteric modulator at GABA<sub>A </sub>receptors. Transdermal or oral administration of an effective amount of CBD gel can be an effective treatment for the behavioral and/or psychiatric phenotypes of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, for example, anxiety.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Objective: The objective of this study was to conduct a retrospective literature review on patients with ASD, FXS, and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome to determine the nature and extent of symptomatic overlap in these conditions and to suggest a possible role for CBD in the management of these shared symptoms based on insights from an open-label, 12-week study evaluating the safety, tolerability and initial efficacy of transdermal CBD for the treatment of behavioral and emotional symptoms associated with child/adolescent FXS.

See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, Common Behavioral Features of ASD, FXS, and 22q11DS.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">ASD: Anxiety-related symptoms are common in patients with ASD, with up to 84% of children experiencing some degree of debilitating anxiety; rates of physician-diagnosed anxiety disorders range from 42-55% and may include simple phobias, generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and social phobias. Comorbid anxiety disorders can be broad-ranging and associated with behaviors such as aggression/irritability and isolation from same-age peers. Inattention and hyperactivity are often present in Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder and ASD, and they are common to their respective diagnostic criteria. Children with ASD who have severe intellectual disability ([ID] IQ&#x3c;40) showed higher levels of psychiatric symptoms (anxiety, mood, sleep, organic syndromes, and stereotypies/tics) than those with ID but no ASD.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">FXS: In FXS, severe cognitive and social impairments are more common in males than in females. FXS usually has profound effects on the life of patients (comorbid conditions, social impairment) as well as their caregivers and families (mental health, absence from work/school). Anxiety and social avoidance are considered core features of FXS. Social avoidance has been defined as a behavioral response to anxiety that arises from fear of social interaction; thus, anxiety can be thought of as a foundational precipitant to social avoidance. Social avoidance encompasses behaviors that may include seeking isolation (e.g., stay in their room to avoid others), lack of interaction, social escape (e.g., face-hiding, leaning away), and gaze avoidance that distance the individual from his/her social counterparts. Variation in FMR1 protein expression has been linked to avoidance behaviors among females with the disorder. In a study that used interviews of parents/caregivers (n=97) of boys and girls with FXS to determine the prevalence of anxiety (based on DSM-IV criteria), 82.5% of participants had at least 1 anxiety disorder, irrespective of sex, age, presence of autism, or IQ, with the most common diagnoses being specific phobia (59.6%); social phobia (58.3%); selective mutism (25.3%); generalized anxiety disorder (23.7%); and obsessive-compulsive disorder (23.7%). The presence of ID in patients with FXS impairs their ability to self-report symptoms of worry and fear, increasing reliance on caregiver observations of outward behavioral manifestations of anxiety characteristics, which may include any of the following: social avoidance; nervous behavior during social situations; shyness; refusal of activities with social demands; poor understanding of social cues from inattention to faces, socioemotional processing, social skills during interpersonal interactions; fearfulness; social escape behaviors.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">22q11.2 deletion syndrome: The most common behavioral/psychiatric diagnoses in children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are ADHD, ASD, and anxiety. A large-scale, collaborative study (&#x3e;1400 participants aged 6-68 yrs) reported ADHD in 37% of 6-12 year-olds and in nearly 24% of 13-17 year-olds; ASD peaked in 13-17 year-olds (25.4%); anxiety disorders were more prevalent than mood disorders at all ages, but especially in children and adolescents with at least 33% of 6-17 year-olds reporting anxiety disorder. Up to one-third of patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome will develop schizophrenia and schizo-affective disorder by late adolescent and early adulthood, and over 40% of patients have been reported to a schizophrenic spectrum disorder after 25 years of age. Although these diagnoses are reported in individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, the diagnosis of ASD is particularly controversial in this population and may be related to poor clinical understanding of the typical behavioral and/or psychiatric phenotype. The emergence of social deficits during adolescence can represent a major source of disability in some individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome; cross-sectional studies show that children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are withdrawn and shy and have social impairments which may be less of a concern to the individual.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Role of CBD: CBD has diverse pharmacologic effects. Based on findings from an open-label study in children/adolescents with FXS (Heussler et al., <i>A phase </i>1/2<i>, open</i>-<i>label assessment of the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of transdermal cannabidiol </i>(<i>ZYN</i>002) <i>for the treatment of pediatric fragile X syndrome</i>; J. Neurodev Disorder. 2019; 11(1): 16) and a retrospective literature review, CBD may improve multiple symptoms experienced by patients with ASD, FXS, and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, and it is generally well tolerated in children and adults. Results from receptor pharmacology studies investigating the possible role of CBD in the treatment of behavioral symptoms associated with ASD, FSX, and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome suggest (1) a role for the endocannabinoid system in regulating behavioral symptoms and (2) the pharmacology of CBD is broad, continues to be defined, and may prove beneficial in addressing important symptoms. Findings from the first crossover trial testing the effects of CBD on symptoms of social anxiety in adults with social phobia found significant and clinically meaningful reductions in both physiological and cognitive indicators of anxiety, which may translate to therapeutic effects in patients with ASD, FXS, and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. A recent case series provided initial evidence that CBD may lead to broad improvement in childhood FXS symptomology, including symptoms of anxiety and social avoidance. An open-label, 12-week study evaluated the safety, tolerability and initial efficacy of transdermal CBD for the treatment of behavioral and emotional symptoms associated with child/adolescent FXS and found both positive effects on the emotional and behavioral symptoms of FXS, including for many, an increase in social confidence which may be translatable to the other defined populations.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Conclusions: Patients with ASD, FXS, and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome share a constellation of socio-behavioral symptoms that includes anxiety, leading to seeking isolation behavior (social avoidance), irritability, attention deficits, and poor communication. Preliminary evidence shows that CBD improves social anxiety and associated behavioral manifestations suggesting that CBD may prove to be effective in managing the spectrum of behavioral symptoms associated with these conditions.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example 2: An Open-Label, Tolerability and Efficacy Study of ZYN002 Administered as a Transdermal Gel to Children and Adolescents with 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome</heading><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Objectives: The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ZYN002 administered as a transdermal gel formulation in patients ages 6 to &#x3c;18 years, in the treatment of 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome.

The total score and all five subscales of the ADAMS tests showed statistically significant improvements at Week 6 and Week 14 to treatment compared to baseline. All five subscales of the ABC-C tests showed statistically and clinically meaningful improvements at Week 6 and Week 14 compared to baseline. The PARS showed statistically significant improvements at Week 14 compared to baseline. The majority of patients showed clinically meaningful improvements at Week 6 and Week 14 as demonstrated by the CGI-I tests. Seventy-five percent of patients were rated by clinicians as &#x201c;improved&#x201d;, &#x201c;much-improved&#x201d; or &#x201c;very much improved&#x201d; with nearly two-thirds (62.5%) of the patients being &#x201c;much improved&#x201d; or &#x201c;very much improved&#x201d;. The transdermal administration of CBD was well tolerated. These results show that real reductions in general anxiety, social withdrawal and social avoidance, in children and adolescents with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome can be achieved through administration of CBD.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0087">Unexpectedly, significant and clinically meaningful improvements in ADAMS Obsessive/Compulsive Behavior and were observed.
