This section may include certain aspects of the art that may be related to various features of the present disclosure. However, it should be appreciated that this section is used only to enhance the understanding of the reader with respect to the present disclosure, and not as admissions of prior art.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Today with the advent of wireless technology like Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM), Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), High Speed Packet Access (HSPA), Long Term Evolution (LTE), and the like, all communications in a wireless network provide various communication services such as voice, video, data, advertisement, content, messaging, broadcasts, etc. One example of such a network is Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA). E-UTRA is a radio access network standard that is meant to be a replacement for Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) and High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA)/High-Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA) technologies as specified in 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) releases 5 and beyond. E-UTRA is an air interface of 3GPP's LTE upgrade path for mobile networks. Unlike HSPA, E-UTRA of LTE is an entirely new air interface system, unrelated to and incompatible with W-CDMA. It provides higher data rates, and lower latency, and is optimized for packet data. The UMTS, which is a successor to GSM technologies, currently supports various air interface standards, such as Wideband-Code Division Multiple Access (W-CDMA), Time Division-Code Division Multiple Access (TD-CDMA), and Time Division-Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access (TD-SCDMA). The UMTS also supports enhanced third-generation (3G) data communications protocols, such as HSPA, which provides higher data transfer speeds and capacity to associated UMTS networks. With the capacity and higher data transfer speeds, there are many problems associated with the cells and the optimization of the cells.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In 5G cellular deployment, macro cells, along with various small cells, are planned to provide a coverage and capacity solution across a target area. Thus, inter-site distance becomes narrower for the network. Further, a greater number of sites/eNodeBs are required to mitigate ongoing data demand in the emerging network, which creates a dense to hyper-dense radio access network in big cities.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Key Performance Indications (KPIs) are being used in the method for calculating throughput, call drop rate, and mute call rate. The network events generated by the users constitute already known information. KPI information is generally universal and is calculated from the counters/events, which are specific to a network element of a telecom vendor.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the present day, Telecom Operators &#x26; Vendors in Telecom Industry run the Network performance improvement plans based on the network KPIs. The network KPIs are calculated through the counters/events measured by the network elements and these plans don't have any counters that provide a measurement of customer's experience. Though these plans provide the cells that are needed for overall network improvement, yet, they fail to identify the cells that are impacting the users most.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Currently, existing approaches of KPIs computations, in the telecom network, are based on computing the counters measured by the network elements and don't have any counters that provides measurement of customer's experience. However, the approach is incapable of computing a realistic user score of an arbitrary geographical area. This is due to the fact that the area could potentially be served by multiple telecom cells. Further, the spatial density of users may vary vastly across different regions of the area.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">There is therefore a need in the art to provide a method and system that can overcome the shortcomings of the existing prior art.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Objects of the Present Disclosure</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Some of the objects of the present disclosure, which at least one embodiment herein satisfy are as listed herein below.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">An object of the present disclosure is to provide a method and a system for computing user correlated network score of mobile users across a telecom network.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">An object of the present disclosure is to provide a method and a system for enhancing communication experience for mobile users across a telecom network.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">An object of the present disclosure is to provide a method and a system for computing user correlated network score of mobile users across a telecom network of an arbitrary geographical region served by different Telecom Operators &#x26; Vendors of the Telecom Industry.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">An object of the present disclosure is to provide a method and a system for assessing a mobile customer's communication experience in the telecom network by scoring each network cell by correlating KPIs based on network and users both, derived from the counters of network elements, as well as the counters of network events generated by customers.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">An object of the present disclosure is to provide a method and a system for computation of a realistic User Correlated Network Scores to get insights into user profile of the telecom area.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">An object of the present disclosure is to provide a method and a system to identify only the cells needed for overall network performance improvement in the telecom area.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">An object of the present disclosure is to provide a method and a system to identify the cells that are impacting the user experience the most in the telecom area.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">This section is provided to introduce certain objects and aspects of the present invention in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description.

The system computes a network score based on one or more Key Performance Indications (KPIs) of a macro cell or a small cell operating in the telecom area for a time interval T. The network score of the macro cell or the small cell (<b>101</b>) operating in the telecom area for the time interval T is computed based on the KPIs that comprise an average throughput, a Physical Resource Block (PRB) utilization, interference ratio, a call drop rate, a mute call rate, and a call setup success rate. Further, the system selects a group of mobile users based on the computed network score. The selected group of mobile users have the network score of a last &#x201c;n&#x201d; percentile network score. Further, the system collects a call record of the selected group of mobile users from a storage module. The call record of the selected group of mobile users from the storage module is captured when a mobile user initiates a voice or a data session with the telecom network by latching on to the macro cell or the small cell operating in the telecom area. Further, the call record of the selected group of mobile users from the storage module comprises parameters such as a user IMSI identifier, a usage duration, a cell identifier, and a voice/data flag.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Further, the system aggregates a session duration across the collected call record to compute a total user call duration for the macro cell or the small cell operating in the telecom area for the time interval T. Further, the system computes a number of unique mobile users latched on the macro cell or the small cell operating in the telecom area by aggregating the collected call record cell-wise. Further, the system computes a user correlation factor of the macro cell or the small cell operating in the telecom area for the time interval T based on the total user call duration for the macro cell or the small cell (<b>101</b>) operating in the telecom area for the time interval T and the number of unique mobile users (<b>102</b>) latched on the macro cell or the small cell (<b>101</b>) operating in the telecom area. The user correlation factor of the macro or small cell operating in the telecom area for the time interval T is stored in the storage module. Further, the user correlation factor of the macro cell or the small cell operating in the telecom area for the time interval T is calculated by dividing the total user call duration computed for the macro cell or the small cell by the time interval T scaled with the number of unique mobile users latched on the macro cell or the small cell operating in the telecom area. Thereafter, the system computes a user correlated network score for the macro cell or the small cell operating in the telecom area based on the computed network score and the computed user correlation factor of the macro cell or the small cell (<b>101</b>) operating in the telecom area for the time interval T. The user correlated network score is calculated by scaling the computed network score with the computed user correlation factor of the macro cell or the small cell operating in the telecom area for the time interval T. Further, the user correlated network score comprises a realistic user score that provides a predictive insight into a mobile user profile of the telecom area. Further, the user correlated network score for a bigger time interval T<sub>Large </sub>is calculated by dividing a bigger time interval T<sub>Large </sub>into a plurality of smaller and equal time intervals T<sub>Small </sub>and computing the user correlated network score for a plurality of smaller and equal time intervals T<sub>Small </sub>and averaging the computed correlated network scores for a plurality of smaller and equal time intervals T<sub>Small </sub>to compute the user correlated network score for a bigger time interval T<sub>Large</sub>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an aspect, the present disclosure provides a method for computing a user correlated network score in a telecom area.
