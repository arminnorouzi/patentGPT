Indeed, extended reality (e.g., virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, etc.) has grown in popularity, and technological advancements have facilitated its use in a variety of applications, such as gaming, online shopping, military training, and tourism. However, conventional extended reality hardware, such as headsets worn when participating in extended reality, provides limited functionality for users of extended reality systems who have differing head shapes or facial bone structure to secure such headsets comfortably and precisely to their faces. This imprecise fit often results in discomfort, preventing users from fully and comfortably utilizing the full potential provided by extended reality systems.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The detailed description is described with reference to the accompanying figures.

Extended reality headsets generally include a display structure, which is placed over a user's eyes and allows the user to &#x201c;see&#x201d; the extended reality and a mechanism to secure the display structure to the user's head. Conventional extended reality headsets rely on a single strap being tightly secured around the user's head in order to position the display structure relative to the user's face. However, such conventional extended reality headsets require the single strap being tight enough to adequately secure the display structure, causing the position of the display structure relative to the user's face dependent on the user's skull and facial structure, which can cause user discomfort and frustration. Thus, the described techniques provide functionality beyond what is provided in conventional extended reality headsets by incorporating an internal suspension system secured to the user's head and pivotably coupled to the display structure. In this way, an extended reality headset can be positioned and securely fastened to a user's head regardless of head shape, providing substantially uniform and distributed pressure on the user's head and a more comfortable fit for a greater number of head shapes and sizes.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As used herein, the term &#x201c;virtual environment&#x201d; or &#x201c;extended reality environment&#x201d; refers to a simulated environment in which users can fully or partially immerse themselves. For example, an extended reality environment can include virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, etc. An extended reality environment can include objects and elements with which a user can interact. In many cases, a user participates in an extended reality environment using a computing device, such as a dedicated extended reality device. As used herein, the term &#x201c;extended reality headset&#x201d; refers to a computing device having extended reality capabilities and/or features. In particular, an extended reality headset can refer to a computing device that can present an extended reality graphical user interface. An extended reality headset can further display one or more visual elements within the extended reality graphical user interface and receive user input that targets those visual elements. For example, an extended reality headset can include, but is not limited to, a virtual reality device, an augmented reality device, or a mixed reality device. In particular, an extended reality device can include any device capable of presenting a full or partial extended reality environment. Nonlimiting examples of extended reality headsets can be found throughout this application.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">For example, an extended reality headset (referred to herein as &#x201c;headset&#x201d;) includes an external frame which can be substantially rigid and can define a general exterior shape of the headset. In at least one example, the external frame can have a first side piece and/or a second side piece coupled to the external frame. The first side piece and/or the second side piece can be located on opposite sides of the headset. In at least one example, the first side piece and/or the second side piece can be configured to move in a direction away from and/or towards the head of the user. The external frame can further be coupled to a display structure such that the display structure is configured to fit over at least a portion of the user's eyes. The display structure can include an electronic display that is capable of providing an extended-reality presentation, for example. In at least one example, the headset includes a front head-engaging structure configured to engage a front portion of a head of a user. In at least one example, the headset includes a rear head-engaging structure configured to engage a rear portion of a head of a user. In some examples, the front head-engaging structure and/or the rear head-engaging structure are coupled to the external frame.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The headset can also include a flexible strap. The flexible strap can be located inside the external frame and can be formed from one or more elastomeric materials, including relatively hard elastomeric materials such as polyamide, polypropylene, polyurethane and/or polyethylene, etc. and/or relatively soft materials such as a natural material (rubber, silk, cork, wool, felt, etc.), or a synthetic material (styrene-butadiene block copolymers, polyisoprene, ethylene propylene rubber, ethylene propylene diene rubber, silicone elastomers, fluoroelastomers, polyurethane elastomers, and nitrile rubbers, neoprene, polyester, etc.). The flexible strap can be secured to the head of the user. The flexible strap can be coupled to the front head-engaging structure and/or the rear head-engaging structure of the headset. For example, the flexible strap can be rotationally coupled to the external frame via a pivot point associated with the front head-engaging structure and/or an attachment point associated with the head-engaging structure. Applying tension to the flexible strap by the tensioning mechanism can cause the front head-engaging structure to translate toward the user or compress into the user, which enables the flexible strap to rotate along the pivot point to conform to the head of the user. Meanwhile, the external frame can control and/or stabilize the display structure relative to the head of the user.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some examples, the flexible strap has a first end and a second end. The tensioning mechanism can further include an upper rack coupled to the first end of the flexible strap and/or a lower rack coupled to the second end of the flexible strap. Additionally, the tensioning mechanism can include a gear located between the upper rack and the lower rack. Rotation of the gear can cause the lower rack and the upper rack to move in opposite directions, causing tension to be applied or removed from the flexible strap.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some examples, the tensioning mechanism is a first tensioning mechanism. The headset further includes a second upper rack coupled to the first side piece and/or a second lower rack coupled to the second side piece. Additionally, the second tensioning mechanism can include a second gear located between the second upper rack and the second lower rack, such that a rotation of the second gear can cause the second lower rack and the second upper rack to move in opposite directions. In some examples, this can cause the first side piece and/or the second side piece to move in a direction away from one another or toward one another.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some examples, the headset can include a rear head-engaging structure coupled to the external frame. The rear head-engaging structure can include padding and can be configured to conform to a head when the headset is worn. For example, the rear head-engaging structure can include a polyethylene, polyurethane, and/or melamine foam, material, to name a few non-limiting examples.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some examples, the rear head-engaging structure has a first end and a second end opposite the first end. Applying tension to the flexible strap can, for example, cause the first end of the rear head-engaging structure and/or the second end of the rear head-engaging structure to move in a direction towards a face. Additionally or alternatively, removing tension from the flexible strap can cause the first end of the rear head-engaging structure and/or the second end of the rear head-engaging structure to move in a direction towards the face.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some examples, the display structure presents virtual data. For example, the display structure can include one or more display devices (e.g., electronic display(s), display screen(s), projector(s), lens(es), head-up display(s), etc.) capable of providing an extended reality presentation.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some examples, the material of the flexible strap includes an elastomeric material, including relatively hard elastomeric materials such as polyamide, polypropylene, polyurethane and/or polyethylene, etc. and/or relatively soft materials such as a natural material (rubber, silk, cork, wool, felt, etc.), or a synthetic material (styrene-butadiene block copolymers, polyisoprene, ethylene propylene rubber, ethylene propylene diene rubber, silicone elastomers, fluoroelastomers, polyurethane elastomers, and nitrile rubbers, neoprene, polyester, etc.). In at least one example, an elastomeric material can allow the flexible strap to maintain flexibility and hold tension without substantially stretching along the length of the flexible strap.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some examples, the material of the external frame includes polycarbonate ABS alloy (PC/ABS). Additionally or alternatively, other thermoplastics can be used (e.g., acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polycarbonate (PC), aliphatic polyamides (PA, PPA), polyoxymethylene (POM), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), polypropylene (PP), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), polyphenylsulfone (PPSU), polyether ether ketone (PEEK), polyetherimide (PEI), etc.). This allows the external frame to maintain a rigid shape, allowing the headset to secure to a head safely and comfortably.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some examples, the external frame includes an audio component. For example, the audio component can be located on the first side piece and/or the second side piece. In some examples, the audio component includes of one or more speakers configured to provide audio output directly to a user. Additionally or alternatively, the audio component can include one or more microphones configured to generate audio data.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In this way, the present headset stabilization device improves current headset designs by incorporating a flexible strap rotationally coupled to a display structure via a pivot point, allowing a user to secure the display structure of the headset on the user's forehead independent of the user's head shape or pressing the display structure to the user's forehead. Additionally, external straps provide additional stabilization, providing a secure and comfortable headset fit.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">These and other aspects are described further below with reference to the accompanying drawings. The drawings merely illustrate examples and should not be construed to limit the scope of the claims. For example, while examples are illustrated in the context of a particular headset for extended reality, the techniques can be implemented using any headset device.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="2">Example Device</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a 3-D side view of an example extended reality headset <b>100</b> including an example headset stabilization device. For example, the headset <b>100</b> includes a substantially rigid external frame <b>102</b> which defines a general shape of the headset <b>100</b>. For example, the external frame <b>102</b> can have a first side piece <b>104</b> and/or a second side piece <b>106</b>, which can be located on opposite sides of the headset <b>100</b>. External frame <b>102</b> can support a display structure <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The side pieces <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> of the external frame <b>102</b> can be coupled to a display structure <b>108</b>. Coupling first side piece <b>104</b> and second side piece <b>106</b> of external frame <b>102</b> to display structure <b>108</b> can laterally stabilize the display structure. The external frame <b>102</b> can stabilize the display structure <b>108</b> relative to the head of the user and prevent the display structure <b>108</b> from rotating around a gaze axis which is perpendicular to a presentation surface of the display structure <b>108</b>. The display structure <b>108</b> can include one or more display devices (e.g., electronic display screen(s), projector(s), lens(es), head-up display(s), etc.) capable of providing an extended reality presentation. For example, the display structure <b>108</b> can be located at a front end of the headset and can be positioned such that a top end of the display structure can contact at least a portion of the user's forehead and extend to cover at least a portion of the user's eyes. In some examples, the display structure <b>108</b> includes a content delivery system which can present media on a presentation surface. The content delivery system can include a near eye display (NED) to be worn on the face of the user such that visual content is presented to the user. Content presented to the user may include, for example, one or more images, video, audio, tactile sensation, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some examples, the headset <b>100</b> further includes a flexible strap <b>110</b>. The flexible strap <b>110</b> can be located inside the external frame <b>102</b>, such that the flexible strap <b>110</b> is located proximate the external frame <b>102</b> and the head of the user when in use. The flexible strap <b>110</b> can be coupled to the external frame <b>102</b>. The flexible strap <b>110</b> can configure the headset <b>100</b> to be secured to the head of the user. The flexible strap <b>110</b> can be formed from one or more elastomeric materials, such as a natural material (rubber, silk, cork, wool, felt, etc.), or a synthetic material (styrene-butadiene block copolymers, polyisoprene, ethylene propylene rubber, ethylene propylene diene rubber, silicone elastomers, fluoroelastomers, polyurethane elastomers, and nitrile rubbers, neoprene, polyester, etc.). In some examples, the flexible strap <b>110</b> can be coupled to a front head-engaging structure <b>112</b> of the headset <b>100</b>. In some examples, a hinge can pivotably couple the external frame <b>102</b> to the front head-engaging structure <b>112</b> of the headset <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The front head-engaging structure <b>112</b> can be located at a front of the headset <b>100</b> and can be configured to contact at least a portion of the user's forehead. The front head-engaging structure <b>112</b> can be covered in a cushioned material (e.g., polyethylene, polyurethane, melamine foam, etc.) such that the front head-engaging structure <b>112</b> can comfortably conform to the user's forehead.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some examples, the front head-engaging structure <b>112</b> can be rotationally coupled to the flexible strap <b>110</b> via a pivot point <b>114</b> to account for differences in facial shape and geometry in various users. As an illustrative example, a user may have a forehead that protrudes outward from the user's face. Conventional headsets may be configured to rest a display structure directly upon the user's forehead. Not only can this cause uneven and uncomfortable pressure on the user's forehead compared to the rest of the user's face in contact with the display portion, but the user's forehead shape also may cause the conventional display structure to be tilted down, distorting the user's view of the content presented in the display structure. Alternatively, a user may have large and/or protruding cheeks. Rather than tilting down, the display structure may be tilted up, such that the bottom of the display structure is located farther away from the user's forehead. Similarly, this may cause greater and unequal pressure on the user's cheeks, as well as a distorted view of the content presented in the display structure.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">To overcome shortcomings of conventional headsets, the pivot point <b>114</b> acts as a datum along which the front head-engaging structure <b>112</b> rotates along a z-axis. Thus, the front head-engaging structure <b>112</b> allows the user to comfortably position the headset <b>100</b> without compromising the position of the display structure <b>108</b>. In other words, the front head-engaging structure <b>112</b> can tilt along the pivot point <b>114</b> to accommodate for differences in users' facial geometry, without altering the tilt of the display structure.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some examples, the headset <b>100</b> includes a rear head-engaging structure <b>116</b> to provide additional comfort and stabilization. For example, the rear head-engaging structure <b>116</b> is located at the back of the headset. Side pieces <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> of external frame <b>102</b> can be slidably received into a slot of the rear head-engaging structure <b>116</b>. Rear head-engaging structure <b>116</b> can be coupled to the external frame <b>102</b> via an attachment point <b>118</b>. In some examples, the rear head-engaging structure <b>116</b> can be attached to the attachment point <b>118</b> such that the rear head-engaging structure <b>116</b> can rotate clockwise and/or counterclockwise on the attachment point <b>118</b>. In various examples, attachment point <b>118</b> can couple flexible strap <b>110</b> to external frame <b>102</b>. Similar to the front head-engaging structure <b>112</b>, the rear head-engaging structure can be made of a material configured to conform to the back of the user's head, such as polyethylene, polyurethane, and/or melamine foam, to name a few non-limiting examples.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some examples, the rear head-engaging structure <b>116</b> can be coupled to the flexible strap <b>110</b> to customize the fit of the rear head-engaging structure <b>116</b> to the back of the user's head. For example, the flexible strap <b>110</b> can have a first end <b>120</b> and/or a second end (not pictured). Additionally or alternatively, the rear head-engaging structure <b>116</b> can have a first end <b>122</b> and/or a second end <b>124</b>. In some examples, the first end <b>120</b> of the flexible strap <b>110</b> can be attached to the first end <b>122</b> of the rear head-engaging structure. Additionally or alternatively, the second end of the flexible strap <b>110</b> can be attached to the second end <b>124</b> of the rear head-engaging structure <b>116</b>. In some examples, applying tension to the inner strap <b>110</b> can cause the first end <b>122</b> of the rear head-engaging structure <b>116</b> and/or the second end <b>124</b> of the rear head-engaging structure <b>116</b> to flex in a direction towards the user's head. Alternatively, removing tension from the flexible strap <b>110</b> can cause the first end <b>122</b> of the rear head-engaging structure <b>116</b> and/or the second end <b>124</b> of the rear head-engaging structure to flex out in a direction away from the user's head. In this way, the flexible strap <b>110</b> of headset <b>100</b> can further conform the headset <b>100</b> to fit around the user's head, providing a secure and comfortable fit and external frame <b>102</b> can stabilize the display structure <b>108</b> relative to the head of a user.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">While the flexible strap is depicted as being one strap, multiple flexible straps are anticipated in some instances. For example, the flexible strap <b>110</b> may be a first flexible strap, and the headset may further include a second flexible strap (not pictured) having a third end and a fourth end. For example, the first end of the first flexible strap <b>110</b> may be attached to the first end of the rear head-engaging structure <b>116</b> and the second end of the first flexible strap <b>110</b> may be attached to the front head-engaging structure <b>112</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the third end of the second flexible strap may be attached to the second end of the rear head-engaging structure <b>116</b> and the fourth end of the second flexible strap may be attached to the front head-engaging structure <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some examples, the external frame <b>102</b> and the flexible strap <b>110</b> can be adjustable to fit a head shape and size of any user and/or to stabilize the display structure <b>108</b> relative to the head of a user, respectively. The external frame <b>102</b> can, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, include a telescoping mechanism that can allow the first side piece <b>104</b> and/or the second side piece <b>106</b> to move in a direction away from and/or a direction towards the user's head. For example, the external frame <b>102</b> can rely on a first tensioning mechanism located at a back of the headset <b>100</b>. The tensioning mechanism, in various examples, can represent various size adjusting mechanisms. In at least one example, the tensioning mechanism can represent a ratcheting mechanism. The first side piece <b>104</b> can be coupled to a first lower rack <b>126</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the second side piece can be coupled to a first upper rack <b>128</b> located substantially parallel and below the first lower rack <b>126</b>. The first upper rack <b>128</b> and/or the first lower rack <b>126</b> can include teeth-like ridges extending toward a first gear <b>130</b> located between the first upper rack <b>128</b> and the first lower rack <b>126</b> such that a rotation of the first gear <b>130</b> can cause the first upper rack <b>128</b> and the first lower rack <b>126</b> to move in opposite directions.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some examples, applying an outward force to the first side piece <b>104</b> and/or the second side piece <b>106</b>, such as pulling the first side piece <b>104</b> and the second side piece <b>106</b> in opposite directions, can cause the first gear <b>130</b> to move counterclockwise. This can cause the first upper rack <b>128</b> and the first lower rack <b>126</b> to move in a direction away from one another, causing the first upper rack <b>128</b> to move in a direction right of the first gear <b>130</b> and the lower rack <b>126</b> to move in a direction left of the gear <b>130</b>. Thus, the first side piece <b>104</b> and the second side piece <b>106</b> can move in a direction away from one another, creating a larger area to fit around a user's head and extending a width of the headset.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Alternatively, applying an inward force to the first side piece <b>104</b> and/or the second side piece <b>106</b>, such as pushing the first side piece <b>104</b> and the second side piece <b>106</b> in the same direction, can cause the gear <b>130</b> to move clockwise. This can cause the upper rack <b>128</b> and the lower rack <b>126</b> to move in a direction towards one another, causing the upper rack <b>128</b> to move in a direction left of the gear and the lower rack <b>126</b> to move in a direction right of the gear. Thus, the first side piece <b>104</b> and the second side piece <b>106</b> can move in a direction towards one another, shrinking the width of the headset. In this way, the tensioning mechanism can support outer moments, stabilizing the display structure <b>108</b> relative to the head of a user.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Similar to the external frame <b>102</b>, the flexible strap <b>110</b> can additionally or alternatively have a second tensioning mechanism located behind the rear head-engaging structure <b>116</b>. Although not depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the first end <b>120</b> of the flexible strap <b>110</b> can be coupled to a second lower rack, and the second end of the flexible strap <b>110</b> can be coupled to a second upper rack located substantially parallel and below the second lower rack. The second upper rack and/or the second lower rack can include teeth-like ridges extending toward a gear such that a rotation of the second gear can cause the second upper rack and the second lower rack to move in opposite directions. In some examples, rotating the front head-engaging structure <b>112</b> of the headset <b>100</b> in a direction away from the user's forehead can cause the second gear to move in a clockwise direction. This can cause the second upper rack and the second lower rack to move in a direction away from one another, causing the second upper rack to move in a direction right of the second gear and the second lower rack to move in a direction left of the second gear. Thus, a downward rotational moment can occur at the pivot point <b>114</b>, causing the front head-engaging structure <b>112</b> of the headset to rotate in a direction towards the user's forehead to secure the headset <b>100</b> to the head of the user.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Alternatively, rotating the front head-engaging structure <b>112</b> of the headset <b>100</b> upward in a direction toward the user's forehead can cause the second gear to move in a counterclockwise direction. This can cause the second upper rack and the second lower rack to move in a direction toward one another, causing the second upper rack to move in a direction left of the second gear and the second lower rack to move in a direction right of the second gear. Thus, an upward rotational moment can occur at the pivot point <b>114</b>, causing the front head-engaging structure <b>112</b> of the headset to rotate in a direction away from the user's forehead, thereby releasing pressure on the head of the user.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some examples, the external frame includes an audio component(s) <b>132</b>(A) and/or <b>132</b>(B). Audio component <b>132</b>(A) can be located on at least a portion of the first side piece <b>104</b>, and the audio component <b>132</b>(B) can be located on at least a portion of the second side piece <b>106</b> such that when the headset <b>100</b> is worn, the audio component <b>132</b>(A) and/or the audio component <b>132</b>(B) can cover at least a portion of the user's ear. In some examples, audio components <b>132</b>(A) and <b>132</b>(B) can include one or more speakers (not pictured) configured to provide audio output directly to the ears of the user. The audio output can be sound associated with the visual content being concurrently displayed to the user, while in other cases, the audio output can be standalone content. Additionally or alternatively, audio components <b>132</b>(A) and <b>132</b>(B) can include one or more microphones (not pictured) configured to generate microphone audio data representative of noise in an environment surrounding the user, such as, for instance, words spoken by the user.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a 3-D view taken along a z-axis of an example extended reality headset including an example first tensioning mechanism of an example stabilization device. For example, the headset <b>200</b> includes an external frame <b>202</b>. In some examples, the external frame <b>202</b> has a first side piece <b>204</b> and/or a second side piece <b>206</b> extending from a front of the headset <b>200</b> (toward a face of a user) to a back of the headset <b>200</b> (towards a back of the user's head). The external frame <b>202</b>, the first side piece <b>204</b> and/or the second side piece <b>206</b> can be formed from one or more substantially rigid or semi-rigid polymers (e.g., polycarbonate, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), polycarbonate/acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene terpolymer blend (PC/ABS), polycarbonate-ABS, acrylic, nylon, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), etc.). In examples, the external frame <b>202</b> enables a display structure <b>208</b> to remain stable. For example, a torque can be applied to the display structure <b>208</b>, such as twisting the display structure <b>208</b> along a z-axis, creating a moment at the front of the headset <b>200</b>. Because the first side piece <b>204</b> and the second side piece <b>206</b> can be comprised of a rigid material fixed to the back of the headset <b>200</b>, the first side piece <b>204</b> and the second side piece <b>206</b> can resolve the moment that the torque imparts at the front of the headset <b>200</b>. In other words, the external frame <b>202</b> can stabilize the headset by preventing rotation of the headset <b>200</b> in the z-direction.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some examples, the headset <b>200</b> includes a first tensioning mechanism which can enable a user to adjust the headset to 200 to fit a width of the user's head while stabilizing the display structure relative to the head of the user. For example, the external frame <b>202</b> can include a first upper rack <b>210</b> coupled to the first side piece <b>204</b> and/or a first lower rack <b>212</b> coupled to the second side piece <b>206</b>. A first gear <b>214</b> (e.g., an eyela spur gear) can be disposed between the first upper rack <b>210</b> and the first lower rack <b>212</b> such that a rotation of the gear <b>214</b> causes the first upper rack <b>210</b> and the first lower rack <b>212</b> to move in opposite directions. For example, the first upper rack <b>210</b> and/or the first lower rack <b>212</b> can include teeth-like ridges extending towards the first gear <b>214</b>. The first gear <b>214</b> can fit in a space between the teeth-like ridges, allowing a rotation of the first gear <b>214</b> to cause the first upper rack <b>210</b> and the first lower rack <b>212</b> to move an equal distance in opposite z-directions.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As an illustrative example, a user may wish to widen the external frame <b>202</b> to enable the headset <b>200</b> to fit around a larger-sized head while stabilizing the display structure relative to the head of the user. By applying force to the first side piece <b>204</b> in a negative x-direction and/or the second side piece <b>206</b> in a positive x-direction, the force(s) can cause the first upper rack <b>210</b> to move in the positive x-direction and/or the first lower rack <b>212</b> to move in the negative x-direction. In some examples, the first upper rack <b>210</b> and the first lower rack <b>212</b> can move in substantially equal, but opposite, directions.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Alternatively, a user may wish to narrow the width of the external frame <b>202</b> to enable the headset <b>200</b> to fit around a smaller-sized head while stabilizing the display structure relative to the head of the user. By applying a force to the first side piece <b>204</b> in the positive x-direction and/or the second side piece <b>206</b> in the negative x-direction, the force can cause the first upper rack <b>210</b> to move in the positive x-direction and/or the first lower rack <b>212</b> to move in the negative x-direction.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some examples, the first tensioning mechanism can include a locking mechanism (not pictured) which can enable the user to lock the first upper rack <b>210</b> and/or the second upper rack <b>212</b> in a set position. For example, once the headset <b>200</b> is positioned and secured on the user's head, the user can lock the first tensioning mechanism in place such that the display structure remains stable throughout use. Additionally, the locking mechanism can include a release (e.g., push-button release) to unlock the first upper rack <b>210</b> and/or the first lower rack <b>212</b>, allowing the user to adjust the width of the headset <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a 3-D perspective view taken along a z-axis of an example extended reality headset <b>300</b> including an example second tensioning mechanism of an example stabilization device. The headset <b>300</b> can be the same or similar to headsets <b>100</b> and <b>200</b>. For example, the headset <b>300</b> can include an external frame <b>302</b> having a first side piece <b>304</b>(<b>1</b>) and a second side piece <b>304</b>(<b>2</b>) extending from a front of the headset <b>300</b> (toward a face of a user) to a back of the headset <b>300</b> (towards a back of the user's head). The external frame <b>302</b> can be coupled to a display structure <b>306</b> configured to present extended reality. The external frame <b>302</b> can stabilize the display structure <b>306</b> relative to the head of the user.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some examples, the headset <b>300</b> can include a flexible strap <b>308</b>. The flexible strap <b>308</b> can be located inside the external frame <b>302</b> and can secure the headset <b>300</b> to the head of a user. The flexible strap <b>308</b> can include an elastomeric material, such as a natural material (rubber, silk, cork, wool, felt, etc.), or a synthetic material (styrene-butadiene block copolymers, polyisoprene, ethylene propylene rubber, ethylene propylene diene rubber, silicone elastomers, fluoroelastomers, polyurethane elastomers, and nitrile rubbers, neoprene, polyester, etc.). In some examples, the flexible strap <b>308</b> can be coupled to a front head-engaging structure <b>310</b> of the headset <b>300</b>. The front head-engaging structure <b>112</b> can be located at the front of the headset <b>300</b> and configured to contact at least a portion of a user's forehead. The front head-engaging structure can be covered in a cushioned material such that the front head-engaging structures <b>310</b> can comfortably conform to the user's forehead.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some examples, the front head-engaging structure <b>310</b> can be rotationally coupled to the external frame <b>302</b> via a pivot point <b>312</b>. For example, the pivot point <b>312</b> can act as a datum along which the front head-engaging structure <b>310</b> rotates along the z-axis without compromising the position of the display structure. Further, the pivot point <b>312</b> can account for differences in facial shape and geometry in various users. In other words, the front head-engaging structure <b>310</b> can tilt along the pivot point <b>312</b> to accommodate for differences in users' facial geometry, without altering the tilt of the display structure <b>306</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some examples, the headset <b>300</b> can include a second tensioning mechanism, similar to the first tensioning mechanism described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, to enable the user to adjust the tilt of the front head-engaging structure <b>310</b> of the headset to 300 in the z-direction to conform to the user's facial geometry. For example, the second tensioning mechanism can include a second upper rack <b>314</b> coupled to a first end <b>316</b> of the flexible strap and/or a second lower rack <b>318</b> coupled to a second end of the flexible strap <b>320</b>. A second gear <b>322</b> (e.g., an eyela spur gear) can be disposed between the second upper rack <b>314</b> and the second lower rack <b>318</b> such that a rotation of the second gear <b>322</b> causes the second upper rack <b>314</b> and the second lower rack <b>318</b> to move in opposite directions. For example, the second upper rack <b>314</b> and/or the second lower rack <b>318</b> can include teeth-like ridges extending towards the second gear <b>322</b>. The second gear <b>322</b> can fit in a space between the teeth-like ridges, allowing a rotation of the second gear <b>322</b> to cause the second upper rack <b>314</b> and the second lower rack <b>318</b> to move an equal distance in the opposite z-directions.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some examples, moving the second upper rack <b>314</b> and/or the second lower rack <b>318</b> in the z-direction can cause the front head-engaging structure <b>310</b> to rotate along the z-axis. For example, a user may wish to move the front head-engaging structure <b>310</b> to fit large or protruding cheeks or cheekbones. By applying force to the front head-engaging structure <b>310</b> in a negative z-direction, the force can create tension in the flexible strap <b>308</b>, causing the second upper rack <b>314</b> to move in the positive z-direction and/or the second lower rack <b>318</b> to move in the negative z-direction, rotating the front head-engaging structure in the negative z-direction.

This can cause the second upper rack <b>314</b> to move in the negative z-direction and/or the second lower rack <b>318</b> to move in the positive z-direction, rotating the front head-engaging structure in the positive z-direction.

Additionally, the locking mechanism <b>324</b> can include a release (e.g., push-button release) to unlock the second upper rack <b>314</b> and/or the second lower rack <b>318</b>, allowing the user to adjust the angle of the front head-engaging structure <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The gaze direction of a user can be referred to as a gaze axis, <b>326</b>. The external frame <b>302</b> can enhance stabilization of the display structure <b>306</b> by resisting motion of the display structure <b>306</b>, such as by minimizing rotation around the gaze axis <b>326</b> illustrated by the double-sided arrow <b>328</b>.

The headset <b>400</b> can also include a display structure <b>408</b>. In some examples, multiple forces are imparted on the headset <b>400</b> while being worn on the head of a user. For example, the headset <b>400</b> can have forces <b>410</b> in the negative y-axis based at least in part on the weight of the front head-engaging structure <b>404</b> and inertial forces. The front head-engaging structure <b>404</b> can include a force of friction <b>412</b> and an opposite normal force <b>414</b>.

For example, the rear head-engaging structure <b>416</b> can include a force of friction <b>418</b> and an opposite normal force <b>420</b>. For example, when the headset <b>400</b> is secured to the head of the user, the force of friction <b>418</b> and the normal force <b>420</b> can be of equal but opposite magnitudes.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some examples, the headset <b>400</b> includes a flexible strap <b>422</b>.

When the headset <b>400</b> is being worn by a user and at rest, the front head-engaging structure <b>404</b> can impart a force <b>424</b> on the flexible strap <b>422</b> in the positive x-direction.
