When a certain elastic member <b>51</b> is focused, the elastic member <b>51</b> adjacent to the certain elastic member <b>51</b> in the circumferential direction is arranged at about a position rotated by 90 degrees about the protruding part <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The four elastic members <b>51</b> are each arranged at a position apart from the adjacent elastic member <b>51</b> in the circumferential direction.

The recessed part <b>14</b> serves as a space S formed between the plate <b>30</b> and the base <b>10</b>, a space S formed between two adjacent elastic members among the four elastic members <b>51</b> in the circumferential direction, and a space S formed inside the base <b>10</b>. Accordingly, the space S accommodates a part of the deformed elastic members <b>51</b>.

The elastic members <b>51</b> need not necessarily be arranged between the flange part <b>15</b> and the plate <b>30</b>, but instead the elastic members <b>51</b> may be arranged between the upper surface of the coil <b>40</b> and the plate <b>30</b>, or may be arranged between the upper surface of the protruding part <b>20</b> and the plate <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the present embodiment, the plate <b>30</b> and the base <b>10</b> constitute a magnetic circuit. The plate <b>30</b> is located close to the flange part <b>15</b> at a predetermined interval from the flange part <b>15</b> in the outer peripheral part, and is located close to the protruding part <b>20</b> at a predetermined interval from the protruding part <b>20</b> in the central part. Accordingly, the plate <b>30</b> and the base <b>10</b> including the protruding part <b>20</b> constitute the magnetic circuit. The plate <b>30</b> and the base <b>10</b> are spaced apart from each other by an amount equal to the thickness of the elastic member <b>51</b>, and a magnetic gap corresponding to the thickness of the elastic member <b>51</b> is provided at the magnetic circuit. It is preferable for the magnetic gap to be as small as possible in terms of an increase in the amplitude of the plate <b>30</b> (in terms of increasing the magnetism efficiency of the magnetic circuit).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The vibration generating device <b>1</b> is driven by repeatedly switching a state such that a current flows through the coil <b>40</b> and a state of no current flowing through the coil <b>40</b>. Specifically, the vibration generating device <b>1</b> can generate a vibration by repeatedly magnetizing and demagnetizing the electromagnet formed with the coil <b>40</b> and the base <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">When the current flows through the coil <b>40</b>, the base <b>10</b> is excited. Accordingly, the upper part of the base <b>10</b> and the flange part <b>15</b> serve as a magnetic pole part, and magnetize the plate <b>30</b> constituting the magnetic circuit. A relatively strong magnetic attraction force is generated between the upper part of the base <b>10</b> and the central part of the plate <b>30</b>, and between the flange part <b>15</b> and the outer peripheral part of the plate <b>30</b>. Thereby the plate <b>30</b> is attracted to the base <b>10</b>. Accordingly, the plate <b>30</b> is displaced downward to the base <b>10</b> while the elastic members <b>51</b> are compressed, so that the interval between the plate <b>30</b> and the base <b>10</b> is reduced. When the elastic members <b>51</b> are compressed at a state of no current flowing through the coil <b>40</b>, a restoring force is generated and the plate <b>30</b> is urged in a direction apart from the base <b>10</b>. Accordingly, a maximum amount of displacement of the plate <b>30</b> is obtained at a position, in the position the magnetic attraction force and the restoring force of the elastic member <b>51</b> are balanced. In the present embodiment, the upper part of the base <b>10</b> serves as the protruding part <b>20</b>. Note that the upper part of the base <b>10</b> is not limited to the protruding part <b>20</b>. The upper part of the base <b>10</b> may be a region located at a position closer to the plate <b>30</b> than the bottom part <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the base <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">When the state is switched from the state such that a current flows through the coil <b>40</b> to the state of no current flowing through the coil <b>40</b>, the magnetism disappears and the magnetic attraction force also disappears. Thus, the restoring force of the elastic members <b>51</b> compressed with the displacement of the plate <b>30</b> with respect to the base <b>10</b> acts on the plate <b>30</b>, so that the plate <b>30</b> is displaced upward with respect to the base <b>10</b>. As a result, the interval between the plate <b>30</b> and the base <b>10</b> is increased.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">When the state a current flowing through the coil <b>40</b> and the state of no current flowing through the coil <b>40</b> are repeatedly switched, the plate <b>30</b> is repeatedly displaced in the up and down direction with respect to the base <b>10</b>. In other words, the plate <b>30</b> is displaced in the direction away from or closer to the base <b>10</b>. Thus, the vibration generating device <b>1</b> can generate a vibration force.
