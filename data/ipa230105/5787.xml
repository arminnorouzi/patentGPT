Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the present invention to those skilled in the art. Throughout the disclosure, like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout the various figures and embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The drawings are not necessarily to scale and, in some instances, proportions may have been exaggerated in order to clearly illustrate features of the embodiments. When a first layer is referred to as being &#x201c;on&#x201d; a second layer or &#x201c;on&#x201d; a substrate, it not only refers to a case where the first layer is formed directly on the second layer or the substrate but also a case where a third layer exists between the first layer and the second layer or the substrate.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> are perspective views illustrating a structure of a metal line in a semiconductor device in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the metal line ML may include a double via including a via V<b>1</b> and a partial via V<b>2</b> having different line widths from each other. The conductive material for the metal line may include, for example, copper (Cu). The metal line ML may have a line shape. The metal line ML may have a line shape extending in one direction. According to another embodiment of the present invention, the metal line ML may be formed in a different shape, e.g., spiral shape or a zigzag shape. The line width of the metal line ML may be greater than the line width of the via V<b>1</b>. The line width of the metal line ML may be the same as the line width of the partial via V<b>2</b> or may be greater than the line width of the partial via V<b>2</b>. According to the embodiment of the present invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the line width of the metal line ML may be greater than the line width of the via V<b>1</b> and also greater than the line width of the partial via V<b>2</b>, while the line width of the partial via V<b>2</b> may be greater than the line width of the via V<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The via V<b>1</b> and the partial via V<b>2</b> may be contacts for coupling the metal line ML and the lower layer and may overlap with a portion of the metal line ML. The stacked structure of the via V<b>1</b> and the partial via V<b>2</b> may have island shapes that are spaced apart from the neighboring stacked structures of the via V<b>1</b> and the partial via and V<b>2</b>. The upper surface of the partial via V<b>2</b> may contact the lower surface of the metal line ML, and the lower surface of the via V<b>1</b> may contact the upper surface of the lower layer. The metal line ML may be electrically connected to the lower layer through the via V<b>1</b> and the partial via V<b>2</b>. The via V<b>1</b> and the partial via V<b>2</b> may have different line widths. The line width of the via V<b>1</b> may be smaller than the line width of the partial via V<b>2</b>. Each of the via V<b>1</b> and the partial via V<b>2</b> may have a cylindrical shape. According to another embodiment of the present invention, the via V<b>1</b> and the partial via V<b>2</b> may have a polygonal pillar shape, such as a quadrangular pillar shape.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the embodiment of the present invention, the line width increases as it goes from the via V<b>1</b> toward the partial via V<b>2</b>, and to the metal line ML so as to form a stepped structure.

Hereinafter, the trimmed third hard mask will be denoted by a reference numeral <b>79</b>T. The line width of the region defined by the third hard mask <b>79</b>T may be adjusted to be smaller than the line width of the trench TO. Accordingly, a portion of the lower surface of the trench TO may be exposed by the third hard mask <b>79</b>T.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Subsequently, the second dielectric layer <b>75</b> on the exposed lower surface of the trench TO may be etched. As a result, a partial via VO<b>2</b> by increasing a line width of an upper portion of the via VO<b>1</b> may be formed. The partial via VO<b>2</b> may include a vertical profile. The via VO<b>1</b> may include a sloped profile in which a line width of an upper portion is greater than a line width of a lower portion. The via VO<b>1</b> and the partial via VO<b>2</b> may have a glass shape including a cylindrical shape and a cut cone shape. According to another embodiment of the present invention, the partial via VO<b>2</b> and the via VO<b>1</b> may be formed in an inverted trapezoidal shape having a slop profile.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The etching of the second dielectric layer <b>75</b> may be divided into a process of forming the partial via VO<b>2</b> and a process of expanding the top of the via VO<b>1</b>. The process of forming the partial via VO<b>2</b> may be performed under the condition that the side of the partial via VO<b>2</b> has a vertical profile, and the process of expanding the top of the via VO<b>1</b> may be performed under the condition that the side of the via VO<b>1</b> has a slop profile. According to another embodiment of the present invention, the etching process for forming the partial via VO<b>2</b> and via VO<b>1</b> may be performed continuously. The third hard mask <b>79</b>T may be removed after the partial via VO<b>2</b> is formed. The via VO<b>1</b> and the partial via VO<b>2</b> may be referred to as a &#x2018;double via&#x2019;. The double via may also be referred to as a &#x2018;metal line contact hole&#x2019; that couples between metal lines.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>G</figref>, a second metal line <b>82</b> may be formed. The second metal line <b>82</b> may be formed through a series of processes of forming a barrier layer <b>81</b> on the profile of the second dielectric layer <b>75</b> including the via VO<b>1</b>, the partial via VO<b>2</b> and the trench TO, forming a conductive material that fills the via VO<b>1</b>, the partial via VO<b>2</b> and the trench TO over the barrier layer <b>81</b>, and then etching the conductive material and the barrier layer <b>81</b> to expose the upper surface of the second dielectric layer <b>75</b>. In this case, the process of etching the conductive material and the barrier layer <b>81</b> may be performed by Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) or an etch-back process.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">The barrier layer <b>81</b> may serve to prevent diffusion of the second metal line <b>82</b>. The barrier layer <b>81</b> may be formed of at least one material selected from the group including Ta, TaN, TiN, WN, and W&#x2014;Si&#x2014;N. The second metal line <b>82</b> may include, for example, tungsten, copper, or aluminum.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">According to the embodiment of the present invention, the line width may be increased in a stepwise manner as it goes up toward the via VO<b>1</b>, the partial via VO<b>2</b> and the trench TO. In other words, by applying the partial via VO<b>2</b> larger than the line width of the bottom of the via VO<b>1</b> and smaller than the line width of the trench between the via VO<b>1</b> and the trench TO, the aspect ratio of the via may be reduced and the contact area between the via and the metal line may be increased. Accordingly, it may be possible to secure a gap-fill margin when the conductive material for the metal line ML is filled, thereby improving the problem of voids being formed. Also, it may be possible to secure an overlap margin between the via VO<b>1</b> and the metal line ML.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Furthermore, according to the embodiment of the present invention, by applying a double via including the via VO<b>1</b> and the partial via VO<b>2</b> under the second metal line <b>82</b>, the distance dL from the first metal line <b>73</b> may be increased. Accordingly, parasitic capacitance between the first metal line <b>73</b> and the second metal line <b>82</b> may be improved, which may lead to improvement in memory operation characteristics.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">According to the embodiment of the present invention, the reliability of the semiconductor device may be improved by improving the burial of the metal lines by applying double vias having different line widths.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">The effects desired to be obtained in the embodiments of the present invention are not limited to the effects mentioned above, and other effects not mentioned above may also be clearly understood by those of ordinary skill in the art to which the present invention pertains from the description below.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">While the present invention has been described with respect to the specific embodiments, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
