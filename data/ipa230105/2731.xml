More specifically, the invention relates to the expansion of NK cells by increasing the expression of specific transcription factors associated with NK cell production.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">There has been an increase in interest in Natural Killer (NK) cells as they are cytotoxic against cancerous, pathogen-infected and otherwise damaged cells. NK cells are innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), specifically large granular cytotoxic lymphocytes that bridge the innate and the adaptive arms of the immune response. They make up 10-15% of circulating lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. NK cells also exhibit the highest level of cytotoxic activity within the immune system. Therefore, altered NK cell functionality or numbers impact the functioning of the immune system against infection and cancer. For example, a large scale study in Japan has shown that reduced levels of NK cells in a cohort of people aged over 40 is associated with a significantly higher incidence of cancer.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Similarly to B cells and T cells, these NK cells are derived from Common Lymphoid Progenitor (CLP) cells that in turn come from Haematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs). However, NK cells are different from B and T cells as they lack specific cell surface antigen receptors. Due to this, NK cells may kill cancerous and pathogen-infected cells without prior sensitisation, making them part of the innate immune response. They also have a critical role in tumour immunosurveillance by directly influencing the adaptive immune response.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Activation of NK cells triggers them to release perforin and cytoplasmic granules containing granzymes. Perforin polymerises to form pores on target cells in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Granzymes may enter these pores into target cells, causing DNA fragmentation and apoptosis. NK cells may also secrete cytokines, which trigger the action of other immune cells in the adaptive arm of the immunity.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Due to the importance of NK cells in immune response against pathogen infection and cancer cells, multiple clinical trials have tested the efficacy of NK cells in adoptive transfer protocols. In adoptive transfer, NK cells isolated from the blood of donors are expanded ex vivo and matured into healthy and functional NK cells prior to transfusion into recipients. However, to be effective it is crucial that NK cell donors are be screened for their KIR genotype, where the donor must have the appropriate KIR allelic polymorphism to the recipient to allow recognition of target cells for destruction. In any event, studies have found that the expanded products have lower clinical success rate than expected, with less ability to kill cancerous or infected cells. Thus, there are significant barriers to the current adoptive transfer protocols.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An alternative therapeutic approach is to increase the number of endogenous NK cells. One method is the administration of cytokines that are essential for NK cell development. Administration of IL-2 and IL-15 was predicted to enhance NK cell development. IL-2 promotes the proliferation and cytotoxicity of NK cells, whereas IL-15 promotes the development and expansion of NK cells. However, in in vivo studies, the cytokines were found only stimulate a minimal expansion of NK cells with reduced half-life, even at a very high dose. Further, administered cytokines often leads to systemic toxicity due to inappropriate activation of immune responses and the induction of NK cell apoptosis. In addition, even when previous methods have been able to increase NK cell expansion, the resulting expanded NK cells often exhibit limited functional activity, such as lower levels of IFN&#x3b3; production and low levels of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, using conventional methods and techniques, producing large numbers of NK cells is difficult, and producing fully functional NK cells with high cytotoxicity is even harder. There is currently no drug available that selectively increases NK cell numbers. Therefore, there is a need to develop new methods of NK cell production; both ex vivo to produce large numbers of functional NK cells for therapeutic and research use; and in vivo.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Natural Killer (NK) cells have a critical role in the immune system where they destroy cancerous, pathogen-infected or damaged cells. Boosting NK cell number or functionality is predicted to increase the killing of these cells. Existing therapies such as NK cell adoptive transfer and cytokine enhancement of endogenous NK cells are not very successful in terms of their efficacy.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">NK cells are differentiated from the HSCs in the bone marrow and distributed throughout lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues including lymph nodes, spleen, peripheral blood, lungs and liver. Specific cytokines and transcription factors are needed to encourage HSCs to develop into NK cells. Each cytokine and transcription factor must be present at a precise time and concentration in order to push differentiation from HSCs into NK cells. However, the precise hierarchy of cytokines and transcription factors governing NK cell maturation is still incompletely understood.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present inventors have shown that abrogation of Notch signalling impedes NK cell production, and that the total lack of NK cell development from E4bp4<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212; </sup>progenitors can be completely rescued by short exposure to Notch peptide ligands, particularly Delta-like ligand 4 (DLL4). Based on this work, the inventors have developed a method for the ex vivo expansion of NK cells from haematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), which minimises exhaustion and produces large numbers of functional NK cells.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present inventors have previously shown that inhibiting the action of REV-ERB increases NK cell production. In particular, the inventors demonstrated that inhibiting the action of REV-ERB (e.g. using the REV-ERB antagonist SR8278) increases E4bp4 expression, which in turn increases NK cell production. The inventors have now shown that combining these two independent mechanisms (use of Notch ligands and REV-ERB inhibition) results in a surprisingly potent means for enhancing NK cell production, allowing for the production of large numbers of functional NK cells that are suitable for in vivo therapeutic use more rapidly than the current methods.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In addition, the present inventors have also now shown that post-translational modification for E4bp4 can regulate E4bp4 activity. In particular, the inventors have shown that phosphorylation and SUMOylation decrease E4bp4 activity, and that, conversely decreasing phosphorylation and/or SUMOylation of E4bp4 can increase E4bp4 activity. Thus, post-transcriptional modification of E4bp4 may be used to increase E4bp4 activity, and hence increase NK cell production.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The inventors have now also developed a new method for the expansion of NK cells that surprisingly increases the proportion of CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells. In particular, the inventors have surprisingly found that a production method which includes a distinct pre-differentiation culture stage gives rise to NK cells with increased CD16 expression. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that inclusion of a prolonged pre-differentiation stage according to the invention affects the transcriptome of the CD34+ HPCs, resulting in epigenetic changes which favour CD16 expression in CD56+NK cells. As CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells are critical for ADCC, the method of the present invention advantageously allow for the production of expanded NK cell populations with improved functionality. As a further advantage, the invention allows for the production of CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells without the need to introduce exogenous genetic elements into the NK cells, which provide a further significant benefit when the NK cells are intended for clinical use. Thus, the ex vivo method for increasing the number of CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells in an expanded NK population, and expanded NK cell populations made by said method provide a significant advantage, enabling the expansion of NK cells from haematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), which minimises cellular exhaustion and produces large numbers of functional CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Accordingly, the present invention provides an ex vivo method for expanding an NK cell population, comprising the steps of: a) culturing an haematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) comprising sample obtained from an individual with a compound that inhibits the action of REV-ERB; b) culturing said cells in the presence of a Notch ligand; and c) expanding said cells in vitro to produce an NK cell population.

NK cells are similar to B cells and T cells, but lack specific cell surface antigen receptors. Instead, NK cells have activatory and inhibitory receptors that recognise motifs.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064">NK cells circulate in the blood and the peripheral lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes and spleen. They can become activated by cytokines or upon encountering target cells. The recognition and elimination of target cells is based on balancing between inhibitory and activatory signals. Activatory signals are generated by activatory receptors (NKG2D, NKp46, NKp30) binding to ligands, which can be present not only on cancerous, pathogen-infected and damaged cells, but also on healthy cells. On the other hand, inhibitory signals are generated when inhibitory receptors (KIR, CD94/NKG2A) on NK cells bind to Major Histocompatability Complex (MHC) Class I molecules that are normally present on all healthy cells. MHC Class I molecules on target cells are absent or greatly downregulated, making them ideal NK cell targets. This allowed NK cells to distinguish between target and healthy cells. In order for NK cells to recognise and kill target cells, overall activatory signals must be greater than inhibitory signals.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065">NK cells recognise and kill cancerous, pathogen-infected and damaged cells without prior sensitisation, making them part of the innate immune response. For example, NK cells provide an early response to virus infection, occurring prior to T cell killing of infected cells. NK cells can kill target cells within minutes. NK cells also secrete cytokines and &#x201c;weaponise&#x201d; other parts of the immune system. For example, NK cells promote T cell effector function and enhance antibody-directed cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0066">NK cells are differentiated from haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) via the pathway set out in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In more detail, NK cells develop from HSCs into Common Lymphoid Progenitor (CLP) cells, pre-NK progenitor (pre-NKP) cells, NK progenitor (NKP) cells, immature NK (iNK) cells, mature NK (mNK) cells and finally into conventional NK (cNK) cells, which circulate in the bloodstream. Although this terminology derives from NK cell development in mice, a corresponding pathway occurs in human NK cell development. For example, HSCs develop through multiple stages of precursors (stage 1, 2 and 3), before developing into mature NK cells (stages 4 and 5). For consistency, references HSCs, CLPs, pre-NKPs, NKPs, iNK, mNK, cNK and NK cells are used herein. However, in the context of the present invention, these terms are interchangeable with stages 1 to 5 of the human nomenclature. Below the diagram of the pathway in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> are the cytokines and transcription factors that are essential for NK cell development. IL-15 is one of the main cytokine required for the development of NK cells. Other extrinsic factors, such as specific stromal cells, are also required for the development and maturation of NK cells. According to the present invention, Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells (HPCs) are a heterogeneous population containing multi-potential progenitors such as HSCs, CLPs and also NKPs. HPCs are referred to as lineage negative cells, as they have not yet committed to a developmental pathway. Accordingly, in the context of the present invention, HSCs, CLP cells and NKP cells are all HPCs and a reference to HPCs is a reference to any of HSCs, CLP cells and/or CLP cells, or any combination thereof, unless explicitly stated to the contrary.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0067">Due to the importance of NK cells in immune response, multiple clinical trials have tested the efficacy of NK cells in adoptive transfer protocols. Typically this is allogenic transfer, with the NK cells being isolated from a healthy donor and expanded. However, the downregulation of MHC Class I molecules on target cells is partial and the KIR genotype from donors and recipients may be similar. Due to this, NK cells transfused into recipients, even from different individuals may not attach target cells if their KIRs recognise MHC Class I molecules. Therefore, it is crucial that NK cell donors must be screened for their KIR genotype, where the donor must have the appropriate KIR allelic polymorphism to the recipient to allow recognition of target cells for destruction. Moreover, the expanded products were found to have lower clinical success rate than expected, with less ability to kill cancerous or infected cells.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0068">An NK cell may be defined in terms of its marker expression, its function/activity, or a combination thereof. Such definitions are standard in the art and methods are known by which marker expression and/or NK cell activity may be assessed. Thus, one of skill in the art would readily be able to categorise a cell as an NK cell using standard methodology and definitions.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069">For example, mNK and cNK cells may be recognised by their expression of the surface markers CD16 (Fc&#x3b3;RIII) and/or CD56, typically both CD16 and CD56 in humans, and NK1.1 or NK1.2 in some mice strains. NKp46 is another marker for mNK and cNK cells, and is expressed in humans and several mice strains. Thus, NKp46 may be used as a marker for NK cells either with or without CD16 and/or CD56 (in humans) or with or without NK1.1 or NK1.2 (in mice). Other examples of makers which can be used to identify/define NK cells according to the present invention include Ly49, natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs), CD94, NKG2, killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), and/or leukocyte inhibitory receptors (ILT or LIR), or any combination thereof, including in combination with CD16 and or CD56 (in humans) or NK1.1/NK1.2 (in mice). In some preferred embodiments mature NK cells according to the invention (i.e. mNK and cNK cells) are CD56<sup>+</sup> and CD45<sup>+</sup>, and may be also be CD16<sup>+</sup>. As used herein, the term mature human NK cell encompasses NK cells that are CD56<sup>bright </sup>(stage 4) and CD56<sup>dim </sup>(stage 5), both of which are CD56<sup>+</sup>. Mature NK cells may also be defined by the absence of markers, such as CD34, and lymphocyte markers CD3 and/or CD19. Thus, mature NK cells of the invention may be CD56<sup>+</sup>, CD45<sup>+</sup>, CD16, CD3<sup>&#x2212; </sup>and/or CD19<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, or any combination thereof, such as CD56<sup>+</sup>, CD45<sup>+</sup>, CD16<sup>+</sup>, CD3<sup>&#x2212;</sup> and CD19<sup>&#x2212;</sup>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070">In addition or alternatively, an NK may be identified by/defined in terms of its activity. For example, an NK cell may be identified/defined by the presence of cytolytic granules within its cytoplasm, by its ability to secrete antimicrobial molecules such as &#x3b1;-defensins, and/or its ability to secrete cytokines such as TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-10, IFN-&#x3b3; and TFG-&#x3b2;.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">Unless otherwise stated herein, a reference to NK cells includes a reference to iNK, mNK and cNK cells. HSCs, CLP cells and NKPs will typically be referred to as such.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">CD16 and Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC)</heading><p id="p-0074" num="0072">CD16 (Fc&#x3b3;RIII) is an Fc receptor expressed on the surface of NK cells, neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and some T cells. CD16A (Fc&#x3b3;RIIIA) is expressed by NK cells. The human CD16A protein (UniProt Accession No. P08637, sequence version 2, accessed 26 May 2022) is expressed on NK cells. The terms CD16, CD16A, Fc&#x3b3;RIII and Fc&#x3b3;RIIIA are used interchangeably herein.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073">CD16 signals through association with the Fc receptor common &#x3b3; chain, which possesses immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs). Signalling through CD16 mediates ADCC by NK cells. In ADCC the Fc regions of antibodies bound to the surface of target cells are recognised and bound by CD16 on the surface of NK cells. Cross-linking of CD16 with the antibody Fc regions activates the NK cells, resulting in the release of cytotoxic factors by the NK cells (also known as degranulation) that cause the death of the target cell by apoptosis. Therefore, NK cells with increased CD16 expression exhibit increased ADCC compared with NK cells with no or low CD16 expression.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">The present inventors have developed an ex vivo method for expanding NK cells which also increases the number of CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells within the resulting expanding NK cell population.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">Therefore, the invention provides mature NK cells, and particular expanded populations of NK cells (typically mature NK cells) which are CD56<sup>+</sup>, CD45<sup>+</sup>, CD3<sup>&#x2212;</sup> and/or CD19<sup>&#x2212;</sup> (e.g. CD56<sup>+</sup>, CD45<sup>+</sup>, CD3<sup>&#x2212;</sup> and CD19<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) and which also have increased CD16<sup>+</sup> expression compared with a control expanded NK cell population. A control expanded NK cell population may be one that is produced by any conventional method for NK cell expansion, or a corresponding method to that described herein, but without the pre-differentiation step (step (A)).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">Therefore, the invention provides an expanded population of NK cells, wherein at least 10% of the NK cells in the population are CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells, at least 15% of the NK cells in the population are CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells, at least 20% of the NK cells in the population are CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells, at least 25% of the NK cells in the population are CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells, at least 30% of the NK cells in the population are CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells, at least 35% of the NK cells in the population are CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells, at least 40% of the NK cells in the population are CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells, at least 45% of the NK cells in the population are CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells, at least 50% of the NK cells in the population are CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells, at least 60% of the NK cells in the population are CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells, at least 70% of the NK cells in the population are CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells, at least 80% of the NK cells in the population are CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells, up to 100% of the NK cells in the population are CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells. Preferably at least 15% of the NK cells are CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells, more preferably at least 20% of the NK cells are CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells, still more preferably at least 25% of the NK cells are CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells even more preferably at least 30% of the NK cells are CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells, even more preferably at least 40% of the NK cells are CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells. Such expanded NK cell populations can typically be obtained by a method of the invention. CD16 expression may be determined using standard techniques, examples of which are known in the art and could be routinely selected by one of ordinary skill. Non-limiting examples of suitable techniques include flow cytometry, cell imaging and ELISA.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">One benefit of the CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells of the invention is that they exhibit increased CD16 expression without the need for introduction of exogenous nucleic acid (such as by transduction or transfection). This is in contrast to conventional methods for expanding NK cells with increased CD16 expression, which require expression of an exogenous CD16 transgene to achieve even minimal increases in CD16 expression. Alternatively or in addition, another benefit of the CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells of the invention is that an NK cell population with an increased proportion CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells can be obtained with no or reduced purification and/or concentration compared with conventionally produced expanded NK cell populations. As such, conventionally produced expanded NK cell populations differ from those according to the invention, even if NK cells within said populations are manipulated to increase CD16 expression, and/or said conventionally produced NK cell population is manipulated to select and/or concentrate CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells, because (i) the CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells within such conventional populations will have been genetically altered and comprise exogenous nucleic acid, which is associated with disadvantages from a clinical/GMP perspective; and/or (ii) when extensive purification and/or concentration of CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells is required, this can result in damage to the purified and/or concentrated NK cells.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">Accordingly, the invention provides a population of NK cells comprising an increased number of CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells (also referred to herein as a CD16<sup>+</sup>NK cell population), wherein the CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells have not been contacted with an exogenous nucleic acid (typically a nucleic acid encoding for CD16). Typically, a population of NK cells comprising an increased number of CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells according to the invention may comprise CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells that do not comprise exogenous nucleic acid encoding for CD16. In view of the potential clinical application of the NK cells of the invention, a population of NK cells comprising an increased number of CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells according to the invention may comprise CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells that do not comprise any exogenous nucleic acid. The term &#x201c;exogenous nucleic acid&#x201d; encompasses a naked nucleic acid (e.g. a plasmid), or a viral vector (e.g. AAV or lentiviral vector) used to introduce a nucleic acid of interest (e.g. a nucleic acid encoding CD16) into NK cells. Alternatively or in addition, the invention provides a population of NK cells comprising an increased number of CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells (also referred to herein as a CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cell population), wherein the CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells have been subjected to no or reduced purification and/or concentration compared to CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells that have been produced by conventional means, including means comprising the use of exogenous nucleic acid encoding for CD16.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0079">As described herein, CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells are more effective at mediating ADCC, as it is binding of CD16 to the Fc portion of antibodies that triggers degranulation of NK cells and hence ADCC. Accordingly, by providing expanded NK cell populations with increased numbers of CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells, the invention provides CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells and expanded NK cell populations which exhibit increased ADCC, i.e. increased ADCC activity. This increase in ADCC can be compared with a suitable reference or control NK cell or NK cell population. A control method may be any standard method known in the art for producing NK cell populations. For example, a control method may use conventional adoptive transfer techniques, rather than a method according to the present invention. One example of suitable control NK cells or NK cell populations is an NK cell or NK cell population produced by a corresponding method in which the HPCs are not cultured in a medium which does not induce differentiation of the HPCs to NK cells, or wherein the HPCs are cultured in a medium which does not induce differentiation of the HPCs to NK cells for less than 2 days. In other words, one example of suitable control NK cells or NK cell populations is an NK cell or NK cell population produced by a corresponding method in which step (A) as described herein is omitted. NK cells and NK cell populations produced by such control/standard methods may be used as control cells and populations as described herein.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0080">An expanded population of NK cells according to the invention or the CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells within said population may exhibit at least 25% greater ADCC, such as at least 30% greater ADCC, at least 40% greater ADCC, at least 50% greater ADCC, at least 60% greater ADCC at least 70% greater ADCC, at least 80% greater ADCC, preferably at least 50% greater ADCC, more preferably at least 60% greater ADCC, still more preferably at least 70% greater ADCC, compared with a suitable reference or control NK cell or NK cell population.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Expanded NK Cell Populations</heading><p id="p-0083" num="0081">As disclosed herein, the invention provides methods for generating an expanded population of NK cells (referred to interchangeably herein as an expanded NK cell population or an NK cell population).

In particular, the methods of the present invention enable the production of expanded populations with greater number of NK cells compared with conventional methods. Further, a greater proportion of the NK cells (e.g. CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells) in a population of the invention are functional, preferably fully functional, compared with populations obtained by conventional methods, in which a large number of the NK cells are &#x201c;exhausted&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0088">As used herein, the term &#x201c;exhausted&#x201d; in the context of NK cells means that an NK cell or expanded NK cell population has lost at least some of its effector functions, such as cytotoxic function, cytokine production and/or ADCC. Thus, an exhausted NK cell or expanded NK cell population may exhibit impaired survival, impaired cytotoxic function, altered or impaired cytokine production and/or impaired ADCC. For example, an exhausted NK cell or exhausted NK cell population may exhibit at least a 50% reduction in one of its effector functions. For example, at least a 50% reduction in cytokine secretion, at least a 50% reduction in ADCC and/or at least 50% reduction in cytotoxic activity. These values may be quantified relative to any appropriate control as defined herein. Any appropriate technique can be used to determine effector function, and hence to quantify and reduction therein. Suitable techniques are known in the art. Alternatively and/or in addition, exhausted NK cells may exhibit altered marker expression, such as an increase in the expression of one or more inhibitory receptor (as described herein) and/or a decrease in the expression of one or more activatory receptor (as described herein). In some embodiments, increased expression of NKG2A and/or Tim3 may be used as a marker for NK cell exhaustion. Again, the expression of these markers may be quantified relative to any appropriate control as defined herein.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0089">In contrast, the terms &#x201c;functional&#x201d; and &#x201c;fully functional&#x201d; in the context of NK cells means that an NK cell or expanded NK cell population has all of the expected effector functions when responding to a given immune challenge. Thus, a (fully) functional NK cell or expanded NK cell population will typically exhibit cytotoxic function, cytokine production and/or ADCC as would be observed in vivo when NK cells are activated in response to an immune challenge, and will typically exhibit enhanced survival compared with NK cells produced using conventional methods. Alternatively and/or in addition, (fully) functional NK cells may exhibit altered marker expression, such as an increase in the expression of one or more activatory receptor (as described herein) and/or a decrease in the expression of one or more inhibitory receptor (as described herein). As a non-limiting example, a functional (mature) human NK cell may be CD56<sup>+</sup> and/or CD45<sup>+</sup>, preferably both CD56<sup>+</sup> and CD45<sup>+</sup>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0090">Alternatively or in addition to detecting and/or quantifying CD16<sup>+</sup> to determine the functionality of the NK cells, the cytotoxicity of NK cells can be determined using a degranulation assay in NK cells co-incubated with &#x2018;target cells&#x2019;. A degranulation assay involves analysing the expression of CD107a within the NK cell population. The amount of CD107a correlates with cytokine secretion and NK cell-mediated lysis of target cells. NK cells can also be analysed for the expression of Interferon-&#x3b3; (IFN-&#x3b3;), which is the main cytokine secreted when functional NK cells are activated. NK cells that are functional should express similar or higher CD107a as well as IFN-&#x3b3; when compared to a control. Further alternatively or additionally, the cytotoxicity of the NK cells may be determined using flow cytometry to quantify cell death in a target cell population. Said target cell population may optionally be pre-labelled with fluorescent marker. In some embodiments, the use of flow cytometry to quantify cell death in a target cell population is a preferred means of determining the cytotoxicity of the NK cells.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0091">Any increase in NK cell (e.g. CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cell) number/functionality in an expanded NK cell (e.g. CD16<sup>+</sup>NK cell) population made by a method of the present invention may be compared with the NK cell number/function of an NK cell population obtained from a control method as described herein.

The genomic DNA sequence of the human E4bp4 gene is given in SEQ ID NO: 3 (Genbank Accession No. X64318, version X64318.1). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, E4bp4 is expressed in CLPs and is critical in the production of NK cells from blood stem cell progenitors. Mice with the E4bp4 gene deleted do not have functional NK cells, but have normal numbers of T and B cells. In contrast, overexpression of E4bp4 in HSCs in vitro increases NK cell production. Thus, E4bp4 is a lineage commitment factor, controlling the development of NKPs from HSCs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). E4bp4's critical function in NK cells is specific to the early stages of the developmental pathway, as specific ablation of E4bp4 in peripheral mNK cells does not affect NK cell number or response to cytomegalovirus infection. In addition E4bp4 regulates other transcription factors that are essential in NK cell development, such as Id2 and Eomes.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0111">Although IL-7 and IL-15 have been shown to regulate E4bp4 expression, generally very little is known about how either extrinsic or intrinsic stimuli influence E4bp4. Transcription factors such as E4bp4 can be hard to target because of their structure and function. For example, they usually lack enzymatic activity or cofactor binding sites. The present inventors have previously demonstrated that E4bp4 expression can be increased using a compound which inhibits the activity of REV-ERB, and that this results in an increase in NK cell number (see GB Application No. 1703476.0, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Without wishing to be bound by theory, REV-ERB binds to porphyrin heme, and it is this characteristic that is believed to make REV-ERB a druggable target (see below). In sum, the inventors have shown that by targeting REV-ERB and inhibiting its activity, it is possible to increase E4bp4 expression and hence increase NK cell number.

In particular, the present inventors have previously demonstrated that the small molecule SR8278 is capable of binding to the porphyrin heme moiety of REV-ERB, resulting in inhibition of REV-ERB activity and an increase in NK cell number</p><p id="p-0127" num="0125">Accordingly, in some embodiments, the present invention is concerned with compounds which inhibit the action of REV-ERB, and their use in increasing E4bp4 expression, and hence NK cell number.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">Inhibition of REV-ERB Activity</heading><p id="p-0128" num="0126">In some embodiments, the present invention relates to the use of compounds to inhibit the action of REV-ERB, i.e. compounds which inhibit REV-ERB activity. REV-REB activity may be inhibited by any appropriate means. Suitable standard techniques are known in the art. Inhibition may take place via any suitable mechanism, depending for example on the nature (see below) of the compound used, e.g. steric interference in any direct or indirect interaction or inhibition of REV-ERB.

Thus, the activity of REV-ERB in a sample of NK precursor or progenitor cells, an expanded NK cell population or in a sample obtained from an individual/patient to be treated according to the invention may be compared with the activity of REV-ERB in a control. Activity may be quantified in any appropriate terms, for example binding of REV-ERB to the E4bp4 gene, or in terms of E4bp4 expression as defined herein.

PROTACs are heterobifunctional small molecules that simultaneously bind a target protein and ubiquitin ligase, enabling ubiquitination and degradation of the target. In more detail, a PROTAC reagent typically comprises a ligand for the target protein (in the case of the present invention, REV-ERB) and a ligand for an E3 ligase recognition domain. Through the use of such a PROTAC, an E3 ligase is recruited to the PROTAC-bound REV-ERB, inducing ubiquitin transfer from the E3 ligase complex to the target protein (in the case of the present invention, REV-ERB).

Such dsRNAs will typically be small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), or micro-RNAs (miRNAs). The sequence of such dsRNAs will comprise a portion that corresponds with that of a portion of the mRNA encoding REV-ERB.

The antisense (guide) strand directs RISC to mRNA that has a complementary sequence. In the case of perfect complementarity, RISC cleaves the mRNA.

Protocols to determine percent identity are routine procedures within the scope of one skilled in the. Global methods align sequences from the beginning to the end of the molecule and determine the best alignment by adding up scores of individual residue pairs and by imposing gap penalties. Non-limiting methods include, e.g., CLUSTAL W, see, e.g., Julie D. Thompson et al., CLUSTAL W: Improving the Sensitivity of Progressive Multiple Sequence Alignment Through Sequence Weighting, Position-Specific Gap Penalties and Weight Matrix Choice, 22 (22) Nucleic Acids Research 4673-4680 (1994); and iterative refinement, see, e.g., Osamu Gotoh, Significant Improvement in Accuracy of Multiple Protein.

Thus, a compound which inhibits REV-ERB activity and a Notch ligand (e.g. DLL4) are preferably present in the medium which does not induce differentiation of the HPCs, and not the medium which does induce differentiation of the HPCs. The pre-differentiation HPC population resulting from step (A) of a method of the invention may be transferred to a different culture vessel prior to step (B).

Alternatively, the cells may be first cultured in the presence of a Notch ligand and then in the presence of a REV-ERB inhibitory compound.

In further embodiments, both the REV-ERB inhibitory compound and the Notch ligand are added in step (B). If the REV-ERB inhibitory compound and the Notch ligand added in the same stage (either step (Aa) or step (B)), that stage may be further divided so that: (i) the REV-ERB inhibitory compound is added before the Notch ligand; or (ii) the Notch ligand is added before the REV-ERB inhibitory compound.

As used herein, the term &#x201c;preventing&#x201d; includes preventing the onset of symptoms associated with a disease or disorder that may be treated by increasing NK cell number and/or reducing the severity or intensity of said symptoms. The term &#x201c;preventing&#x201d; includes inducing or providing protective immunity against such diseases or disorders, particularly infectious diseases as described herein. Immunity may be quantified using any appropriate technique, examples of which are known in the art.</p><p id="p-0362" num="0353">A compound or products of the invention may be administered to a patient already having a disease or disorder which may be treated by increasing NK cell number. For example, the patient may be suspected of having an infectious disease or cancer as described herein, and may or may not be showing symptoms of said disease or disorder. When administered to such a patient, a compound or products of the invention can cure, delay, reduce the severity of, or ameliorate one or more symptoms, and/or prolong the survival of a subject beyond that expected in the absence of such treatment.</p><p id="p-0363" num="0354">Alternatively, a compound or products of the invention may be administered to a patient who may ultimately be infected with a particular infectious disease, or develop a disease or disorder as described herein, in order to cure, delay, reduce the severity of, or ameliorate one or more symptoms, and/or prolong the survival of a subject beyond that expected in the absence of such treatment, or, in the case of infectious diseases help prevent that patient from transmitting said disease.</p><p id="p-0364" num="0355">The treatments and preventative therapies of the present invention are applicable to a variety of different subjects of different ages. In the context of humans, the therapies are applicable to children (e.g. infants, children under 5 years old, older children or teenagers) and adults. In the context of other animal subjects (e.g. mammals such as primates), the therapies are applicable to immature subjects and mature/adult subjects.</p><p id="p-0365" num="0356">The invention relates to the treatment of any disease or disorder which may be beneficially treated with by increasing the number of NK cells in a patient. Such diseases and disorders include cancer, infectious diseases (acute and chronic), autoimmune diseases and diseases or disorders related to female infertility or pregnancy. Infectious diseases that may be treated according to the present invention include viral infection, and infection by other pathogens, including bacteria, protists, fugal, or helminth pathogens. Typically said pathogens are intracellular pathogens which have at least one intracellular phase in their life cycle. Infections of particular interest include viral infections, and zoonotic infections that are of particular importance from a public health perspective. Cancers that may be treated according to the present invention include bladder cancer, blood cancers, leukaemia, bone cancers, bowel cancer, brain tumours, breast cancer, kidney cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, skin cancer, stomach cancer, testicular cancer and uterine cancer. Autoimmune diseases that may be treated according to the present invention include systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and obesity-induced insulin resistance. As used herein, the term diseases or disorders related to female infertility or pregnancy includes, but is not limited to, fetal growth restriction, preterm labour, defects in uterine vascular remodelling and preeclampsia.</p><p id="p-0366" num="0357">The compounds or products of the invention may be used in combination with one or more additional therapeutic agents or treatments, which typically may be selected from a conventional treatment for the disease or disorder to be treated. As a non-limiting example, if a compound or products of the invention are for use in the treatment of a cancer, such as lung cancer, then said compound or products may be used in combination with conventional treatments for lung cancer, such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy or surgery. When used in combination with one or more additional therapeutic agent or treatment, a compound or products of the invention may be administered before, simultaneously with, or after the administration of the one or more additional therapeutic agent or treatment.</p><p id="p-0367" num="0358">In some preferred embodiments, a compound or products of the invention is for use in combination with antibody-mediated immunotherapy. Antibody-mediated immunotherapy involves the administration of antibodies to a patient to target disease-specific antigens. Such antibodies could be used to increase the specificity and killing activity of NK cells, which express receptors for the Fc regions of IgG antibodies. Activation of these Fc receptors, leads to NK cell activation, resulting in cytokine secretion and release of cytotoxic granules by the activated NK cell, causing lysis of the cell expressing the disease antigen. Such combination therapy is particularly preferred for the treatment of cancer (using antibodies to tumour-specific antigens). Any antibody used in immunotherapy may be used in combination with a compound or products of the invention. Non-limiting examples of such antibodies include anti-CD20 mAbs (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic lymphoma), anti-ganglioside D2 (anti-GD2) mAbs (neuroblastoma, melanoma), anti-human epidermal growth factor (anti-HER2) mAbs (breast and gastric cancers), anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) mAbs (colorectal and head and neck cancer).</p><p id="p-0368" num="0359">The invention also provides the use of a compound which results in the post-translational modification of E4bp4, thereby causing an increase in E4bp4 activity (as described herein) in a therapeutic use or method as described herein.

The administration may be by parenteral injection, for example, a subcutaneous, intradermal or intramuscular injection. For example, formulations comprising antibodies or expanded NK cell populations of the invention may be particularly suited to administration intravenously, intramuscularly, intradermally, or subcutaneously. Administration of small molecule REV-ERB inhibitors may be injection, such as intravenously, intramuscularly, intradermally, or subcutaneously, or by oral administration (small molecules with molecule weight of less than 500 Da typically exhibiting oral bioavailability).</p><p id="p-0374" num="0365">Accordingly, immunogenic compositions, therapeutic formulations, medicaments and prophylactic formulations of the invention may be prepared as injectables, either as liquid solutions or suspensions. Solid forms suitable for solution in, or suspension in, liquid prior to injection may alternatively be prepared. The preparation may also be emulsified, or the peptide encapsulated in liposomes or microcapsules.</p><p id="p-0375" num="0366">The active immunogenic ingredients (such as the compounds, products or expanded NK cell populations of the invention) are often mixed with excipients which are pharmaceutically acceptable and compatible with the active ingredient. Suitable excipients are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, or the like and combinations thereof. In addition, if desired, the vaccine may contain minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents, and/or adjuvants which enhance the effectiveness of the vaccine.</p><p id="p-0376" num="0367">Generally, the carrier is a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier. Non-limiting examples of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include water, saline, and phosphate-buffered saline. In some embodiments, however, where the composition comprises a compound or products of the invention, this may be in lyophilized form, in which case it may include a stabilizer, such as BSA. In some embodiments, it may be desirable to formulate the composition with a preservative, such as thiomersal or sodium azide, to facilitate long term storage.</p><p id="p-0377" num="0368">Examples of additional adjuvants which may be effective include but are not limited to: complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA), Incomplete Freunds adjuvant (IFA), Saponin, a purified extract fraction of Saponin such as Quil A, a derivative of Saponin such as QS-21, lipid particles based on Saponin such as ISCOM/ISCOMATRIX, <i>E. coli </i>heat labile toxin (LT) mutants such as LTK63 and/or LTK72, aluminium hydroxide, N-acetyl-muramyl-L-threonyl-D-isoglutamine (thr-MDP), N-acetyl-nor-muramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (CGP 11637, referred to as nor-MDP), N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutaminyl-L-alanine-2-(1&#x2032;-2&#x2032;-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-hydroxyphosphoryl oxy)-ethylamine (CGP 19835A, referred to as MTP-PE), and RIBI, which contains three components extracted from bacteria, monophosphoryl lipid A, trehalose dimycolate and cell wall skeleton (MPL+TDM+CWS) in a 2% squalene/Tween 80 emulsion, the MF59 formulation developed by Novartis, and the AS02, AS01, AS03 and AS04 adjuvant formulations developed by GSK Biologicals (Rixensart, Belgium).</p><p id="p-0378" num="0369">Examples of buffering agents include, but are not limited to, sodium succinate (pH 6.5), and phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 6.5 and 7.5).</p><p id="p-0379" num="0370">Additional formulations which are suitable for other modes of administration include suppositories and, in some cases, oral formulations or formulations suitable for distribution as aerosols. For suppositories, traditional binders and carriers may include, for example, polyalkylene glycols or triglycerides; such suppositories may be formed from mixtures containing the active ingredient in the range of 0.5% to 10%, preferably 1%-2%.</p><p id="p-0380" num="0371">Oral formulations include such normally employed excipients as, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, magnesium carbonate, and the like. These compositions take the form of solutions, suspensions, tablets, pills, capsules, sustained release formulations or powders.</p><p id="p-0381" num="0372">The dosage ranges for administration of the compounds or products of the present invention are those which produce the desired therapeutic effect. It will be appreciated that the dosage range required depends on the precise nature of the compound or products, the route of administration, the nature of the formulation, the age of the patient, the nature, extent or severity of the patient's condition, contraindications, if any, and the judgement of the attending physician.

Mature SUMO2 and SUMO3 proteins differ by only three amino acids and are functionally homologous, whilst SUMO4 cannot be efficiently processed in mammalian cells and is not thought to be functional. E4bp4 was expressed in HeLa cells stably expressing 6His-SUMO1, 6His-SUMO2 and 6His-SUMO3 and, following enrichment of all SUMOylated proteins by Ni<sup>2+</sup> affinity chromatography, higher molecular weight forms of E4bp4 were observed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). Each SUMO conjugate adds 10-15 kDa onto the apparent molecular weight of a protein, so the higher molecular weight forms of E4bp4 correspond to multiply SUMOylated versions of the protein. FLAG tagged E4bp4 was also expressed in each 6His-SUMO HeLa cell line and purified using anti-FLAG affinity resin and the same multiple higher molecular weight forms of E4bp4 were observed in the presence of 6His-SUMO2 and 6His-SUMO3 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0388" num="0377">E4bp4 was examined for the presence of the SUMOylation consensus motif &#x3c8;-K-x-E in its primary amino acid sequence (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>). Five potential modification sites were discovered that were all highly conserved across a range of species (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>). To establish if any of these sites were SUMOylated, the central lysine residue at each site was individually mutated to an arginine in the E4bp4 cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis. This mutation abolishes any SUMO modification at that site while maintaining the structural integrity of the protein. To assess the effect of the mutations, each SUMO mutant was expressed in the 6His-SUMO2 HeLa cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>). E4bp4-K219R was the only individual mutant to affect the SUMOylation of E4bp4, but it did not fully remove all E4bp4 SUMOylation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>). All multi-site mutants affected SUMOylation of E4bp4, in particular, the 5&#xd7;-SUMO mutant lacking all 5 putative SUMOylation sites, had no higher molecular weight forms of E4bp4 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0389" num="0378">To confirm the presence of SUMO modifications, purified E4bp4 protein was analysed by mass spectrometry (MS). Studying SUMO modifications by MS is challenging as SUMOylated forms of a protein are generally low in abundance and standard trypsin cleavage results in long SUMO peptide &#x2018;tails&#x2019; remaining conjugated to target peptides, making them difficult to detect in standard MS21. A system was developed where FLAG epitope-tagged E4bp4 protein was expressed in 293T cells, purified by immunoprecipitation and sequentially digested with both trypsin and Glu-C. This novel double digest strategy aimed to produce short E4bp4 peptides with reduced SUMO isopeptide side chains on modified peptides. Using this approach a SUMO modified peptide was predicted to have a -GGTQQQFV side chain attached to a modified lysine. MS/MS analysis readily identified an E4bp4 peptide with a SUMO modification at K219, further confirming the presence of this POST-TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATION (PTM) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>). These data demonstrated that the E4bp4 protein has SUMO modifications.</p><heading id="h-0043" level="1">Example 2&#x2014;SUMOylation of E4bp4 Influences NK Cell Development</heading><p id="p-0390" num="0379">The potential effect of these SUMO modifications on E4bp4's function as a transcription factor in NK cell development was then investigated.</p><p id="p-0391" num="0380">SUMOylation can affect the function of a transcription factor in different ways: cellular localisation; interactions with other proteins or; ability to regulate the expression of target genes. As E4bp4 is critical for the development of NK cells, it was postulated that SUMOylation may regulate this function. Therefore, the ability of E4bp4 to promote NK cell development with and without SUMO modifications was compared. Lineage negative (Lin<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) BM cells were isolated from E4bp4<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212; </sup>mice and transduced with a retrovirus expressing either the WT-form of E4bp4 or one of the E4bp4 mutants lacking SUMO modification sites. WT-form E4bp4 rescued NK cell development from E4bp4<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212; </sup>Lin<sup>&#x2212;</sup> BM cells as previously reported, however, the number of NK cells produced was significantly higher when the cells expressed E4bp4 SUMOylation mutants (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A-C</figref>). As the number of NK cells produced can vary between assays, the percentage of NK cells produced by each mutant was normalised to the positive control condition (i.e. WT-form E4bp4) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>). The same assay was also performed using E4bp4<sup>+/+</sup> Lin BM cells. In the E4bp4<sup>+/+</sup> Lin<sup>&#x2212;</sup> BM cells, expression of WT-form E4bp4 increased the level of NK cell production compared to the empty vector, but again the expression of E4bp4 SUMO mutants led to significantly greater levels of NK cell production (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>,D). These findings showed that SUMOylation can influence the function of E4bp4 and in its absence the activity of E4bp4, as measured by NK cell output, is substantially increased.</p><heading id="h-0044" level="1">Example 3&#x2014;E4bp4 is Multiply Phosphorylated and these Modifications Influence NK Cell Development</heading><p id="p-0392" num="0381">To determine which residues of E4bp4 are phosphorylated FLAG-E4bp4 expressed in 293T cells was purified and digested the protein using trypsin for LC-MS/MS analysis. The tandem MS conclusively revealed that E4bp4 has three phosphorylation sites at serines 286, 301 and 353 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>6</b>-<b>8</b></figref>). Each of these serine residues was mutated to alanine to abolish any phosphorylation but maintain protein conformation. As described for SUMOylation, the aim was to determine if phosphorylation regulates the function of E4bp4. Each phosphorylation mutant was expressed by retroviral expression vector in E4bp4<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212; </sup>Lin<sup>&#x2212;</sup> BM cells and these were cultured in conditions promoting NK cell development. The ability of the phosphorylation mutants to rescue NK cell development was compared to the WT-form of E4bp4 and several of the mutants were found to promote significantly higher levels of NK cell production (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, C). In particular, the S286A mutant produced double the number of NK cells as WT-form E4bp4 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>). The phosphorylation mutants were also transduced into E4bp4<sup>+/+</sup> Lin<sup>&#x2212;</sup> BM cells and NK cell production was greatly enhanced in the cells transduced with the phosphorylation mutants compared to those transduced with the WT-form of E4bp4, particularly with the S286A and S286-353A mutants (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>E</figref>, E). The phenotype observed when phosphorylation sites were mutated replicated that described above for SUMOylation. Therefore, both post-translational modifications (PTMs) negatively regulate the function of E4bp4 in NK cells and manipulating the PTMs of E4bp4 provides a simple mechanism to control NK cell production.</p><heading id="h-0045" level="1">Example 4&#x2014;SUMOylation and Phosphorylation do not Affect the Stability of E4bp4</heading><p id="p-0393" num="0382">SUMOylation and phosphorylation can both affect the stability of a transcription factor and influence its proteasomal degradation. As the absence of both of these PTMs enhanced the function of E4bp4 during NK cell development, it was investigated whether the mutant versions of E4bp4, lacking PTM sites, had altered stability. Using a cycloheximide time course assay on cell lines stably expressing the 5&#xd7;-SUMO, S286-353A mutants or the WT-form of E4bp4, the stability of each form of E4bp4 was compared. Both mutants had very similar half-lives to WT E4bp4 with protein levels reduced by almost half after 8 hours of cycloheximide treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, B).</p><heading id="h-0046" level="1">Example 5&#x2014;the Transcriptional Activity of E4bp4 can be Regulated by SUMOylation and Phosphorylation</heading><p id="p-0394" num="0383">E4bp4 was first identified as a transcriptional repressor and has been shown to repress the expression of numerous target genes in vivo e.g. Il-13 in TH2 cells. However, E4bp4 has likewise been found to transactivate the expression of various target genes, including Id2 and Eomes in NK cells. It was postulated that SUMOylation and phosphorylation might influence the ability of E4bp4 to control target gene expression. To analyse the effect on gene transcription, a luciferase reporter gene assay was used as readout. Cells were co-transfected with an E4bp4 expression vector and a plasmid with three E4bp4 DNA binding sequences upstream of the pGL3 promoter luciferase reporter. E4bp4 was found to act as a transcriptional repressor in this context (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>). The WT-form of E4bp4 consistently led to a 50% decrease in luciferase expression, as previously reported 24, but the E4bp4 5&#xd7;-SUMO mutant promoted even greater transcriptional repression than the WT-form of E4bp4 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>). A similar observation was observed for the E4bp4 phosphorylation mutants, particularly those containing a S286A mutant residue (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>D</figref>). These data indicate the E4bp4 PTM mutants influence transcription via E4bp4-binding consensus sequences in an episomal context. Based on these findings, it was decided to test, in a NK cell context, if the E4bp4 PTM mutants had any effect on the expression of endogenous genes known to strongly influence lymphoid cell development.</p><p id="p-0395" num="0384">The mouse NK cell line MNK was transduced with the WT-form of E4bp4, the 5&#xd7;-SUMO and S286-353A mutants. E4bp4 promoted Eomes expression in these cells and a similar level of expression was seen in the presence of both E4bp4 mutants (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>E</figref>). E4bp4 did not affect the transcription of Gata3 or Tbet, however, it was found to promote the expression of Notch1 and, strikingly, an even greater increase in expression was seen with the 5&#xd7;-SUMO and S286-353A E4bp4 mutants (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>E</figref>). This provided evidence that SUMOylation and phosphorylation negatively regulate the transcriptional activation effect of E4bp4. These data show that removing these PTMs makes the E4bp4 protein both a more potent transcriptional activator or more potent transcriptional repressor depending on context. This observation provides an insight into the mechanism by which the mutant forms of E4bp4 enhance NK cell production to a greater extent than WT-form E4bp4 and suggests a previously unknown mechanism of NK cell development, namely, that E4bp4 might act on the Notch signalling pathway.</p><heading id="h-0047" level="1">Example 6&#x2014;E4bp4 can Act Through Notch to Promote NK Cell Development</heading><p id="p-0396" num="0385">The effect of E4bp4 on the expression of Notch1, and whether this might potentially influence NK cell production, was investigated. Transient Notch signalling has previously been shown to induce the development of NK cells from Pax5<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> pro-B cells and murine HSCs. First, it was examined whether Notch1 is a direct transcriptional target of E4bp4. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) it was determined whether E4bp4 could directly bind to the regulatory region of the Notch1 gene in vivo. MNK-1 cells were transduced with FLAG-tagged E4bp4 and protein-chromatin complexes were precipitated by either IgG, anti-FLAG or anti-E4bp4 antibodies. The regulatory regions around the transcriptional start site (TSS) of Notch1 were searched and six putative E4bp4 binding sites identified (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>). E4bp4 binding was found to be highly enriched at predicted site E, to an even greater degree than the previously best characterised E4bp4 binding regulatory region found in the Per2B gene. In addition, sites A and B upstream of the TSS and sites D and F downstream of the TSS were also enriched in the E4bp4 immunoprecipitated samples (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>). This indicated that E4bp4 binds to regulatory regions of Notch1 that could enhance its transcriptional activation. To further test the hypothesis that E4bp4 can regulate the expression of Notch1, it was postulated that a loss of E4bp4 should influence Notch1 expression in HPCs in vivo. The expression of Notch1 in E4bp4<sup>+/+</sup> and E4bp4<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> Lin<sup>&#x2212;</sup> bone marrow (BM) cells was compared and found that, in the absence of E4bp4, Notch1 expression was indeed significantly reduced as shown previously for another E4bp4 target gene, Id23 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0397" num="0386">As E4bp4 appeared to regulate Notch1 expression, it was speculated that enhanced Notch signalling, at an early stage, could potentially affect the development of NK cells from E4bp4<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212; </sup>HPCs. To study NK cell development from HPCs in the presence or absence of Notch signalling, Lin<sup>&#x2212;</sup> BM cells were cultured on either OP9 stromal cells or OP9-DL1 cells (that express the Notch ligand delta-like 1) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref>). Subsequently, cells were transferred onto fresh OP9 and cultured in the presence of IL-15 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>). When E4bp4<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> cells were grown on control OP9, no NK cell development was observed, but when the E4bp4<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212; </sup>cells were grown on OP9-DL1 for the first part of the culture, remarkably, NK cell development was rescued (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>). The same result was not observed when the cells were grown on OP9-DL1 for the second part of the culture (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>). To eliminate the influence of stromal cells, tissue culture plates were coated with either recombinant delta-like ligand 1 (rDLL1) or rDLL4 protein. These plates were used for the first 7-day period of the culture (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>). Some Delta-like ligands have previously been shown to efficiently induce Notch signalling when immobilised onto plastic surfaces. When cultured on empty plates, the E4bp4<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> Lin<sup>&#x2212;</sup> BM cells did not develop into NK cells, but when grown on rDLL4-coated plates the production of NK cells could be dramatically rescued entirely in the absence of the critical transcription factor for NK cell development (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref>). Only a very partial rescue was observed when the cells were cultured on rDLL1-coated plates (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref>). Additionally, when E4bp4<sup>+/+</sup> HPCs were cultured on rDLL4-coated plates, the level of NK cell production was increased compared to cells grown on uncoated plates (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0398" num="0387">It was then investigated whether abrogation of Notch signalling would have any direct influence on NK cell development by using a method engendering Cre-mediated deletion of the Rbpj gene. Recombination signal-binding protein J<sub>K </sub>(RBP-J) is a transcriptional cofactor critical for the expression of target genes activated by the Notch signalling pathway. HPCs isolated from Rbpj<sup>flox/flox </sup>mice were transduced by a lentivirus co-expressing Cre recombinase and truncated human CD2. The human CD2 expression served to mark all transduced cells. Following transduction, HPCs were cultured on OP9 cells with IL-15 or first cultured on rDLL4-coated plates for 3 days before transfer to OP9 plus IL-15 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>D</figref>). Much reduced numbers of mature NK cells developed from those HPCs subject to Cre-deletion (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>E</figref>). This differential effect was greatly accentuated by pre-incubation with rDLL4 that selectively enhances NK cell development from HPCs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>E</figref>). These data suggest that Notch signalling can play a role in the early stages of NK cell development and this action is as an integral part of the E4bp4-mediated transcriptional network that controls NK cell production.</p><heading id="h-0048" level="1">Example 7&#x2014;the Combination of SR8278 and DLL4 Treatment Results in a Significant Increase in NK Cell Production Ex Vivo</heading><p id="p-0399" num="0388">The effect of combining REV-ERB inhibition and Notch ligand exposure on NK cell production was investigated.</p><p id="p-0400" num="0389">HPCs were cultured in four sets of conditions in addition to control (non-treated) conditions: (i) treated with SR8278 on day 2 of culture (no recombinant DLL4, rDLL4); (ii) cultured on rDLL4 (no SR8278); (iii) cultured on rDLL4 and treated with SR8278 on day 0 of culture; or (iv) treated with SR8278 on day 0 of culture, cultured on rDLL4 from day 2.

The percentages (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref>) are the average of separate triplicate experiments. The addition of SR8278 on day 2 of culture produced a significant increase in the % of NK cells produced (57.5%), as did culturing the HPCs on rDLL4 in the absence of SR8278 (65.3%). Culturing the HPCs on rDLL4 with SR8278 treatment on day 0 of culture elicited a further increase in NK cell production (77%). However, first incubating the HPCs with SR8278 on day 0 and then switching to culture on rDLL4 on day 2 had an even greater effect, with an average of 82.5% of the cells produced being NK cells (and in some repeats, over 85% of cells produced were NK cells).</p><p id="p-0402" num="0391">This experiment was repeated with an expanded set of culture conditions, as set out in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>.

Condition f (SR8278 is added 2 days post isolation of bone marrow progenitors followed by exposure to rDLL4 2 days later) showed the strongest effect.</p><p id="p-0403" num="0392">These data show that treatment of HPCs with SR8278 prior to (or simultaneously with) exposure to rDLL4 synergized to enhance NK cell production. E4bp4 is essential for the canonical production of NK cells. E4bp4 expression is increased by SR8278. Without being bound by theory, this can be explained by the induction of E4bp4 expression by SR8278, which in turn subsequently induces the expression of the Notch receptor. Later exposure to the Notch ligand, rDLL4 will maximize the effect on NK cell production.</p><p id="p-0404" num="0393">Therefore, synergy between rDLL4 indicates that the rapid expansion of NK cells due to rDLL4 exposure following SR8278 treatment may well produce NK cells that have enhanced functionality in terms of their cytotoxicity, cytokine expression and survival post-transfusion to a recipient. Such NK cells would have a significant functional enhancement compared to existing techniques used to produce cells for adoptive transfer.</p><heading id="h-0049" level="1">Example 8&#x2014;Exposure to Notch Ligand Greatly Accelerates the Production of Phenotypically Mature Human NK Cells</heading><p id="p-0405" num="0394">As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, exposure of human CD34<sup>+</sup> cord blood stem cells to the Notch ligand, rDLL4, significantly reduced the time required to produce a large population of mature human NK cells. In particular, exposure to rDLL4 resulted in the production of an NK cell population comprising almost 50% mature (CD45<sup>+</sup>/CD56<sup>+</sup>) NK cells after 12 days, compared with the control method in which only 30% mature NK cells were obtained even after 16 days. Populations with high percentages of mature NK cells are required by clinical protocols used for human NK cell production prior to transfusion to patients. Thus, the methods of the invention have the potential to greatly reduce any possible NK cell exhaustion phenotype which reduces the function of human NK cells after transfusion.</p><heading id="h-0050" level="2">Materials and Methods</heading><heading id="h-0051" level="2">Mice</heading><p id="p-0406" num="0395">Wild type mice, E4bp4 heterozygous mice (E4bp4<sup>+/&#x2212;</sup>), E4bp4 knockout mice (E4bp4<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup>) and REV-ERB-&#x3b1; knockout mice (Rev-erb-&#x3b1;<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup>) were used.

Due to these properties, researchers are interested in boosting the number of NK cells in order to enhance cytotoxicity against cancerous or pathogen-infected cells. NK cells develop from HSCs in the bone marrow and are controlled by a tightly regulated process involving various transcription factors and cytokines. E4bp4 is the most critical gene regulating NK cell development. E4bp4 has a profound effect on NK cell production despite there being only a relatively small increase in E4bp4 mRNA levels during NK cell development. Little is known about any means that exist to control the activity of E4bp4 protein. The ability to control E4bp4 expression would have highly significant implications for the development and production of NK cells.</p><p id="p-0439" num="0422">The present inventions have previously demonstrated that upon administration of SR8278, the production of NK cells in NK cell production assays increases more than 2-fold. In the assays conducted, the optimum time to add SR8278 to the HPC culture for in vitro NK cell production was at Day 2 and the optimum dose was 10 &#x3bc;M. The addition of SR8278 was also found to significantly increase human NK cell development from human HPCs cultured in vitro.</p><p id="p-0440" num="0423">The present inventors have demonstrated that the E4bp4 protein has multiple SUMO modifications and is predominantly modified by the SUMO2/3 isoform. K219 as a site an endogenous site of SUMO modification. The MS analysis of the E4bp4 protein also revealed it is phosphorylated at three sites; S286, S301 and S353.</p><p id="p-0441" num="0424">E4bp4 plays a central role in NK cell development where its expression in CLPs is required to commit developing cells to the NK lineage. The inventors have shown that the SUMOylation and phosphorylation sites of E4bp4 have a dramatic influence both on the activity of E4bp4 and on NK cell development. When comparing the activity of WT-form E4bp4 to mutant forms that lack SUMOylation or phosphorylation sites, the mutant forms were found to consistently promote greater levels of NK cell production. The two types of post-translational modification reported on herein, act in a similar manner to negatively regulate the activity of E4bp4 during NK cell production. E4bp4 was previously demonstrated to be a limiting factor for NK cell development, as transduction of E4bp4+/+Lin&#x2212; BM cells with E4bp4 caused increased levels of NK cell production3,5. Transducing E4bp4+/+ cells with mutant forms of E4bp4 also increased NK cell production but to a greater extent than the WT-form E4bp4. This demonstrated that SUMOylation and phosphorylation both negatively regulate the activity of E4bp4, as removing the sites of these modifications increases E4bp4 activity and ultimately NK cell production. As E4bp4 is critical for NK cell development, it is highly likely that its activity is tightly controlled by multiple mechanisms as aberrant activity could lead to defective haematopoiesis. There are no other well characterized examples where the PTM of a single transcription factor can have such a dramatic effect on a complex biological process such as lineage development.</p><p id="p-0442" num="0425">SUMOylation and phosphorylation were both found to suppress the transcriptional activity of E4bp4 regardless of whether it was activating or repressing transcription. The effect of WT-form E4bp4 and the PTM mutant forms on the expression of transcription factors known to regulate lymphoid commitment was compared. The remarkable outcome of this comparison was that Notch1 expression was upregulated in the presence of WT-form E4bp4 but that expression was significantly further enhanced in the presence of both the E4bp4 5&#xd7;-SUMO mutant and the S286-353A phosphorylation mutant.</p><p id="p-0443" num="0426">Notch signalling activated by extrinsic ligands has previously been suggested to have a role in the development of both murine and human NK cells. It must act transiently during the early phase of NK cell development, as prolonged signalling induces T cell development. The inventors have shown that Cre-mediated deletion of Rbpj in HPCs results in impaired NK cell development, which is the first report of an intrinsic role for Notch in NK cell development. In particular, the data herein demonstrates that Notch signalling significantly enhances NK cell development. In particular, mice with conditional deletion of Notch1 in their haematopoietic cells do not have significantly reduced numbers of NK cells. This could be because the E4bp4-mediated transcriptional network in the conditional knockout cells remains intact and can compensate for the lack of Notch1. Early stages of NK cell development may be somewhat impaired with Notch1 deleted, but homeostatic processes could lead to the accumulation of normal numbers of peripheral NK cells in steady state conditions.</p><p id="p-0444" num="0427">Like Notch, E4bp4 is required during early lymphocyte development and must be expressed in CLPs for them to commit to the NK lineage, however it is dispensable for the maturation and functionality of mature NK cell8. E4bp4 and Notch1 are also important for the development of other innate lymphoid cell types, for example, lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells, where Notch signalling is required to engage the LTi developmental pathway but needs to be turned off later to avoid diversion to T cell fate. The inventors have found that E4bp4 transcriptionally regulates Notch1 as it binds directly to regulatory regions of the Notch1 gene and in the absence of E4bp4, Notch1 expression was reduced in HPCs. E4bp4 most prominently bound to a region 1.8 Kb upstream of the TSS of Notch1 in a similar manner to other transcription factors, such as DLX5 and ER&#x3b2;, known to regulate Notch1 expression. Strikingly, increased Notch signalling during the early part of NK cell development alone was sufficient to completely rescue the development of NK cells from E4bp4<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212; </sup>progenitor cells. This strongly suggests that Notch1 acts downstream of E4bp4 during NK cell development. This rescue was only achieved when Notch ligands were present during the early stage of NK cell development. The rescue from E4bp4<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> progenitors was achieved using both DLL1 expressing OP9 stromal cells and rDLL1 and rDLL4 proteins immobilised on plastic plates. The rDLL4 had a much greater effect than the rDLL1 on NK cell development as DLL4 binds Notch1 with much higher affinity than DLL1.</p><p id="p-0445" num="0428">As Notch1 ligands are expressed in the bone marrow microenvironment, it appears that the availability of Notch signalling at the appropriate time can drive NK cell development. Similarly to E4bp4, Notch1 has also been found to regulate the expression of Eomes48, which could be a further means by which Notch1 enhances NK cell development via the E4bp4-regulated pathway. Thus, the data shown here for NK cells is indicative of a central mechanism linking extrinsic signals via E4bp4 to direct transcriptional control of all ILC production.</p><p id="p-0446" num="0429">In sum, control of E4bp4 expression and/or activity by extrinsic stimuli such as Notch ligands has significant implications for the production of human NK cells for use in immunotherapy. The conventional methods for the production of NK cells from various sources (e.g. induced-pluripotent stem cells and umbilical cord blood stem cells) involves the use of cytokines and stromal cells to commit the cells to the NK lineage, but influencing E4bp4 expression and/or activity, and/or Notch signalling could provide a simple strategy to enhance the process. Thus, the manipulation of E4bp4 activity and/or expression and/or Notch signalling, either alone, and particularly in combination, has potential utility in the production of future NK cell immunotherapeutic products, including the direct mobilisation of NK cell production in vivo as immunotherapy.</p><heading id="h-0070" level="1">Example 9&#x2014;Inclusion of a Pre-Differentiation Step with DLL4 Increases CD16<sup>+</sup> NK Cell Production</heading><p id="p-0447" num="0430">CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs were isolated from human umbilical cord blood and frozen prior to testing.
