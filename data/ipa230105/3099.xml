Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a valve assembly. In particular, but not exclusively, the present invention relates to a valve assembly comprising a housing having a bore, a valve member which is movable relative to the housing bore between open and closed positions, a cutting component arranged within the housing which cooperates with a cutting feature of the valve member, and a seal element arranged within the housing which provides a seal relative to a sealing surface of the valve member. A method of controlling communication along a bore of a housing is also disclosed.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Background Information</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the oil and gas exploration and production industry, wellbore fluids comprising oil and/or gas are recovered to surface through a wellbore which is drilled from surface. The wellbore is lined with metal wellbore-lining tubing, which is known in the industry as casing. The casing is cemented in place within the drilled wellbore and serves numerous purposes including supporting drilled rock formations; preventing undesired ingress/egress of fluid; and providing a pathway through which further tubing and downhole tools can pass.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Numerous tubing strings and tools are run-in to the well during a procedure to complete the well in preparation for production, as well as during subsequent production of well fluids and any intervention procedures which may need to be carried out during the lifetime of the well. For example, well fluids are recovered through production tubing which is installed within the cased well, extending from the surface to the region of a producing formation. Tool strings are run-into the well, carrying downhole tools for performing particular functions within the well. Coiled tubing and wireline can be employed as an efficient method of running a downhole tool into a well.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Safety legislation requires the provision of a blow-out preventer (BOP), comprising an arrangement of shear and seal rams, which provides ultimate pressure control of the well. In an emergency situation, seal rams can seal around tubing extending through the BOP, to seal an annulus around the tubing. If required, shear rams can be activated to sever tubing and/or wireline extending through the BOP, to shut-in the well.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Other valve assemblies are provided as part of tubing strings that are run-into and located within the well. Examples include subsurface safety valves (SSSVs), which are typically installed in an upper part of the wellbore, and subsea test trees (SSTTs), which are typically installed in a lower part of the wellbore. SSSVs and SSTTs can close producing conduits in the event of an emergency.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">SSSVs and SSTTs comprise an arrangement of valves which are required to perform a cutting and/or sealing function. This is to ensure safe cutting of tubing (such as coiled tubing), wireline, slickline or other wellbore components extending through the valves, and subsequent sealing of the SSSV/SSTT bore. Numerous different types of valves can be used including ball valves, gate valves and flapper valves, the latter having a purely sealing function.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Ball-type valves comprise a ball member which is rotatable between an open position in which a bore of the ball member is aligned with a bore of a housing in which the ball member is mounted, and a closed position in which the bore of the ball member is disposed transverse to the housing bore, thereby closing the valve. Gate-type valves comprise a sliding gate which is moved in a direction transverse to a bore of a housing containing the gate, to selectively open and close the housing bore.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As is well known in the industry, it is necessary to seal the housing bore following movement of the ball member (or other valve member) to a closed position. In the past, this has been achieved by deploying a valve comprising a cutting ball member having a cutting component or surface which serves for severing the tubing, wireline, slickline or other wellbore component extending through the housing bore, and a separate sealing ball member. The sealing ball member has a sealing surface or component which cooperates with a sealing surface on or in a wall of the housing, to seal the housing bore following movement of the sealing ball member to its closed position.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In more recent years, valves have been developed comprising a ball member which provides both a cutting and a sealing function, the ball member comprising both a cutting surface or component, and a sealing surface or component which cooperates with the sealing surface of the housing. Whilst this can provide efficiencies in terms of simplifying the structure of the valve and its method of operation, it has been found that it can lead to difficulties in ensuring adequate sealing of the housing bore following operation of the valve. In particular, it has been found that the cutting surface or component can have a tendency to damage the sealing surface of the housing during a closing operation. This has tended to occur particularly where components that are more bulky are to be severed, and/or where components that require the application of a larger cutting force are to be severed (such as, in both cases, coiled tubing).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Efforts have been made in the industry to address this problem. One prior valve is disclosed in European Patent Publication No. EP-2578798A1. The disclosed valve comprises a ball movable between open and closed configurations and having a cutting device arranged to shear against an anvil member when the ball is moving between the open and closed configurations, and a sealing sleeve providing a seat for seating of the ball when the ball is in the closed configuration. The sealing sleeve is moveable relative to the anvil member when the ball is moving from the open to the closed configuration, so that during opening and closing, the sealing sleeve is displaced away from the cutting device as the cutting device engages the anvil member. The sealing sleeve is pushed away from the ball and the anvil to a maximum separation (which is a small distance away from the ball) at the point on the stroke when the cutting surface of the ball is moving past the anvil member. The sealing sleeve is therefore moved out of contact with the ball when the cutting surface engages the anvil member, and moves back into contact with the ball when the cutting surface has passed the anvil member and the sealing surface of the ball is aligned with the sealing sleeve.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Movement of the sealing sleeve away from a position in which it contacts the ball is achieved by a displacement mechanism comprising a cam device having a non-circular profile, which pushes the sealing sleeve away from the ball. This increases the complexity of the valve, with an associated impact on manufacturing and maintenance costs. It also makes the valve more bulky, in comparison to prior valves which do not include such a displacement mechanism. This can be problematic as space is often restricted, as would be the case, for example, in an SSSV or SSTT located in a marine riser. Further, the mechanical arrangement by which the sealing sleeve is moved away from the ball provides only a small movement of the sealing sleeve away from the ball, with the possibility of the sealing sleeve coming into contact with part of a downhole component that has been deployed through the valve and severed during closing of the ball. The mechanical arrangement could also create difficulties in the event that the sealing sleeve becomes jammed within a housing for the ball, for example through contact with part of a downhole component that has been severed, or by the presence of debris. In an extreme situation, this could hamper movement of the ball towards its closed position, since the cam device is mounted to the ball and contacts the sealing sleeve to move it away from the position in which it contacts the ball. Jamming of the sealing sleeve could therefore restrict movement of the ball, and so closing of the valve. In addition, the requirement for the cam device to urge the sealing sleeve away from the ball has the result that a greater force is required to move the ball between its different positions than would otherwise be the case.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to a first aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a valve assembly comprising: a housing having a bore; a valve member arranged within the housing, the valve member being movable relative to the housing bore between an open position in which communication along the bore is permitted, and a closed position in which communication along the bore is restricted, the valve member comprising a cutting feature and a sealing surface; a cutting component arranged within the housing, the cutting component cooperating with the cutting feature of the valve member when the valve member is moved to the closed position; a first seal element arranged within the housing, the first seal element providing a first seal relative to the sealing surface of the valve member, to seal the valve member relative to the housing; and a second seal element arranged within the housing, the second seal element providing a second seal relative to the sealing surface of the valve member, to seal the valve member relative to the housing, the second seal element being movable relative to the housing bore between a first position in which it is out of sealing contact with the sealing surface of the valve member and a second position in which it is in sealing contact with the sealing surface of the valve member.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The provision of a valve assembly comprising such first and second seal elements may provide an enhanced sealing effect on the valve member, in comparison to a valve assembly comprising only a single seal element. It may also or alternatively provide a backup for the event that the first seal element becomes damaged, for example through contact with the cutting feature of the valve member, when the valve member is moved to the closed position, and/or through contact with part of a body (e.g. a downhole component) that has been deployed through the valve and severed during closing of the valve member. The second seal that is provided by the second seal element may be on or with the same valve member as the first seal, and may be with the same sealing surface of the valve member.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a second aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a valve assembly comprising: a housing having a bore; a valve member arranged within the housing, the valve member being movable relative to the housing bore between an open position in which communication along the bore is permitted, and a closed position in which communication along the bore is restricted, the valve member comprising a cutting feature and a sealing surface; a cutting component arranged within the housing, the cutting component cooperating with the cutting feature of the valve member when the valve member is moved to the closed position; and a seal element arranged within the housing, the seal element providing a seal relative to the sealing surface of the valve member, to seal the valve member relative to the housing, the seal element being movable relative to the housing bore between a first position in which it is out of sealing contact with the sealing surface of the valve member and a second position in which it is in sealing contact with the sealing surface of the valve member, the seal element being movable between the first and second positions by the application of fluid pressure.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The provision of a valve assembly comprising a seal element which is movable between such first and second positions on the application of fluid pressure may provide the advantage that movement of the seal element between its different positions is separate from (in particularly mechanically separated from) movement of the valve member between its open and closed positions. This may have the effect that the valve member itself is not required to impart a force (in particular a mechanical force) on the seal element to move it between different positions. Movement of the seal element between its different positions by applied fluid pressure may also help to avoid problems that might occur if the seal element should become jammed, as a relatively high pressure force may be able to be applied to the seal element to release it, without requiring that force to be transmitted through the valve member to the seal element. A hydraulic lock may also exist which serves to maintain the seal element in its second position (in sealing contact with the sealing surface of the valve member), when the valve member is in its closed position, and optionally in its first position (out of sealing contact with the sealing surface of the valve member).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the valve assembly of the first aspect of the present disclosure, the seal element may be movable between the first and second positions by the application of fluid pressure.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the valve assembly of the second aspect of the present disclosure, the seal element may be a second seal element, and the valve assembly may comprise a first seal element as defined in the first aspect.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to a third aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a valve assembly comprising: a housing having a bore; a valve member arranged within the housing, the valve member being movable relative to the housing bore between an open position in which communication along the bore is permitted, and a closed position in which communication along the bore is restricted, the valve member comprising a cutting feature and a sealing surface; a cutting component arranged within the housing, the cutting component cooperating with the cutting feature of the valve member when the valve member is moved to the closed position; a first seal element arranged within the housing, the first seal element providing a first seal relative to the sealing surface of the valve member, to seal the valve member relative to the housing; and a second seal element arranged within the housing, the second seal element providing a second seal relative to the sealing surface of the valve member, to seal the valve member relative to the housing, the second seal element being movable relative to the housing bore between a first position in which it is out of sealing contact with the sealing surface of the valve member and a second position in which it is in sealing contact with the sealing surface of the valve member, the second seal element being movable between the first and second positions by the application of fluid pressure.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The valve assembly of the third aspect may effectively be considered to be a combination of features of the valve assemblies of the first and second aspects. The advantages discussed above in relation to the first and second aspects may therefore be found in the valve assembly of the third aspect.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Optional further features of the valve assemblies of any one of the first to third aspects may be derived from the following text. In the context of the valve assembly of the second aspect, references below to further features of the second seal element may be taken as applying in a corresponding fashion to the seal element of the second aspect.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The second seal element of the first and/or third aspects, and the seal element of the second aspect, may be movable between its positions by the application of fluid pressure on the seal element.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The second seal element may be hydraulically actuated for movement between its first and second positions. The second seal element may be or may comprise a piston. The housing may define at least part of a cylinder within which the piston is mounted. The piston may be movable within the cylinder between first and second positions, which may correspond to the first and second positions of the second seal element. The piston may comprise opposed first and second piston faces. Application of fluid pressure to the first piston face may move the second seal element in a first direction relative to the housing bore. Application of fluid pressure to the second piston face may move the second seal element in a second direction relative to the housing bore. The second direction may be opposite to the first direction. One of the first and second directions may be towards the valve member, and the other one of the first and second directions may be away from the valve member.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The valve assembly may be arranged so that movement of the second seal element from its first position to its second position is only triggered following commencement of movement of the valve member towards its closed position. The valve assembly may be arranged so that movement of the second seal element from its first position to its second position is only triggered following movement of the valve member to a position in which the second seal element is shielded from contact with the cutting feature of the valve member, and/or cannot contact the cutting feature. In said position of the valve member, the valve member itself, for example the sealing surface, may shield the second seal element from contacting the cutting feature. The valve assembly may be arranged so that movement of the second seal element from its first position to its second position is only triggered following movement of the valve member to a position in which its cutting feature is proximate the cutting component. The cutting feature and the cutting component may cooperate to cut a body extending through the housing bore in an overlapping scissors-type cutting or shearing action. The valve assembly may be arranged so that movement of the second seal element from its first position to its second position is only triggered following movement of the valve member to a position in which the cutting feature overlaps the cutting component. The valve assembly may be arranged so that movement of the second seal element from its first position to its second position is only triggered following location of the valve member in its closed position. This may require completion of a movement of the valve member to its closed position before movement of the second seal element is triggered.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The valve assembly may be arranged so that the valve member is moved from its closed position towards its open position when the second seal element is moved from its second position towards its first position. The valve assembly may be arranged so that movement of the valve member from its closed position towards its open position is only triggered following movement of the second seal element away from its first position, optionally following movement of the second seal element to a position in which it is out of sealing contact with the valve member. The valve assembly may be arranged so that movement of the valve member from its closed position to its open position is only triggered after the second seal element has moved a majority of a distance from its second position towards its first position, optionally in which the second seal element is proximate an end of its travel to the first position. The valve assembly may be arranged so that movement of the valve member from its closed position to its open position is only triggered following location of the second seal element in its first position. This may require completion of a movement of the second seal element to its first position before movement of the valve member is triggered.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The arrangements for the valve assembly specified in the preceding paragraphs may provide the advantage that contact between the second seal element and the valve member is avoided during movement of the valve member between its open and closed positions. This may help to avoid contact between the cutting feature of the valve member and the second seal element, as the valve member moves between its positions. This may reduce a likelihood of damage to the sealing surface of the valve member, and/or a sealing surface of the second seal element, during movement of the valve member between its positions.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The valve assembly may comprise a control assembly for controlling at least one of: a) movement of the valve member between its open and closed positions; and b) movement of the second seal element between its first and second positions. The control assembly may be arranged to control both such movements. Optionally, the control assembly is arranged or configured to sequence the movements of the valve member and the second seal element as set out in the preceding paragraphs.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The control assembly may be a hydraulic control assembly. The valve assembly may be adapted to be coupled to a source of fluid, suitably hydraulic fluid, to provide motive power for movement of the valve member and/or the second seal element. The valve assembly may comprise at least one fluid line for communicating with the source of fluid, and may comprise a fluid supply line and a fluid return line.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The valve member may be moveable between the open and closed positions by the application of fluid pressure. The control assembly may be arranged to control the supply of fluid to and from a piston associated with the valve member, movement of the piston causing the valve member to move between its open and closed positions. The control assembly may be arranged to control the supply of fluid to and from the second seal element, to move it between its open and closed positions. The control assembly may be arranged or configured so that it is operated to supply fluid to the valve member, to move it from its open position towards its closed position, and then to supply fluid to the second seal element to move it from its first position towards its second position. The control assembly may be arranged or configured so that it only supplies fluid to the second seal element, to move it towards its second position, when the valve member has commenced its movement towards the closed position. The control assembly may be arranged or configured so that it supplies fluid to the second seal element, to commence its movement from the second position to the first position, and only then supplies fluid to the valve member to move it from the closed position towards the open position. The control assembly may be arranged or configured so that it only supplies fluid to the valve member, to move it to its open position, when the second seal element has commenced its movement to the first position. The control assembly may be arranged to control the supply of fluid to and from the valve member piston, and the second seal element, according to the sequence of operation defined in the preceding paragraphs.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The control assembly may comprise a seal control valve for controlling the supply of fluid to the second seal element, to move it from its first position to its second position. The control valve may be associated with or provided by the valve member piston. The control valve may comprise a flow passage having a flow port which can communicate with an inlet port of a communication passage associated with the second seal element, when the piston is operated to move the valve member towards its closed position. The valve member piston may comprise a seal which is arranged to isolate the flow port from the inlet port of the communication passage. Movement of the valve member piston towards a position in which the valve member is in its closed position may cause fluid communication between the flow port and the inlet port of the communication passage to be opened.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The control assembly may comprise a valve member control valve for controlling the supply of fluid to the valve member, suitably the valve member piston, to move it from the closed position to the open position. The control valve may be or may comprise a valve element, such as a poppet, which is biased towards a closed position in which fluid flow to the valve member, to move it to its open position, is prevented. The control valve element may be adapted to cooperate with the second seal element to move to an open position in which fluid flow to the valve member, to move it to its open position, is permitted. The control valve element may be contacted by the second seal element (or a component coupled to the second seal element) when it is moved to its first position, which may move the control valve element from its closed position to its open position.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The control assembly may comprise an actuator for controlling at least one of the movements a) and b) set out above. The actuator may be associated with or may define one or more control valves for controlling at least one of said movements, and may be operable to open and close said control valve(s). The actuator may be operable to cause at least one of said movements on receipt of a control signal. Receipt of a control signal by the actuator may cause the actuator to open a fluid communication path and/or to supply fluid to the selected one or more of the valve member and the second seal element (suitably by controlling said valve or valves), to cause the desired movement. The actuator may be an electro-mechanical actuator such as a solenoid. The control signal may then be an electrical control signal. The actuator may be a pressure switch, such as a roller or plunger type pressure switch. The control signal may then be a pressure signal. The control signal may be issued from surface to the valve assembly, for example via a control line (electrical or hydraulic); via a fluid pressure signal, acoustic signal, radio or other frequency signal, which may be transmitted through a column of fluid in tubing or a wellbore in which the valve assembly is deployed, or through tubing coupled to the valve assembly, as appropriate. The valve assembly may comprise a controller associated with the control assembly, which may receive the control signal and issue a command signal to the actuator to operate the actuator.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The valve member may be a ball member or ball type member.

In the open position of the valve member, fluid communication along the bore may be permitted. In the closed position of the valve member, the housing bore may be completely closed by the valve member, and so communication along the bore may be prevented. In the closed position of the valve member, fluid communication along the bore may be restricted, and optionally may be prevented. The reference to communication along the bore should be taken to encompass the passage of bodies along the housing bore, such bodies including but not restricted to wireline, slickline, coiled tubing and other tubing, downhole tools and parts thereof including tubing forming a tool string.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The cutting component and the first seal element may be provided together, for example on a body that is mountable within or provided as part of the housing.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The valve assembly may be for use in an oil and/or gas well, and may be for controlling the flow of fluid into and/or out of the well.

The first seal element may be provided on or as part of a body which is mounted within the housing. The first seal element may comprise a sealing surface adapted to cooperate with the sealing surface of the valve member to provide the first seal.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The cutting component may cooperate with the cutting feature of the valve member when the valve member is moved to the closed position to cut a body extending along the bore of the housing.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The second seal element may be disposed inwardly, optionally radially inwardly, of the first seal element. Alternatively, the second seal element may be disposed outwardly, optionally radially outwardly, of the first seal element.

The second seal element may be generally annular. The second seal element may be generally tubular, and may take the form of a sleeve. The second seal element may comprise a sealing surface adapted to cooperate with the sealing surface of the valve member to provide the second seal. The sealing surface may be provided on, near or adjacent an end of the second seal element, optionally an end which faces towards the valve member.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The valve member may comprise a valve bore which permits communication along the housing bore when the valve member is in the open position. In the open position of the valve member, the bore of the valve member may be substantially aligned with the housing bore. The valve member bore may describe a minimum internal dimension, which may be a diameter (for example where the bore is circular in cross-section). The second seal element may comprise a bore, which may be substantially aligned with the housing bore. The second seal element bore may describe a minimum internal dimension, which may be a diameter (for example where the bore is circular in cross-section). The minimum internal dimension described by the second seal element bore may be substantially the same as, or optionally greater than, the minimum internal dimension described by the valve member bore.

The use and functionality of landing strings are well known in the industry for through-riser deployment of equipment, such as completion architecture, well testing equipment, intervention tools and the like into a subsea well from a surface vessel.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">When in a deployed configuration the landing string <b>10</b> extends through the riser <b>12</b> and into the BOP <b>18</b>. While deployed the landing string <b>10</b> provides many functions, including permitting the safe deployment of wireline or coiled tubing equipment (not shown) through the landing string and into the well, providing the necessary primary well control barriers and permitting emergency disconnect while isolating both the well and landing string <b>10</b>. Wireline or coiled tubing deployment may be facilitated via a lubricator valve <b>22</b> which is located proximate the surface vessel <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Well control and isolation in the event of an emergency disconnect is provided by a suite of valves, which are located at a lower end of the landing string <b>10</b> inside the BOP. The valve suite includes a lower valve assembly called the subsea test tree valve (SSTT valve or SSTT) <b>24</b> which provides a safety barrier to contain well pressure, and also functions to cut any wireline or coiled tubing (or other body) which extends through the landing string <b>10</b>. The valve suite also includes an upper valve assembly, typically referred to as a retainer valve <b>26</b>, which isolates the landing string contents and which can be used to vent trapped pressure from between the retainer valve <b>26</b> and SSTT valve <b>24</b>. A shear sub component <b>28</b> extends between the retainer valve <b>26</b> and SSTT valve <b>24</b>, which is capable of being sheared by shear rams <b>30</b> of the BOP <b>18</b> if required. A slick joint <b>32</b> extends below the SSTT valve <b>24</b> which facilitates engagement with BOP pipe (seal) rams <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The landing string <b>10</b> may include an interface arrangement for interfacing with other oilfield equipment. For example, the landing string <b>10</b> can include a tubing hanger <b>36</b> at its lowermost end, which engages with a corresponding tubing hanger <b>38</b> provided in the wellhead <b>20</b>. When the landing string <b>10</b> is fully deployed and the corresponding tubing hangers <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> are engaged, the weight of a lower string (such as a completion, workover string or the like which extends into the well and thus is not illustrated) becomes supported through the wellhead <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, there is shown a longitudinal cross-sectional view of a known type of valve, which can perform various functions, and which can form part of the SSTT valve <b>24</b> of the landing string <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. It should be noted that although the SSTT valve <b>24</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a dual valve assembly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows only a single valve, for ease of illustration. The SSTT valve <b>24</b> is of the type disclosed in the applicant's International Patent Publication No. WO-2016/113525, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by way of reference, and which takes the general form of a ball-type valve.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The ball valve <b>24</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> includes a housing, generally identified by reference numeral <b>40</b>, which is secured between the upper shear sub component <b>28</b> and the lower slick joint <b>32</b>. As such, the ball valve <b>24</b> is installed in-line with the landing string <b>10</b>, which can be considered to be a fluid conduit system. The housing <b>40</b> has a bore <b>41</b> and accommodates a ball seat <b>42</b> and a ball-type valve member <b>44</b>, the ball member <b>44</b> being rotatable about axis <b>46</b> to selectively close the ball valve <b>24</b> and control flow through the landing string <b>10</b>. The illustrated ball member <b>44</b> is rotatable in the direction of arrow <b>48</b> to close the ball valve <b>24</b>. The ball seat <b>42</b> and ball member <b>44</b> define respective throughbores <b>50</b> and <b>52</b>. When aligned, the throughbores <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> define a flow path through the valve <b>24</b>. When misaligned (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), the throughbores <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> prevent or restrict flow through the valve. When the ball member <b>44</b> is closed, a sealing area <b>54</b> is defined between the ball seat <b>42</b> and the ball member <b>44</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The ball member <b>44</b> is rotatable between an open position in which the throughbores <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> are aligned, and a closed position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) in which the ball bore <b>52</b> is disposed transverse to the seat bore <b>50</b>, so that the throughbores are misaligned. In the closed position, flow through the valve <b>24</b>, and the passage of equipment through the valve and into the wellbore, is prevented. As described in detail in WO-2016/113525, a leading edge surface <b>56</b> of the ball member <b>44</b> is configured to cut through a body (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), such as wireline, coiled tubing or the like which extends through the valve <b>24</b> and landing string <b>10</b>, upon closure of the ball member <b>44</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The housing <b>40</b> is configured to be mechanically secured in-line with the landing string <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The housing <b>40</b> comprises a generally cylindrical member which extends between axially opposing end flange connectors <b>64</b> and <b>66</b>, which are secured to flange components <b>68</b> and <b>70</b> of the shear sub <b>28</b> and slick joint <b>32</b>, respectively. The housing <b>40</b> is designed to accommodate mechanical forces, such as axial and bending forces, associated with the landing string <b>10</b> and those of any supported lower string. The housing <b>40</b> also provides pressure containment of any and all internal and/or external pressures.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The ball valve further includes an actuator assembly, generally identified by reference numeral <b>72</b>, for use in actuating the ball member <b>44</b> to rotate it relative to the ball seat <b>42</b> between its open and closed positions. The actuator assembly drives a cage <b>74</b> coupled to the ball member <b>44</b>, which is translated axially to rotate the ball member between its open and closed positions, via trunnions (not shown in this drawing) mounted on the ball member. In the present example, the actuator assembly <b>72</b> comprises a piston arrangement, however it should be understood that other actuators may be used.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, there is shown a longitudinal sectional view of a valve assembly according to an embodiment of the present invention, which may have a similar function to the valve assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and described above. However, the valve assembly of the present invention may have a use in relation to other types of valve assembly beyond those discussed above and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The valve assembly may have a use in industries other than the oil and gas exploration and production industry. In general terms, the valve assembly of the invention may have a use generally in any situation in which communication along a tubular component (in particular the control of flow of a fluid through a tubular component) is required, and/or where there is a requirement to sever a body disposed within a bore of a tubular component.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The valve assembly is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> by reference numeral <b>24</b><i>a</i>. Like components of the valve assembly <b>24</b><i>a </i>with the valve assembly <b>24</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> share the same reference numerals, with the addition of the suffix &#x2018;a&#x2019;.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The valve assembly <b>24</b><i>a </i>generally comprises a housing <b>40</b><i>a </i>having a bore <b>41</b><i>a</i>, and a valve member in the form of a ball-type member <b>44</b><i>a</i>, arranged within the housing. The valve member <b>44</b><i>a </i>is moveable relative to the housing bore <b>41</b><i>a </i>between an open position which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, and a closed position which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>. In the open position of the valve member <b>44</b><i>a</i>, communication along the housing bore <b>41</b><i>a </i>is permitted, whilst in the closed position, communication along the bore <b>41</b><i>a </i>is restricted. The valve member <b>44</b><i>a </i>comprises a cutting feature, which takes the form of a hardened cutting edge surface <b>56</b><i>a</i>, and a sealing surface <b>80</b>, which is provided by a generally spherical outer surface of the valve member <b>44</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The valve assembly <b>24</b><i>a </i>also comprises a cutting component <b>42</b><i>a</i>, which is provided by a valve seat, the cutting component arranged within the housing <b>40</b><i>a</i>. The cutting component <b>42</b><i>a </i>cooperates with the cutting feature <b>56</b><i>a </i>of the valve member <b>44</b><i>a</i>, and can cut any body that might reside within the bore <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the housing <b>40</b><i>a </i>when the valve member is moved to the closed position. As will be understood by persons skilled in the art, the body may comprise any suitable element that can be deployed into the wellbore of an oil or gas well, including but not restricted to wireline, slickline, tubing such as coiled tubing or tool strings, downhole tools and parts thereof. In the illustrated embodiment, the cutting component comprises a hardened cutting surface <b>82</b> provided on the seat <b>42</b><i>a</i>, and which may suitably take the form of a cutting rim, or cutting teeth, extending at least partway around a circumference of the seat <b>42</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The valve assembly <b>24</b><i>a </i>also comprises a first seal element <b>84</b> arranged within the housing <b>40</b><i>a</i>, the first seal element providing a first seal relative to the sealing surface <b>80</b> of the valve member <b>44</b><i>a</i>, to seal the valve member relative to the housing <b>40</b><i>a</i>. The first seal element suitably takes the form of a generally annular seal located in a face <b>86</b> defined by an end of the seat <b>42</b><i>a</i>, and which may be of a suitable sealing material. Elastomeric materials may be suitable for forming the seal element <b>84</b>, although a metal-to-metal seal may be preferred, for example by a suitably selected metal or metal alloy material which may be of a softer material than that forming a remainder of the seat <b>42</b><i>a</i>. It will also be understood that a curved face <b>86</b> of the seat <b>42</b><i>a </i>may form at least part of the first seal element, for example providing a metal-to-metal seal with the sealing surface <b>80</b> of the valve member <b>44</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The valve assembly <b>24</b><i>a </i>also comprises a second seal element arranged within the housing <b>40</b><i>a</i>, the second seal element indicated generally by reference numeral <b>88</b>. The second seal element <b>88</b> provides a second seal relative to the sealing surface <b>80</b> of the valve member <b>44</b><i>a</i>, to seal the valve member relative to the housing <b>40</b><i>a</i>. The second seal element <b>88</b> is moveable relative to the housing bore <b>41</b><i>a </i>between a first position in which it is out of sealing contact with the sealing surface <b>80</b> of the valve member <b>44</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), and a second position in which it is in sealing contact with the sealing surface <b>80</b> of the valve member <b>44</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The valve assembly <b>24</b><i>a </i>is operated to sever, shear and/or cut a body extending along the bore <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the housing <b>40</b><i>a</i>, and to seal the housing bore, in a similar fashion to the prior valve assembly <b>24</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> and discussed above. This is achieved by operating the ball valve member <b>44</b><i>a </i>to rotate between its open position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and its closed position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>. As will be understood, such movement of the valve member <b>44</b><i>a </i>acts to sever any body that might reside in the housing bore <b>41</b><i>a </i>at that time, and to seal the housing bore by contact between the first seal element <b>84</b> and the sealing surface <b>80</b> of the valve member <b>44</b><i>a</i>. This provides the first seal described above.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In addition however, the present invention can provide a second seal, which potentially provides numerous advantages. These include that the first and second seal elements <b>84</b> and <b>88</b> provide an enhanced sealing effect on the valve member <b>44</b><i>a</i>, in comparison to a valve assembly comprising only a single seal element, such as the valve assembly <b>24</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. It may provide a backup for the event that the first seal element <b>84</b> becomes damaged, for example through contact with the cutting edge surface <b>56</b><i>a </i>of the valve member <b>44</b><i>a </i>(during rotation towards its closed position), and/or through contact with part of a body that has been deployed through the valve and severed during closure of the valve member <b>44</b><i>a</i>. It can also provide the advantage that the second seal element <b>88</b> can be located in a position in which it is out of sealing contact with the valve member <b>44</b><i>a </i>when a cutting operation is performed, to reduce a risk of damage to a sealing surface of the second seal element, for example by contact with the cutting edge surface <b>56</b><i>a </i>of the valve member <b>44</b><i>a </i>and/or a body residing in the housing bore <b>41</b><i>a </i>during cutting.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the illustrated embodiment, the second seal element <b>88</b> is moveable between its first position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, and its second position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, by the application of fluid pressure. This may provide the advantage that movement of the second seal element <b>88</b> between its different positions is separate from (and in particular mechanically separated from) movement of the valve member <b>44</b><i>a </i>between its open and closed positions. This has the effect that the valve member <b>44</b><i>a </i>may not itself be required to impart a force (in particular a mechanical force) on the second seal element <b>88</b> to move it between its different positions. Movement of the second seal element <b>88</b> between its different positions by applied fluid pressure may also help to avoid problems that might occur if the seal element should become jammed, as a relatively high pressure force can be applied to the seal element to release it, without requiring that a high (mechanical) force be transmitted through the valve member <b>44</b><i>a </i>on to the seal element <b>88</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Whilst the present invention is primarily described in this document as comprising first and second seal elements <b>84</b> and <b>88</b>, embodiments of the invention may comprise only the movable, pressure activated seal element <b>88</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The invention will now be described in more detail, with reference also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, which is a view corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> but showing the valve member <b>44</b><i>a </i>during movement from its open position to its closed position.

Fluid contained within the portion of the cylinder <b>122</b> in communication with the first face <b>130</b> of the piston <b>124</b> is then exhausted from the cylinder through the hydraulic line <b>128</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">It will be understood that modifications can be made to the control assembly <b>90</b> in order to provide variations on the precise sequencing of the operation of the valve member <b>44</b><i>a </i>and the second seal element <b>88</b>. For example, by varying a position of the seal <b>140</b> on the valve member piston <b>124</b>, flow port <b>136</b> and/or of the branch <b>142</b>, the second seal element <b>88</b> can be arranged so that it only moves to the second position (in sealing contact with the valve member) when the valve member has completed its movement to the closed position. By varying the way in which the control valve <b>140</b> operates, the valve member <b>44</b><i>a </i>can be arranged so that it only moves from its closed position to its open position after the second seal element has completed its movement to its first position.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">The second seal element <b>88</b> is typically located inwardly of the first seal element <b>84</b>, specifically radially inwardly of the valve seat <b>42</b><i>a </i>carrying the first seal element <b>84</b>. This may facilitate assembly and maintenance of the valve assembly <b>24</b><i>a</i>. The valve member <b>44</b><i>a </i>comprises a bore <b>52</b><i>a </i>which describes a minimum internal dimension, which in the illustrated embodiment is a diameter d<sub>1</sub>. The second seal element <b>88</b> comprises a bore <b>89</b>, which is substantially aligned with the housing bore <b>41</b><i>a</i>. The second seal element bore <b>89</b> describes a minimum internal dimension, which in the illustrated embodiment is a diameter d<sub>2</sub>. The minimum internal diameter d<sub>2 </sub>described by the second seal element bore <b>89</b> is substantially the same as, and optionally greater than, the minimum internal dimension d<sub>1 </sub>described by the valve member bore <b>52</b><i>a</i>. This may provide the advantage of reducing a likelihood of the end of the second seal element <b>88</b> defining the sealing surface <b>98</b> contacting a body being passed through the housing bore <b>41</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The present invention may provide an effective dual seal barrier and hydraulic system for operating a moveable seal element to engage a valve member. The valve assembly may be operable multiple times for movement between open and closed positions, with an effective seal being provided. The first seal element (which may be optional) may provide a seal in both open and closed positions of the valve member, and indeed during movement of the valve member between those positions. The second seal element may only be moved into sealing contact with the valve member when the valve member is moved towards its closed position. The valve member may only be moved from its closed position towards its open position when the second seal element has been moved out of sealing contact with the valve member.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Various modifications may be made to the foregoing without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The control assembly may comprise an actuator for controlling at least one of the movements a) and b) set out above. The actuator may be associated with or may define one or more control valves for controlling at least one of said movements, and may be operable to open and close said control valve(s). The actuator may be operable to cause at least one of said movements on receipt of a control signal. Receipt of a control signal by the actuator may cause the actuator to open a fluid communication path and/or to supply fluid to the selected one or more of the valve member and the second seal element (suitably by controlling said valve or valves), to cause the desired movement. The actuator may be an electro-mechanical actuator such as a solenoid. The control signal may then be an electrical control signal. The actuator may be a pressure switch, such as a roller or plunger type pressure switch. The control signal may then be a pressure signal. The control signal may be issued from surface to the valve assembly, for example via a control line (electrical or hydraulic); via a fluid pressure signal, acoustic signal, radio or other frequency signal, which may be transmitted through a column of fluid in tubing or a wellbore in which the valve assembly is deployed, or through tubing coupled to the valve assembly, as appropriate. The valve assembly may comprise a controller associated with the control assembly, which may receive the control signal and issue a command signal to the actuator to operate the actuator.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
