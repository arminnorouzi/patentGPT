The flexibility and capability to point beams to moving users is a definite advantage for the 5G (5th Generation of cellular network) or Low-Earth Orbit (&#x201c;LEO&#x201d;) satellite systems. The precision of the beam shape with its side lobes depends on the accuracy of the phase and amplitude of the Beamforming Network (&#x201c;BFN&#x201d;). When performed digitally, the initial accuracy is excellent but degrades with the variations found in the radio frequency (&#x201c;RF&#x201d;) circuitry. When using analog beamforming, the BFN itself adds more variance and errors when forming a beam. The key point is the active array elements and its components need to be calibrated to ensure proper coherency of the array element weights applied.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are two fundamental architectures used to calibrate a PAA. A first is on-board calibration which uses embedded sensors close to the array and local processing. A second is remote in-orbit calibration using a ground terminal. The first calibration approach (on-board) does not need a dedicated terminal but uses hardware and software resources in the spacecraft to perform the calibration tasks. The second calibration approach (remote calibration), by not requiring such on-board hardware and software resources, may advantageously lower the cost and complexity of the PAA and satellite payload.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Several methods have been developed over the years to solve the remote calibration problem. Work from Silverstein (e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6,384,781 B1), Bast (e.g. PCT Publication No. WO 2005/086285 A1), and Oodo et al. (e.g. &#x201c;A remote calibration for a transmitting array antenna by using synchronous orthogonal codes&#x201d;, IEICE Trans. Comm. Vol. E84-B, No. 7, 5 Jul. 2001) have paved the way in that regard, respectively. The method described by Silverstein lacks performance in terms of calibration error especially when tracking a moving target. Since the objective is to calibrate the phased array antenna remotely, the communications channel varying with time and conditions makes the tasks difficult and thus requires a strong algorithm to overcome the channel impairments.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another challenge when sending calibration signals over the air is to prevent having hot spots or high radiated power density or Equivalent Isotropically Radiated Power (&#x201c;EIRP&#x201d;) points in space and thus reduce interfering signals. This is particularly true for space systems under strict regulations, such as from the International Telecommunication Union (&#x201c;ITU&#x201d;), the Federal Communications Commission (&#x201c;FCC&#x201d;), or other regulatory commissions. Further, remote calibration approaches which calibrate a Single Element (SE) at a time suffer from Signal-to-Noise Ratio (&#x201c;SNR&#x201d;), thus taking more integration time and may be difficult to implement in hardware without RF switches in analog beamforming.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Some existing calibration systems use a separate antenna to send a reference signal. Such an approach can be more costly and use more volume and mass on the satellite.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Generally PAAs have several beams which this calibration method is taking advantage of.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Analog beamforming in multi-beam PAAs may take a long time to calibrate when the number of beams, B, and the number of array elements, N, are high. The number of RF beamformer adjustments to calibrate, being NxB, could be in the several thousands. Being able to calibrate the beams simultaneously can thus provide a great advantage. Digital beamforming in multi-beam generally has fewer RF paths to calibrate but can also benefit from this method.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, there is a need for an improved system and method to calibrate a phased array antenna that overcomes at least some of the disadvantages of existing systems and methods.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A system for calibrating a phased array antenna (&#x201c;PAA&#x201d;) is provided.

In an aspect, the proposed calibration system and method uses a dedicated calibration terminal. The dedicated calibration terminal performs the computation and calibration of the remote active antenna. The phased array antenna under calibration sends/receives two signals that are coded and sent with a specific BFN coded weights sequence. This technique uses multiple elements encoding rather than a Single Element (SE) successive calibration approach. This helps reduce the overall calibration time, maintain the active antenna in working operation, and obviate using external probes located in proximity to the antenna. All phased array antenna array elements can be calibrated fast enough to compensate for changes such as temperature. In some embodiments, a few seconds per beam may be needed to calibrate one antenna. With the proposed method, multiple beams can be simultaneously calibrated, which may further reduce the calibration time in multi-beams systems.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Another advantage of the present disclosure is that the dedicated calibration terminal performs coherent detection of two signals, the reference and calibration signals, using exactly the same RF channel outside of the PAA. This approach removes the channel varying impairment significantly, which is a key advantage.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">A further advantage of the present disclosure is that the calibration method uses formed beams for both signals instead of distinct sources and uses the same antenna, as opposed to two (separate antennas) as found in existing approaches. The beam steering vector is part of the matrix solving accuracy and is removed therefrom.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Yet another advantage of the present disclosure is that each signal can be modulated and coded with a long Direct Spread Spectrum Sequence (DSSS) orthogonal code with repetition to increase the coding gain. This allows operation at lower receive power, thus reducing noise level and increasing interference immunity. In addition, the long code length of the DSSS orthogonal code enables the calibration of several beams simultaneously with good cross correlation properties. The post-detection Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) is thus improved, reducing overall calibration error.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Yet a further advantage of the present disclosure is that the calibration method is applicable to any number of array elements, any beamforming type (digital, hybrid or analog), and any number of beams.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Another advantage of the present disclosure is that the power seen in space is scattered via a coding technique that prevents exceeding the flux power density in certain directions in transmit mode and protects the calibration from interference in the receive mode.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">A further advantage of the present disclosure is that the calibration error can be reduced by removing the normal amplitude taper used in formed beams. In practical PAAs, an amplitude taper is applied to the beam coefficients of the BFN to improve beam side-lobes. This amplitude weighting causes errors in such systems and can be dealt with by the calibration systems and methods of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Yet another advantage of the present disclosure is that, to increase accuracy further, during calibration the phased array may be solely dedicated to calibration, which removes uncertainty, especially in transmitter. Multi-beam steering and temperature gradient variation in the array can increase calibration error if not addressed.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Based on the quality of the beam former network, and especially for digital beam forming, another advantage of the present disclosure is that only a one-point calibration of the BFN amplitude and phase range may be sufficient to calibrate its full amplitude and phase range. The whole Amplitude or Phase transfer function is calibrated at one point only. Usually picked at the center of the range. The two points referred below would be to increase the calibration precision when used with interpolation. This is an advantage compared to controlled circuit encoding (CCE) that takes a much longer calibration time.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Yet a further advantage of the present disclosure is that the calibration method, using the calibration data and element physical position, can evaluate the beam pointing error of the antenna/spacecraft. The two plane gradients (X and Y) of post calibration is compared to reference beam pointing at pre-calibration to resolve a beam pointing angle offset. This can complement spacecraft attitude control systems such as sky tracker or others. The Beam Pointing Error is the error of pointing of any arbitrary beam. This error is caused by various effects but most likely the spacecraft attitude error (satellite movement). The use of the BPE can be compared to the star tracker satellite positioner for coherency or fine adjustment as complement.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Another advantage of the present disclosure is that the calibration algorithm can be used to estimate the amplitude and phase of each interdependent RF array element, or, in other words, measure the aggregate coupling. This may be particularly useful during development for problem finding as well as in evaluating a performance specified by a customer. This, however, would not be used in remote calibration applications but rather in ground testing.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">According to an aspect of the present disclosure there is provided a method for calibrating a transmitter phased array antenna (PAA). The method includes: transmitting a beam steering information of all array elements of the PAA to a calibration terminal from a processor unit connected to the PAA; processing (e.g. simultaneously) a calibration and reference beam between a calibration terminal and all the array elements and the processor unit, the calibration and reference beam being modulated and coded using a Direct Spread Spectrum Sequence (DSSS); determining a phase error and an amplitude error for each one of the array elements by removing the beam steering information of all the array elements from the received calibration and reference beam and computing the received calibration and reference beams; and transmitting the phase error and amplitude error of each one of the array elements to the processor connected to the PAA to remove the phase and amplitude errors from each array element.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In one embodiment, the receiver PAA calibration is at least one of a transmit (TX) antenna and a receive (RX) antenna, and the step of processing of the method includes: (a) for a RX antenna, transmitting only the reference beam from the calibration terminal through all the array elements generating the calibration and reference beam received at the processor unit; and simultaneously creating the calibration and reference beam from the processor unit through all the array elements and to the calibration terminal; and (b) for a TX antenna, simultaneously transmitting the calibration and reference beam from the processor unit through all the array elements and to the calibration terminal.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">According to another aspect of the present disclosure there is provided a system for calibrating an active phased array antenna (PAA). The system includes: a processor unit connected to the PAA; and a remote calibration terminal linked to all array elements of the PAA for receiving a beam steering information of all the array elements of the PAA from the processor unit, the remote calibration terminal processing (e.g. simultaneously) a calibration and reference beam with all the array elements and the processor unit, the calibration and reference beams being modulated and coded using a Direct Spread Spectrum Sequence (DSSS), the remote calibration terminal determining a phase error and an amplitude error for each one of the array elements by removing the beam pointing information of all the array elements from the received calibration and reference beam, analyzing the received calibration and reference beam, and transmitting the phase and amplitude errors of each element to the processor unit to remove the phase and amplitude errors from each array element.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">The method may use a formed beam as reference signal along with the calibration signal and sent from the same phased array antenna. The beam steering information may be removed from the solution and help to decrease the calibration error. The method may use the same channel for the reference and calibration channel removing the common impairments. The method may use a Direct Spread Spectrum Sequence with high cross-correlation property to differentiate the two carriers (calibration and reference) using the same channel and capable of calibrating several beams simultaneously. The method may use a direct Least Square (LS) algorithm or equivalent optimizer (e.g. overdetermined equations, maximum likelihood) to minimize the error under noisy samples for a better convergence.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">The transmitter and receiver amplitude taper may be removed from the beam formed coefficients to achieve better calibration error performance (e.g. apply an amplitude taper reversal for the calibration beam). In the case of the transmitter, the output power may be reduced to be able to remove the &#x201c;hardware taper&#x201d; present from the staged zone power amplifiers. The Hadamard codes may be scrambled at the transmission to avoid having high peaks of power localized on earth (except for the reference beam pointed to the terminal). This helps spread the signal flux density (Equivalent Power-Flux Density (EPFD) constraints) on earth for minimal interference for other and like systems. Similarly, this may be done in the receiver to protect the algorithm from being impacted by directional high-power interference. The beam steering information on TX or RX may be known by the On-Board Processor (&#x201c;OBP&#x201d;) of the spacecraft and sent to the calibration terminal for removal to help reducing the error solution. This information (the beam steering information) may be sent just prior to formal synchronization to start the calibration. This may include all pointing error compensation by the spacecraft. The phased array antenna normal payload transmission may be interrupted while performing calibration to minimize calibration error. The antenna may be solely dedicated to the calibration function during calibration. A code repetition of the spreading code may be performed to lower the noise level at the receiver and thus increase the SNR and calibration error performance. The amplitude and phase BFN may be assumed to be monotonic and linear, and the calibration may therefore be performed at one point only reducing calibration time (the whole amplitude or phase transfer function calibrated at one point, usually picked at the center of the range); if not, two additional points may be added to better assess the transfer function. The two additional points may increase the calibration precision when used with interpolation.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">Other aspects and features will become apparent, to those ordinarily skilled in the art, upon review of the following description of some exemplary embodiments.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0118" num="0117">The drawings included herewith are for illustrating various examples of articles, methods, and apparatuses of the present specification.

In a particular case, the PAA may be located on a spacecraft (e.g. as part of a satellite communication system). The PAA may be an active PAA. Systems and methods for evaluating coupling between antenna elements (radio frequency (&#x201c;RF&#x201d;) coupling estimation) of a PAA and for beam pointing error (&#x201c;BPE&#x201d;) estimation of a PAA are also provided. A derivative of the calibration method may be used to perform the RF coupling estimation and/or to perform the BPE estimation of the PAA. The systems and methods of the present disclosure may be used for PAAs using analog beamforming and/or PAAs using digital beamforming. The calibration systems and methods described herein are compatible with timeslot implementations (beam hopping), though this is not a requirement and in some cases may be implemented in non-beam hopping implementations.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">Generally, the calibration systems and methods described herein may be used to determine amplitude and phase errors for individual array elements of a PAA. The PAA needs to control its individual array elements amplitude and phase error contributors for the following reasons: to maintain beam pattern and signal power; to keep the side lobes level under control; and to minimize the PAA loss of efficiency. The term &#x201c;array element&#x201d; as used herein refers to any component of the full RF path of the PAA and may include any one or more of a BFN RF path, an amplification stage, a filtering component, a polarizer, and the antenna (radiating) element itself.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">The present disclosure provides a system and method for calibrating a phased array antenna (&#x201c;PAA&#x201d;). The PAA may be a component of a moving spacecraft, an aircraft, or a High-Altitude Platform (&#x201c;HAP&#x201d;), or may be a component of a terrestrial system (on-ground, such as on Earth, other planets or moons). Thus, while the embodiments of the calibration systems and methods described in the present disclosure refer to satellite based PAAs, it is to be understood that such application is one example and that the calibration systems and methods described herein may be applied to PAAs in contexts other than satellite communication. The MDA proprietary processing method is insensitive to channel variations, delivers better error estimation and provides high processing gain for difficult channel conditions</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">Analog beamforming in multi-beam DRAs may take a long time to calibrate when the number of beams B and the number of array elements N are high. The number of RF beamformer adjustments to calibrate, being NxB, could be in the several thousands. Being able to calibrate the beams simultaneously is a great advantage as it is proposed herein.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">In an aspect, the present disclosure provides systems and methods for remote in-orbit calibration of a PAA onboard a spacecraft (satellite) using a ground terminal. The second calibration approach, which is the type presented herein, has the advantages to lower the cost and complexity of the PAA and satellite payload.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">There are two types of calibration that need to take place when building an active phased array antenna. A first calibration type is the calibration performed when the unit is built, to get the reference coefficients of the particular unit. Once the unit is shipped, launched and in operation, a sustaining periodical calibration is required to overcome temperature, ageing, and radiation effect on active array elements. While the presented method can be applied to the first category of calibration, the emphasis in the present disclosure is on the remote calibration of the phased array antenna. Further, while the system and method of the present disclosure can be applied equally to terrestrial or space systems, the focus of the will be on the space systems.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">In an aspect, a method of calibrating a PAA having a plurality of array elements is provided. The method includes transmitting a beam steering information of each of the plurality of array elements to a calibration terminal from a processor unit connected to the PAA. The method further includes simultaneously processing a calibration beam and a reference beam between the calibration terminal and the plurality of array elements and the processor unit, where the calibration beam and reference beam are modulated and coded using a Direct Spread Spectrum Sequence (&#x201c;DSSS&#x201d;) system. The calibration beam may be coded using a plurality of scrambled orthogonal codes (orthogonal matrix). The scrambled orthogonal codes may be Hadamard codes. The method further includes determining a phase error and amplitude error for each respective one of the plurality of array elements by removing the beam steering information of the plurality of array elements from the received calibration beam and reference beam and analyzing the received calibration beam and reference beam. The method further includes transmitting the phase error and amplitude error of each respective one of the plurality of array elements to the processor unit to remove the phase error and amplitude error from an operating signal of each respective one of the plurality of array elements.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">In another aspect, a method of calibrating a PAA having a plurality of array elements is provided. The method includes using scrambled Hadamard codes to remove radiated peak power to reduce interference issues.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">In another aspect, a method of calibrating a PAA having a plurality of array elements is provided. The method includes using a same RF channel(s) for both a reference signal and a calibration signal. Using the same RF channels for reference and calibration signals may allow for a complete removal of the varying channel.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">In another aspect, a method of calibrating a PAA having a plurality of array elements is provided. The method includes evaluating an antenna element complex coupling using a &#x3c0;/2 weight modulation and resolving with the calibration method of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">In another aspect, a method of calibrating a PAA having a plurality of array elements is provided. The method includes evaluating a beam pointing error (BPE) of the PAA using calibration results obtained using the calibration method of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">In another aspect, a system for calibrating a PAA is provided. The system includes a PAA having a plurality of array elements, a processor unit connected to the PAA, and a remote calibration terminal linked to each the plurality of array elements of the PAA, the remote calibration terminal for receiving a beam steering information of the plurality of array elements of the PAA from the processor unit. The remote calibration terminal simultaneously processes a calibration and reference beam [with all the array elements and the processor unit]. The calibration and reference beam is modulated and coded using a DSSS. The remote calibration terminal determines a phase error and an amplitude error for each of the plurality of array elements by removing the beam steering information of the plurality of array elements from the received calibration and reference beam. The remote calibration terminal analyzes the received calibration and reference beam and transmits the phase error and the amplitude error of each of the plurality of array elements to the processor unit for removal of the phase error and the amplitude error from an operating signal of the array element.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">In another aspect, a system and method for calibrating remotely a phased array antenna of a satellite or terrestrial system is provided. The amplitude and phase variations of active antennas used in PAAs are prone to vary over life, temperature, radiation, etc. and need to be corrected frequently to preserve side lobes level and antenna gain. The system utilizes a dedicated calibration terminal on ground capable of performing remote calibration of an active antenna having N radiating elements. The antenna may be a receive (Rx) antenna or a transmit (Tx) antenna. The calibration terminal may perform remote calibration of both Rx antennas and Tx antennas, which in some cases may be present on the same platform (e.g. on the same spacecraft). A particular modulation, coding and level control allows sending a reference and calibration signal using the same antenna. The use of the exact same communications channel for the calibration and reference signals removes the variations by its differential decoding. The power level of each transmitter element is coded such that the Equivalent Power-Flux Density (EPFD) on ground is controlled.

Several beams may be calibrated simultaneously, which reduces the overall calibration time.

The amplitude and phase variations of active antennas used in PAAs are prone to vary over life, temperature, radiation, etc. and need to be corrected frequently to preserve side lobes level and antenna gain. The system utilizes a dedicated calibration terminal on ground capable of performing remote calibration of receivers or transmitters active antennas with N radiating elements. A particular modulation, coding, and level control allows sending a reference and calibration signal using the same antenna. The use of the exact same communications channel removes the variations by its differential decoding. The power level of each transmitter element is coded such that the Equivalent Power-Flux Density (EPFD) on ground is controlled. Multitudes coding methods are used to increase the post detection Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and reduce the residual calibration error. Several beams can be calibrated simultaneously which reduces the overall calibration time. The method can be applied to several other applications such as remote element failure detection, inter-element coupling evaluation, spacecraft beam pointing error and antenna manufacturing testing and calibration.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0238">While the above description provides examples of one or more apparatus, methods, or systems, it will be appreciated that other apparatus, methods, or systems may be within the scope of the claims as interpreted by one of skill in the art.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00001" nb-file="US20230006754A1-20230105-M00001.NB"><img id="EMI-M00001" he="13.04mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230006754A1-20230105-M00001.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00002" nb-file="US20230006754A1-20230105-M00002.NB"><img id="EMI-M00002" he="5.25mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230006754A1-20230105-M00002.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00003" nb-file="US20230006754A1-20230105-M00003.NB"><img id="EMI-M00003" he="3.56mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230006754A1-20230105-M00003.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
