For example, an application on a first computing system may require data from a storage server located on a second computing system. To provide the communication, the data payload may be placed in a network packet and transferred to the required computing system. However, although network packets provide a method of communication between computing systems, difficulties often arise in maintaining security and configuration information to support the communications.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To overcome some of the deficiencies presented in securing network communications, various technologies have been developed. These technologies include virtual local area networks (VLANs), encryption for the data payload within the data packets, amongst other similar security procedures. Yet, while these security technologies may provide additional security over unprotected network packets, configuring individual networks can be difficult and cumbersome. These difficulties are compounded when a network includes different types of computing systems with different firewall and other security measures.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The technology described herein manages a private network over multiple local networks.

In some implementations, organizations may require computing elements across multiple local networks to exchange data, including images, video, spreadsheets, or other some other data or data structure. For example, an organization may deploy a server in a first local network, such as a local network at the headquarters for the organization, while other user computing systems may request and obtain data from the server to provide various operations.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Here, to manage the connectivity between computing elements on different local networks and to establish a private network between the computing elements, a coordination service is provided that maintains permissions for computing elements to join and communicate in a private network. In one implementation, a computing element may generate a request to the coordination service to join a private network. This request may include information about the user of the computing element, information about the computing element itself (hardware, operating system, and other similar information), or some other information about the computing element or user thereof. In response to the request, the coordination service may identify communication information associated with the request and provide the communication information to the requesting computing element. The communication information may include addressing information for one or more other computing elements in the private network, encryption information for the one or more other computing elements, permissions or permitted communications between the computing elements, or some other information associated with the communication between computing elements in the private network. In some examples, the communication information may be determined based on rules, wherein the rules may define users or user types that are permitted to communicate, device types that are permitted to communicate, or some information.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">As an example, a computing element may generate a request to join a private network with other computing elements distributed across multiple local networks. In the request, the computing element may provide credential information about the user, device information, or some other information. In response to the request, the coordination service may determine communication information for other computing elements based on rules identified for the joining computing element. When the request is received, the coordination service may identify rules associated with the newly connecting device and determine communication information for other computing elements based on the rules. The communication information may include IP addressing information, media access control (MAC) addressing information, port information, encryption information, or some other information. Once the information is identified, the communication information may be provided to the joining computing element. In some examples, the communication information may include a unique IP address that is allocated to each reachable computing element in the private network.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some implementations, the requesting computing element may operate on a local network that permits computing elements to identify and communicate with other computing elements on the same local network. For example, a home network may permit computers and other devices to identify and exchange data between computers on the same network. As a result, in addition to advertising itself in the local home network, a computing element that joins the private network via the coordination service may further advertise computing elements on other local networks outside of the home network. To communicate with the computing elements on other networks, the local computing elements may communicate packets to one or more specific ports on the registered computing element on the private network, the registered computing element may encapsulate the packets, update addressing in the packets for the private network, and may forward the encapsulated packet over the internet toward the destination computing element. In some examples, in advertising the other computing elements, the computing element may use zero-configuration networking, which can provide computing element identifier information, IP addressing information, port information, and other information about the computing element in a local network.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some implementations, the registered computing element may advertise multiple IP addresses, wherein each of the IP addresses correspond to a different computing element. For example, a first IP address may correspond to the registered computing element, while one or more additional IP addresses correspond to one or more computing elements on other local computing networks. When a packet is received by the registered computing element using a destination IP address that corresponds to a computing element in another network, the registered computing element may update addressing in the packet (e.g., replace the local IP address with a unique address allocated by the coordination service), encapsulate the packet, and forward the packet toward the destination computing element.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some examples, when a computing element is registered with the coordination service, the computing element may provide information about other computing elements on the local network. Advantageously, although the other computing elements may not register directly with the private network using the coordination service, the other computing elements may communicate in the private network via the registered computing element. For example, in a home network, a desktop computer may be registered to a private network using the coordination service and permit one or more other devices on the network to communicate with the private network without directly registering with the private network. Communication information about the one or more other devices may also be provided to other registered computing elements on other local networks. In addition to providing communication information about the registering computing element to the coordination service, the registering computing element may further provide information about other computing elements on the network (identifier, available ports, etc.). This may permit the computing elements on other local networks to advertise these computing elements in their own local network.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a computing environment <b>100</b> to manage a private network across multiple local networks according to an implementation. Computing environment <b>100</b> includes coordination service <b>120</b> and local networks <b>140</b>-<b>142</b>, which are coupled via internet <b>160</b>. Coordination service <b>120</b> further includes data store <b>126</b>, access control lists (ACL) store <b>128</b>, and provides operation <b>300</b> that is further described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Local networks <b>140</b>-<b>142</b> further includes private computing elements <b>110</b>-<b>112</b>, and computing elements <b>150</b>-<b>154</b>. Private computing elements maintain information <b>130</b>-<b>132</b> that corresponds to communication information obtained from the coordination service, and private computing element <b>110</b> provides operation <b>200</b> that is further described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Private computing elements <b>110</b>-<b>112</b> and computing elements <b>150</b>-<b>154</b> may comprise desktop computers, laptop computers, smartphones, tablets, routers or other gateways, virtual machines, containers, or some other computing element.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In deploying a private network, coordination service <b>120</b> may be used to maintain and distribute communication rules for computing elements to join the private network. Data store <b>126</b> may be used to maintain information about the computing elements in the network, while ACL store <b>128</b> may maintain rules for what computing elements can join a private network and what communications are permitted between the computing elements of a private network. Here, private computing elements <b>110</b>-<b>112</b> may represent computing elements that are joining the same private network. To join the network a computing element, such as private computing element <b>110</b> may provide a request to coordination service <b>120</b> to join the private network. In response to the request, coordination service <b>120</b> may determine permissions for the private computing element and provide communication information associated with the permissions to private computing element <b>110</b>. The communication information may include addressing information associated with other computing elements in the private computing network, encryption information associated with other computing elements in the private computing network, or some other information associated with the addressing information. The communication information corresponds to other computing elements for which the registering computing element can communicate. For example, when private computing element <b>110</b> registers with coordination service <b>120</b>, the rules may permit private computing element <b>110</b> to communicate with private computing element <b>110</b>, but not communicate with private computing element <b>112</b>. Accordingly, communication information may be provided to private computing element <b>110</b> that includes addressing and other information for private computing element <b>111</b>, while no information is provided about private computing element <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Here, in addition to the registering computing element, other computing elements on a local network may be permitted to communicate using the communication information from the coordination service. When private computing element <b>110</b> registers with coordination service <b>120</b>, private computing element <b>110</b> may be provided with communication information to communicate with resources on private computing element <b>111</b>. Additionally, the communication information may permit, private computing element <b>110</b> to communicate with computing elements <b>152</b>-<b>153</b> through private computing element <b>111</b>. In communicating with computing elements <b>152</b>-<b>153</b>, private computing elements <b>110</b> may use addressing unique to a computing element of computing elements <b>152</b>-<b>153</b> to communicate with the computing elements. For example, private computing element <b>110</b> may generate a packet that uses a unique private IP address allocated to computing element <b>152</b> by coordination service <b>120</b> as the destination. Once generated, private computing element <b>110</b> may encapsulate the packet using public addressing information for private computing element <b>111</b> over internet <b>160</b> and forward the packet to the private computing element <b>111</b>. In response to receiving the packet, private computing element <b>111</b> may decapsulate the packet and forward the packet to computing element <b>152</b>. In some implementations, private computing element <b>111</b> may modify the addressing of the packet to provide the packet to computing element <b>152</b> on the local network. This modification may include modifying the IP address of the packet, the port of the packet, or some other information associated with the packet.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Like communicating with computing elements <b>152</b>-<b>153</b> on other networks, private computing element <b>110</b> may permit computing elements <b>150</b>-<b>151</b> to send and receive data from other computing elements on the computing network. In some implementations, the communication information provided by coordination service <b>120</b> may permit private computing element <b>110</b> to advertise other computing elements in the private network to computing elements <b>150</b>-<b>151</b> as though the computing elements are in local network <b>140</b>. For example, private computing element <b>111</b> may provide communication information about computing elements <b>152</b>-<b>153</b> to coordination service <b>120</b>. The communication information may then be provided to private computing element <b>110</b>, wherein the communication information may permit private computing element <b>110</b> to advertise computing elements <b>152</b>-<b>153</b> as though the computing elements are in the local network. In some implementations, private computing element <b>110</b> may advertise port numbers to communicate with computing elements <b>152</b>-<b>152</b> using private computing element <b>110</b>, device information about the computing elements, or some other information about the computing elements. If a communication is received at private computing element <b>110</b> at a port advertised, private computing element <b>110</b> may modify addressing in the packet to support the private network (e.g., use unique IP addresses allocated to the computing elements, including computing elements <b>150</b>-<b>153</b>), may encapsulate the packet to be communicated over internet <b>160</b>, or may provide some other operation. Once encapsulated, the packet may be communicated from private computing element <b>110</b> to private computing element <b>111</b>, wherein private computing element <b>111</b> may decapsulate the packet, modify addressing parameters (e.g., IP addresses, MAC addresses, etc.) to support the local network, and forward the packet to the destination computing element.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some implementations, when advertising the computing elements in the network, a private computing element may obtain multiple local IP addresses from the router or other allocation service. For example, rather than advertising a single IP address for private computing element <b>110</b>, private computing element <b>110</b> may advertise additional local IP addresses for other computing elements in local networks <b>141</b>-<b>142</b>. Thus, rather than appearing as a single computing element, private computing element may appear as multiple computing elements on the local network. When a communication is required, such as from computing element <b>150</b> to computing element <b>152</b>, computing element <b>150</b> may use a local IP address advertised by private computing element <b>110</b> for computing element <b>152</b>. Once received by private computing element <b>110</b>, private computing element <b>110</b> may translate the local IP address to an IP address allocated by coordination service <b>120</b> for use in the private network. For example, a local address may comprise 192.0.1.8, while the address allocated by coordination service <b>120</b> may comprise 76.3.4.5. Once translated, the packet communication can be encapsulated, and public addressing may be used to communicate the packet over internet <b>160</b> to private computing element <b>111</b>. Once received by private computing element <b>111</b>, the packet can be decapsulated using the encryption information provided by coordination service <b>110</b>. Private computing element <b>110</b> may identify the private network IP address allocated by coordination service <b>120</b> to computing element <b>152</b> and may translate the private network IP address to a local network IP address for computing element <b>152</b> in local network <b>141</b>. Once translated, the packet may be communicated to computing element <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an operation <b>200</b> of a computing element to join a private network according to an implementation. The steps of operation <b>200</b> are referenced parenthetically in the paragraphs that follow with reference to systems and elements of computing environment <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As depicted, operation <b>200</b> includes (201) obtaining credentials associated with the computing element and (<b>202</b>) communicating the credentials to a coordination service. Once communicated, the operation further obtains (<b>203</b>) communication information associated with one or more other computing elements in the private network, wherein the communication information permits the computing element to communicate with the one or more other computing elements. The communication information may include addressing information, encryption information, or some other type of information permitting the communication with other computing elements in the private computing network. In some examples, such as that in computing environment <b>100</b>, computing elements in the private network may be located on multiple local networks. For example, a first local network may comprise a home local network, while a second computing network may comprise a work network or second home network.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">After receiving the communication information, operation <b>200</b> advertises (<b>204</b>) the one or more computing elements from the other local networks to the local computing elements as though the one or more other computing elements are on the local network. For example, when private computing element <b>110</b> joins a private network, coordination service <b>120</b> may provide communication information to private computing element <b>110</b> that permits communication with computing elements registered to the network (private computing elements <b>111</b>-<b>112</b>) and computing elements permitted to communicate over the registered computing elements. Here, while computing elements <b>152</b>-<b>153</b> are permitted to communicate using private computing element <b>111</b>, computing element <b>154</b> is not permitted to communicate using private computing element <b>154</b>. This may mean that computing element <b>154</b> does not receive the advertisement of other computing elements, that computing element <b>154</b> is not advertised to other computing elements of the private network.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">When a communication is desired by computing element <b>150</b> to computing element <b>152</b>, the communication may be directed to private computing element <b>110</b> using the local private IP address for private computing element <b>110</b> and a port advertised in association with computing element <b>152</b>. In response to receiving the communication, private computing element <b>110</b> may update addressing in the communication, including IP addresses and ports, wherein the IP addresses may comprise addresses allocated by coordination service <b>120</b> to each device available in the private network. For example, computing element <b>150</b> may be allocated a first unique address for the private network, while computing element <b>152</b> may be allocated a second unique address for the private network. Once the addressing is updated, private computing element <b>110</b> may encapsulate the communication to be communicated over internet <b>160</b> to private computing element <b>111</b>. After receiving the encapsulated communication, private computing element <b>111</b> may decapsulate the communication, update addressing in the packet in association with the local network and forward the communication to computing element <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">While demonstrated in the previous example as communicating between two computing elements that have not directly registered with the coordination service, similar operations may be implemented when a registered private computing element communicates a packet over the internet. For example, a communication from private computing element <b>110</b> may use addressing associated with the private network (e.g., unique IP addresses allocated by coordination service <b>120</b>) to communicate over internet <b>160</b>. The communication may be encapsulated using encryption information from coordination service <b>160</b> and public addressing information from coordination service <b>120</b> to forward the communication over the internet to a registered computing element in the private network.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some implementations, in advertising computing elements from the other local network, private computing element <b>110</b> may request and receive multiple local IP addresses, such that private computing element <b>110</b> may appear as multiple computing elements.

Once the communication is received by private computing element <b>110</b>, private computing element <b>110</b> may translate the local IP address to a private network IP address allocated by coordination service <b>120</b> to private computing element <b>111</b>.

The credentials may comprise username and password information, a token associated with the user, device information, or some other credentials associated with the computing element. Once the credentials are identified, operation <b>300</b> may identify (<b>303</b>) communication rules associated with the computing element based on the credentials and identify (<b>304</b>) communication information associated with other computing elements based on the communication rules. In some examples, the communication rules may be used to associate credentials of the user with other computing elements available to the user. In some implementations, a user type (associated with the user, e.g., attorney, parent, etc.) and/or device type for registering computing element may be used to identify other user types and/or device types available for communication with the registering computing element. The rules may further limit the types of communications that are permitted, the services that are available on each of the computing elements, or some other limitation. Once the rules are identified, communication information for computing elements that satisfy the criteria of the rules may be identified. Operation <b>300</b> may then (<b>305</b>) communicate the communication information to the computing element, wherein the communication information may include addressing information (IP addresses, ports, etc.), encryption information, or some other information to permit the registering computing element to communicate with other computing elements.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some implementations, when a computing element, such as private computing element <b>110</b>, registers with coordination service <b>120</b>, the computing element may provide addressing and encryption information to permit other computing elements to communicate with the registering computing element. In some examples, the registering computing element may further provide information about other computing elements available via the local network, wherein the registering computing element may communicate with the other elements on the local network. For example, private computing element <b>110</b> may provide addressing and encryption information for itself and may further provide device information associated with computing elements <b>150</b>-<b>151</b> to coordination service <b>120</b>. This information may include device type, a device identifier, or some other information, wherein the information may be used to determine whether the computing element can communicate in the private network. When the information is provided, coordination service <b>120</b> may allocate unique addresses to the various computing elements that are permitted to communicate over the network.

Storage system <b>745</b> may include volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information, such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data. Storage system <b>745</b> may be implemented as a single storage device but may also be implemented across multiple storage devices or sub-systems. Storage system <b>745</b> may comprise additional elements, such as a controller to read operating software from the storage systems. Examples of storage media include random access memory, read only memory, magnetic disks, optical disks, and flash memory, as well as any combination or variation thereof, or any other type of storage media. In some implementations, the storage media may be a non-transitory storage media. In some instances, at least a portion of the storage media may be transitory. In no case is the storage media a propagated signal.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Processing system <b>750</b> is typically mounted on a circuit board that may also hold the storage system. The operating software of storage system <b>745</b> comprises computer programs, firmware, or some other form of machine-readable program instructions. The operating software of storage system <b>745</b> comprises coordination service <b>730</b> capable of providing at least operation <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The operating software on storage system <b>745</b> may further include an operating system, utilities, drivers, network interfaces, applications, or some other type of software. When read and executed by processing system <b>750</b>, the operating software on storage system <b>745</b> directs computing system <b>700</b> to operate as described herein.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In at least one implementation, coordination service <b>730</b> directs processing system <b>750</b> to obtain a request from a computing element to join a private network, wherein the private network is managed via the coordination service. In response to the request, coordination service <b>730</b> directs processing system <b>750</b> to identify communication rules associated with the registering computing element and determine communication information for one or more other computing elements based on the communication rules. In some examples, coordination service <b>730</b> may maintain ACLs or a rule list that indicates what user identifiers or types, device types, and other user or device related information are permitted to communicate and the types of communications that are permitted. From the identified rules, computing system <b>700</b> may determine one or more other computing elements that correspond to the rules and communication information for the one or more other computing elements. The rules and communication information may be stored in data store <b>735</b>. As an example, a rule may permit a first user type to communicate with a second user type. Accordingly, if a computing element with a first user type registers with the coordination service, the coordination service may identify communication information associated with computing elements with the second user type. Once the communication information is identified, the communication information may be distributed to the registering computing element. Additionally, communication information may also be provided to the one or more other computing elements, permitting the one or more other computing elements to communicate with the newly registering computing element.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some implementations, the communication information maintained may comprise information for computing elements that actively register and execute a service or application that implements the private networking operations (encapsulation, network address translation, encryption, and the like). The communication information may also include information for one or more computing elements that use a registered computing element to communicate with computing elements on other local networks. For example, a desktop computing system may register with the coordination service and permit one or more other devices on the local network to communicate over the private network. The communication information for the one or more other devices on the local network may include a device identifier, ports available for the one or more other devices, a unique IP address allocated by the coordination service for use in the private network (allocated to available devices for the network), or some other information. A computing element on a separate local network may advertise the desktop computing system (using a device identifier and port) and may also advertise the one or more other devices that communicate via the desktop computing system. In advertising the devices, the computing element may advertise ports that are available to communicate with the devices on the other network and may impersonate the devices to make them appear as though they are on the local network.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The included descriptions and figures depict specific implementations to teach those skilled in the art how to make and use the best mode.
