One consideration when using such large monitors is the placement of a webcam for use in video collaboration applications, in order to enable a natural user experience. A webcam being placed on top of a tall monitor captures the top of a user's head, a placement under the monitor results in poor views of the user. Also, eye contact might not be possible with these current placements of the web cam. Additionally, monitors that rotate to support both landscape and portrait display modes might not have good camera placement for optimal eye contact when collaborating over video.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some implementations, software is used to redraw the user's eyes to simulate eye contact, which may look unnatural and which might not help with the suboptimal camera perspective.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some examples of apparatuses and/or methods will be described in the following by way of example only, and with reference to the accompanying figures, in which</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>show schematic diagrams of examples of a camera device;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>c </i></figref>shows a flow chart of an example of a method for a camera device;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a </i></figref>shows a schematic diagram of an example of a base unit for a camera device;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b </i></figref>shows a flow chart of an example of a method for a base unit for a camera device;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i></figref>show a schematic diagrams of examples of computation devices;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>c </i></figref>shows a flow chart of a method for a computation device;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a </i></figref>illustrates a wireless camera unit being placed in a base unit under the monitor for charging;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b </i></figref>illustrates a wireless camera unit being placed on the display in any location by the end user;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>c </i></figref>illustrates a base triangulating a location of the camera, and launching and aligning a video chat application;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>c </i></figref>show schematic drawings of viewing angles provided from different camera angles;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a schematic illustration of two software layers being used for an alignment app and for a video collaboration app;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>a </i></figref>shows a schematic diagram of a wireless camera unit being used on a monitor in landscape orientation;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>b </i></figref>shows a schematic diagram of a wireless camera unit being used on a monitor in portrait orientation;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>a </i></figref>shows a schematic diagram of a base being attached to a monitor;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>b </i></figref>shows a schematic diagram of a camera being docked into the base with the lens pointing downward for privacy concerns;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>c </i></figref>shows a schematic diagram of a camera being docked into the base with the lens facing towards the user;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b><i>a </i>to <b>9</b><i>c </i></figref>show a schematic diagram of a setup process for a wireless camera unit; and</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b><i>a </i>to <b>10</b><i>c </i></figref>show schematic diagrams of computation devices.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Some examples are now described in more detail with reference to the enclosed figures.

In the following, the camera device is introduced with reference to certain structural components that may be used to implement the camera device. The camera device may, on the other hand, also be implemented using other components. Therefore, the camera device is not only introduced in terms of structural components, but also in terms of functional component means, which may be implemented by the respective structural components of the camera device. Therefore, the respective component means are introduced in parentheses. The camera device comprises a magnetic attachment mechanism (or magnetic attachment means) <b>11</b> for attaching the camera device to a display surface <b>105</b> of a monitor <b>100</b>. The camera device comprises a camera sensor (or means for generating image data) <b>12</b> for generating image data. The camera device comprises wireless communication circuitry (or means for communicating wirelessly) <b>13</b> for providing the image data wirelessly to a computation device.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>c </i></figref>shows a flow chart of an example of a corresponding method for a camera device. The method is performed by the camera device. The method comprises providing <b>110</b> a magnetic attachment mechanism for attaching the camera device to a display surface of a monitor. The method comprises generating <b>120</b> image data using a camera sensor of the camera device. The method comprises providing <b>130</b> the image data wirelessly to a computation device.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The following description relates to both the camera device and to the corresponding method for the camera device.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Various examples of the present disclosure relate to a camera device, and to a corresponding method and computer program (where applicable). Various examples of the present disclosure are based on the insight that large monitors having diagonals of <b>27</b> inches and more and/or monitors that support a portrait orientation are being used for working in the workplace or from home. At the same time, video conferencing is being widely used, e.g. in work-from-home scenarios. With large monitors, a placement of a camera to use for video conferencing may become harder, as placing a camera on top of the monitor may result in a view from the top, which might not allow for direct eye contact, and placing a camera below the monitor may result in an unfavorable &#x201c;nostril view&#x201d; from below. Various examples of the present disclosure provide a camera device that is suitable for providing direct eye contact in a video conferencing setting even with large monitors, by making the camera device attachable to the monitor. The camera may comprise silicone feet for avoiding scratches. For example, the camera device may be a wireless webcam, which may be used for video conferencing applications, and placed at an ergonomic height on a display surface of the monitor.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The camera device <b>10</b> comprises the magnetic attachment mechanism <b>11</b> for attaching the camera device to a display surface <b>105</b> of a monitor <b>100</b>. In general, many desktop monitors comprise a steel backplate that provides rigidity to the monitor. For example, the monitor <b>100</b> may a desktop monitor. A camera device that comprises a magnetic attachment mechanism (with strong magnets) can be placed on the display surface, and the magnetic force may suffice for keeping the camera device in place on the display surface of the monitor. Consequently, the magnetic attachment mechanism <b>11</b> may comprise one or more magnets, e.g. permanent magnets, that are suitable for holding the camera device in place when the camera device is attached to the display surface via the magnetic attachment mechanism. For example, the magnetic attachment mechanism may be suitable for, or configured to, providing/provide a non-permanent (i.e. removable) attachment of the camera device to the display surface of the monitor (through a magnetic force being applied between the magnetic attachment mechanism and a steel backplate of the monitor). For example, the display surface of the monitor may be a portion of a surface of the monitor that a video signal being displayed by the monitor is shown on. In other words, the display surface of the monitor may exclude the frame or bezel of the monitor.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The camera device <b>10</b> comprises a camera sensor <b>12</b> for generating image data. For example, the camera sensor may be or comprise a world-facing camera sensor. For example, the camera sensor may be suitable for, or configured to, providing/provide image data for use in a video (collaboration) application. In some examples, as shown in the following, the camera device <b>10</b> may comprise a further camera sensor (also denoted <b>12</b>, as it may be co-located with the camera sensor) that faces the display surface, i.e. a display-facing camera sensor.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The camera device comprises the wireless communication circuitry <b>13</b> that is suitable for, or configured to, providing/provide the image data wirelessly to the computation device. In general, the components of the camera device may be controlled by control circuitry <b>15</b> of the camera device. In other words, the camera device may comprise control circuitry (or means for controlling) <b>15</b>. The control circuitry may be configured to control the components of the camera device, e.g. the camera sensor, the (optional) further camera sensor, the wireless communication device, a charging mechanism <b>18</b> and/or an ultrasound emitter <b>14</b>. For example, the control circuitry may be configured to provide the image data wirelessly to the computation device via the wireless communication circuitry. In some examples, the image data is provided directly to the computation device. In other words, the control circuitry may be configured to provide the image data, using the wireless communication circuitry, directly to the computation device, e.g. without involving a base unit of the camera device. Alternatively, a base unit for the communication device, e.g. a base unit as introduced in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a </i></figref>and/or <b>2</b><i>b, </i>may be involved. In other words, the control circuitry <b>15</b> may be configured to provide the image data to the computation device via a base unit of the camera device, e.g. by wirelessly providing the image data to the base unit, which may relay the image data to the computation device (e.g. wirelessly or using a wireline connection).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Apart from relaying the image data, the base unit may provide a home or dock for the camera device. For example, the camera device may be charged when the camera device is put into or onto the base unit. For example, the camera device may comprise a battery <b>17</b> (e.g. a lithium-ion battery or any suitable kind of battery) and a charging mechanism (or means for charging) <b>18</b> for charging <b>160</b> the camera device when the camera device is placed on a corresponding base unit <b>20</b>. For example, the charging mechanism may comprise a wireless charging pad (for inductive charging) or contact pins for establishing an electrical connection with the base unit. Additionally, the charging mechanism may optionally comprise charging control circuitry for controlling the charging of the battery.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In many examples, the base unit is used to hold the camera device while the camera device is not in use, e.g. to recharge the camera, and to remove the camera device from the display surface so non-videoconferencing apps can use the entire display surface. Consequently, the base unit may comprise a mechanism for holding, i.e. retaining, the camera device when the camera device is put on (or in) the base unit. In the following, the term &#x201c;on&#x201d; is used, even when the camera device is inserted into a mechanism of the base unit. For example, the magnetic attachment mechanism may be used, in connection with one or more metal portions of the base unit, to retain the camera device.
