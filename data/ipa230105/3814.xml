In some embodiments, the medical system may include an imaging system. The imaging system may include a single modality imaging system and/or a multi-modality imaging system. The single modality imaging system may include, for example, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system. Exemplary MRI systems may include a superconducting magnetic resonance imaging system, a non-superconducting magnetic resonance imaging system, etc. The multi-modality imaging system may include, for example, a computed tomography-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI-CT) system, a positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging (PET-MRI) system, a single photon emission computed tomography-magnetic resonance imaging (SPECT-MRI) system, a digital subtraction angiography-magnetic resonance imaging (DSA-MRI) system, etc. In some embodiments, the medical system may include a treatment system.

The superconducting magnet may include a container, at least one first chamber, at least one second chamber, and magnet coils including at least one group of inner coils and at least one group of outer coils. The at least one first chamber, the at least one second chamber, the at least one group of inner coils, and the at least one group of outer coils may be disposed within the container. The at least one first chamber may house the at least one group of inner coils. The at least one second chamber may house the at least one group of outer coils. The at least one first chamber and the at least one second chamber may be in fluid communication. A cooling chamber may be formed based on the at least one first chamber and the at least one second chamber. The cooling chamber may be filled with a cooling medium configured to cool the magnet coils to and/or maintain them at a superconducting state. The size and shape of the cooling chamber may be set according to actual needs, thereby reducing the consumption of the cooling medium.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Another aspect of the present disclosure relates to a superconducting magnet system. The superconducting magnet system may include magnet coils, a support structure, a shell structure, a thermal conduction structure, and a refrigeration device. At least one chamber may be formed based on the support structure and the shell structure. The at least one chamber may be configured to be filled with a cooling medium configured to cool the magnet coils to and/or maintain them at a superconducting state.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Due to its fluidity, a liquid cooling medium may be evenly distributed in the at least one chamber. When the liquid cooling medium is cooled, the cooling medium may transform to a solid status. The solidified cooling medium may evenly cover the surface of the magnet coils, thereby forming a good thermal contact between the cooling medium and the magnet coils to facilitate heat transfer between the cooling medium and the magnet coils. Therefore, the cooling medium may alleviate uneven or localized heating of the magnet coils, thereby in turn reducing the risk of quenching of superconductivity of the magnet coils.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Yet another aspect of the present disclosure relates to a cooling structure configured to be applied in an MRI system to cool magnet coils of the MRI system to a superconducting state. The cooling structure may include a cooling body, an end cover, and a plurality of pipes. When the cooling structure is applied in an MRI system to cool magnet coils of the MRI system, the cooling body may be in thermal contact with the magnet coils. A cooling medium may enter the cooling body through at least one of plurality of pipes disposed on the end cover. The cooling medium may flow in the cooling body to cool the magnet coils through heat transfer. Using the cooling structure filled with the cooling medium to cool the magnet coils may effectively solve the problem of large consumption of liquid helium caused by immerging the magnet coils in liquid helium, without compromising the cooling of the magnet coils, thereby greatly reducing the consumption of the cooling medium, reducing costs, reducing waste of the cooling medium, which in turn may simplify the manufacturing, transportation, and/or maintenance of the MRI system.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an exemplary MRI system <b>100</b> according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The MRI system <b>100</b> may be configured to scan an object (e.g., an object <b>105</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) located within its detection region and generate a plurality of imaging data relating to the object.
