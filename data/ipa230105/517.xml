Ultrasonic surgical devices, such as ultrasonic scalpels, are finding increasingly widespread applications in surgical procedures by virtue of their unique performance characteristics. Depending upon specific device configurations and operational parameters, ultrasonic surgical devices can provide substantially simultaneous transection of tissue and homeostasis by coagulation, desirably minimizing patient trauma. An ultrasonic surgical device may comprise a handpiece containing an ultrasonic transducer, and an instrument coupled to the ultrasonic transducer having a distally-mounted end effector (e.g., a blade tip) to cut and seal tissue. In some cases, the instrument may be permanently affixed to the handpiece. In other cases, the instrument may be detachable from the handpiece, as in the case of a disposable instrument or an interchangeable instrument. The end effector transmits ultrasonic energy to tissue brought into contact with the end effector to realize cutting and sealing action. Ultrasonic surgical devices of this nature can be configured for open surgical use, laparoscopic, or endoscopic surgical procedures including robotic-assisted procedures.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0003">Ultrasonic energy cuts and coagulates tissue using temperatures lower than those used in electrosurgical procedures and can be transmitted to the end effector by an ultrasonic generator in communication with the handpiece. Vibrating at high frequencies (e.g., 55,500 cycles per second), the ultrasonic blade denatures protein in the tissue to form a sticky coagulum. Pressure exerted on tissue by the blade surface collapses blood vessels and allows the coagulum to form a hemostatic seal. A surgeon can control the cutting speed and coagulation by the force applied to the tissue by the end effector, the time over which the force is applied, and the selected excursion level of the end effector.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0004">The ultrasonic transducer may be modeled as an equivalent circuit comprising a first branch having a static capacitance and a second &#x201c;motional&#x201d; branch having a serially connected inductance, resistance and capacitance that define the electromechanical properties of a resonator. Known ultrasonic generators may include a tuning inductor for tuning out the static capacitance at a resonant frequency so that substantially all of a generator's drive signal current flows into the motional branch. Accordingly, by using a tuning inductor, the generator's drive signal current represents the motional branch current, and the generator is thus able to control its drive signal to maintain the ultrasonic transducer's resonant frequency. The tuning inductor may also transform the phase impedance plot of the ultrasonic transducer to improve the generator's frequency lock capabilities. However, the tuning inductor must be matched with the specific static capacitance of an ultrasonic transducer at the operational resonant frequency. In other words, a different ultrasonic transducer having a different static capacitance requires a different tuning inductor.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0005">Additionally, in some ultrasonic generator architectures, the generator's drive signal exhibits asymmetrical harmonic distortion that complicates impedance magnitude and phase measurements. For example, the accuracy of impedance phase measurements may be reduced due to harmonic distortion in the current and voltage signals.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0006">Moreover, electromagnetic interference in noisy environments decreases the ability of the generator to maintain lock on the ultrasonic transducer's resonant frequency, increasing the likelihood of invalid control algorithm inputs.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0007">Electrosurgical devices for applying electrical energy to tissue in order to treat and/or destroy the tissue are also finding increasingly widespread applications in surgical procedures. An electrosurgical device may comprise a handpiece and an instrument having a distally-mounted end effector (e.g., one or more electrodes). The end effector can be positioned against the tissue such that electrical current is introduced into the tissue. Electrosurgical devices can be configured for bipolar or monopolar operation. During bipolar operation, current is introduced into and returned from the tissue by active and return electrodes, respectively, of the end effector. During monopolar operation, current is introduced into the tissue by an active electrode of the end effector and returned through a return electrode (e.g., a grounding pad) separately located on a patient's body. Heat generated by the current flowing through the tissue may form hemostatic seals within the tissue and/or between tissues and thus may be particularly useful for sealing blood vessels, for example. The end effector of an electrosurgical device may also comprise a cutting member that is movable relative to the tissue and the electrodes to transect the tissue.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0008">Electrical energy applied by an electrosurgical device can be transmitted to the instrument by a generator in communication with the handpiece. The electrical energy may be in the form of radio frequency (RF) energy. RF energy is a form of electrical energy that may be in the frequency range of 300 kHz to 1 MHz, as described in EN60601-2-2:2009+A11:2011, Definition 201.3.218&#x2014;HIGH FREQUENCY. For example, the frequencies in monopolar RF applications are typically restricted to less than 5 MHz. However, in bipolar RF applications, the frequency can be almost any value. Frequencies above 200 kHz are typically used for monopolar applications in order to avoid the unwanted stimulation of nerves and muscles which would result from the use of low frequency current. Lower frequencies may be used for bipolar techniques if a risk analysis shows the possibility of neuromuscular stimulation has been mitigated to an acceptable level. Normally, frequencies above 5 MHz are not used in order to minimize the problems associated with high frequency leakage currents. It is generally recognized that 10 mA is the lower threshold of thermal effects on tissue.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0009">During its operation, an electrosurgical device can transmit low frequency RF energy through tissue, which causes ionic agitation, or friction, in effect resistive heating, thereby increasing the temperature of the tissue. Because a sharp boundary may be created between the affected tissue and the surrounding tissue, surgeons can operate with a high level of precision and control, without sacrificing un-targeted adjacent tissue. The low operating temperatures of RF energy may be useful for removing, shrinking, or sculpting soft tissue while simultaneously sealing blood vessels. RF energy may work particularly well on connective tissue, which is primarily comprised of collagen and shrinks when contacted by heat.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0010">Due to their unique drive signal, sensing and feedback needs, ultrasonic and electrosurgical devices have generally required different generators. Additionally, in cases where the instrument is disposable or interchangeable with a handpiece, ultrasonic and electrosurgical generators are limited in their ability to recognize the particular instrument configuration being used and to optimize control and diagnostic processes accordingly. Moreover, capacitive coupling between the non-isolated and patient-isolated circuits of the generator, especially in cases where higher voltages and frequencies are used, may result in exposure of a patient to unacceptable levels of leakage current.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0011">Furthermore, due to their unique drive signal, sensing and feedback needs, ultrasonic and electrosurgical devices have generally required different user interfaces for the different generators. In such conventional ultrasonic and electrosurgical devices, one user interface is configured for use with an ultrasonic instrument whereas a different user interface may be configured for use with an electrosurgical instrument. Such user interfaces include hand and/or foot activated user interfaces such as hand activated switches and/or foot activated switches. As various aspects of combined generators for use with both ultrasonic and electrosurgical instruments are contemplated in the subsequent disclosure, additional user interfaces that are configured to operate with both ultrasonic and/or electrosurgical instrument generators also are contemplated.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0012">Additional user interfaces for providing feedback, whether to the user or other machine, are contemplated within the subsequent disclosure to provide feedback indicating an operating mode or status of either an ultrasonic and/or electrosurgical instrument. Providing user and/or machine feedback for operating a combination ultrasonic and/or electrosurgical instrument will require providing sensory feedback to a user and electrical/mechanical/electro-mechanical feedback to a machine. Feedback devices that incorporate visual feedback devices (e.g., an LCD display screen, LED indicators), audio feedback devices (e.g., a speaker, a buzzer) or tactile feedback devices (e.g., haptic actuators) for use in combined ultrasonic and/or electrosurgical instruments are contemplated in the subsequent disclosure.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0013">Other electrical surgical instruments include, without limitation, irreversible and/or reversible electroporation, and/or microwave technologies, among others. Accordingly, the techniques disclosed herein are applicable to ultrasonic, bipolar or monopolar RF (electrosurgical), irreversible and/or reversible electroporation, and/or microwave based surgical instruments, among others.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0014">In one general aspect, a method of of estimating a state of an end effector of an ultrasonic device is provided.

In one aspect, the parameters of the ultrasonic device may be adjusted based on the location of the tissue within the jaws of the ultrasonic end effector, for example, the location of the tissue between the clamp arm and the ultrasonic blade. The impedance of the ultrasonic transducer may be employed to differentiate what percentage of the tissue is located in the distal or proximal end of the end effector. The reactions of the ultrasonic device may be based on the tissue type or compressibility of the tissue. In another aspect, the parameters of the ultrasonic device may be adjusted based on the identified tissue type or parameterization. For example, the mechanical displacement amplitude of the distal tip of the ultrasonic blade may be tuned based on the ratio of collagen to elastin tissue detected during the tissue identification procedure. The ratio of collagen to elastin tissue may be detected used a variety of techniques including infrared (IR) surface reflectance and emissivity. The force applied to the tissue by the clamp arm and/or the stroke of the clamp arm to produce gap and compression.

For example, the generator <b>900</b> can deliver energy with higher voltage and lower current to drive an ultrasonic transducer, with lower voltage and higher current to drive RF electrodes for sealing tissue, or with a coagulation waveform for spot coagulation using either monopolar or bipolar RF electrosurgical electrodes. The output waveform from the generator <b>900</b> can be steered, switched, or filtered to provide the frequency to the end effector of the surgical instrument.

The electromechanical ultrasonic system has an initial resonant frequency defined by the physical properties of the ultrasonic transducer, the waveguide, and the ultrasonic blade. The ultrasonic transducer is excited by an alternating voltage V<sub>g</sub>(t) and current I<sub>g</sub>(t) signal equal to the resonant frequency of the electromechanical ultrasonic system. When the electromechanical ultrasonic system is at resonance, the phase difference between the voltage V<sub>g</sub>(t) and current I<sub>g</sub>(t) signals is zero. Stated another way, at resonance the inductive impedance is equal to the capacitive impedance. As the ultrasonic blade heats up, the compliance of the ultrasonic blade (modeled as an equivalent capacitance) causes the resonant frequency of the electromechanical ultrasonic system to shift. Thus, the inductive impedance is no longer equal to the capacitive impedance causing a mismatch between the drive frequency and the resonant frequency of the electromechanical ultrasonic system. The system is now operating &#x201c;off-resonance.&#x201d; The mismatch between the drive frequency and the resonant frequency is manifested as a phase difference between the voltage V<sub>g</sub>(t) and current I<sub>g</sub>(t) signals applied to the ultrasonic transducer. The generator electronics can easily monitor the phase difference between the voltage V<sub>g</sub>(t) and current I<sub>g</sub>(t) signals and can continuously adjust the drive frequency until the phase difference is once again zero. At this point, the new drive frequency is equal to the new resonant frequency of the electromechanical ultrasonic system. The change in phase and/or frequency can be used as an indirect measurement of the ultrasonic blade temperature.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0278">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the electromechanical properties of the ultrasonic transducer may be modeled as an equivalent circuit comprising a first branch having a static capacitance and a second &#x201c;motional&#x201d; branch having a serially connected inductance, resistance and capacitance that define the electromechanical properties of a resonator. Known ultrasonic generators may include a tuning inductor for tuning out the static capacitance at a resonant frequency so that substantially all of generator's drive signal current flows into the motional branch. Accordingly, by using a tuning inductor, the generator's drive signal current represents the motional branch current, and the generator is thus able to control its drive signal to maintain the ultrasonic transducer's resonant frequency. The tuning inductor may also transform the phase impedance plot of the ultrasonic transducer to improve the generator's frequency lock capabilities. However, the tuning inductor must be matched with the specific static capacitance of an ultrasonic transducer at the operational resonance frequency. In other words, a different ultrasonic transducer having a different static capacitance requires a different tuning inductor.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0279"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an equivalent circuit <b>1500</b> of an ultrasonic transducer, such as the ultrasonic transducer <b>1120</b>, according to one aspect. The circuit <b>1500</b> comprises a first &#x201c;motional&#x201d; branch having a serially connected inductance L<sub>s</sub>, resistance R<sub>s </sub>and capacitance C<sub>s </sub>that define the electromechanical properties of the resonator, and a second capacitive branch having a static capacitance C<sub>0</sub>. Drive current I<sub>g</sub>(t) may be received from a generator at a drive voltage V<sub>g</sub>(t), with motional current I<sub>m</sub>(t) flowing through the first branch and current I<sub>g</sub>(t)&#x2212;I<sub>m</sub>(t) flowing through the capacitive branch. Control of the electromechanical properties of the ultrasonic transducer may be achieved by suitably controlling I<sub>g</sub>(t) and V<sub>g</sub>(t). As explained above, known generator architectures may include a tuning inductor L<sub>t </sub>(shown in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) in a parallel resonance circuit for tuning out the static capacitance C<sub>0 </sub>at a resonant frequency so that substantially all of the generator's current output I<sub>g</sub>(t) flows through the motional branch. In this way, control of the motional branch current I<sub>m</sub>(t) is achieved by controlling the generator current output I<sub>g</sub>(t). The tuning inductor L<sub>t </sub>is specific to the static capacitance C<sub>0 </sub>of an ultrasonic transducer, however, and a different ultrasonic transducer having a different static capacitance requires a different tuning inductor L<sub>t</sub>. Moreover, because the tuning inductor L<sub>t </sub>is matched to the nominal value of the static capacitance C<sub>0 </sub>at a single resonant frequency, accurate control of the motional branch current I<sub>m</sub>(t) is assured only at that frequency. As frequency shifts down with transducer temperature, accurate control of the motional branch current is compromised.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0280">Various aspects of the generator <b>1100</b> may not rely on a tuning inductor L<sub>t </sub>to monitor the motional branch current I<sub>m</sub>(t).

In one aspect, for example, the programmable logic device <b>1660</b> may implement a DDS control algorithm <b>2680</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>) by recalling waveform samples stored in a dynamically-updated look-up table (LUT), such as a RAM LUT which may be embedded in an FPGA. This control algorithm is particularly useful for ultrasonic applications in which an ultrasonic transducer, such as the ultrasonic transducer <b>1120</b>, may be driven by a clean sinusoidal current at its resonant frequency. Because other frequencies may excite parasitic resonances, minimizing or reducing the total distortion of the motional branch current may correspondingly minimize or reduce undesirable resonance effects. Because the waveform shape of a drive signal output by the generator <b>1100</b> is impacted by various sources of distortion present in the output drive circuit (e.g., the power transformer <b>1560</b>, the power amplifier <b>1620</b>), voltage and current feedback data based on the drive signal may be input into an algorithm, such as an error control algorithm implemented by the processor <b>1740</b>, which compensates for distortion by suitably pre-distorting or modifying the waveform samples stored in the LUT on a dynamic, ongoing basis (e.g., in real-time). In one aspect, the amount or degree of pre-distortion applied to the LUT samples may be based on the error between a computed motional branch current and a desired current waveform shape, with the error being determined on a sample-by sample basis. In this way, the pre-distorted LUT samples, when processed through the drive circuit, may result in a motional branch drive signal having the desired waveform shape (e.g., sinusoidal) for optimally driving the ultrasonic transducer. In such aspects, the LUT waveform samples will therefore not represent the desired waveform shape of the drive signal, but rather the waveform shape that is required to ultimately produce the desired waveform shape of the motional branch drive signal when distortion effects are taken into account.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0284">The non-isolated stage <b>1540</b> may further comprise an ADC <b>1780</b> and an ADC <b>1800</b> coupled to the output of the power transformer <b>1560</b> via respective isolation transformers <b>1820</b>, <b>1840</b> for respectively sampling the voltage and current of drive signals output by the generator <b>1100</b>. In certain aspects, the ADCs <b>1780</b>, <b>1800</b> may be configured to sample at high speeds (e.g., 80 Msps) to enable oversampling of the drive signals. In one aspect, for example, the sampling speed of the ADCs <b>1780</b>, <b>1800</b> may enable approximately 200&#xd7; (depending on drive frequency) oversampling of the drive signals. In certain aspects, the sampling operations of the ADCs <b>1780</b>, <b>1800</b> may be performed by a single ADC receiving input voltage and current signals via a two-way multiplexer. The use of high-speed sampling in aspects of the generator <b>1100</b> may enable, among other things, calculation of the complex current flowing through the motional branch (which may be used in certain aspects to implement DDS-based waveform shape control described above), accurate digital filtering of the sampled signals, and calculation of real power consumption with a high degree of precision. Voltage and current feedback data output by the ADCs <b>1780</b>, <b>1800</b> may be received and processed (e.g., FIFO buffering, multiplexing) by the programmable logic device <b>1660</b> and stored in data memory for subsequent retrieval by, for example, the processor <b>1740</b>. As noted above, voltage and current feedback data may be used as input to an algorithm for pre-distorting or modifying LUT waveform samples on a dynamic and ongoing basis. In certain aspects, this may require each stored voltage and current feedback data pair to be indexed based on, or otherwise associated with, a corresponding LUT sample that was output by the programmable logic device <b>1660</b> when the voltage and current feedback data pair was acquired. Synchronization of the LUT samples and the voltage and current feedback data in this manner contributes to the correct timing and stability of the pre-distortion algorithm.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0285">In certain aspects, the voltage and current feedback data may be used to control the frequency and/or amplitude (e.g., current amplitude) of the drive signals.

The frequency of the drive signal may then be controlled to minimize or reduce the difference between the determined impedance phase and an impedance phase setpoint (e.g., 0&#xb0;), thereby minimizing or reducing the effects of harmonic distortion and correspondingly enhancing impedance phase measurement accuracy.

For voltage V<sub>g</sub>(t) and current I<sub>g</sub>(t) signals having the same frequency, each negative to positive zero-crossing of voltage signal V<sub>g</sub>(t) triggers the start of a pulse, while each negative to positive zero-crossing of current signal I<sub>g</sub>(t) triggers the end of the pulse. The result is a pulse train with a pulse width proportional to the phase angle between the voltage signal and the current signal. In one aspect, the pulse train may be passed through an averaging filter to yield a measure of the phase difference. Furthermore, if the positive to negative zero crossings also are used in a similar manner, and the results averaged, any effects of DC and harmonic components can be reduced. In one implementation, the analog voltage V<sub>g</sub>(t) and current I<sub>g</sub>(t) signals are converted to digital signals that are high if the analog signal is positive and low if the analog signal is negative. High accuracy phase estimates require sharp transitions between high and low. In one aspect, a Schmitt trigger along with an RC stabilization network may be employed to convert the analog signals into digital signals. In other aspects, an edge triggered RS flip-flop and ancillary circuitry may be employed.

In certain aspects, control of the current amplitude may be implemented by control algorithm, such as, for example, a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control algorithm, in the processor <b>1740</b>.

Although the processor <b>1900</b> may primarily support UI functionality, it may also coordinate with the processor <b>1740</b> to implement hazard mitigation in certain aspects. For example, the processor <b>1900</b> may be programmed to monitor various aspects of user input and/or other inputs (e.g., touch screen inputs <b>2150</b>, foot switch <b>1430</b> inputs, temperature sensor inputs <b>2160</b>) and may disable the drive output of the generator <b>1100</b> when an erroneous condition is detected.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0294">In certain aspects, both the processor <b>1740</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>A</figref>) and the processor <b>1900</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>B</figref>) may determine and monitor the operating state of the generator <b>1100</b>. For processor <b>1740</b>, the operating state of the generator <b>1100</b> may dictate, for example, which control and/or diagnostic processes are implemented by the processor <b>1740</b>. For processor <b>1900</b>, the operating state of the generator <b>1100</b> may dictate, for example, which elements of a user interface (e.g., display screens, sounds) are presented to a user.

In this way, the controller <b>1960</b> may continue to monitor an input device <b>2150</b> (e.g., a capacitive touch sensor located on a front panel of the generator <b>1100</b>) for turning the generator <b>1100</b> on and off. When the generator <b>1100</b> is in the &#x201c;power off&#x201d; state, the controller <b>1960</b> may wake the power supply (e.g., enable operation of one or more DC/DC voltage converters <b>2130</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) of the power supply <b>2110</b>) if activation of the &#x201c;on/off&#x201d; input device <b>2150</b> by a user is detected.

The signal conditioning circuit <b>2020</b> may be configured to receive a periodic signal from the programmable logic device <b>2000</b> (e.g., a 2 kHz square wave) to generate a bipolar interrogation signal having an identical frequency. The interrogation signal may be generated, for example, using a bipolar current source fed by a differential amplifier. The interrogation signal may be communicated to a surgical device control circuit (e.g., by using a conductive pair in a cable that connects the generator <b>1100</b> to the surgical device) and monitored to determine a state or configuration of the control circuit. For example, the control circuit may comprise a number of switches, resistors and/or diodes to modify one or more characteristics (e.g., amplitude, rectification) of the interrogation signal such that a state or configuration of the control circuit is uniquely discernible based on the one or more characteristics. In one aspect, for example, the signal conditioning circuit <b>2020</b> may comprise an ADC for generating samples of a voltage signal appearing across inputs of the control circuit resulting from passage of interrogation signal therethrough. The programmable logic device <b>2000</b> (or a component of the non-isolated stage <b>1540</b>) may then determine the state or configuration of the control circuit based on the ADC samples.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0300">In one aspect, the instrument interface circuit <b>1980</b> may comprise a first data circuit interface <b>2040</b> to enable information exchange between the programmable logic device <b>2000</b> (or other element of the instrument interface circuit <b>1980</b>) and a first data circuit disposed in or otherwise associated with a surgical device. In certain aspects, for example, a first data circuit <b>2060</b> may be disposed in a cable integrally attached to a surgical device handpiece, or in an adaptor for interfacing a specific surgical device type or model with the generator <b>1100</b>. In certain aspects, the first data circuit may comprise a non-volatile storage device, such as an electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) device. In certain aspects and referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the first data circuit interface <b>2040</b> may be implemented separately from the programmable logic device <b>2000</b> and comprise suitable circuitry (e.g., discrete logic devices, a processor) to enable communication between the programmable logic device <b>2000</b> and the first data circuit.

This information may be read by the instrument interface circuit <b>1980</b> (e.g., by the programmable logic device <b>2000</b>), transferred to a component of the non-isolated stage <b>1540</b> (e.g., to programmable logic device <b>1660</b>, processor <b>1740</b> and/or processor <b>1900</b>) for presentation to a user via an output device <b>2140</b> and/or for controlling a function or operation of the generator <b>1100</b>. Additionally, any type of information may be communicated to first data circuit <b>2060</b> for storage therein via the first data circuit interface <b>2040</b> (e.g., using the programmable logic device <b>2000</b>). Such information may comprise, for example, an updated number of operations in which the surgical device has been used and/or dates and/or times of its usage.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0302">As discussed previously, a surgical instrument may be detachable from a handpiece (e.g., instrument <b>1106</b> may be detachable from handpiece <b>1107</b>) to promote instrument interchangeability and/or disposability. In such cases, known generators may be limited in their ability to recognize particular instrument configurations being used and to optimize control and diagnostic processes accordingly. The addition of readable data circuits to surgical device instruments to address this issue is problematic from a compatibility standpoint, however. For example, it may be impractical to design a surgical device to maintain backward compatibility with generators that lack the requisite data reading functionality due to, for example, differing signal schemes, design complexity and cost. Other aspects of instruments address these concerns by using data circuits that may be implemented in existing surgical instruments economically and with minimal design changes to preserve compatibility of the surgical devices with current generator platforms.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0303">Additionally, aspects of the generator <b>1100</b> may enable communication with instrument-based data circuits. For example, the generator <b>1100</b> may be configured to communicate with a second data circuit (e.g., a data circuit) contained in an instrument (e.g., instrument <b>1104</b>, <b>1106</b> or <b>1108</b>) of a surgical device. The instrument interface circuit <b>1980</b> may comprise a second data circuit interface <b>2100</b> to enable this communication. In one aspect, the second data circuit interface <b>2100</b> may comprise a tri-state digital interface, although other interfaces may also be used. In certain aspects, the second data circuit may generally be any circuit for transmitting and/or receiving data. In one aspect, for example, the second data circuit may store information pertaining to the particular surgical instrument with which it is associated. Such information may include, for example, a model number, a serial number, a number of operations in which the surgical instrument has been used, and/or any other type of information. Additionally or alternatively, any type of information may be communicated to the second data circuit for storage therein via the second data circuit interface <b>2100</b> (e.g., using the programmable logic device <b>2000</b>). Such information may comprise, for example, an updated number of operations in which the instrument has been used and/or dates and/or times of its usage. In certain aspects, the second data circuit may transmit data acquired by one or more sensors (e.g., an instrument-based temperature sensor). In certain aspects, the second data circuit may receive data from the generator <b>1100</b> and provide an indication to a user (e.g., an LED indication or other visible indication) based on the received data.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0304">In certain aspects, the second data circuit and the second data circuit interface <b>2100</b> may be configured such that communication between the programmable logic device <b>2000</b> and the second data circuit can be effected without the need to provide additional conductors for this purpose (e.g., dedicated conductors of a cable connecting a handpiece to the generator <b>1100</b>). In one aspect, for example, information may be communicated to and from the second data circuit using a one-wire bus communication scheme implemented on existing cabling, such as one of the conductors used transmit interrogation signals from the signal conditioning circuit <b>2020</b> to a control circuit in a handpiece. In this way, design changes or modifications to the surgical device that might otherwise be necessary are minimized or reduced. Moreover, because different types of communications can be implemented over a common physical channel (either with or without frequency-band separation), the presence of a second data circuit may be &#x201c;invisible&#x201d; to generators that do not have the requisite data reading functionality, thus enabling backward compatibility of the surgical device instrument.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0305">In certain aspects, the isolated stage <b>1520</b> may comprise at least one blocking capacitor <b>2960</b>-<b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>) connected to the drive signal output <b>1600</b><i>b </i>to prevent passage of DC current to a patient. A single blocking capacitor may be required to comply with medical regulations or standards, for example. While failure in single-capacitor designs is relatively uncommon, such failure may nonetheless have negative consequences. In one aspect, a second blocking capacitor <b>2960</b>-<b>2</b> may be provided in series with the blocking capacitor <b>2960</b>-<b>1</b>, with current leakage from a point between the blocking capacitors <b>2960</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>2960</b>-<b>2</b> being monitored by, for example, an ADC <b>2980</b> for sampling a voltage induced by leakage current.

In another aspect, feedback samples corresponding to a particular LUT sample output by the programmable logic device <b>1660</b> may be stored, along with the LUT address of the LUT sample, at a common memory location. In any event, the feedback samples may be stored such that the address of the LUT sample from which a particular set of feedback samples originated may be subsequently ascertained. As discussed above, synchronization of the LUT sample addresses and the feedback samples in this way contributes to the correct timing and stability of the pre-distortion algorithm. A direct memory access (DMA) controller implemented at block <b>2166</b> of the processor <b>1740</b> may store the feedback samples (and any LUT sample address data, where applicable) at a designated memory location <b>2180</b> of the processor <b>1740</b> (e.g., internal RAM).</p><p id="p-0187" num="0309">Block <b>2200</b> of the processor <b>1740</b> may implement a pre-distortion algorithm for pre-distorting or modifying the LUT samples stored in the programmable logic device <b>1660</b> on a dynamic, ongoing basis.

In one aspect, the PID controller <b>12972</b> may comprise a proportional element <b>12974</b> (P), an integral element <b>12976</b> (I), and a derivative element <b>12978</b> (D).

The &#x201c;I&#x201d; element <b>12976</b> accounts for past values of the error. For example, if the current output is not sufficiently strong, the integral of the error will accumulate over time, and the controller will respond by applying a stronger action. The &#x201c;D&#x201d; element <b>12978</b> accounts for possible future trends of the error, based on its current rate of change. For example, continuing the P example above, when the large positive control output succeeds in bringing the error closer to zero, it also puts the process on a path to large negative error in the near future. In this case, the derivative turns negative and the D module reduces the strength of the action to prevent this overshoot.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0362">It will be appreciated that other variables and set points may be monitored and controlled in accordance with the feedback control systems <b>12950</b>, <b>12970</b>.

Aspects of the ultrasonic surgical devices can be configured for transecting and/or coagulating tissue during surgical procedures, for example. Aspects of the electrosurgical devices can be configured for transecting, coagulating, scaling, welding and/or desiccating tissue during surgical procedures, for example.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0364">Aspects of the generator utilize high-speed analog-to-digital sampling (e.g., approximately 200&#xd7; oversampling, depending on frequency) of the generator drive signal current and voltage, along with digital signal processing, to provide a number of advantages and benefits over known generator architectures. In one aspect, for example, based on current and voltage feedback data, a value of the ultrasonic transducer static capacitance, and a value of the drive signal frequency, the generator may determine the motional branch current of an ultrasonic transducer. This provides the benefit of a virtually tuned system, and simulates the presence of a system that is tuned or resonant with any value of the static capacitance (e.g., C<b>0</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) at any frequency. Accordingly, control of the motional branch current may be realized by tuning out the effects of the static capacitance without the need for a tuning inductor. Additionally, the elimination of the tuning inductor may not degrade the generator's frequency lock capabilities, as frequency lock can be realized by suitably processing the current and voltage feedback data.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0365">High-speed analog-to-digital sampling of the generator drive signal current and voltage, along with digital signal processing, may also enable precise digital filtering of the samples. For example, aspects of the generator may utilize a low-pass digital filter (e.g., a finite impulse response (FIR) filter) that rolls off between a fundamental drive signal frequency and a second-order harmonic to reduce the asymmetrical harmonic distortion and EMI-induced noise in current and voltage feedback samples. The filtered current and voltage feedback samples represent substantially the fundamental drive signal frequency, thus enabling a more accurate impedance phase measurement with respect to the fundamental drive signal frequency and an improvement in the generator's ability to maintain resonant frequency lock. The accuracy of the impedance phase measurement may be further enhanced by averaging falling edge and rising edge phase measurements, and by regulating the measured impedance phase to 0&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0366">Various aspects of the generator may also utilize the high-speed analog-to-digital sampling of the generator drive signal current and voltage, along with digital signal processing, to determine real power consumption and other quantities with a high degree of precision. This may allow the generator to implement a number of useful algorithms, such as, for example, controlling the amount of power delivered to tissue as the impedance of the tissue changes and controlling the power delivery to maintain a constant rate of tissue impedance increase. Some of these algorithms are used to determine the phase difference between the generator drive signal current and voltage signals. At resonance, the phase difference between the current and voltage signals is zero. The phase changes as the ultrasonic system goes off-resonance. Various algorithms may be employed to detect the phase difference and adjust the drive frequency until the ultrasonic system returns to resonance, i.e., the phase difference between the current and voltage signals goes to zero. The phase information also may be used to infer the conditions of the ultrasonic blade. As discussed with particularity below, the phase changes as a function of the temperature of the ultrasonic blade. Therefore, the phase information may be employed to control the temperature of the ultrasonic blade. This may be done, for example, by reducing the power delivered to the ultrasonic blade when the ultrasonic blade runs too hot and increasing the power delivered to the ultrasonic blade when the ultrasonic blade runs too cold.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0367">Various aspects of the generator may have a wide frequency range and increased output power necessary to drive both ultrasonic surgical devices and electrosurgical devices. The lower voltage, higher current demand of electrosurgical devices may be met by a dedicated tap on a wideband power transformer, thereby eliminating the need for a separate power amplifier and output transformer. Moreover, sensing and feedback circuits of the generator may support a large dynamic range that addresses the needs of both ultrasonic and electrosurgical applications with minimal distortion.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0368">Various aspects may provide a simple, economical means for the generator to read from, and optionally write to, a data circuit (e.g., a single-wire bus device, such as a one-wire protocol EEPROM known under the trade name &#x201c;1-Wire&#x201d;) disposed in an instrument attached to the handpiece using existing multi-conductor generator/handpiece cables. In this way, the generator is able to retrieve and process instrument-specific data from an instrument attached to the handpiece. This may enable the generator to provide better control and improved diagnostics and error detection. Additionally, the ability of the generator to write data to the instrument makes possible new functionality in terms of, for example, tracking instrument usage and capturing operational data.

with the end effector jaw in various open or closed configurations and loading. The circle plots in solid line depict impedance and the circle plots in broken lines depict admittance, in accordance with at least one aspect of the present disclosure. By way of example, the impedance/admittance circle plots are generated by connecting an ultrasonic device to an impedance analyzer. The display of the impedance analyzer is set to complex impedance and complex admittance, which can be selectable from the front panel of the impedance analyzer. An initial display may be obtained with the jaw of the ultrasonic end effector in an open position and the ultrasonic device in an unloaded state, as described below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>60</b></figref>, for example. The autoscale display function of the impedance analyzer may be used to generate both the complex impedance and admittance circle plots. The same display is used for subsequent runs of the ultrasonic device with different loading conditions as shown in the subsequent <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b>-<b>29</b></figref>. A LabVIEW application may be employed to upload the data files. In another technique, the display images may be captured with a camera, such as a smartphone camera, like an iPhone or Android. As such, the image of the display may include some &#x201c;keystone-ing&#x201d; and in general may not appear to be parallel to the screen. Using this technique, the circle plot traces on the display will appear distorted in the captured image. With this approach, the material located in the jaws of the ultrasonic end effector can be classified.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0418">The complex impedance and complex admittance are just the reciprocal of one another.

So, the circle on the right side becomes choppy. But this is only due to the impedance analyzer and the settings used to cover multiple resonances.</p><p id="p-0327" num="0462">When multiple resonances are present, there is more information to improve the classifier. The circle plots <b>132110</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, <b>132112</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>fit can be calculated for each as encountered to keep the algorithm running fast. So once there is a cross of the complex admittance, which implies a circle, during the sweep, a fit can be calculated.</p><p id="p-0328" num="0463">Benefits include in-the-jaw classifier based on data and a well-known model for ultrasonic systems. Count and characterizations of circles are well known in vision systems. So data processing is readily available. For example, a closed form solution exists to calculate the radius and axes' offsets for a circle. This technique can be relatively fast.</p><p id="p-0329" num="0464">TABLE 2 is a list of symbols used for lumped parameter model of a piezoelectric transducer (from IEEE 177 Standard).</p><p

It is known that different surgical techniques exist in different regions of the world, and vary widely from surgeon to surgeon. For this reason, a technique mode may be provided on the generator to enable more efficient energy delivery based upon the user's specific surgical technique such as, for example, a tip bite of tissue versus a full bite of tissue. A tip bite refers to the end effector of a surgical device grasping tissue at the tip only. A full bite refers to the end effector of a surgical device grasping tissue within the entire end effector. The generator may be configured to detect if a user is consistently operating with a tip bite of tissue or a full bite of tissue. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>58</b></figref> initial RF impedance data was measured and plotted for tip bites as Group <b>1</b> <b>132472</b> and full bites as Group <b>2</b> <b>132474</b>.

Upon detecting whether the user grasps a tip bite of tissue or a full bite of tissue, the algorithm can suggest a predetermined dissection mode. For example, for a tip bite of tissue the algorithm may suggest a fine dissection mode to the user or this option may be selected before a procedure. For example, for a full bite of tissue the algorithm may suggest a course dissection mode to the user or this option may be selected before a procedure. In fine dissection mode, the algorithm may be tailored to optimize energy delivery for this surgical technique by lowering the ultrasonic displacement to protect the clamp arm pad from burning through. Also it is known that tip biting has a greater amount of RF noise, causing longer seal times, and greater variation in seal performance. Fine dissection mode for tip biting cold have an algorithm tailored to having a lower RF termination impedance and/or different filtering signal to increase accuracy of energy delivery.</p><p id="p-0407" num="0540">A technique sensitivity analysis was conducted as part of the development work for classification.

The output of the feedback control can be used to prevent the ultrasonic end effector clamp arm pad from burning through, which is not a desirable effect for ultrasonic surgical instruments.

As the temperature of the ultrasonic blade increases due to frictional contact with tissue, for example, the control circuit monitors the change or delta in the resonant frequency of the ultrasonic electromechanical system and determines <b>133324</b> whether the delta frequency threshold for a predetermined blade temperature has been reached. If the delta frequency is below the threshold, the process continues along the NO branch and the control circuit continues to seek <b>133325</b> the new resonant frequency and monitor the delta frequency. When the delta frequency meets or exceeds the delta frequency threshold, the process continues along the YES branch and calculates <b>133326</b> a new lower frequency limit (threshold), which corresponds to the melting point of the clamp arm pad.

For example, in the case of a TEFLON clamp arm pad, the control circuit determines <b>133328</b> if the ultrasonic blade temperature is approaching 350&#xb0; C., for example, based on the current resonant frequency. If the current resonant frequency is above the lower frequency limit, the process continues along the NO branch and applies <b>133330</b> a normal level of electrical current to the ultrasonic transducer suitable for tissue transection. Alternatively, if the current resonant frequency is at or below the lower frequency limit, the process continues along the YES branch and regulates <b>133332</b> the resonant frequency by modifying the electrical current applied to the ultrasonic transducer. In ne aspect, the control circuit employs a PID controller as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>-<b>17</b></figref>, for example.

Since the CTM algorithm depicted by the logic flow diagram <b>133320</b> only has an effect at or near the melting point of the clamp arm pad, the CTM algorithm is activated after the tissue is transected.</p><p id="p-0417" num="0550">Burst pressure testing conducted on samples indicates that there is no impact on the burst pressure of the seal when the CTM process or logic configuration depicted by the logic flow diagram <b>133320</b> is employed to seal and cut vessels or other tissue.

Moreover, temperature measurements confirm that the ultrasonic blade temperature is bounded by the CTM algorithm compared to devices without CTM feedback algorithm control and devices that underwent 10 firings at maximum power for ten seconds against the pad with 5 seconds rest between firings showed significantly reduced pad wear whereas no device without CTM algorithm feedback control lasted more than 2 firings in this abuse test.</p><p id="p-0418" num="0551"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>62</b></figref> is a graphical representation <b>133340</b> of temperature versus time comparing the desired temperature of an ultrasonic blade with a smart ultrasonic blade and a conventional ultrasonic blade, in accordance with at least one aspect of the present disclosure.

In the plot, the dash-dot line is a temperature threshold <b>133342</b> that represents the desired temperature of the ultrasonic blade.

Once the temperature of the smart ultrasonic blade under the control of the CTM algorithm exceeds the desired temperature threshold (&#x2dc;340&#xb0; C.), the CTM algorithm takes control and regulates the temperature of the smart ultrasonic blade to match the threshold as closely as possible until the transection procedure is completed and the power to the ultrasonic transducer is deactivated or cut off.</p><p id="p-0419" num="0552">In another aspect, the present disclosure provides a CTM algorithm for a &#x201c;seal only&#x201d; tissue effect by an ultrasonic device, such as ultrasonic shears, for example. Generally speaking, ultrasonic surgical instruments typically seal and cut tissue simultaneously. Creating an ultrasonic device configured to seal only without cutting has not been difficult to achieve using ultrasonic technology alone due to the uncertainty of knowing when the seal was completed before initiating the cutting. In one aspect, the CTM algorithm may be configured to protect the end effector clamp arm pad by allowing the temperature of the ultrasonic blade to exceed the temperature required for cutting (transecting) the tissue but not to exceed the melting point of the clamp arm pad. In another aspect, the CTM seal only algorithm may be tuned to exceed the sealing temperature of tissue (approximately 115&#xb0; C. to approximately 180&#xb0; C. based on experimentation) but not to exceed the cutting (transecting) temperature of tissue (approximately 180&#xb0; C. to approximately 350&#xb0; C.). In the latter configuration, the CTM seal only algorithm provides a &#x201c;seal only&#x201d; tissue effect that has been successfully demonstrated. In a linear fit that calculates the change in frequency with respect to the initial lock frequency, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>59</b></figref>, for example, changing the intercept of the fit regulates the final steady state temperature of the ultrasonic blade. By adjusting the intercept parameter, the ultrasonic blade can be set to never exceed approximately 180&#xb0; C. resulting in the tissue sealing but not cutting. In one aspect, increasing the clamp force may improve the sealing process without impacting clamp arm pad burn through because the temperature of the blade is controlled by the CTM seal only algorithm. As previously described, the CTM seal only algorithm may be implemented by the generator and PID controller described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>C, <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>B, and <b>16</b>-<b>17</b></figref>, for example. Accordingly, the flow diagram <b>133320</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>61</b></figref> may be modified such that the control circuit calculates <b>133326</b> a new lower frequency limit (threshold t correspond with a &#x201c;seal only&#x201d; temperature such as, for example, approximately 180&#xb0; C., determine <b>133328</b> when the frequency is near the lower limit, and regulate <b>133332</b> the temperature until the &#x201c;seal only&#x201d; surgical procedure is terminated and the ultrasonic transducer is deactivated.</p><p id="p-0420" num="0553">In another aspect, the present disclosure provides a cool thermal monitoring (CTMo) algorithm configured to detect when atraumatic grasping is feasible. Acoustic ultrasonic energy results in an ultrasonic blade temperature of approximately 230&#xb0; C. to approximately 300&#xb0; C. to achieve the desired effect of cutting or transecting tissue. Because heat is retained in the metal body of the ultrasonic blade for a period of time after deactivation of the ultrasonic transducer, the residual heat stored in the ultrasonic blade can cause tissue damage if the ultrasonic end effector is used to grasp tissue before the ultrasonic blade has had an opportunity to cool down.</p><p id="p-0421" num="0554">In one aspect, the CTMo algorithm calculates a change in the natural frequency of the ultrasonic electromechanical system from the natural frequency at a hot state to a natural frequency at a temperature where atraumatic grasping is possible without damaging the tissue grasped by the end effector. Directly or a predetermined period of time after activating the ultrasonic transducer, a non-therapeutic signal (approximately 5 mA) is applied to the ultrasonic transducer containing a bandwidth of frequencies, approximately 48,000 Hz to 52,000 Hz, for example, at which the natural frequency is expected to be found. A FFT algorithm, or other mathematically efficient algorithm of detecting the natural frequency of the ultrasonic electromechanical system, of the impedance of the ultrasonic transducer measured during the stimulation of the ultrasonic transducer with the non-therapeutic signal will indicate the natural frequency of the ultrasonic blade as being the frequency at which the impedance magnitude is at a minimum. Continually stimulating the ultrasonic transducer in this manner provides continual feedback of the natural frequency of the ultrasonic blade within a frequency resolution of the FFT or other algorithm for estimating or measuring the natural frequency. When a change in natural frequency is detected that corresponds to a temperature that is feasible for atraumatic grasping, a tone, or a LED, or an on screen display or other form of notification, or a combination thereof, is provided to indicate that the device is capable of atraumatic grasping.</p><p id="p-0422" num="0555">In another aspect, the present disclosure provides a CTM algorithm configured to tone for seal and end of cut or transection. Providing &#x201c;tissue sealed&#x201d; and &#x201c;end of cut&#x201d; notifications is a challenge for conventional ultrasonic devices because temperature measurement cannot easily be directly mounted to the ultrasonic blade and the clamp arm pad is not explicitly detected by the blade using sensors. A CTM algorithm can indicate temperature state of the ultrasonic blade and can be employed to indicate the &#x201c;end of cut&#x201d; or &#x201c;tissue sealed&#x201d;, or both, states because these are temperature-based events.</p><p id="p-0423" num="0556">In one aspect, a CTM algorithm according to the present disclosure detects the &#x201c;end of cut&#x201d; state and activates a notification. Tissue typically cuts at approximately 210&#xb0; C. to approximately 320&#xb0; C. with high probability. A CTM algorithm can activate a tone at 320&#xb0; C. (or similar) to indicate that further activation on the tissue is not productive as that the tissue is probably cut and the ultrasonic blade is now running against the clamp arm pad, which is acceptable when the CTM algorithm is active because it controls the temperature of the ultrasonic blade. In one aspect, the CTM algorithm is programmed to control or regulate power to the ultrasonic transducer to maintain the temperature of the ultrasonic blade to approximately 320&#xb0; C. when the temperature of the ultrasonic blade is estimated to have reached 320&#xb0; C. Initiating a tone at this point provides an indication that the tissue has been cut. The CTM algorithm is based on a variation in frequency with temperature. After determining an initial state temperature (based on initial frequency), the CTM algorithm can calculate a frequency change that corresponds to a temperature that implies when the tissue is cut. For example, if the starting frequency is 51,000 Hz, the CTM algorithm will calculate the change in frequency required to achieve 320&#xb0; C. which might be &#x2212;112 Hz. It will then initiate control to maintain that frequency set point (e.g., 50,888 Hz) thereby regulating the temperature of the ultrasonic blade. Similarly, a frequency change can be calculated based on an initial frequency that indicates when the ultrasonic blade is at a temperature which indicates that the tissue is probably cut. At this point, the CTM algorithm does not have to control power, but simply initiate a tone to indicate the state of the tissue or the CTM algorithm can control frequency at this point to maintain that temperature if desired. Either way, the &#x201c;end of cut&#x201d; is indicated.</p><p id="p-0424" num="0557">In one aspect, a CTM algorithm according to the present disclosure detects the &#x201c;tissue sealed&#x201d; state and activates a notification. Similar to the end of cut detection, tissue seals between approximately 105&#xb0; C. and approximately 200&#xb0; C. The change in frequency from an initial frequency required to indicate that a temperature of the ultrasonic blade has reached 200&#xb0; C., which indicates a seal only state, can be calculated at the onset of activation of the ultrasonic transducer. The CTM algorithm can activate a tone at this point and if the surgeon wishes to obtain a seal only state, the surgeon could stop activation or to achieve a seal only state the surgeon could stop activation of the ultrasonic transducer and automatically initiate a specific seal only algorithm from this point on or the surgeon could continue activation of the ultrasonic transducer to achieve a tissue cut state.</p><p id="p-0425" num="0558">While several forms have been illustrated and described, it is not the intention of the applicant to restrict or limit the scope of the appended claims to such detail.
