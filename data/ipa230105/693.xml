id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention pertains to the technical field of swim diapers, more preferably disposable swim pants, and to absorbent structures for use in such swim diapers. More specifically the present invention relates to a swim diaper comprising an absorbent core between a topsheet and a backsheet.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Absorbent articles such as diapers, baby pants, adult incontinent garments and the like, typically comprise an absorbent core, positioned in between a liquid permeable or pervious, hydrophilic or semi hydrophilic topsheet and a liquid impermeable or impervious backsheet. The absorbent core comprises absorbent material that is able to absorb fluid and liquid bodily excretions of the user of the absorbent article. The absorbent material of the absorbent core may be an absorbent particulate polymer material which is dispersed in a matrix of cellulose fibers or fluff pulp in order to prevent the particulate material from aggregating.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Swim diapers are typically worn by babies, infants, toddlers and children in situations where it is expected that the diapers will be in continuous or frequent contact with water, for example in a swimming pool, in a bath or in sea. Absorbent cores of regular absorbent articles as described above are not suited to be used in swim diapers for various reasons.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Regular absorbent cores generally have a high absorbent capacity and the absorbent core may expand several times its weight and volume when used in wet environments. These increases may cause the absorbent article to deform and to sag in the crotch region as they become saturated with liquid. In addition, such a saturated absorbent core will become very heavy and this may impede the movements of the wearer both in the water, potentially causing a drowning hazard, and out of the water. Moreover, a heavy sagging diaper may cause skin irritation or even cuts or abrasions to the legs and/or waist of the wearer.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Furthermore, existing absorbent cores containing fluff pulp have a limited wet integrity, which leads to the shape and fit of the absorbent article being deformed when e.g. the absorbent article is being worn by a baby in a bath or a toddler in a pool. In other words, such fibrous materials may disintegrate in water and failure of such an absorbent core may result in loose fibrous material being introduced into the pool water. This may cause contamination of the water and may pose a possible health hazard for other children in the pool. In addition, when a diaper would fail in a pool, this might cause fecal waste to be introduced into the pool which would also cause contamination of the water.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an object of embodiments of the invention to provide a swim diaper with improved dry and wet integrity. Moreover, it is an object of embodiments of the invention to provide a swim diaper which is comfortable to wear in a dry and/or wet state. Furthermore it is an object of embodiments of the invention to provide a swim diaper which, if a fecal accident arises, contains the feces and prevents contamination of the surroundings.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an aspect of the invention there is provided a swim diaper comprising a liquid pervious topsheet, a liquid impervious backsheet, and an absorbent core positioned in between said topsheet and said backsheet. The absorbent core comprises a top core wrap sheet and a back core wrap sheet and fluff pulp between the top core wrap sheet and the back core wrap sheet. The absorbent core has a first and second longitudinal edge and a front and rear transverse edge. The absorbent core is substantially free of superabsorbent polymers. Seen in a longitudinal direction of the absorbent core, looking from the front transverse edge to the rear transverse edge, the absorbent core comprises subsequently a first, second, third and fourth zone. The absorbent core comprises a front part extending between the front edge and a transverse crotch line of the absorbent core, and a rear part extending between the rear edge and the transverse crotch line of the absorbent core. The first and second zones extend in the front part of the absorbent core and the third and fourth zone extend in the rear part. The absorbent core is provided with one or more reinforcement zones, where the top core wrap sheet is attached to the back core wrap sheet, extending at least partially in the second and/or third zone. The one or more reinforcement zones are arranged such that for any area in the second and/or third zone having a width of 50% of a width of the absorbent core and a length of 40% of a length of the absorbent core, at least one reinforcement zone is at least partially located in said area.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Preferably, the second zone and third zone together extend over a length corresponding with at least 40% of the length of the absorbent core, preferably at least 50% of the length of the absorbent core.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Embodiments are based inter alia on the inventive insight that by providing an absorbent core comprising fluff pulp and substantially no superabsorbent polymers with one or more reinforcement zones, the wet integrity of the absorbent core is drastically improved. Especially by providing at least one reinforcement zone extending in the second and third zone of the absorbent core, it is achieved that the crotch region of the swim diaper exhibits an improved wet integrity thereby allowing the safe use of the swim diaper in a wet or aqueous environment. The crotch region of the swim diaper is the region of the diaper which has the smallest amount of support provided by the body of the wearer and is therefore the region of the diaper with the highest risk of sagging. By providing at least one reinforcement covering at least part of any area in the second and/or third zone having a width of 50% of a width of the absorbent core and a length of 40% of a length of the absorbent core, the amount of unsupported fluff pulp in the absorbent core is reduced, and a dry and/or wet integrity of the swim diaper is improved. In this manner, fecal excretions can be successfully retained within the swim diaper and contamination of the surroundings is avoided. Moreover, because the absorbent core is substantially free from superabsorbent polymers and because of the provision of one or more reinforcement zones the swim diaper will not, when saturated, become too heavy for the wearer and the risk of sagging is significantly reduced. This results in a swim diaper with an improved wearing comfort, both in and out of the water.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably the second zone and/or the third zone extend over a length corresponding with at least 20% of the length of the absorbent core, preferably at least 25% of the length of the absorbent core, more preferably at least 30% of the length of the absorbent core. In further embodiments the second zone and/or the third zone extend over an even larger length corresponding with at least 40% of the length of the absorbent core.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably the one or more reinforcement zones are arranged such that for any area in the second and/or third zone having a width of 50% of the width of the absorbent core and a length of 35%, 30%, 25% or 20% of the length of the absorbent core, at least one reinforcement zone is at least partially located in the respective area.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably the one or more reinforcement zones are arranged such that for any area in the second and/or third zone having a width of 40% of the width of the absorbent core and a length of 40%, 35%, 30%, 25% or 20% of the length of the absorbent core, at least one reinforcement zone is at least partially located in the respective area.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably the one or more reinforcement zones are arranged such that for any area in the second and/or third zone having a width of 30% of the width of the absorbent core and a length of 40%, 35%, 30%, 25% or 20% of the length of the absorbent core, at least one reinforcement zone is at least partially located in the respective area.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an embodiment the absorbent core comprises between 30 and 160 gsm of fluff pulp, preferably between 50 and 140 gsm of fluff pulp, and more preferably between 70 and 120 gsm of fluff pulp. It has been found by the Applicant that these grammages of fluff pulp, in combination with the one or more reinforcement zones in the absorbent core result in improved absorbent core functionality.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">On the one hand, such grammages are sufficient to ensure that fecal excretions can be maintained within the swim diaper, and, on the other hand such grammages are beneficial in that they only allow for a limited amount of volume and/or weight increase of the swim diaper when absorbing liquid. In this manner a reliable and comfortable swim diaper is provided.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Preferably, the term &#x201c;substantially free of superabsorbent polymer&#x201d; implies that any superabsorbent polymer material represents less than 10% of the absorbent material in the absorbent core, preferably less than 5%, more preferably less than 3%, even more preferably less than 2%, most preferably less than 1%, and e.g. no superabsorbent polymer.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an embodiment the one or more reinforcement zones extend from a crotch region in the direction of the front and/or rear transverse edge.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to an embodiment the one or more reinforcement zones comprise a substantially continuous attachment having a width of at least 1 mm, preferably at least 2 mm, more preferably at least 3 mm, and most preferably at least 4 mm. In that manner channels or pockets are created guiding the liquid to the absorbent areas. In addition, the one or more reinforcement zones may be configured to assist in creating a tub-shaped swim diaper, especially in the crotch region, which results in an improved fit of the swim diaper in wet conditions.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to a further embodiment the one or more reinforcement zones comprise a discontinuous attachment at a plurality of locations at a distance of each other, the discontinuous attachment having a width of at least 1 mm, preferably at least 2 mm, more preferably at least 3 mm, and most preferably at least 4 mm Preferably the width direction corresponds with the transverse direction of the absorbent core.<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0020">Depending on the technique used for creating the one or more reinforcement zones either continuous or discontinuous attachments may be preferred.

It may be semi-rigid, non-elastic and can be made fully or partially elasticized and include backing.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0170">The topsheet which is located above the top core wrap sheet <b>110</b>, is preferably soft, exhibits good strikethroughs and has a reduced tendency to rewet from the liquid absorbent material. The topsheet may be semi-rigid and non-elastic, or may be fully or partially elasticized. The topsheet is intended to be placed in close proximity to the skin of the wearer when swim diaper <b>100</b> is worn. The topsheet permits bodily exudates to rapidly penetrate it so as to flow more quickly toward absorbent core <b>130</b> via a top surface thereof, preferably not allowing such bodily exudates to flow back through the topsheet. The topsheet may be constructed from any one of a wide range of liquid and vapor permeable, preferably hydrophilic, materials. The upper and lower surface of topsheet may be treated differently. The topsheet may include e.g. a surfactant on the upper surface so as to facilitate liquid transfer there through, especially at a central zone or area of the topsheet located over absorbent core <b>130</b>, and/or a hydrophobic agent on the lower surface to minimize the liquid contained within absorbent core <b>130</b> from contact wetting topsheet thereby reducing rewet values. The topsheet may be coated with a substance having rash preventing or rash reducing properties. Preferably, topsheet covers substantially the entire wearer facing area of diaper <b>100</b>, including substantially all of the front waist region, back waist region, and crotch region CR. Optionally, side panels <b>210</b>, <b>210</b>&#x2032; and/or waist feature layers of the inner region may be formed from the same single topsheet material. Alternatively, the topsheet may be formed from multiple different materials which vary across the topsheet. Such a multiple piece design allows for creation of preferred properties in different zones of the topsheet.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0171">Absorbent core <b>130</b> comprises fluff material, typically cellulosic fluff pulp, and is substantially free from superabsorbent polymers. Absorbent core <b>130</b> may be configured to extend over substantially the full length and/or width of swim diaper <b>100</b>. However, as in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref>, preferably absorbent structure <b>130</b> is not coextensive with the entire swim diaper <b>100</b> and is limited to certain regions of swim diaper <b>100</b> including crotch region CR. In various embodiments, the absorbent core <b>130</b> extends to the edges of swim diaper <b>100</b> but the fluff material is concentrated in the crotch region CR or another target zone of the diaper <b>100</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref>, absorbent core <b>130</b> is shown as having a substantially rectangular configuration, however, absorbent core <b>130</b> may be shaped differently, such as, elliptical, dogbane shaped, T-shaped or I-shaped. More in particular the width of the front portion may be larger than the width of the rear portion of the absorbent core <b>130</b>, or vice versa. Reference is for example made to the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>, wherein the front portion of the absorbent core is wider than the rear portion. For embodiments where the absorbent core has different widths along its length, the wording &#x201c;width of the absorbent core&#x201d; preferably refers to a maximum width of the absorbent core. However, in other embodiments with a variable width, it may also refer to the average width of the absorbent core along its length.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0172">Swim diaper <b>100</b> may also utilize a pair of containment walls or cuffs <b>230</b>. Each cuff <b>230</b> is a longitudinally extending wall structure preferably positioned on each side of absorbent core <b>130</b> and spaced laterally from the transverse center line TL. Preferably, cuffs <b>230</b> are attached, for example, by adhesive or sonic bonding to the lower structure. Preferably, cuffs <b>230</b> are equipped with elastic members. When released or otherwise allowed relaxing, the elastic members retract inwardly. When swim diaper <b>100</b> is worn, the elastic members function to contract cuffs <b>230</b> about the buttocks and the thighs of the wearer in a manner, which forms a seal between swim diaper <b>100</b>, the buttocks and the thighs.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0173">The front and rear waist regions each comprise a central region and a pair of side panels or ears <b>210</b> which typically comprise the outer lateral portions of the waist regions. These side panels <b>210</b> may be unitary with the chassis or may be attached or joined thereto by any means know in the art. Preferably, the side panels <b>210</b> positioned in the back waist region are flexible, extensible and/or elastic in at least the lateral direction. In another embodiment the side panels <b>210</b> are non-elastic, semi-rigid, rigid and/or stiff. In order to keep swim diaper <b>100</b> in place about the wearer, preferably at least a portion of the back waist region is attached by fastening or securing members to at least a portion of the front waist region. The fastening or securing members may be e.g. adhesive, mechanical fasteners, hook and loop features, conceivable strings and/or combinations thereof. The fastening or securing members may also be co-adhesive such that they adhere to each other but not other materials. Preferably the materials making up the fastening or securing members are flexible, extensible and/or elastic, allowing them to better conform to the shape and movements of the body and thus, to reduce the likelihood that the fastening system will irritate or injure the wearer's skin. Alternatively, the swim diaper may be configured as a pant or the like. In this configuration, the swim diaper may or may not have fastening members.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0174">Swim diaper <b>100</b> may also employ additional layers, such as an acquisition layer and/or dispersion layer situated between topsheet and absorbent core <b>130</b>, and/or coverstock layers, and/or other layers situated between absorbent core <b>130</b> and backsheet. An acquisition layer and/or dispersion layer serves to slow down the flow so that the liquid has adequate time to be absorbed by absorbent core <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0175">Swim diaper <b>100</b> may also include such other features, components and elements as are known in the art including waistbands, waist cap features, elastics and the like to provide better fit, containment and aesthetic characteristics. These features may be assembled in a variety of well-known configurations and are well known in the art.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0176">The elongated reinforcement zone <b>145</b> of swim diaper <b>100</b> extends from the crotch region CR in the direction of both the front and rear transverse edge <b>133</b>, <b>134</b>. The reinforcement zone <b>145</b> extends over substantially the entire length of the second zone Z<b>2</b> and third zone Z<b>3</b>, along a longitudinal center line LL. In this manner it is guaranteed that a maximum free transverse distance, i.e. a transverse distance along which the absorbent core does not comprise a reinforcement zone, in the second zone Z<b>2</b> and third zone Z<b>3</b> is smaller than 50% of the width of the absorbent core. In other words, the reinforcement zone is arranged such that for any area in the second and third zone having a width of 50% of a width of the absorbent core and a length of 40% of a length of the absorbent core, the reinforcement zone is at least partially located in the respective area. In the event of a variable with of the absorbent core, the width may correspond with the maximum width. To further illustrate this, an area A having the above described dimensions (the drawing is not to scale) is schematically drawn in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, for example in a position such that the area A partially overlaps the second and third zone. For any position of the area A within the second and/or third zone, the reinforcement zone <b>145</b> will be at least partially located within the area A. In other embodiments, more than one reinforcement zone may be at least partially present within the area A with the above described dimensions. Consequently, according to further embodiments the one or more reinforcement zones are arranged such that for any area A in the second and/or third zone having a width of 50%, 45%, 40%, 35% or 30% of the width of the absorbent core and a length of 40%, 35%, 30%, 25% or 20% of the length of the absorbent core, at least one reinforcement zone is at least partially located in the respective area A. In other words, the dimensions of the area A are representative for a &#x201c;density&#x201d; of reinforcement zones, i.e. if the dimensions of the area A correspond with the smaller percentages of the abovementioned ranges, this is indicative of a relatively high density of reinforcement zones in the second and/or third zone. On the other hand, if the dimensions of the area A correspond with the larger percentages of the abovementioned ranges, this is indicative of a relatively low density of reinforcement zones in the second and/or third zone. A higher density of reinforcement zones may result in an even higher wet integrity of the absorbent core as compared to a lower density of reinforcement zones. However, it should be noted that the density of reinforcement zones cannot be endlessly increased as this might deteriorate the absorbent and/or containment functionality of the swim diaper.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0177">The reinforcement zone <b>145</b> comprises a substantially continuous attachment having a width of at least 1 mm, preferably at least 2 mm, more preferably at least 3 mm, and most preferably at least 4 mm.
