More particularly, the invention relates to compositions and methods for chemical mechanical polishing of transition metals such as molybdenum, tungsten, cobalt, copper, and ruthenium surfaces.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Microelectronic device wafers are used to form integrated circuits. The microelectronic device wafer includes a substrate, such as silicon, into which regions are patterned for deposition of different materials having insulative, conductive or semi-conductive properties. In order to obtain the correct patterning, excess material used in forming the layers on the substrate must be removed. Further, to fabricate functional and reliable circuitry, it is often important to prepare a flat or planar microelectronic wafer surface prior to subsequent processing. Thus, it is necessary to planarize and/or polish certain surfaces of a microelectronic device wafer. Additionally, for optical devices, it may be necessary to smooth the surfaces for optical transmission or to remove sub-surface damage.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Chemical Mechanical Polishing or Planarization (&#x201c;CMP&#x201d;) is a process in which material is removed from a surface of a microelectronic device wafer, and the surface is planarized and polished by coupling a physical process such as abrasion with a chemical process such as oxidation or chelation. In its most rudimentary form, CMP involves applying slurry, e.g., a solution of an abrasive and an active chemistry, to a polishing pad that buffs the surface of a microelectronic device wafer to achieve the removal, planarization, and polishing processes. It is not typically desirable for the removal or polishing process to be comprised of purely physical or purely chemical action, but rather the synergistic combination of both in order to achieve fast, uniform removal. In the fabrication of integrated circuits, the CMP slurry should also be able to preferentially remove films that comprise complex layers of metals and other materials so that highly planar surfaces can be produced for subsequent photolithography, patterning, etching, and thin-film processing. In conventional CMP operations, a substrate carrier or polishing head is mounted on a carrier assembly and positioned in contact with a polishing pad in a CMP apparatus. The carrier assembly provides a controllable pressure to the substrate pressing the substrate against the polishing pad. The pad is then moved relative to the substrate.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Molybdenum metal is used in microelectronic devices for interconnects, photo masks, etc. Generally, the molybdenum is present on the device in an excess amount, which then requires the excess to be removed by polishing or lapping. Molybdenum polishing generally presents low removal rates when using silica abrasive compositions. When oxidizers such as hydrogen peroxide are used, high corrosion rates are often encountered.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Ruthenium is under consideration for replacement of Ta/TaN as barrier materials for copper interconnects, as lower electrode material in metal-insulator-metal capacitors, and as next generation liners and conducting metals. Ruthenium can be polished using abrasives in conjunction with oxidizing agents; unfortunately, certain of these compositions pose safety and toxicity concerns due to reaction products of such a polishing process. Additionally, ruthenium polishing is often accompanied by low removal rates and high etching rates using conventional (colloidal) silica and iodate (i.e., oxidizer) chemistry. Additionally, such methodology presents severe pad staining, especially at neutral to alkaline pH conditions, along with poor reproducibility. In this regard, pad staining is believed to be due to by-products formed as a result of oxidation of ruthenium, potentially generating insoluble species which ultimately may cause undesirable scratching of the ruthenium surface.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, a need exists for new and improved compositions and methods for the polishing of molybdenum and ruthenium which are not encumbered with these difficulties.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In summary, the invention provides compositions useful in the polishing of transition metal-containing surfaces typically found on microelectronic devices.

Such coated titania generally have an average diameter of about 50 to about 250 nm, about 100 to about 250 nm, about 50 nm to about 150 nm, or about 20 nm to about 50 nm. The coating of these titania particles with amorphous silica or alumina can be accomplished by known methodology. See for example, &#x201c;Dense silica coating of titania nanoparticles by seeded polymerization technique&#x201d;, Ahmed Mohamed El-Toni, Shu Yin, and Tsugio Sato, <i>Colloids and Surfaces A</i>: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects, Volume 274, Issues 1-3, 15 Feb. 2006, pages 229-233. The coating of titania with alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) can be accomplished by deposition in a gas phase by: hydrolysis or decomposition of volatile substances; addition of oxides, hydroxides or substances that can be absorbed onto the surface during pigment grinding, which results in partial coating of the pigment surface; or precipitation of the coating from aqueous solution onto the suspended TiO2 particles.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0025">In one embodiment, the titania abrasive particles are in the rutile form. In general, component b. above, i.e., the coated titania particles, are comprised primarily of titanium dioxide (along with the alumina or amorphous silica coating); however, minor amounts of dopants or materials which are other than titanium dioxide may be present within the titania abrasive particles, such as about 5% by weight, or less, about 2% by weight, or less, or about 1% or less.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0026">As noted above, the compositions of the invention comprise at least one organic corrosion inhibitor. Essentially, these organic corrosion inhibitors fall into the general class of surfactants. As used herein, the term &#x201c;surfactant&#x201d; refers to an organic compound that lowers the surface tension (or interfacial tension) between two liquids or between a liquid and a solid, typically an organic amphiphilic compound that contains a hydrophobic group (e.g., a hydrocarbon (e.g., alkyl) &#x201c;tail&#x201d;) and a hydrophilic group. In one embodiment, these surfactants or metal corrosion inhibitors are cationic surfactants. Cationic surfactants are essentially surface-active molecules which possess at least one positively-charged moiety. In one embodiment, the cationic surfactant is chosen from C<sub>6</sub>-C<sub>18 </sub>ammonium halides. The &#x201c;C<sub>6</sub>-C<sub>18</sub>&#x201d; modifier refers the number of carbon atoms in the surfactant and may include aliphatic and aromatic moieties. In another embodiment, the cationic surfactant is chosen from C<sub>12</sub>-C<sub>18 </sub>ammonium halides.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0027">Exemplary cationic surfactants (corrosion inhibitors) include, but are not limited to, cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) (also known as hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide), hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium chloride (CTAC), heptadecanefluorooctane sulfonic acid, tetraethylammonium halides, stearyl trimethylammonium chloride, 4-(4-diethylaminophenylazo)-1-(4-nitrobenzyl)pyridium bromide, cetylpyridinium chloride monohydrate, benzalkonium chloride, benzalkonium bromide, benzethonium chloride benzyldimethyldodecylammonium chloride, benzyldimethylhexadecylammonium chloride, hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride, dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride, didodecyldimethylammonium bromide, di(hydrogenated tallow)dimethylammonium chloride, tetraheptylammonium bromide, tetrakis(decyl)ammonium bromide, and oxyphenonium bromide, dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride, dimethyldihexadecylammonium bromide, and di(hydrogenated tallow)dimethylammonium chloride. In one embodiment, the corrosion inhibitor/surfactant is chosen from benzalkonium chloride and benzalkonium bromide.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0028">These corrosion inhibitors/surfactants are typically present in amounts of about 0.0001 to about 5 percent, by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, and as found to be necessary by empirical observation.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0029">In the compositions of the invention, the relative amount of coated titania particles can be adjusted as desired, based on the total weight of the composition, for the polishing of a particular transition metal surface. In some embodiments, the coated titania particles are present in an amount of about 0.001 to about 5 weight percent, or about 0.1 to about 1 weight percent, based on the total weight of the composition. Any suitable amount of the abrasive can be present in the polishing composition, depending on both the surface being polished as well as other conditions utilized. In some embodiments, the abrasive is present in the polishing composition at a concentration of about 0.0005 wt. % or more, e.g., about 0.001 wt. % or more, about 0.0025 wt. % or more, about 0.005 wt. % or more, about 0.01 wt. % or more, about 0.025 wt. % or more, or about 0.05 wt. % or more. More typically, the abrasive is present in the polishing composition at a concentration of about 0.001 wt. % or more, e.g., about 0.0025 wt. % or more, about 0.005 wt. % or more, about 0.01 wt. % or more, about 0.025 wt. % or more, or about 0.05 wt. % or more. Alternatively, or in addition, the abrasive is present in the polishing composition at a concentration of about 30 wt. % or less, e.g., about 20 wt. % or less, about 10 wt. % or less, about 5 wt. % or less, about 1 wt. % or less, about 0.5 wt. % or less, about 0.1 wt. % or less, or about 0.05 wt. % or less. More typically, the abrasive is present in the polishing composition at a concentration of about 1 wt. % or less, e.g., about 0.5 wt. % or less, about 0.1 wt. % or less, or about 0.05 wt. % or less. Thus, the abrasive can be present in the polishing composition within a range bounded by any two of the aforementioned endpoints. For example, the abrasive can be present in the polishing composition at a concentration of about 0.0005 wt. % to about 10 wt. %, e.g., about 0.001 wt. % to about 10 wt. %, about 0.001 wt. % to about 1 wt. %, about 0.001 wt. % to about 0.5 wt. %, about 0.001 wt. % to about 0.1 wt. %, about 0.001 wt. % to about 0.05 wt. %, about 0.005 wt. % to about 10 wt. %, about 0.005 wt. % to about 1 wt. %, about 0.005 wt. % to about 0.5 wt. %, about 0.005 wt. % to about 0.1 wt. %, about 0.005 wt. % to about 0.05 wt. %, about 0.01 wt. % to about 10 wt. %, about 0.01 wt. % to about 1 wt. %, about 0.01 wt. % to about 0.5 wt. %, about 0.01 wt. % to about 0.1 wt. %, about 0.01 wt. % to about 0.05 wt. %, about 0.05 wt. % to about 10 wt. %, about 0.05 wt. % to about 1 wt. %, about 0.05 wt. % to about 0.5 wt. %, about 0.05 wt. % to about 0.1 wt. %, or about 0.05 wt. % to about 0.05 wt. %. In certain embodiments, the abrasive is present in the polishing composition at a concentration of about 0.001 wt. % to about 1 wt. %.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0030">In another embodiment, the compositions of the invention further comprise at least one oxidizing agent.

In certain embodiments, the polishing composition is free of an oxidizing agent (i.e., below the level of detection).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0037">The polishing process can be performed at a temperature of from about 15&#xb0; C. to about 100&#xb0; C. Higher temperatures are expected to increase the polishing rate of molybdenum or ruthenium. In one embodiment, the temperature range is about 25&#xb0; C. to about 65&#xb0; C. One way to reach a higher temperature is to preheat the slurry before being supplied to the CMP apparatus.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0038">Regarding the polishing pad, any type of polymer-based polishing pad can generally be used. Examples of polishing pads are based on polyurethane pads and suede pads. The pad thickness can vary from 0.1 mm to 25 mm. The hardness of the suede pads can vary from Asker C hardness of 5 to Asker Hardness of 95. The compressibility of the suede pad can be from 0.1% to 40%. The pore size of the suede poromeric pads can vary from 2 microns to 100 microns with the size in the range of 20 to 60 microns in one embodiment. The poromeric pad layer can have a backing pad layer of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), or foam or non-woven material with thickness between 30 microns to 25 mms.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0039">Besides poromeric pads, polyurethane pads can also be used.

Water is added to make the composition 100 weight percent. Additionally, CMP experiments were run using the procedures and experimental conditions given below. The data presented in the examples below was generated by polishing 1.75&#x2033;&#xd7;1.75&#x2033; coupons cut out of blanket Molybdenum wafers. The thickness of the molybdenum films as measured using a profilometer was 5000 &#x212b;. This thickness was confirmed using a 4-point resistivity probe after receipt.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0060">Various abrasives were investigated including colloidal silica, which is considered to be a conventional abrasive for the polishing of Molybdenum surfaces. The slurries at the point of use (PoU) were prepared by diluting the slurries of higher solids loading. The appropriate weight of original slurry was mixed with deionized water (DIW) to achieve the desired solids loading. For example, 10.6 g of silica slurry with original solids loading of 47 weight percent was stirred in 89.4 g DIW such that final particle content of 5 weight percent was achieved. Operating pH varied as per the study as mentioned in the examples below. Aqueous solutions of nitric acid and potassium hydroxide were used as pH modifiers.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0061">The CMP tool used to conduct the polishing runs was Automet 250 supplied by Buehler with the platen size of 12&#x2033;. The rotational speed was set at 150 RPM for the base and 30 RPM for the head. A peristaltic slurry dosing pump was set to dispense the polishing slurry at 30 ml/min throughout the study. A Cabot D100 pad with concentric grooves was employed for all the runs except where the effect of pad variation was tested on the removal rate. Polishing duration was set for 60 seconds. The pad temperature, wherever mentioned was measured during the polishing using the IR thermometer.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0062">The change in the film thickness due to polishing was determined measuring the film thickness before and after polishing using the 4-point resistivity probe. The non-uniformity in the polishing observed from the varied values of the film thickness for a polished sample was due to non-uniform pressure distribution from the Buehler polisher. To account for this non-uniformity, the removal rates were determined based on the weight of the film lost during the polishing.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example 1 (Samples A-F)</heading><p id="p-0049" num="0063">The Mo coupons were polished using slurries A through F at an operating pH of 1.5 and down-pressure of 4 psi. Two different classes of abrasives were utilized, namely silica and titania. All the abrasives are sourced from different suppliers. These were the &#x2018;abrasives alone&#x2019; slurries; meaning that no oxidizing chemistry was introduced to these formulations. A down pressure of 4 psi was used throughout these runs. The solids loading for each slurry and the corresponding removal rate are set forth in Table 1. As it is apparent from the values in the table, titania-based slurries yielded highest removal rates among all the polishing runs within this group. A higher rate for slurry E containing titania particles of APS of 410 nm can be attributed to its larger particle size. However, the comparable rate observed by polishing in presence of slurry F and G containing titania particle of APS 200 nm was a surprise. This higher removal rate is attributed to the surface modification of the titania particle in these slurries. The novelty of this surface modification comes from the inorganic coating with surface doped transition metal oxide. This surface functionalization imparts catalytic activity to the titania particles which act as heterogeneous catalytic centers when in contact with the Mo surface. This behavior mimics the CMP effect when the Mo surface is polishing using slurries containing these particles. The effect is significant enough to maintain the removal rates even lower solids loadings as low as 1%.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Removal rate data for abrasives alone slurries at operating pH of 1.5</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Average</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Particle </entry><entry>Solids</entry><entry>Removal</entry></row><row><entry>Slurry</entry><entry/><entry/><entry>Size</entry><entry>Loading </entry><entry>Rate</entry></row><row><entry>Formulation</entry><entry>Slurry</entry><entry>Abrasive</entry><entry>(nm)</entry><entry>(%)</entry><entry>(&#x212b;/minute)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="28pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="28pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Abrasive,</entry><entry>A</entry><entry>Silica</entry><entry>135</entry><entry>5</entry><entry>110</entry></row><row><entry>DIW, pH</entry><entry/><entry>(Nalco2320,</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Modifier</entry><entry/><entry>Nalco)</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>B</entry><entry>Silica (PL-3,</entry><entry>75</entry><entry>23</entry><entry>256</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Fuso)</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>C</entry><entry>Silica</entry><entry>40</entry><entry>27</entry><entry>192</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>(Nalco13573,</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Nalco)</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>D</entry><entry>Silica (PL-3,</entry><entry>35</entry><entry>20</entry><entry>130</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Fuso)</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>E</entry><entry>Uncoated</entry><entry>410</entry><entry>5</entry><entry>946</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Titania</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>(R900,</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Chemours)</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>F</entry><entry>Alumina-</entry><entry>200</entry><entry>5</entry><entry>943</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Coated</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Titania</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>G</entry><entry>Alumina-</entry><entry>200</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>872</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Coated</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Titania</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example 2</heading><p id="p-0051" num="0064">The Mo coupons were further polished using the &#x2018;abrasive alone&#x2019; slurry containing the unique coated titania particles described in the Example 1, this time as a function of the operating pH.
