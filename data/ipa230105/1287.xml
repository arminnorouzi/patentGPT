These games use a standard deck of 52 playing cards and the playing cards are distributed from a shooter with a plurality of decks (6 to 9 or 10 decks) shuffled in advance to a game table. Because an operator (hereinafter, referred to as a &#x201c;dealer&#x201d;) of the casino distributes the playing cards to the game table to be used in such games, results (winners or winning hands) of the games are determined by arrangement of the cards of the plurality of decks from the shooter. For these purposes, when the packages of the plurality of decks shuffled are used in the casinos, playing cards of a predetermined number of decks are shuffled in random order (arrangement), are individually packed as one package, and are used.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A shortage or replacement of cards should not occur in the casinos. The reason is that, if a person with an unjust purpose reads the arrangement of the cards in the package and returns the package or replaces the cards with cards with known arrangement, the arrangement of the cards distributed by the dealer is known when the read package is used, so that the person can predict a result of a game. To ensure a fair game by preventing the shortage or replacement of the packages of the shuffled playing cards in the casinos, the casinos manage the packages of the shuffled playing cards to properly play the game on the table (that is, the casinos perform the management such that there is no replacement of the packages of the shuffled playing cards or other accidental or unjust actions). The management of the packages of shuffled playing cards is known and is disclosed in International Application Publication No. WO 2015/019619</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides a management method or system for monitoring packages of shuffled playing cards in a casino, in which the packages of the shuffled playing cards in the casino is managed centering around a game table, so that missing (temporary missing) or shortage of the packages of the shuffled playing cards in the casino can be managed and replacement can be prevented. This management is important. The reason is that, in the case in which the package of the shuffled playing cards on the table is lost in the casino once, even if the package is found again later, someone may know or record the arrangement of the cards in the package during missing. For example, if someone previously reads arrangement of some cards or an entire package of cards or replaces the package while the package is carried to the game table, someone may win a game in the table on which the replaced or read package is carried.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To prevent the above problems, management needs to be performed to prevent occurrence of missing or replacement of the package of the playing cards used for the game in the casino or mixing of an unknown package, until an operator (dealer) takes out the package after the package is carried to the game table.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To resolve the problems according to the related art, a management system according to the present invention is a system for managing packages of shuffled playing cards, the management system including: packages of shuffled playing cards in which playing cards configuring a predetermined number of decks are shuffled in random order and are packed individually as one package and to which unique ID codes are attached; a game table on which a game is played using the shuffled playing cards; a card shooter device which is arranged on the game table, receives the shuffled playing cards in the packages, enables the shuffled playing cards to be manually fed one by one on the game table, and reads at least ranks of the playing cards; a storage box which is installed on the game table, stores the plurality of packages, and includes an opening/closing cover which allows the packages to be taken out one by one; one or more ID code readers which read ID codes of all of the packages stored in the storage box as ID codes of packages before use; a registration device of an ID code which registers ID codes of the packages being taken out or having been taken out from the storage box, as taken out (scheduled to be used for the game, in use, or used) packages; and a management control device which includes a memory storing ID codes of the plurality of packages brought into the storage box and constructing a database and reads the ID codes of the plurality of packages brought into the storage box at predetermined time intervals, confirms existence of each ID code registered in the database in the storage box, and manages the ID codes of the packages before the use and ID codes of the taken out packages.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the system for managing the packages according to the present invention, the following specific forms may be included. That is, the management control device further has a time stamping device which stores confirmation time of the existence of each ID code in the storage box and the management control device is configured to be programmed to examine the packages with respect to at least one of: 1) the time stamping device further stores time when the ID codes are registered as the ID codes of the taken out packages in the registration device and whether or not the time from when the package does not exist in the storage box to when the ID codes are registered as the ID codes of the taken out packages in the registration device exceeds a predetermined time; 2) whether or not the ID codes registered as the ID codes of the taken out packages in the registration device exist in the database of the ID codes brought into the storage box; 3) whether or not the packages exist in the storage box during a predetermined period or more; and 4) whether or not the ID codes has been registered as the ID codes of the taken out packages in the past.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Furthermore, the management system includes at least one of: 1) a device reading the ID codes of the packages of the shuffled playing cards arranged on the game table and scheduled to be set in the card shooter device or being set in the card shooter device; and 2) a device connected to a card discard device receiving the shuffled playing cards used for a game and acquiring ID codes of used packages to be discarded as the registration device of the ID codes of the taken out packages. Furthermore, the management control device has a database in which ID codes of contained packages can be searched from a container ID, a pallet ID, or a carton ID holding the packages, and the ID codes of the taken out packages can be acquired from the container ID, the pallet ID, or the carton ID.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the management system according to the present invention, at least one of the following items of (1) to (4) is recorded and managed in the database in association with the ID codes of the packages of the shuffled playing cards: (1) a game table to be used; (2) a dealer (a person who draws a card) who is in charge of the game table to be used; (3) expected time of each package of the shuffled playing cards to be used in the game table; and (4) information on the storage box to which each package of the shuffled playing card is delivered.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Furthermore, the management control device is included in a game table management device arranged on the game table and the game table management device is connected directly or indirectly to the card shooter device on the game table. In addition, the card shooter device can read at least the ranks of the shuffled playing cards manually fed one by one on the game table. Furthermore, the card shooter device can count a sheet number of the shuffled playing cards manually fed one by one on the game table. The card discard device receiving the shuffled playing cards used for the game can read at least the ranks of the shuffled playing cards used for the game, receive information from the card shooter device, and determine whether or not information of the shuffled playing cards manually fed one by one on the game table and information read by the card discard device are matched.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">To resolve the problems according to the related art, a method for managing packages according to the present invention is a method for managing packages of shuffled playing cards, in which playing cards configuring a predetermined number of decks are shuffled in random order and are packed individually as a set of shuffled playing cards and ID codes are attached to packages of the set, the management method including: a step of storing the packages in a storage box which is installed on the game table, stores the plurality of packages, and includes an opening/closing cover which allows the packages to be taken out one by one; a step of reading ID codes of the plurality of packages brought into the storage box by an ID code reader and constructing a database; a registration step of registering ID codes of the packages of the playing cards used for the game on the game table as taken out packages; and a step of reading the ID codes of the plurality of packages brought into the storage box at predetermined time intervals, confirming existence of each ID code registered in the database in the storage box, and comparing and managing the ID codes of the taken out packages registered by the registration step and the ID codes registered in the database.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The method for managing the packages of the shuffled playing cards according to the present invention may have the following forms additionally. That is, the comparison and management step specifies ID codes of packages of which existence is not confirmed in the storage box, stores time when the existence is not confirmed in the storage box, together with the ID codes of the packages of which the existence is not confirmed, and manages whether or not the time from when the existence is not confirmed to when the ID codes are registered as the ID codes of the taken out packages by the registration device exceeds a predetermined time. Furthermore, the registration step is a step of using a database in which ID codes of all packages contained in a carton containing the packages can be searched from a carton ID attached to the carton, reading the carton ID of the used carton to specify the ID codes of the packages contained in the carton, and registering the ID codes of all of the packages contained in the carton as the ID codes of the taken out packages. The management method further includes a feeding card reading step of reading at least ranks of the shuffled playing cards when the shuffled playing cards are manually fed one by one on the game table by the card shooter device; a discard card reading step of reading at least the ranks of the shuffled playing cards used for a game by the card discard device; and a determination step of determining whether or not information of the shuffled playing cards obtained by the feeding card reading step and information of the shuffled playing cards obtained by the discard card reading step are matched.

random order to be used in a table game of a casino according to the embodiment of the present invention is used in the casino. In this embodiment, shuffled playing cards <b>1</b><i>s </i>are packed as a package <b>2</b>. However, the package <b>2</b> is unpacked such that the shuffled playing cards is can be used for a game on a table and is set in a card shooter device S. During the game, a dealer D draws cards <b>1</b> from the card shooter device S and distributes the cards <b>1</b> to the game table. Cards of each shuffled playing card is composed of a predetermined number of decks (normally, 6, 8, 9, or 10 decks) are manufactured to be randomly shuffled and become individually unique random arrangement and are packed with an ID code <b>4</b> given to the package <b>2</b> as a bar code <b>3</b> which can be individually identified by a bar code reader R. An RFID (or an RF tag) may be attached as the ID code <b>4</b> instead of or together with the bar code <b>3</b>. A management control device <b>7</b> in a casino <b>6</b> is used to manage whether or not there is a lost package. While the package <b>2</b> is lost or missing, someone may mix or replace cards of the package <b>2</b> with cards previously arranged in constant arrangement to control or win the game on the table. To resolve the above problems, the management control device <b>7</b> in this application manages the package <b>2</b> of the shuffled playing cards is. The management control device <b>7</b> is realized by a computer device (as a management control device having the following functions) and functions of a method and a process are realized by installing a program executed by a computer processor in a computer.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The package <b>2</b> to which the individual ID code <b>4</b> (bar code <b>3</b>) is attached is packed in a carton CA in units of 18 and is carried to at least one game table <b>11</b> for use in game play. A management/storage box <b>10</b> is installed on the game table <b>11</b> and has a structure in which a plurality (in this embodiment, 18) of packages <b>2</b> are stored and the packages <b>2</b> can be taken out one by one. The card shooter device S is arranged on the game table <b>11</b> and the shuffled playing cards <b>1</b><i>s </i>in the package <b>2</b> can be received and can be manually fed one by one on the game table <b>11</b> by the dealer D. The card shooter device S can read at least the ranks of the fed playing cards <b>1</b><i>s</i>. One or more ID code readers (<b>10</b>R) that read the ID codes of all of the packages <b>2</b> stored in the management/storage box <b>10</b> as ID codes <b>4</b> of packages before use are arranged in the management/storage box <b>10</b> (it is described in detail later).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A registration device <b>70</b> that registers the ID code <b>4</b> of the package <b>2</b> taken out from the management/storage box <b>10</b> as the taken out (scheduled to be used for the game or used for the game (including in use)) package <b>2</b> is connected to the card shooter device S. A bar code reader R is connected to the registration device <b>70</b> of the ID codes, the ID code <b>4</b> of the package <b>2</b> taken out from the management/storage box <b>10</b> is read as the taken out package <b>2</b>, and the registration device <b>70</b> registers the ID code as the ID code <b>4</b> of the taken out package <b>2</b> and sends registration information (ID code <b>4</b> or the like) to the management control device <b>7</b>.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the card discard device <b>100</b> used in the management system of the table game according to the present invention is installed below the game table <b>11</b> or is arranged beside the game table <b>11</b>. The game table <b>11</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is illustrated by a simplified diagram and is used for a normal baccarat game. As well known, in the baccarat game, the game is played by a player and a banker. The card shooter device S is provided in the game table <b>11</b>. The card shooter device S is a supply source of the cards <b>1</b> and the cards <b>1</b> fed from the card shooter device S are distributed to the player. After the game ends, the cards <b>1</b> are discarded by the card discard device <b>100</b>. The card discard device <b>100</b> is a card discard device that discards the cards <b>1</b> stored in the card shooter device S arranged on the game table <b>11</b> and manually distributed by the dealer on the game table <b>11</b>, after use in the game. The card discard device <b>100</b> discards sets (normally, 6, 8, or 12 decks) of the cards <b>1</b> configuring the plurality of decks stored in the card shooter device S and collected cards <b>1</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">A cut card <b>1</b><i>c </i>is inserted into a set is of the cards <b>1</b> before the set is of the cards <b>1</b> are set in the card shooter device S of the game table <b>11</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>). The cut card <b>1</b><i>c </i>is inserted into the latter half (the remainder is about &#xbc; or &#x2155;) of the set <b>1</b><i>s </i>of the cards <b>1</b> when the set <b>1</b><i>s </i>of the cards <b>1</b> is used for the game and prevents the player from counting the ranks of the individual cards distributed during the game to predict the ranks of the remaining few cards. Therefore, the cut card <b>1</b><i>c </i>is used to end the game of the game table <b>11</b> with about 20 to 40 cards <b>1</b> left in the card shooter device S (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>10</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Next, the structure of the card discard device <b>100</b> will be described in detail using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. The card discard device <b>100</b> has a structure in which the cards <b>1</b><i>a </i>used for each game and collected are sequentially received and all cards <b>1</b><i>r </i>left in the card shooter device S without being used can be received at predetermined timing (when the game is stopped after a next game or 2 to 3 games end from drawing of the cut card <b>1</b><i>c</i>) after the cut card <b>1</b><i>c </i>is discharged from the card shooter device S. The card discard device <b>100</b> counts a total sum of the sheet number of cards <b>1</b><i>a </i>after being used for each game and the number of cards <b>1</b><i>r </i>left in the card shooter device S without being used after the cut card <b>1</b><i>c </i>is discharged from the card shooter device S and determines whether or not all of the discarded cards are aligned by the sheet number corresponding to the predetermined number of decks, by a deck inspection mechanism <b>113</b> to be described later. A sheet number counter (not illustrated in the drawings) is provided in the card shooter device S and/or the management control device <b>7</b> or is provided to be connected to the card shooter device S and/or the management control device <b>7</b> by wire or wireless and the sheet number counter is configured to count the sheet number of shuffled playing cards fed from the card shooter device S to the game table. As described later, information of the ranks and the suits of the shuffled playing cards <b>1</b> fed from the card shooter device S to the game table is read by the card shooter device S and is transmitted to the game table management device <b>80</b> and/or the management control device <b>7</b> connected to the card shooter device S by wire or wireless.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The cards <b>1</b> used for the game are inserted into a discharge port <b>101</b> of the card discard device <b>100</b> and are discarded. The card discard device <b>100</b> has a configuration including a discard card reception base <b>102</b> to receive the cards <b>1</b><i>a </i>to be discarded from the discharge port <b>101</b>, a discard card information acquisition mechanism <b>106</b> to acquire information of numbers (ranks) and types (suits) from the cards <b>1</b><i>a </i>inserted into the discharge port <b>101</b>, a group information acquisition mechanism <b>107</b> to acquire group information (information for specifying a casino in which the card is used) from the cards <b>1</b><i>a </i>to be discarded, a sheet number counter <b>108</b> of the cards functioning as a sheet number measurement mechanism to count the sheet number of cards <b>1</b><i>a </i>inserted into the discharge port <b>101</b> and discarded, an authenticity determination mechanism <b>109</b> to compare the group information of the cards obtained from the group information acquisition mechanism <b>107</b> with predetermined group information and determine whether or not the group information of the cards is matched with the predetermined group information, and an output mechanism <b>110</b> to output a determination result of the determination mechanism. The card discard device <b>100</b> includes the deck inspection mechanism <b>113</b> to integrate the information obtained from the discard card information acquisition mechanism <b>106</b> and the information of the sheet number counter <b>108</b> to measure the sheet number of cards at least every number (rank) of the cards <b>1</b> and determine whether or not the number of cards <b>1</b> inserted into the discharge port <b>101</b> is aligned by the predetermined sheet number. The card discard device <b>100</b> includes a control device <b>114</b> to control a whole operation and the individual mechanisms are arranged in the control device <b>114</b> to control individual operations. The control device <b>114</b> is composed of an electronic circuit including a microcomputer and a memory and has a normal computer configuration such as a CPU, a ROM, and a RAM. The control device <b>114</b> executes a program stored in a memory other than the ROM, thereby controlling the entire device and performing necessary processing.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Further, the card discard device <b>100</b> will be described in detail. After use in the game, the cards <b>1</b> are inserted into the discharge port <b>101</b> and are discarded. A weight <b>156</b> is arranged on the discard card reception base <b>102</b> to receive the cards <b>1</b> to be discarded. The weight <b>156</b> is provided to help the cards <b>1</b> to be pressed against the discard card reception base <b>102</b> to feed the cards <b>1</b> to a feeding roller <b>115</b> surely, even when the cards <b>1</b> to be discarded are bent during the game, and is configured to press downward the front and rear of the cards <b>1</b> by weight rollers <b>157</b> and <b>158</b>. The weight <b>156</b> receives the cards <b>1</b> in the discharge port <b>101</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>. However, the weight <b>156</b> has a structure capable of moving upward such that the cards <b>1</b> are received even in a bundle state.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The feeding roller <b>115</b> is provided below the discard card reception base <b>102</b> to feed the discarded cards <b>1</b> manually loaded on the discard card reception base <b>102</b> one by one. The feeding roller <b>115</b> is rotationally driven by a drive motor <b>116</b>. The drive motor <b>116</b> uses a stepping motor. When the cards <b>1</b> are loaded on the discard card reception base <b>102</b>, a card sensor <b>117</b> detects this, the control device <b>114</b> controls the drive motor <b>116</b>, and the feeding roller <b>115</b> rotates. In this way, the cards <b>1</b> on the discard card reception base <b>102</b> are fed by the feeding roller <b>115</b>. Further, the cards <b>1</b> fed from the feeding roller <b>115</b> are delivered to a temporary storage stocker <b>119</b><i>f </i>(arrow D<b>1</b>) by a pair of delivery rollers <b>118</b><i>a</i>. A drive speed is set such that the delivery roller <b>118</b><i>a </i>is driven and controlled by a delivery motor <b>116</b><i>a </i>and delivers the cards <b>1</b> at a speed faster than the speed of the cards <b>1</b> delivered from the feeding roller <b>115</b>. For this reason, the cards <b>1</b> are drawn by the delivery roller <b>118</b> and are surely delivered to the temporary storage stocker <b>119</b><i>f </i>(arrow D<b>1</b>). The delivered cards <b>1</b> pass through a group information acquisition sensor <b>120</b> and two card information acquisition sensors <b>121</b> in the middle of delivering. Here, information of the cards <b>1</b> is detected and acquired.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The group information acquisition sensor <b>120</b> is connected to the group information acquisition mechanism <b>107</b> to acquire group information from the cards <b>1</b>. In addition, the card information acquisition sensor <b>121</b> is connected to the discard card information acquisition mechanism <b>106</b> to acquire information of the number (rank) from the card <b>1</b> and the information of the number (rank) is acquired. The card <b>1</b> delivered to the temporary storage stocker <b>119</b><i>f </i>is detected by the sheet number counter <b>108</b> connected to the card sensor <b>117</b> and the sheet number of cards <b>1</b> passing therethrough is counted. The signal of the group information acquisition sensor <b>120</b> is transmitted to the group information acquisition mechanism <b>107</b>, the group information of the cards <b>1</b> obtained by the group information acquisition mechanism <b>107</b> is compared with the predetermined group information stored in advance by the authenticity determination mechanism <b>109</b>, and it is determined whether or not the group information of the cards <b>1</b> is matched with the predetermined group information. When the group information of the cards <b>1</b> is not matched with the predetermined group information, the authenticity determination mechanism <b>109</b> determines that the cards are fake cards and the control device <b>114</b> turns on a display lamp <b>122</b> through the output mechanism <b>110</b> outputting a determination result and transmits existence of the fake cards to the management department <b>14</b> of the casino via a communication line <b>114</b>L.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">When the card <b>1</b> is delivered to the temporary storage stocker <b>119</b><i>f</i>, information is acquired by the group information acquisition sensor <b>120</b> and the card information acquisition sensor <b>121</b>, and a void hole or a slit to prevent the card <b>1</b> from being used in the future is formed in the card <b>1</b> by a void mechanism (not illustrated in the drawings). For this reason, the card <b>1</b> delivered to the temporary storage stocker <b>119</b><i>f </i>passes through the void mechanism. When it is determined by the authenticity determination mechanism <b>109</b> that the card <b>1</b> is a fake card, information thereof is transmitted to the void mechanism by the control device <b>114</b> and a special void hole or slit (both are not illustrated in the drawings) indicating that the card <b>1</b> is defective is formed. The card <b>1</b> determined by the authenticity determination mechanism <b>109</b> is delivered to the temporary storage stocker <b>119</b><i>f </i>through a gap. The card <b>1</b> delivered to the temporary storage stocker <b>119</b><i>f </i>is configured to be drawn by opening and closing a cover <b>119</b><i>fo </i>(not illustrated in the drawings) provided in an upper part of the temporary storage stocker <b>119</b><i>f</i>. As a result, for example, even when a reading result is an error, it is possible to open the cover <b>119</b><i>fo </i>and draw and confirm an actual card.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The void mechanism forms the void hole or slit in the card <b>1</b> by a punching mechanism (punch and die). A discard card <b>1</b><i>h </i>provided with the void hole is temporarily stored in the temporary storage stocker <b>119</b><i>f</i>. In the configuration of this embodiment, the void hole is formed by the void mechanism. However, a notch may be provided at a corner of the card <b>1</b>, a void mark may be given by a known stamp or a printing mechanism using a laser, or a slit may be formed in the card. As a result, a void hole or a void mark is provided in the card such that the card cannot be reused after discarding processing and checking, thereby completely preventing unjust reuse of the card. This timing is not limited and may be timing before and after reading the card or the same timing as the reading.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The delivered card <b>1</b><i>h </i>is temporarily stored in the temporary storage stocker <b>119</b><i>f</i>. In addition, a communication part <b>114</b>C of the control device <b>114</b> is configured to receive the numbers (ranks) or the suits of shuffled playing cards <b>1</b> fed from the card shooter device S to the game table and information or group information on the sheet number from the card shooter device S and/or the game table management device <b>80</b> and/or the management control device <b>7</b> connected to the card shooter device S by wire or wirelessly. In addition, it is determined by the deck inspection mechanism <b>113</b> of the control device <b>114</b> whether or not the information of the shuffled playing cards <b>1</b> received by the communication part <b>114</b>C and the numbers (ranks) or the suits of shuffled playing cards <b>1</b> acquired in the middle of delivering and the information or the group information on the sheet number are matched. When the information is matched, a delivery roller <b>118</b><i>b </i>is driven and controlled by a delivery motor <b>116</b><i>b </i>and the card <b>1</b><i>h </i>temporarily stored in the temporary storage stocker <b>119</b><i>f </i>is delivered in a direction (arrow D<b>2</b>) of a discard card stocker <b>119</b>. A temporary storage step preferably progresses the game while being executed for each baccarat game (it is possible to proceed to a next game after executing processing until the dealer D places the cards <b>1</b><i>a </i>for one game on the discharge port <b>101</b> and the cards <b>1</b><i>a </i>are dropped into the discard card stocker <b>119</b>, whenever one game ends). Temporary storage interval can be freely set in the control device <b>114</b>. Further, an external input device (not illustrated in the drawings) can be used as timing at which the card <b>1</b><i>a </i>is delivered from the discharge port <b>101</b> to the temporary storage stocker <b>119</b><i>f </i>and timing at which the card <b>1</b><i>h </i>is delivered from the temporary storage stocker <b>119</b><i>f </i>to the discard card stocker <b>119</b>. For example, setting can be performed such that the cards <b>1</b> are dropped into the discard card stocker <b>119</b> by pressing a button.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Next, the deck inspection mechanism <b>113</b> will be described in detail. Cards of a plurality of decks (4, 6, or 8 decks) are normally set in the card shooter device S (electronic shoe) loaded on the game table <b>11</b>. The set <b>1</b><i>s </i>of cards is provided in a state (package <b>2</b>) in which the shuffled cards of the plurality of decks are packed and a different bar code <b>3</b> is provided in each package <b>2</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). ID information specifying the individual set is of cards is read from the bar code <b>3</b> by the bar code reader R arranged on the game table <b>11</b> and the set is of the cards used for the game is specified from the ID information. In addition, the set is of the cards is set in the card shooter device S and is provided for each game. The set is of the cards set in the card shooter device S is not used entirely. At the beginning of all games, the cut card (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>.<b>1</b><i>c</i></figref>) is inserted into the set <b>1</b><i>s </i>of cards of the plurality of decks (4, 6, or 8 decks) for game security. If the cut card <b>1</b><i>c </i>appears, the remaining cards <b>1</b><i>r </i>in the card shooter device S are not used anymore. All of the remaining cards <b>1</b><i>r </i>are inserted into the discharge port <b>101</b> for discarding.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">All of the remaining cards <b>1</b><i>r </i>are inserted into the discharge port <b>101</b> for discarding and information of the numbers (ranks) is acquired from the remaining cards <b>1</b><i>r </i>by the discard card information acquisition mechanism <b>106</b>. The deck inspection mechanism <b>113</b> integrates a combination of the information of the numbers (ranks) obtained from the remaining cards <b>1</b><i>r </i>by the discard card information acquisition mechanism <b>106</b> and the information of at least the number (rank) obtained from each card <b>1</b><i>a </i>already used for each game and the information of the sheet number counter <b>108</b> of the cards functioning as the sheet number measurement mechanism, measures the sheet number of cards every number (rank) of the cards, and determines whether or not the cards are aligned by the sheet number corresponding to the predetermined deck number every number (rank) for all of the cards loaded on the game table and inserted into the discharge port <b>101</b> (416 sheets from Ace to King (example: 4 types&#xd7;8 decks)).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The total sheet number of cards <b>1</b> used in the table game is determined in advance in the casino (normally, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 decks). For example, in the case of 8 decks, eight sheets of cards of the same suit and the same rank are used in the cards <b>1</b> of 416 sheets of 52 sheets&#xd7;8 decks. In the deck inspection mechanism <b>113</b>, it is determined whether or not the cards are aligned by each sheet number by the control device <b>114</b>, the display lamp <b>122</b> is turned on with a different color according to a result by the output mechanism <b>110</b> outputting the result, and a counting result of the cards <b>1</b> is transmitted to the management department <b>14</b> of the casino by the communication mechanism <b>114</b>L as the same time. In this way, it is confirmed by the deck inspection mechanism <b>113</b> that the 416 sheets of cards are aligned.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">If use of the sets (for example, 8 decks) of cards <b>1</b><i>h </i>entering the card shooter device S ends, all of the sets of cards are stored in the discard card stocker <b>119</b> as described above. Then, the bar code <b>3</b> attached to the package <b>2</b> containing the set <b>1</b><i>s </i>of the cards can be separated to specify the set is of the cards entering the discard card stocker <b>119</b> and can be inserted into the discard card stocker <b>119</b> (the discard card stocker <b>119</b> can be configured such that a cover <b>1190</b> of an upper part of the discard card stocker <b>119</b> can be opened and closed and the bar code <b>3</b> can be inserted. Before use of the cards <b>1</b> of the card shooter device S ends and use of a package <b>2</b> included in a new carton CA starts or before the used cards <b>1</b><i>a </i>are first inserted into the card discard device <b>100</b>, the bar code <b>3</b> is preferably inserted). In this case, not only the bar code <b>3</b> but also the package <b>2</b> may be inserted into the discard card stocker <b>119</b>. If the package <b>2</b> and the bar code <b>3</b> are inserted into the same discard card stocker <b>119</b>, there is no waste around the table of the casino and there is an advantage in arrangement. The package <b>2</b> and the bar code <b>3</b> enter the discard card stocker <b>119</b> through a slit (not illustrated in the drawings) formed in the cover <b>1190</b> for drawing. The cover <b>1190</b> for the drawing may have a structure in which the cover is opened upward by unlocking and the package <b>2</b> and the bar code <b>3</b> may enter the discard card stocker <b>119</b> through the slit (not illustrated in the drawings). In this way, use of the sets (for example, 8 decks) of cards entering the card shooter device S ends, all of the sets of cards are stored in the discard card stocker <b>119</b>, and the bar code <b>3</b> used to specify the set is of the cards also enters the same discard card stocker <b>119</b>. Instead of inserting the bar code <b>3</b>, the bar code <b>3</b> may be read by the bar code reader R provided on the back side of a door <b>161</b> of a cabinet for discard.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">All of the sets (for example, 8 decks) of the cards entering the card shooter device S are stored in the discard card stocker <b>119</b> and the bar code <b>3</b> enters the discard card stocker <b>119</b>. As a result, all of the sets (for example, 8 decks) of the cards including the discard cards <b>1</b><i>h </i>and the bar code <b>3</b> are deposited on a cover <b>162</b> of a top surface of the cabinet <b>161</b> for the discard (to be described later) below the card discard device <b>100</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>). The discard card stocker <b>119</b> is sized to be able to sequentially receive the discard cards <b>1</b><i>h </i>distributed from the card shooter device S, used for the game, and collected. When the game is stopped at predetermined timing, all of the cards <b>1</b><i>r </i>remaining in the card shooter device S and the bar code <b>3</b> can enter the discard card stocker <b>119</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">When it is confirmed that the 416 sheets of cards are aligned by the deck inspection mechanism <b>113</b> of the card discard device <b>100</b>, the dealer D opens the cover <b>162</b> of the top surface of the cabinet <b>161</b> for the discard (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>), so that all of the sets (for example, 8 decks) of cards including the discard cards <b>1</b><i>h </i>and the bar code <b>3</b> are moved (dropped) to the inside through a hole <b>163</b><i>o </i>formed in an upper part of a discard card box <b>163</b><i>a </i>arranged in the cabinet <b>161</b> for the discard. The cover <b>162</b> of the top surface may be opened and closed by controlling an electric cylinder by a control device included in the cabinet <b>161</b> for the discard. As timing at which the dealer D opens the cover <b>162</b> of the top surface of the cabinet <b>161</b> for the discard, an external input device (not illustrated in the drawings) can be used.

In the card <b>1</b>, codes <b>170</b> in which the number of the card <b>1</b> is encoded and which are composed of marks MC normally invisible are provided on an upper side and a lower side of the card <b>1</b> in point symmetry. The code <b>170</b> is composed of a combination of the number and the arrangement of a plurality of marks MC printed with infrared reaction ink or ultraviolet reaction ink invisible under daylight. In addition, the card <b>1</b> is provided with group code information <b>171</b> used as an authenticity determination code arranged by printing in a state (for example, ultraviolet reaction ink) in which information representing authenticity of the card is encoded and is normally invisible. The code <b>170</b> and the group code information <b>171</b> are arranged in at least two places of the card <b>1</b> and are arranged at point symmetry positions with respect to the center of the card <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The codes <b>170</b> are read by the two card information acquisition sensors <b>121</b> configuring the card information acquisition sensor <b>121</b>. The card information acquisition sensor <b>121</b> is configured to output an output signal when the marks MC are detected (a known ultraviolet reaction light sensor is used). A relation of outputs of ON signals of the two UV sensors (outputs of electric signals when the codes <b>170</b> composed of the marks MC are read) and the marks MC is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. A predetermined combination of the marks MC can be specified on the basis of a comparison result of relative changes in the outputs of the ON signals of the two UV sensors for the codes <b>170</b> composed of the marks MC. As a result, in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, if four types as combinations of marks MC of upper and lower two rows are printed in four rows, 256 types of codes can be configured by the fourth power of the fourth types. 52 types of cards of playing cards are allocated to any one of 256 types of codes, this is stored in a memory or a program as a comparison table, and the discard card information acquisition mechanism <b>106</b> can specify at least the numbers (ranks) of cards <b>1</b> from a predetermined comparison table (not illustrated in the drawings) by specifying the individual codes <b>170</b>. Preferably, the codes <b>170</b> are printed with paint visualized by receiving ultraviolet light and are printed at positions not overlapping a type notation <b>172</b> and an index <b>173</b> of the card <b>1</b>. In addition, a blank part is provided between the code <b>170</b> and the group code information <b>171</b> and the end of the card <b>1</b>. In addition, the group code information <b>171</b> may be printed together with the ink representing the group code information in the code <b>170</b> at the same place. The code <b>170</b> composed of the marks MC indicating the cut card <b>1</b>C can be printed in the cut card <b>1</b>C and the cut card <b>1</b>C can be specified in the same way.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Next, the authenticity determination mechanism <b>109</b> to determine the authenticity of the card <b>1</b> from the information on the authenticity of the card <b>1</b> will be described.

The group code information <b>171</b> is made of a substance or a material (for example, ink or paint) emitting light of a spectrum of a different wavelength for light of a different wavelength as a code. The authenticity determination mechanism <b>109</b> includes a function of emitting light of a different wavelength to be invisible to the group code information <b>171</b> by the group information acquisition sensor <b>120</b>, receiving light at two or more different wavelengths of light emitted from the group code information <b>171</b>, determining whether or not a ratio of strengths of the light is the same by the authenticity determination mechanism <b>109</b>, and performing authenticity determination of the card <b>1</b>. Light of two or more wavelengths to be more complicated may be analyzed by receiving the light of the different wavelength spectrums.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">When the group code information <b>171</b> is read, the group information acquisition sensor <b>120</b> emits two kinds of ultraviolet rays to radiate the ultraviolet rays to the group code information <b>171</b> printed on the card <b>1</b> and light of different wavelength spectrums emitted from the group code information <b>171</b> Is received by the group information acquisition sensor <b>120</b>. The control device <b>114</b> including the authenticity determination mechanism <b>109</b> is composed of an electronic circuit including a microcomputer and a memory, has a normal computer configuration such as a CPU, a ROM, and a RAM, and executes processing for determining the authenticity of the group code information <b>171</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Finally, contents to be managed by the management control device <b>7</b> will be described.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">1) All of the ID codes <b>4</b> of the packages <b>2</b> carried to the back yard <b>8</b> are registered in the database DB (stored in the memory M of the database DB connected to the management control device <b>7</b>).
