Transceivers conventionally comprise an emitting portion and a receiving portion. The emitting portion particularly comprises a light source emitting a light beam and a first optical device configured to ensure the optical coupling of the light beam in a first optical fiber. The receiving portion particularly comprises a second optical device configured to ensure the coupling of a beam received by a second optical fiber on a photodetector. In the aeronautical field in particular, these transceivers, using two optical fibers, have certain drawbacks, particularly in terms of costs, size, installation and management of the associated maintenance.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to overcome these drawbacks, one solution involves coupling the light beams emitted and received respectively by the light source and the photodetector in one and the same optical fiber. An optical device shared by the light source and the photodetector makes it possible to couple and separate the light beams emitted and those received circulating in the optical fiber.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There are many solutions for producing such a shared optical device. It is possible particularly to use a semi-reflective plate provided with a dichroic filter. However, the optimal optical coupling is not guaranteed, the light source and the photodetector being at a distance from the end of the optical fiber and the light beams emitted or received pass through many optical components (lenses, filter, etc.). In addition, the implementation of this solution involves, in order to hold in position the various optical components, many mechanical parts that must be machined with a high precision. On the other hand, the transceiver obtained is voluminous.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is possible to replace the semi-reflective plate with an optical coupler, an optical circulator or also a wavelength multiplexer/demultiplexer. The transceivers obtained however remain voluminous. The integration of a large number of such transceivers into a reduced environment is therefore not possible.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECT AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The aim of the present invention is to remedy the aforementioned drawbacks.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">To this end, it is proposed by the present invention an optical emitter-receiver module that makes it possible to separate the light beams emitted and those received.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The optical emitter-receiver module comprises a first light source, a first photodetector and a multimode glass optical fiber. The first light source is configured to emit a first emitted beam at a first wavelength. The optical fiber comprises a core, an optical cladding, an optical axis, and has:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0011">a first end surface, inclined at an angle of 45&#xb0; with respect to the optical axis of the optical fiber, comprising a mirror,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0012">a first notch, extending from an outer surface of the optical cladding to the core of the optical fiber, and having a first face comprising a first dichroic filter configured to reflect a light beam of wavelength equal to a second wavelength, different from the first wavelength, called first received beam.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0012" num="0013">The first light source is arranged relative to the mirror such that the first emitted beam emitted by said first light source passes through the optical cladding, is reflected by the mirror and is transmitted in the optical fiber.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0014">The first photodetector and the first face of the first notch are positioned relative to one another such that the first received beam reflected by the first dichroic filter passes through the optical cladding and is directed towards the first photodetector.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0015">The optical emitter-receiver module according to the invention advantageously only comprises a light source, a photodetector and an optical fiber on the one hand to couple a light beam, called first emitted beam, from the first light source in the optical fiber and on the other hand to couple a light beam, called first received beam, coming from said fiber on the first photodetector.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0016">Instead of using external optical components to perform the couplings of the various light beams, first emitted beam and first received beam, the optical fiber itself is used.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0017">This particularly simple configuration thus does not require additional optical components, the geometrical configuration ensuring the transmission and the reception of the first emitted beam and of the first received beam.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0018">The optical fiber is advantageously positioned as close as possible to the optical components that are the first light source and the first photodetector and to guarantee an efficient optical coupling.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0019">Such a configuration makes it possible to produce an optical emitter-receiver module according to the invention of small volume and at low cost. The integration of a large number of these optical emitter-receiver modules into reduced environments is possible.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0020">According to particular implementations, the optical emitter-receiver module according to the invention further meets the following features, implemented alone or in each of the technically operating combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0021">In preferred embodiments of the invention, the optical fiber comprises a second notch, extending from an outer surface of the optical cladding to the core of the optical fiber, and having a first face comprising a second dichroic filter configured to reflect a light beam at a third wavelength, different from the first wavelength and from the second wavelength.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0022">In examples of embodiments, the optical emitter-receiver module comprises a second light source configured to emit a light beam at a third wavelength, called second emitted beam. The second light source and the first face of the second notch are positioned relative to one another such that the second emitted beam emitted by the second light source passes through the optical cladding, is reflected by the second dichroic filter and is transmitted in the optical fiber.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0023">Preferably, the first light source, the first photodetector and the second light source are disposed in a same plane. Such an arrangement makes it possible to further reduce the size of the optical emitter-receiver module.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0024">In other examples of embodiments, the optical emitter-receiver module comprises a second photodetector configured to detect a light beam at a third wavelength, the second photodetector and the first face of the second notch are positioned relative to one another such that the light beam at the third wavelength reflected by the second dichroic filter passes through the optical cladding and is directed towards the second photodetector.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0025">Preferably, the first light source, the first photodetector and the second photodetector are disposed in a same plane. Such an arrangement makes it possible to further reduce the size of the optical emitter-receiver module.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0026">In alternative embodiments, the optical fiber may have a cut separating it into two adjacent sections, one of the faces opposite the cut comprising a dichroic filter configured to reflect a light beam at a predefined wavelength. This cut may replace one of the notches described above.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0027">In embodiments, the first notch or the second notch, or the cut is produced by micro-machining the optical fiber.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0028">The optical fiber used being a multimode optical fiber, its core is wide enough to make it possible to perform micro-machining there.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0029">The micro-machining of the optical fiber may be performed, for example with the aid of a pulse power laser.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0030">The invention will be better understood upon reading the following description, given by way of non-limiting example, and made in reference to the figures that show:</p><p id="p-0030" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic representation, in sectional view, of an optical transceiver according to a first example of embodiment of the invention,</p><p id="p-0031" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic representation, in sectional view, of an optical transceiver according to an alternative embodiment of the invention,</p><p id="p-0032" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic representation, in sectional view, of an optical transceiver according to another alternative embodiment of the invention,</p><p id="p-0033" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic representation, in sectional view, of an optical transceiver according to another alternative embodiment of the invention,</p><p id="p-0034" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic representation, in sectional view, of an optical transceiver according to another alternative embodiment of the invention,</p><p id="p-0035" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic representation, in sectional view, of an optical transceiver according to another alternative embodiment of the invention</p><p id="p-0036" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic representation, in sectional view, of an optical transceiver according to another alternative embodiment of the invention, and</p><p id="p-0037" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a schematic representation, in sectional view, of an optical transceiver according to another alternative embodiment of the invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0038" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates in a very schematic manner, and in sectional view, a first example of an optical emitter-receiver module according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0040">In the remainder of the description, an optical emitter-receiver module will be named optical transceiver <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0041">The optical transceiver <b>100</b> comprises an optical fiber <b>10</b>, a first light source <b>20</b> and a first photodetector <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a longitudinal sectional view of a portion of the optical fiber <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0043">The optical fiber <b>10</b> comprises, conventionally, a core <b>11</b> and an optical cladding <b>12</b>.
