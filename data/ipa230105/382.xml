In particular this disclosure relates to methods and devices for detecting and analyzing energy fields emitted by organisms.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">All live organisms emit energy biofields in the form of waves, which are characterized by the organic processes that produce or modify them. There is a significant difficulty in detecting, measuring, and describing the energy in these biofields, inhibiting human understanding of biological interactions with the environment. Energy waves emanating from a live organism are often referred to as torsion waves and are analogous to electromagnetic waves. Plasma arrays placed next to the skin of an organism can induce torsion waves emanating from a body to be converted to electromagnetic waves, which can be more directly measured and analyzed using millimeter-wave electronics.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Plasma is an ionized state of matter known for its cleaning, decontaminating, sterilizing, antimicrobial and healing properties when applied to an inanimate surface or to tissue. Plasma can be created when energy is applied to a substance. As energy input is increased, the state of matter changes from solid, to liquid, to a gaseous state. If additional energy is fed into the gaseous state, the atoms or molecules in the gas will ionize and change into the energy rich plasma state, or the fourth fundamental state of matter.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are two types of plasma, thermal and non-thermal, which is also known as cold plasma. Thermal plasmas are in thermal equilibrium, i.e., the electrons and the heavy particles are at the same temperature. Current technologies create thermal plasma by heating gas or subjecting the gas to a strong electromagnetic field applied with a generator. As energy is applied with heat or electromagnetic field, the number of electrons can either decrease or increase, creating positively or negatively charged particles called ions. Thermal plasma can be produced by plasma torches or in high-pressure discharges. If thermal plasma is used in treating a material or surface sensitive to heat, it can cause significant thermal desiccation, burning, scarring and other damage.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to mitigate such damage, methods and devices have been created for applying non-thermal plasma to heat-sensitive materials and surfaces. Whereas in thermal plasmas the heavy particles and electrons are in thermal equilibrium with each other, in non-thermal plasmas the ions and neutrals are at a much lower temperature (sometimes as low as room temperature) than the electrons. Non-thermal plasma usually can operate at less than 104&#xb0; F. at the point of contact. Thus, non-thermal plasmas are not likely to damage human tissue. Recent research has shown that non-thermal plasmas may have a number of beneficial medical effects, such as the treatment of localized infections, though the underlying mechanism of non-thermal plasma therapy is not fully understood. The beneficial health effects of non-thermal plasma applications in living organisms are often attributed to reactive oxygen or nitrogen species.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An unexplained repulsive force that is occasionally observed during non-thermal plasma treatment of infections may point the way to an efficient mechanism for characterizing biofield energy. Ambient pressure air plasma in non-thermal equilibrium creates localized areas where a population of atoms or molecules are induced to a higher state of excitability, known as population inversion, causing spontaneous emission at magnetic dipole rotational resonance lines. For O<sub>2</sub>, many of these lines occur in the 60 GHz frequency range.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Extremely high-frequency (EHF) therapy is the practice of using low-intensity electromagnetic radiation in the millimeter band for the treatment of internal disorders, such as various types of cancer and tumors. Recently a possible link between the fine resonance frequencies of oxygen in the 60 GHz region and the therapeutic frequencies used in non-thermal EHF therapy has been investigated. This link could be characteristic of biological torsion fields and provide additional insight regarding the therapeutic mechanisms of plasma medicine.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present device utilizes a system for detecting and measuring millimeter-wave output from a plasma array for biological torsion field characterization.

The electric, magnetic, and gravitational components are orthogonal to each other. In an electromagnetic wave, the gravitational and temporal components have a static value, and the electric and magnetic components dynamically vary with an inverse relationship. In this context, a static temporal component equates to time moving forward at a constant rate. In contrast, biofield energy emitted as waves is theorized to contain static electric and magnetic components and dynamic temporal and gravitational components. Such a wave is essentially a longitudinal or compression wave in the space-time fabric, but is often referred to as a torsion wave. Time and gravitation components of a torsion wave serve as analogous counterparts to the electric and magnetic components of a transverse electromagnetic wave. Biofield energy is thought to be involved in the regulation of biochemical, cellular, and neurological processes that arise from electromagnetic and quantum field activity.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Extremely high frequency (EHF) electromagnetic waves, with frequencies in the 30-300 GHz range, are referred to as millimeter-waves due to the size of their wavelengths. This frequency band is commonly used across a range of research and technology applications including radio astronomy, telecommunications, security scanners at airports, and even weapon systems. Millimeter waves have also been used in biology and medicine, often known as EHF therapy, for the treatment of a number of diseases. In these therapies, electromagnetic radiation of low power but extremely high frequency is applied to bodily areas. Power levels range from 1 pW/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 10 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, and biological effects are weakly related to power level. Applying EHF electromagnetic waves to the body have been observed to modulate immune response, reduce local pain, or even have positive effects on the treatment of cancer. Some common therapeutic frequencies are 53.6 GHz and 61.2 GHz. These correspond to some of the fine resonance frequencies of oxygen, which are centered around 60 GHz at atmospheric pressure. Typically, a cavity-stabilized Gunn or impact ionization avalanche transition-time diode (IMPATT) oscillator is used as a signal source in EHF therapy, such the frequency may be modulated over a 10 MHz bandwidth to ensure the source frequency sweeps over therapeutic frequency range.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Another area of research that is gaining attention is plasma medicine. Plasmas are a fourth state of matter that are created when energy is applied to a substance. They are typically formed when a gas is subjected to high stresses that create a mixture of neutral atoms, positively charged atomic and molecular ions, and freed electrons. There are two types of plasma, thermal and non-thermal, the latter of which is also known as cold plasma. Thermal plasmas are in thermal equilibrium, i.e. the electrons and the heavy particles are at the same temperature. Current technologies create thermal plasma by heating gas or subjecting the gas to a strong electromagnetic field applied with a generator. As energy is applied with heat or electromagnetic field, the number of electrons can either decrease or increase, creating positively or negatively charged particles called ions. Thermal plasma can be produced by plasma torches or in high-pressure discharges, and is not appropriate for treating material sensitive to heat because it can cause significant thermal desiccation, burning, scarring and other damage.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Non-thermal plasmas occur when the electrons are in much more energetic state than the neutral or positively charged particles. The application of non-thermal plasma in medicine has recently been a fruitful field of research. Numerous published papers have noted biological effects based on the modulation frequency of non-thermal air plasma. The beneficial health effects of non-thermal plasma applications in living organisms are often attributed to reactive oxygen or nitrogen species. Closer investigation of the health effects imparted by an array of micro-plasmas placed near the skin shows energetic effects that are not explained by conventional science.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">One application of plasma therapies utilizes an array of non-thermal air plasma plumes. An example of such an array is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>. The example array <b>100</b> comprises a substrate <b>102</b> having at least two opposing surfaces, referred to herein sometimes as a top and bottom for convenience. A plurality of through-holes <b>118</b> are made in the substrate <b>102</b>. A plurality of drive electrodes <b>110</b> are placed on the top of the substrate <b>102</b>, with each drive electrode <b>110</b> centered over one through-hole <b>118</b> in the substrate <b>102</b>. A plurality of ground electrodes <b>108</b> is placed on the bottom of the substrate <b>102</b>, with each ground electrode <b>108</b> centered over one through-hole <b>118</b> in the substrate <b>102</b>. The resulting structure of a through-hole <b>118</b>, a ground electrode <b>108</b>, and a drive electrode <b>110</b> comprises a plasma emitter <b>107</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">To create non-thermal plasma, a potential gradient is applied between two electrodes (e.g., the ground electrode <b>108</b> and the drive electrode <b>110</b> of a plasma emitter <b>107</b>); one electrode (the high voltage electrode, e.g., the drive electrode <b>110</b>) may be subjected to an electric current, while the other electrode is electrically grounded. Typically, the electrodes are in an environment of a fluid such as helium, nitrogen, heliox, argon, or air. When the potential gradient between the high voltage electrode and grounded electrode is large enough, the fluid between the electrodes ionizes and becomes conductive. The ionization of the gas mixture creates sharply non-uniform electric fields around the electrodes. The ionized gas mixture also becomes chemically active. These plasma generation characteristics can be shown by the example array <b>100</b>. Within each plasma emitter <b>107</b>, a dielectric tube is formed, between two disk-shaped electrodes <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> of about the same diameter and separated by a small gap, by the through-hole <b>118</b> in the dielectric substrate <b>102</b>. An AC waveform drives a high voltage potential between the two electrodes <b>108</b>,<b>110</b> and a gas mixture, such as helium and oxygen, is flowed through the through-holes <b>118</b>. When the potential gradient is large enough, the gas mixture within each dielectric tube is ionized and becomes conductive, igniting plasma in the gap between the electrodes <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>. A plasma plume is discharged from one end of the dielectric tube (e.g., through an aperture of an electrode <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>) and into the surrounding room air. When plasma arrays are operated at atmospheric pressures in air, oxygen and nitrogen molecules are split into single atoms which recombine to form ozone and nitric oxide. The polar nature of oxygen molecule causes a large number of hyperfine resonant frequencies during this process, particularly in the 60 GHz range.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Each cycle of the driving AC waveform initiates a plasma discharge with a velocity that is inversely proportional to its size. At high enough velocities, such as in micro-plasmas, it can induce relativistic effects and create a localized non-homogeneous magnetic field pulse. An array of micro-plasma plumes, such as from an array of plasma emitters <b>107</b>, provides a large number of mutually coupled pulses which collapse non-linear magnetic fields and separate atoms with higher excitation energy states. This creates localized areas of population inversion.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">These areas of high excitation energy due to population inversion create a mechanism for spontaneous emission at the resonance frequencies of oxygen in the 60 GHz range. Spontaneous emission describes when an atom or molecule transitions from an excited energy state to a lower energy state and emits a photon. When an incoming photon of a specific frequency interacts with an electron in an excited energy state, that electron will drop to a lower energy level and transfer its energy to the surrounding electromagnetic field. This creates an additional photon with a phase, frequency, and direction of travel identical to the first photon in a process called stimulated emission. Stimulated emission is the mechanism underlying laser and maser technology.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">A previously unexplained repulsive force that is occasionally observed during non-thermal plasma treatment living organisms may point the way to an efficient mechanism for detecting biofield energy. Interactions between torsion waves and the electromagnetic components introduced by plasma and its generation create unique effects that can be used to characterize the biofield. Typically, antennae are used to send and receive information through electromagnetic signals, but torsion waves that comprise the biofield cannot be detected in this manner. This is because, while transverse electromagnetic waves comprise electric and magnetic components that vary within a constant time flow and a constant gravitational force, torsion waves consist of varying temporal and gravitational components that serve as counterparts to the electric and magnetic components of the transverse electromagnetic wave. The comparison of transverse electromagnetic waves and torsion waves is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. As depicted, the electrical component of a transverse electromagnetic wave is analogous to the temporal component of the torsion wave; the magnetic component is analogous to the gravitational component. Small static electric and magnetic components have been detected in torsional waves due to slight non-linearities that may arise in the transport medium, though this leaves a large amount of information in the dynamic components that remains undetected.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The current device detects low-level microwave signals resulting from the unique results of interaction between a biofield and plasma array. Though the torsion waves of a biofield cannot be detected by antennae, they can be detected by an electron avalanche such as occurs in plasma. A side effect of the biofield is a periodic variation in time-rate density, introducing a jitter wherein time speeds up and slows down around a nominal value. In the biofield, this is typically seen at frequencies in the EHF range and higher, such as the resonant frequencies of oxygen. As atoms within a localized area of an electrically conductive plasma are ionized, they collide with and ionize other atoms in a chain reaction known as an electron avalanche. The high potential gradient between two electrodes within the plasma array pulls positively and negatively charged particles (protons and electrons, respectively) of the fluid medium in opposite directions. Electrons, having much less mass than a proton, are accelerated to much higher velocities and may inelastically collide with and ionize other neutral atoms, releasing additional free electrons. Free electrons can be easily captured by neutral molecules rather quickly, however. The ionization and electron avalanche process during plasma generation process occurs in a nanosecond timescale. A change in the time-rate density caused by the biofield will influence electron velocity and hence, momentum during an electron avalanche. Any change in electron momentum will manifest as a change in current during an impact ionization process, since the probability of electron multiplication in a given electron collision will change. This interactive process enables the electron avalanche to be used to detect biofield torsion waves.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Modulation of the electromagnetic signal in this timescale produces a radio carrier signal, as well as side bands of broadband noise from spontaneous emission of particles. When subjected to a plasma array, biological specimens will generate a number of modulated carriers at frequencies centered around the hyperfine resonance frequency of oxygen. Carrier signal could be susceptible to the Zeeman effect, which has been observed in astrophysical masers. The Zeeman effect is observed when a spectral line is split into several components in a static magnetic field. The carrier signals may be modulated by a combination of earth's magnetic field and the associated magnetic fields produced by the non-thermal plasma array interacting with torsional waves. The modulation may impart a circular polarization to the radio waves, a phenomenon in which the electric field of a transverse wave maintains a constant magnitude, but the direction rotates in a right or left circular direction in the plane perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. Furthermore, interaction between any time varying components of the biofield and the plasma may generate additional carrier signals.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Electromagnetic energy and biofield torsion waves interact when a plasma array is placed near a biological specimen, resulting in microwave energy corresponding to the frequency of time rate variation with the biofield signal. The current disclosure provides a system and method for detecting these microwaves using electron avalanche and circular polarization effects. A microwave antenna, such as a microwave horn or another suitable antenna for receiving and concentrating microwave electromagnetic signals, is placed in the vicinity of the interface between the plasma array and a surface of the biological specimen, which may be a skin surface, a wound, or any other component of the biological specimen. While the array is generating plasma, and optionally also before and after the plasma generation, the horn captures the microwave energy and focuses the microwave energy while delivering it to a custom microwave module with electronic polarization switching. The polarized signal is then passed to a high gain low noise amplifier and harmonic mixer, before being digitized and transferred to a PC. Spectral analysis techniques are then used to analyze the signals. The signals are then characterized by noise temperature versus frequency, comparing signal and noise levels at different points relative to plasma onset and polarization setting. The entire RF bandwidth may be analyzed at the same time, utilizing a number of electronic and computer based hardware to efficiently characterize the carrier signals.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A block diagram of an example embodiment is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. A horn <b>401</b> acts as a receiver for carrier signals emanating from an interface space between a plasma array <b>413</b> and a biological specimen. This horn <b>401</b> may be configured to receive signals across a large range of frequencies, particularly the EHF bands with millimeter wavelengths. The horn <b>401</b> transmits signals to linear-to-circular switchable polarizer <b>403</b> allowing the polarization to be studied. Biofield torsion waves have a spin characteristic that may impart left-hand or right-hand circular polarization in the microwave radiation emitted by the plasma by measuring and comparing signal levels as the microwave polarizer is switched between left-hand and right-hand circular. A switchable circular polarizer may be selectively changed between right- and left-handed circular or linear polarizations. In some embodiments polarization switching may be manually controlled, though a person skilled in the arts would recognize this could be controlled electronically as well. Measuring and comparing the signal levels as the circular polarizer is switched between modes may be used to detect biofield and microwave interactions. A circular to linear polarization waveguide transition <b>404</b> produces a signal that can be read by a programmable frequency converter, <b>405</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A block diagram of an example embodiment of a programmable frequency converter, such as the frequency converter <b>405</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Signals enter the programmable frequency converter through receiver waveguide module <b>501</b>. In an example embodiment, receiver module <b>501</b> is a Silicon Germanium (SiGe) receiver configured for millimeter-wave spectrum allocations. Receiver module <b>501</b> utilizes a low noise amplifier to increase the power of carrier waves arising from the interaction of the plasma array and biological specimen, as well as filter any unwanted image frequencies produced by the signal processing. Local oscillator (LO) frequency synthesizer <b>509</b> and associated frequency divider <b>510</b> generate a reference clock <b>510</b> within the receiver and are used to modulate the frequency of the carrier waves in a heterodyning process, yielding a signal with a lower frequency. A signal from a LO mixes with the carrier waves to yield an intermediate frequency (IF) and a splitting of the waveform into orthogonal I and Q components to allow image rejection using a low IF frequency. The outputs are typically referred to as &#x201c;I&#x201d; for &#x201c;inherent&#x201d; where the local oscillator has a nominal phase, and &#x201c;Q&#x201d; for &#x201c;quadrature&#x201d;, where the local oscillator phase is shifted 90 degrees. In one embodiment, the frequency reference for the synthesizers inside the programmable frequency converter may be a temperature compensated crystal oscillator to reduce frequency drift with temperature. If the frequency stability is insufficient, an oven stabilized crystal oscillator may be used.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In an example implementation, the frequency of the carrier wave is reduced in a sine wave multiplication or mixing process. For instance, a practical implementation might have a local oscillator running at 17 GHz. This is multiplied by 3, to get a signal at 51 GHz. The 51 GHz signal is fed to a mixer, along with a 59.5 GHz reference signal to produce an 8.5 GHz output signal. An image frequency would also be present at 42.5 GHz. This may be filtered out by a low noise amplifier. The 8.5 GHz IF signal may then be mixed with two 8.5 GHz LO signals, where the two LO signals differ in phase by 90 degrees (i.e.: the I and Q signals described previously). In this implementation, the frequency multiplier and mixer may be combined in the same device.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The I and Q components of the signal act as inputs to a quadrature coupler <b>503</b> and an associated switch <b>505</b> is used to select between upper and lower IF sidebands. When the I and Q signals are combined in a quadrature combiner, one of the mixing products will increase, since the signals are in phase. The other mixing product will be cancelled since the signals are out of phase. The quadrature coupler <b>503</b> outputs are switched to pass either the high side or low side IF frequency, and reject the opposite sideband. Rejecting one of the sidebands reduces the noise of the signal. The switch <b>505</b> in turn is activated by user software and selects which of the IF sidebands to deliver to an output <b>507</b> of the frequency converter, by selecting the polarity of the output of the IF quadrature hybrid. The content of the IF output is a frequency-shifted version of the 60 GHz input from radio wave carriers. The internal local oscillator operates over a defined frequency range, and by selecting which sideband to use (upper or lower) enables the device to expand the input frequency range. For example, the IF output <b>507</b> covers a limited number of channels; by further splitting the signal with a quadrature coupler <b>503</b> and passing only low or high side bands, each with their assigned frequency-channel pairing, the effective number of channels can be increased by switching the LO between the low side and the high side. This extends the usable frequency range of a programmable frequency converter beyond that of a receiver module <b>501</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, IF output from the programmable frequency converter <b>405</b> is then connected to a frequency converter/digitizer <b>407</b>. The frequency converter/digitizer <b>407</b> further modulates the IF output from the frequency converter <b>405</b> to enable more efficient use of the data and preserve the bandwidth of interest for analysis. Additionally or alternatively, the frequency converter/digitizer <b>407</b> may shift the frequency range lower, into the MHz scale, to enable faster and more efficient signal analysis on a CPU <b>409</b>. An example embodiment of a frequency converter/digitizer <b>407</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The frequency converter/digitizer modulates an input signal frequency using a series of filters that may include notch <b>601</b>, low-pass <b>603</b>, and/or saw <b>605</b> filters. A frequency converter/digitizer also performs additional heterodyning on the modulated signal using LO frequency synthesizers <b>607</b>, <b>608</b> to shift the frequency range lower, such as into the MHz scale. A frequency converter/digitizer utilizes an analog-to-digital converter <b>609</b> to convert the lower frequency signal to a digital signal that may be routed through a field programmable gate array <b>611</b> for transfer to a PC. Analog-to-digital conversion may utilize a sample rate high enough to accommodate frequencies in the MHz range. In an example embodiment, a peripheral controller <b>613</b> may enable connectivity, such as USB 3.0 functionality, for connecting the device to a PC. Other similar interface systems between FPGA output of the device and a PC may further be utilized in other embodiments.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the signal output from the frequency converter/digitizer <b>407</b> may be sent to a hardware computing device, such as a personal computer (PC) <b>409</b>. Once transferred to a PC <b>409</b>, the processed signal may undergo further spectral analysis. Spectral analysis may be done by FFT to improve baseband spectrum analysis speed. For example, in one embodiment using a 192 kSPS digitizing sample rate, an FFT size of N=2{circumflex over (&#x2003;)}16 creates an equivalent noise bandwidth of 4.4 Hz and requires a plasma on time of about 340 ms. A high performance CPU may be required to accommodate a high data rate of a continuous data stream. In another embodiment, data is digitized in millisecond bursts, timed to retain the phase relationships between the carrier signals for spectral analysis. Digitized data bursts may be optimized to support a practical bandwidth for storage in DRAM, which then may be transferred to a PC at slower rate, such as through an optical transmitter.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an exemplary embodiment, a harmonic mixer is utilized to improve measurement speed. In a typical embodiment, the harmonic mixer may be driven at 5.8 GHz, and signals could be detected using the 9<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th </sup>and 11<sup>th </sup>harmonics of a local oscillator. An analog to digital converter sample speed Fs could be 1.5 times the local oscillator frequency, or about 8.7 GSPS. In some embodiments, the ADC sample rate may be too high for real-time signal processing, so a burst of data may be stored, such as in DRAM, while the plasma array is activated and retrieved and processed at a slower rate. Since all microwave signals (in the 60 GHz range) from the plasma are processed at the same time, the phase relationships are preserved. Phase data from subsequent readings can be interpolated to increase frequency resolution or resolve low modulation frequencies. In some embodiments, the high speed FFT may computed in a PC using a GPU card for reduced power consumption.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">An FFT will provide amplitude and phase information for each signal, which has been converted in frequency from the 60 GHz range to a range suitable for digitization. An embodiment which analyzes multiple frequencies at the same time using a high digitizer sample rate will provide more information by capturing the instantaneous phase relationships between each signal. A practical embodiment may combine a set of digital down converters with FFT to reduce the total amount of spectrum being analyzed, hence reducing the computing complexity.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The FFT processing increases the speed of the measurement, a benefit over a traditional narrow-band swept measurement. This speed is important in biofield measurement, as the strength of the signal may vary with the physical position of the array relative to the body. The output of the FFT is a frequency spectrum depicting amplitude and phase versus frequency of carrier wave signals.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The spectrum analysis as described may be used to detect amplitude-modulated signals at the resonant maser frequencies of oxygen. This modulation is expected to produce numerous subcarrier waves, which can be characterized by using an appropriate spectrum resolution bandwidth, for example, between 1 Hz and 100 Hz. The plasma array acts as an energy conversion and amplification mechanism when activated. The random plasma discharges from an array manifest as signal noise. However, in proximity to a biofield, the oxygen plasma acts as a maser amplification mechanism for the biofield. This manifests as independent carriers or amplitude spikes during narrow-band spectrum analysis.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Using a spectrum analysis to detect microwave signals from a plasma array in contact with the body (or other biological specimen) may provide useful information about a plasma medicine treatment condition and optimal placement of the plasma array relative to the body.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
