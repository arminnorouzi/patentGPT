Not all instances of an element are necessarily labeled to simplify the drawings where appropriate. The drawings are not necessarily to scale, emphasis instead being placed upon illustrating the principles being described.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Application of cosmetics and makeup in patterns and shapes can be difficult by hand. For example, intricate designs and theatrical makeup are typically applied by certified makeup professionals. Additionally, self-application can be a challenge generally for those with limited mobility. Currently, solutions are being explored through the development of handheld tools, such as cartridge-plus-dispenser solutions, which implement light-activated cosmetics guided by hand. Despite representing a technological alternative to brushes, such tools are limited by cartridge sizes, cleaning methods, inability to mix or blend colors, short battery life, and lack of location awareness. Also, by depending on a handheld device, such tools do not address accessibility concerns.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Photochromic formulations are described for applying a cosmetic design on a body surface, such as a subject's face or other region of interest, using one or more illumination sources. Described embodiments use photo-responsive materials in combination with reflective and/or structural color materials to define one or more exposure patterns mapped to the body surface using a projection of the cosmetic design onto a 3D mapping of the body surface. Described embodiments are useful in many contexts, including cosmetics or body art applications, skin feature mapping or monitoring, dermatological diagnosis or treatments, or telehealth applications. In the context of such applications, described embodiments provide precision and greater ease of use over complex manual routines.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In described embodiments, a photochromic formulation may include a micrometer-scale particulate material including multiple layers. Each layer may individually modulate a color or a cosmetic effect, including but not limited to shimmer, shine, brightness, angular color, luminescence, iridescence, or fluorescence. The layers may each be actuated/modulated/addressed by one or more wavelengths, as part of applying the cosmetic design both in terms of color fidelity and cosmetic effects. In an illustrative example, a micrometer-scale particle of the photochromic formulation may include a reflective core including mica or titania, a shimmer-control layer that includes a photo-responsive material that transitions from transparency to opacity under a specific wavelength, and a color layer including four photochromic materials. The photochromic materials may be individually addressable by four different and distinct wavelengths. In this way, a region of the body surface can be exposed with a combination of the four wavelengths to express a unique color, for example, as is used in CMYK pigment systems. By applying the photochromic formulation onto the body surface, for example, as a face powder or cream, exposure of the body surface (and thus the photochromic formulation) to an illumination source according to an exposure pattern can transfer the design in a touch-free manner.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Without being limited to a specific system or method, systems and methods for applying such cosmetic designs are also described in the context of a sensor-bearing system. Sensors suitable for use in described embodiments include 2-dimensional (2D) or 3-dimensional (3D) cameras, proximity sensors, or other integrated or peripheral cameras or sensors. Depth sensors are used in some embodiments to obtain 3D information about surfaces and include a range of possible hardware suitable for this purpose, including RGB or infrared stereoscopic cameras, laser or infrared LiDAR sensors, and dot projectors. 3D scans enable improved measurement of actual dimensions of a body surface and allow depth sensing, which can help to determine, for example, how far the body surface is from the camera, or detailed information about particular skin features, such as wrinkles. Reference points obtained through high-quality 3D scanning in accordance with described embodiments provides greater accuracy for determining location than traditional reference points obtained with 2D imaging, such as eyes, lips, noses, or other prominent facial features, and are particularly helpful where the region of interest is occluded.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The systems described expose the surface with multiple actuating wavelengths in accordance with the cosmetic design as mapped onto the 3D information collected by the sensors. In this way, the photochromic formulation, applied to a region of the body surface, can be made to take on the cosmetic design accurately and precisely by illumination with the actuating wavelengths rather than manual application of cosmetics. Advantageously, the materials, systems, and methods described also provide improved accessibility to users with limited mobility or dexterity, for whom cosmetic application, such as makeup, may otherwise involve assistance by another person. As an additional advantage, the materials, systems, and methods described also permit a user to develop, try, or experiment with multiple cosmetic designs without removing or changing the photochromic formulation. For example, in some embodiments, the photochromic formulation can be reset using the same actuating wavelengths used to apply the design, thereby permitting another cosmetic design to be applied. Such versatility reduces the number of materials and layers applied for each design, and further simplifies cosmetic application.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of an example system <b>100</b> incorporating sensors and an illumination source for application of cosmetic designs, according to various embodiments.

Additionally or alternatively, the client computing device <b>104</b> may be electronically coupled with an acoustic speaker to generate an auditory prompt.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The mirror <b>106</b> may include one or more portions <b>112</b> characterized by unidirectional transparency, for example, in ultraviolet, visible, and/or infrared spectral ranges. The camera(s) <b>150</b> may be optically coupled with the visible light mirror <b>106</b> to receive visible light via a first portion <b>112</b>-<b>1</b>, and the illumination source(s) <b>108</b> may be optically coupled with the visible light mirror <b>106</b> and configured to emit a plurality of discrete wavelength channels via a second portion <b>112</b>-<b>2</b> of the mirror <b>106</b>. In this way, the mirror <b>106</b> may appear uniform, and the system <b>100</b> may appear aesthetically as an ordinary cosmetic mirror without outward indication that the system <b>100</b> incorporates electronics, cameras <b>150</b>, or illumination sources <b>108</b>. For example, the components of the client computing device <b>104</b> may be integrated into a housing <b>114</b> that appears similar to a consumer cosmetic mirror rather than an electronics system. In this example, the housing <b>114</b> may conceal power sources, heat management systems, and other components.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">While the client computing device <b>104</b> is illustrated in a particular configuration (e.g., as a countertop mirror or vanity mirror), additional and/or alternative form factors are contemplated. For example, the system <b>100</b> may include a smartphone or tablet computer in communication with the client computing device <b>104</b>, such that one or more computer-executable operations are undertaken by the smartphone or tablet computer rather than by the client computing device <b>104</b>. In this way, the client computing device <b>104</b> may be or include smaller housings <b>114</b>, including, but not limited to, a cosmetics compact or an electronic peripheral configured to electronically couple with a smartphone or tablet computer that includes the camera <b>150</b>, the illumination source <b>108</b>, or both. Similarly, the mirror <b>106</b> can be or include a full-size wall mirror, such that the client computing device <b>104</b>, the camera(s) <b>150</b> and the illumination source(s) <b>108</b> may be positioned behind the mirror <b>106</b> and the one or more portions <b>112</b> may be located relative to the camera(s) <b>150</b> and the illumination source(s) <b>108</b>. In such a configuration, the system <b>100</b> may be installed as a fixture, rather than as a portable system and a single mirror <b>106</b> may be configured to conceal multiple client computing devices <b>104</b>, multiple cameras <b>150</b>, and multiple illumination sources <b>108</b>, corresponding to a number of &#x201c;makeup stations,&#x201d; as in a salon or makeup trailer.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The illumination source <b>108</b> may include one or more optics configured to form a beam and to scan the beam. The optics may include lenses or mirrors internal to the housing <b>114</b> that may be actuated or otherwise controlled to direct a beam from the illumination source(s) <b>108</b> to the subject's face <b>102</b>. For example, the illumination source <b>108</b> may be or include one or more laser sources corresponding to the plurality of discrete wavelength channels, as described in more detail in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, below. In some embodiments, the illumination source <b>108</b> includes multiple light-emitting diodes corresponding to the plurality of discrete wavelength channels. Similarly, the illumination source may be or include a continuous source (e.g., a tungsten halide or broad-spectrum source) and a plurality of bandpass filters to generate the discrete wavelength channels used by the system <b>100</b> to apply a cosmetic design.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The client computing device <b>104</b> may be in electronic communication with additional systems via a network or over near-field communication protocols (e.g., wifi, bluetooth, etc.). For example, the client computing device <b>104</b> may pair with a mobile electronic device, such as a smart phone or tablet, from which the client computing device <b>104</b> may receive an identifier of a design. Similarly, the client computing device <b>104</b> may communicate with a server, storing numerical representations of designs, and may access the design from the server. The server may be a remote server or may be a local server, where the terms &#x201c;remote&#x201d; and &#x201c;local&#x201d; are used both to refer to physical proximity to the system <b>100</b> and to denote whether the client computing device <b>104</b> and the server are configured to communicate over a public network, such as the internet, or a distributed network system (e.g., a cloud system). In some cases, the client computing device <b>104</b> may store design data locally for a number of cosmetic designs, for example, using a non-transitory computer readable storage medium (e.g., SSD flash memory, hard disk drives, etc.). For example, the client computing device <b>104</b> may receive newly released cosmetic design data and associated metadata from the server, such as identifier information and interface data (e.g., images representing the cosmetic design on a model), which may be provided via the interface elements <b>110</b> or via the mobile electronic device. In such cases, the system may be configured to operate with intermittent or no network connectivity.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, the camera <b>150</b> acts as a far-field camera positioned and configured to capture video or still images of subject's face <b>102</b>, as well a region of interest <b>120</b> of the subject's face <b>102</b>, such that the region of interest <b>120</b> is within the field of view <b>152</b> of the camera(s) <b>150</b>. In the example shown, the region of interest <b>120</b> is shown as a portion of the left cheek of the subject's face <b>102</b>, but the region of interest <b>120</b> may cover a larger portion of the subject's face <b>102</b>, such as the entirety of the subject's face <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, the camera unit <b>150</b> includes more than one camera, such as for stereoscopic image or video capture and/or depth sensing. In some embodiments, the camera unit <b>150</b> also includes one or more sensors other than cameras (e.g., a LiDAR sensor or infrared dot projector for depth sensing, a proximity sensor for proximity detection, etc.). In some embodiments, an infrared dot projector projects infrared dots onto a surface, and reflections from the surface are measured by an infrared camera to determine the distance each dot is from the projector system. When working in conjunction with a 3D camera, these depth measurements can be mapped onto a captured 3D image. This approach is used in some embodiments to generate a 3D model of a body surface, and for real-time tracking of additional features to be used for mapping a cosmetic design onto the subject's face <b>102</b> or other body parts.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a schematic illustration of a numerical representation of an example cosmetic design <b>200</b> as a polygonal mesh including a tensor of design data in an face-on direction and a low-angle direction, according to various aspects of the present disclosure. The design <b>200</b> represents an exemplary visualization of a cosmetic design, including multiple polygons <b>202</b>, where each polygon <b>202</b> represents a unit of the numerical representation, akin to a pixel in a digital image. Where the system implementing the processes described herein (e.g., system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) may project the design <b>200</b> onto a surface mapping of a user's face (e.g., subject's face <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), the polygons <b>202</b> may be or include triangles or other shapes that provide greater flexibility for projection and surface mapping relative to square or rectangular pixels.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown, a first polygon <b>202</b>-<b>1</b> of the design <b>200</b>, referenced as Cell<sub>i,j </sub>in the i-j plane of the numerical representation, may include multiple types of design data corresponding to different layers of the design <b>200</b>. For example, the design data for the first polygon <b>202</b>-<b>1</b> may include, but is not limited to, a face-on color tuple and a low-angle color tuple, indicating two different colors to be generated by the system <b>100</b> at different angles. Each tuple may include color level information corresponding to the photo-responsive materials incorporated into a photochromic formulation. For example, the photochromic formulation may include one, two, three, four, five, or more different photo-responsive materials.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">By selectively modulating the photo-responsive materials in accordance with the color levels for each polygon, the cosmetic design <b>200</b> may be applied to the user. As described in more detail in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, angle-dependent color may be provided using angled illumination, such that a cosmetic design may include iridescence or other angular color effects. While each polygon <b>202</b> is illustrated as having a uniform characteristic size, it is to be understood that the polygons are representative of a tensor of color data that is referenced by cell entries in i-j space, rather than in cartesian coordinates. In this way, the first polygon <b>202</b>-<b>1</b> may be larger or smaller than neighboring polygons <b>202</b> when projected into a physical dimension, such as when applied to a facial mapping of a user for application of the cosmetic design <b>200</b> (e.g., region of interest <b>120</b> of the subject's face <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a schematic illustration of an example 3-dimensional projection <b>210</b> of the cosmetic design <b>200</b> onto a face mapping collected using the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, according to various embodiments. As described in more detail in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the system <b>100</b> is configured to receive the cosmetic design <b>200</b> and to generate an exposure pattern. As part of the operations of the system <b>100</b>, the cosmetic design <b>200</b> may be projected onto a 3D mapping of the portion of the user's body (e.g., subject's face <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), The 3D model includes several reference points <b>212</b> in the form of corresponding triangles (although other polygon shapes are also contemplated) of a mesh structure.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Generating the 3D projection <b>210</b> may include multiple computational operations to generate a numerical representation of a portion of a face of the user using the camera (e.g., a facial mapping). The camera may be or include multiple image sensors configured to capture stereoscopic images. In this way, the numerical representation of the portion of the face may be or include a tensor of position information defining a surface of the face (e.g., in the region of interest <b>120</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Examples of computational techniques include edge-detection, feature or point detection and tracking, and/or point-cloud methods. For example, the system <b>100</b> may be configured with a time-of-flight camera, with LiDAR systems, or with stereoscopic cameras, such that the facial mapping may represent a surface generated by contours connecting points and/or features. In some embodiments, the system <b>100</b> may include an implementation of machine learning, such as a face detection/mapping module, that may be trained to predict the facial mapping based on a subset of features and/or points measured by the camera. In this way, the system <b>100</b> may be configured to reduce the number of measurements used to generate the mapping, which may improve system performance, for example, by reducing the length of time used to capture images of the user's face.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Other adaptations can be performed for variations in lighting conditions, viewing angles, or other factors. As one example, a light sensor mounted on the client computing device <b>104</b> can be used to measure current lighting conditions relative to a baseline lighting condition. If the environment is too bright or too dark, the client computing device <b>104</b> may generate a prompt to increase illumination and/or may activate an illumination source (e.g., illumination source <b>108</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) that may or may not be visible to the subject (e.g., an infrared source to provide invisible illumination). In some embodiments, the client computing device <b>104</b> may provide feedback to a user (e.g., via synthesized voice cues or visual indications) to adjust the lighting conditions for better results. In some embodiments, the system may generate feedback to instruct the user to reposition relative to the camera(s) (e.g., generating a prompt to reposition the user's face from a face-on to a side-on position). It should be understood that described embodiments are capable of implementation in many possible ways to determine matches between captured image data and texture data in a 3D model, including matching detected edges or contours, color/pixel values, depth information, or the like in different combinations, and at particular threshold levels of confidence, any of which may be adjusted based on lighting conditions, user preferences, system design constraints, or other factors.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The projection <b>210</b> may be generated by various means to reduce artifacts of the projection onto the face. For example, the polygons into which the design <b>200</b> is divided may be heterogeneously scaled, skewed, or otherwise modified when generating the projection <b>210</b>, as illustrated. For example, where the cosmetic design may include each polygon with a uniform size, the projection <b>210</b> may include many different sizes for the polygons <b>212</b>. In some embodiments, resizing may correspond to the contours of the facial mapping, where regions of high dynamic range correspond to smaller polygons <b>212</b> and regions of low dynamic range correspond to larger polygons <b>212</b>. Additionally and/or alternatively, the projection <b>210</b> may be resized in accordance with information density. For example, where the number of polygons <b>202</b> making up the design <b>200</b> correspond to the resolution of the design, analogous to a pixel resolution of a digital image, information-rich regions of the design <b>200</b> may include relatively high numbers of polygons <b>202</b>, compared to regions that include negligible design information. As an illustrative example, more polygons may be used to describe the regions around facial features, such as eyes, nose, mouth, or eyebrows, in contrast to regions of the cheeks, jaw, forehead, etc. In this way, the projection <b>210</b> may be include exposure data for both a face-on direction (e.g., substantially normal to the surface) and for a low-angle direction, as defined for one or more angles of the user's face relative to the illumination source.

For example, color mixing for a first polygon <b>212</b>-<b>1</b>, as indicated by the intensity data of the design <b>200</b>, may be effected by exposing the first polygon to the multiple distinct wavelength channels (e.g., &#x3bb;<sub>1-4</sub>) for different durations corresponding to the characteristic activation/deactivation time of the different dies. The physical mechanisms of photochromic materials are dynamic and sometimes may include reversible activation/deactivation, such that multiple designs <b>200</b> may be applied using a single application of photo-responsive material.

The example photochromic formulation <b>300</b> includes multiple layers to facilitate individual modulation/actuation of different elements of a cosmetic design (e.g., cosmetic design <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). A core material <b>310</b> may form the center of a particle, around which may be disposed a number of layers.

Surrounding the core material <b>310</b>, the example photochromic formulation <b>300</b> may include a photochromic layer <b>330</b>. In some embodiments, a shimmer control layer <b>320</b> may be interposed between the core material <b>310</b> and the photochromic layer <b>330</b>. Similarly, an encapsulation layer <b>340</b> may be disposed overlying the photochromic layer <b>330</b>. In some embodiments, the particle may be characterized by a characteristic dimension, such as a diameter <b>350</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The core material <b>310</b> may be or include a reflective mineral. In some embodiments, the reflective mineral may be or include mica, titanium oxide, or silicon oxide. In this way, the core material <b>310</b> may impart shimmer, may amplify the color effect of the photochromic formulation <b>300</b>, and may impart specular color to the photochromic formulation <b>300</b>. In some embodiments, the core material <b>310</b> may be or include a material that fluoresces under ambient conditions (e.g., Sun, UV, etc.), for example, titanium oxide nanoparticles. In this way, the core material <b>310</b> may provide a white foundation to improve color fidelity of the photochromic layer <b>330</b>. Similarly, the core material <b>310</b> may be or include a polymeric material characterized by a diffuse color, which may be selected from a range of shades or tones. In an illustrative example, the core material <b>310</b> includes a mixture of titanium oxide nanoparticles suspended in a white polymer microbead with a diameter from 0.1-5 &#x3bc;m, or larger. In this example, the core material <b>310</b> can provide a diffuse white foundation for the photochromic layer <b>330</b> under indoor conditions, and a brilliant white foundation under sunlit conditions that will amplify the perceived intensity of the photochromic layer. Advantageously, such an approach permits the photochromic formulation <b>300</b> to respond to changing ambient conditions by amplifying or damping the brightness of the color.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The shimmer control layer <b>320</b>, interposed between the core material <b>310</b> and the photochromic layer <b>330</b>, may be or include a photo-responsive material characterized by a transition from visible transparency to visible opacity when exposed to irradiation of a characteristic wavelength. The visible opacity may correspond to broad reflectance in the visible spectrum. Additionally or alternatively, the visible opacity may correspond to a solid diffuse color. In this way, the shimmer control layer <b>320</b> may permit modulation of any optical properties of the core material <b>310</b> independently of the photochromic layer <b>330</b>. In some embodiments, the transition from visible transparency to visible opacity is progressive in proportion to an extent of the irradiation. For example, the shimmer control layer may be or include a photo-responsive polymer, including but not limited to spiropyran, sprooxazine, diarylethenes, or naphthopyran, that transitions either physical confirmation or electronic state in response to irradiation at the characteristic wavelength. As an illustrative example, spiropyran transitions under UV irradiation to absorb photons of visible light, and therefore appear colorful. When the UV source is removed, the molecules gradually relax to their ground state. Without being limited to a particular range, the characteristic wavelength may be in the UV range, such as about 400 nm or less, about 380 nm or less, about 360 nm or less, about 340 nm or less, about 320 nm or less, within the ranges of energy that human skin is adapted to absorb at least in intermittent exposure (e.g., UV-A and/or UVB). In some embodiments, the characteristic wavelength may be in the visible range, from about 380 nm to 750 nm, such that the shimmer-control layer may be modulated between a UV-absorber and a visible-absorber under irradiation by visible light, which may be preferred over UV light for some users. For example, some diarylethene coordination complexes, such as polyoxometalate diarylethene coordination complexes, switch between UV-absorbers to broad-spectrum absorbers from about 425 nm to about 800 nm, centered around a wavelength of about 620 nm after irradiation at a characteristic wavelength of 400 nm.

To reduce cross-talk between color channels in the photochromic layer, the three characteristic wavelengths may be provided by an illumination source (e.g., illumination source(s) <b>108</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) with three distinct wavelength channels, such as line sources or filtered light sources (e.g., an RGB projector).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">For example, a first photo-responsive dye or pigment may be included that is characterized by reversible diffuse reflectance at a first central wavelength from 490 nm to 520 nm in response to irradiation by photons of a first characteristic wavelength.

In some embodiments, the first characteristic wavelength may be an activation wavelength or a deactivation wavelength, such that the first photo-responsive dye or pigment may exhibit stable transparency that is modulated to a stable diffuse color in response to irradiation at the first characteristic wavelength. Alternatively, the first photo-responsive dye or pigment may exhibit stable diffuse color that is modulated to a stable transparency in response to irradiation at the first characteristic wavelength. For example, for deactivation mechanisms, the first characteristic wavelength may be from about 625 nm to about 740 nm, corresponding to red light. For activation mechanisms, the first characteristic wavelength may be generally in the ultraviolet range, as described above.

In this way, the third photo-responsive dye or pigment may correspond to the magenta portion of the CMY triad. As described in reference to the first photo-responsive dye or pigment, the third photo-responsive dye or pigment may be modulated by an activation or deactivation mechanism.

For example, in reference to the DAE naming system developed by Yamada Chemical Company, LTD. Of Japan, the photochromic layer may be or include DAE-0001, DAE-0012, and DAE-0068 photochromic dyes.

Similar to the photochromic materials described above, the fourth photochromic material may be characterized by a transition from visible transparency to visible opacity when exposed to irradiation of a characteristic wavelength (e.g., UV photons). In contrast to the CMY triad materials, the K material may be isomerized between a broad absorber (e.g., a diffuse black color) across the visible spectrum and a broad transmitter (e.g., transparent). The inclusion of the fourth photochromic material to impart the K-channel in the photochromic layer <b>330</b> provides improved color rendering fidelity to the photochromic formulation, as is observed in CMYK printing systems.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Additionally or alternatively, the photochromic layer <b>330</b> may be or include a material that exhibits structural color. In contrast to pigments and dyes, structural color is generated by interference effects caused by the structure of the material, rather than photon-absorption by electrons in atomic or molecular orbitals. In multilayer thin-film materials, for example, structural color can result from wavelength-dependent phase shifting that produces interference in a characteristic pattern in the visible spectrum, observed as a color. In contrast to photochromic materials described above, however, structural color may be fixed, rather than transitioning between two color states.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In this way, the photochromic layer <b>330</b> may be a structural color layer, including one of three or more structural color materials. In contrast to the photochromic pigments or dyes described above that render colors by subtractive color mixing, structural color is typically not susceptible to modulation by an activation/deactivation wavelength. Instead, materials exhibiting structural color are typically characterized by a static wavelength-dependent color, that manifests in response to exposure to photons at a characteristic wavelength, polarity, or other property. In this way, structural color materials may be selected to reproduce an additive color triad. Examples of an additive color triad include but are not limited to an &#x201c;RGB&#x201d; triad as in addressable pixel displays. In this way, the photochromic formulation <b>300</b> may include a mixture of particles including particles with different structural color materials, the proportion of which can be selected to produce different color rendering capabilities. In an illustrative example, the photochromic formulation can include a mixture of red-structural color particles, green-structural color particles, and blue-structural color particles, in substantially equal proportions (e.g., 1:1:1&#x2014;R:G:B). In this context, &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; is used to indicate a distribution of values &#xb1;10% of the stated value.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, the structural color is imparted to the photochromic layer <b>330</b> by a nanostructured or microstructured material. For example, the structural color layer may be or include porous clusters suspended in a photo-responsive matrix. The porous clusters may be or include inverse opal, as may be formed from silicon oxide or titanium oxide. Inverse opals are three-dimensionally ordered macroporous photonic crystal particles, characterized by structural color that is tunable by synthesis parameters. For example, by synthesis of silicon oxide crystals in a colloidal matrix template that forms the photonic crystal structure after pyrolysis. As a photonic crystal material, a powder of the material can retain the structural color properties of the bulk crystal. In this way, a suspension of porous clusters that act as photonic crystals may be incorporated into a photochromic material that acts as the photo-responsive matrix. As such, the structural color layer may be provided by the core material <b>310</b>, where the core material includes a photonic crystal characterized by a structural color.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In turn, the photo-responsive matrix modulates the exposure of the porous clusters to incident photons by transitioning from transparent to opaque under irradiation by a characteristic actuation/modulation wavelength. Similar to the photochromic materials described above, the photo-responsive matrix may be characterized by a transition from visible transparency to visible opacity, or the reverse, when exposed to irradiation of a characteristic wavelength (e.g., UV photons, visible photons, or infrared photons). As with the K-channel material or the shimmer control layer <b>320</b>, the photo-responsive matrix material may be isomerized between a broad absorber (e.g., a diffuse black color), a broad reflector (e.g., a diffuse white color), or a narrow reflector (e.g., a specific diffuse color) to a broad transmitter (e.g., transparent). The specific diffuse color may be used, for example, to provide a neutral tone that may be matched to the skin tone, while black or white matrix materials may be used to provide foundations to promote color rendering fidelity. In some embodiments, the specific diffuse color may be provided by blending multiple photochromic materials in the photo-responsive matrix, such that the characteristic wavelength may include multiple wavelengths that together modulate the blend.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In terms of the structures illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the photochromic layer <b>330</b>, as a structural color layer, may include a first photonic crystal material characterized by a first structural color in the blue range. The structural color layer, may include a second photonic crystal material characterized by a second structural color in the green range. The structural color layer, may include a third photonic crystal material characterized by a third structural color in the red range. In contrast to the photochromic materials, the structural color layer may be limited to a single structural color rather than a blend of all three. In this way, three color channels may be independently modulated by providing the three different photo-responsive matrix materials to the three photonic crystal materials, each selected to isomerize in response to irradiation by a different respective wavelength. As described in more detail in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, a blend of three different structural color materials, incorporating three different photo-responsive matrix materials, may permit a cosmetic design to be applied using an array of color tuples, applied by modulating the photo-responsive matrix materials, to provide a difference color by subtractive mixing.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Overlying the photochromic layer <b>330</b>, the photochromic formulation <b>300</b> may include an encapsulation layer <b>340</b>. The encapsulation layer <b>340</b> may be or include an inert polymeric material providing an chemical and/or diffusion barrier to protect the underlying materials from chemical oxidation or other degradation reactions. Similarly, the encapsulation layer may isolate the materials making up the photochromic layer <b>330</b>, the shimmer-control layer <b>320</b>, and the core material <b>310</b> from body surfaces (e.g., the subject's face <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The encapsulation layer <b>340</b> may be or include a material that is transparent to photons across UV and visible wavelengths. For example, the encapsulation layer may be or include a silicone material, such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS).</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is a schematic illustration of photo-modulation of an example photochromic formulation <b>400</b>, in accordance with various embodiments. The photochromic formulation <b>400</b> may be an example of the photochromic formulation <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, incorporating a photo-responsive pigment or dye and/or a structural color material. From an exterior perspective, a photochromic formulation <b>400</b> may be stable in a first state <b>410</b>. The first state <b>410</b> may describe a first diffuse color, such as white, black, a color selected from a palette of skin tone colors (e.g., a sum color produced by additive mixing of multiple photochromic materials). Alternatively, the first state <b>410</b> may be at least partially transparent, to reduce the visual profile of the first state <b>410</b> and to blend the photochromic formulation <b>400</b> into the body surface behind.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Under irradiation by photons of one or more characteristic wavelengths <b>415</b>, the photochromic formulation may transition from the first state <b>410</b> to a second state <b>420</b>. The second state <b>420</b> may be characterized by a diffuse color, as when the photochromic formulation <b>400</b> includes a photonic crystal or a blend of photochromic materials. As described above, the diffuse color may result from sctructural color or subtractive color mixing, and may be characterized by wavelength-dependent reflectance of photons of one or more wavelengths <b>425</b>. For photochromic materials, color rendering results from subtractive mixing of two or more photo-responsive pigments, while for structural colors, each particle may be characterized by a single diffuse color. As such, the number of wavelengths <b>425</b> corresponds to the type of material making up the photochromic formulation <b>400</b>. In an illustrative example, for a structural color particle, the characteristic wavelength <b>415</b> may be in the visible spectrum, and may be applied to transition a photo-responsive material, such as spiropyran or naphthopyran, from a diffuse black color to a transparent color, thereby revealing a photonic crystal layer (e.g., either layer <b>330</b> or core material <b>310</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), which reflects the wavelength <b>425</b>. Similarly, for a photochromic dye or pigment particle, the characteristic wavelength <b>415</b> may include multiple wavelengths to modulate a triad or tetrad of photo-responsive materials, resulting color rendering by subtractive mixing. As described above, in such cases, the wavelength <b>425</b> may include multiple wavelengths, received and interpreted by the human eye as a single diffuse color.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some embodiments, the photochromic formulation <b>400</b> may be &#x201c;locked in&#x201d; to the second state <b>420</b>. In this context, &#x201c;locking in&#x201d; refers to a process whereby the photochromic formulation <b>400</b> includes a photo-responsive material that isomerizes, polymerizes, or undergoes another chemical change in response to irradiation by a &#x201c;locking&#x201d; wavelength, different from the characteristic wavelength <b>415</b>. The photo-responsive material may be an example of the encapsulation layer (e.g., encapsulation layer <b>340</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), and the change may result in the encapsulation layer absorbing the characteristic wavelength <b>415</b> and preventing further modulation of the photochromic material. In an illustrative example, where the second state <b>420</b> is stable after irradiation under the characteristic wavelength <b>415</b> in the UV range, the encapsulation layer of the photochromic formulation <b>400</b> may be photo-polymerized to become a UV-absorbing polymer, after which the photochromic formulation <b>400</b> is &#x201c;locked&#x201d; in the second state <b>420</b>. Locking in, as such, may also apply to matrix materials.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> describes spectroscopic aspects of the photochromic system, including intensity spectrum <b>450</b> and absorbance spectrum <b>460</b> for three illumination sources and three photochromic materials, respectively, in accordance with various embodiments. The photochromic formulation with which the cosmetic design (e.g., example cosmetic design <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) is implemented may be or include a blend of multiple photo-responsive and/or photochromic materials, as described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>. In the example spectra illustrated, the intensity spectrum <b>450</b> represents the excitation or deactivation spectra of three different photochromic or photo-responsive materials. For example, the three materials may correspond to a CMY triad where each color channel is independently modulated by a wavelength included in intensity spectrum <b>450</b>. Alternatively, the three materials may correspond to three different photo-responsive materials that each transition from transparent to opaque under irradiation by a respective wavelength in intensity spectrum <b>450</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Each constituent peak of the spectrum <b>450</b> may be generated by the illumination source of the system <b>100</b> described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. For example, a first emission peak <b>451</b>, corresponding to a bluish color in the visual spectrum, may be selected to correspond to a first absorbance band <b>461</b> of one of the materials. Similarly, a second emission peak <b>453</b> may be selected to correspond to a second absorbance band <b>463</b> of a second of the materials. Similarly, a third emission peak <b>455</b> may be selected to correspond to a third absorbance band <b>465</b> of a third of the materials. In this way, the illumination source (e.g., illumination source(s) <b>108</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) may be configured to expose the photochromic formulation at or near absorbance maxima of the materials, as illustrated in absorbance spectra <b>460</b>. For example, the three line sources <b>451</b>, <b>453</b>, and <b>455</b> of the emission spectrum <b>450</b> are aligned with three central wavelengths &#x3bb;<sub>1-3 </sub>for independently modulating three color channels (CMY, RGB, or otherwise) as an approach to rendering a full spectrum of colors described in the cosmetic design of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> (e.g., cosmetic design <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). In some embodiments, the three central wavelengths may within ranges of 410-475 nm, 490-540 nm, and 600-670 nm, respectively, corresponding to bluish, greenish, and reddish light. In this context, the term &#x201c;central wavelength&#x201d; describes a peak emission intensity around which intensity follows a distribution of emission intensity, as determined by optical properties of the illumination source that may differ for different emission modalities. For example, a coherent line-source (e.g., a laser) may emit at a characteristic central wavelength with a relatively narrow distribution on either side. By contrast, a broad-spectrum illumination source, such as a black-body source, may be characterized by a wavelength distribution that is determined by a passband of a filter used to select a given central wavelength. In this way, an illumination source may emit photons at a central wavelength within one of the ranges described above, characterized by a distribution of emission intensity at higher energy and lower energy determined by the source and optics. In some embodiments, the central wavelengths may be in the ultraviolet spectral range less than 400 nm or in the NIR or IR ranges, longer than 750 nm.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments, the central wavelengths of the illumination source(s) are different. Even so, channel crosstalk may be observable in some cases, where emission intensity distributions for one or more wavelengths is broad enough to overlap with the nearest neighboring central wavelength. While crosstalk may impair the individual addressability of the respective photo-responsive materials, limited crosstalk may have limited to negligible impact on the color rendering fidelity, where dynamics of photo-chromaticism are relatively slow or where colors are typically blended. For example, a first photo-responsive pigment or dye may respond to bluish light relatively rapidly, where a second photo-responsive pigment or dye may respond to greenish light relatively slowly. As such, where the emission intensity of a bluish central wavelength may extend into the greenish range, the exposure time of the green-sensitive material to greenish illumination may be such that little to no transition is observable in the green-sensitive material. Similarly, relatively few colors exclude one or more of the triad or tetrad channels entirely. In this way, the relative impact of low-level channel overlap may be limited to a marginal change, rather than a step change in color rendering strength.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of a photochromic formulation <b>500</b> under face-on illumination <b>501</b> and under low-angle illumination <b>503</b> using the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to produce polychromatic designs, in accordance with various embodiments.

In some embodiments, the camera is in optical communication with the visible light mirror via a partially transparent portion of the visible light mirror (e.g., first portion <b>112</b>-<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In this context, detecting the user may include multiple operations included as part of face-detection and recognition routines. For example, the computer system may store feature data for a number of faces, such that the computer system is able to detect and identify the face present in the field of view of the camera (e.g., field of view <b>152</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Such identification may benefit the system by reducing the resource demand associated with generating face mappings and projections. For example, by storing depth and image data, the computer system may rely on periodic re-initialization for the 3D mapping operations, rather than continuous mapping, which may be more computationally intensive.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The method <b>600</b> may optionally include generating, by the computer system, a prompt for the user to apply the mixture of photochromic materials at operation <b>606</b>.

Such prompts may facilitate the application of cosmetic designs, for example, where the client computing device is not equipped with a sensor to detect the presence of the photochromic formulation. In some embodiments, the photochromic formulation includes a constituent compound or that is detectable optically. For example, a matrix (e.g., matrix material <b>515</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) may include a material that absorbs a characteristic wavelength for which the computer system is provided with a source that is typically reflected by human skin. Additionally and/or alternatively, the matrix may include a material that reflects or fluoresces under a characteristic wavelength of illumination.

The numerical representation of the face includes a tensor of position information defining a surface of the face.

For example, the computer system may incorporate or be electronically coupled with sensors including, but not limited to, time-of-flight cameras, stereoscopic cameras, LiDAR sensors, or point-tracking systems, to generate the numerical representation of the face. As described in more detail in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> the numerical representation of the face may be stored in memory of the computer system and/or in separate data store for use in generating projections of the cosmetic design onto the face mapping.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">At operation <b>610</b>, the computer system defines one or more exposure patterns for the surface of the face, at least in part by projecting the tensor of color intensity information onto the tensor of position information.

The exposure is effected in accordance with the exposure pattern. In some embodiments, the illumination source is physically coupled with the visible light mirror and configured to emit the plurality of discrete wavelength channels. In some embodiments, the illumination source is optically coupled with the mirror via a unidirectional transparent portion (e.g., second portion <b>112</b>-<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), such that the illumination source emits the plurality of discrete wavelength channels through the mirror via the unidirectional transparent portion. The sources can be steered by the computer system as part of processing the exposure pattern into drive instructions for the sources. For example, the sources may include beam steering optics that rely on electronic actuation or dynamic lensing/optics to direct the source beam toward a specific position on the face. In some embodiments, the sources are configured to emit a field of light covering the entire surface, but with variable wavelength content at each of a number of pixels, reproducing the projected design, as described in more detail in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>.
