The Sonos Wireless Home Sound System enables people to experience music from many sources via one or more networked playback devices. Through a software control application installed on a controller (e.g., smartphone, tablet, computer, voice input device), one can play what she wants in any room having a networked playback device. Media content (e.g., songs, podcasts, video sound) can be streamed to playback devices such that each room with a playback device can play back corresponding different media content. In addition, rooms can be grouped together for synchronous playback of the same media content, and/or the same media content can be heard in all rooms synchronously.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Features, aspects, and advantages of the presently disclosed technology may be better understood with regard to the following description, appended claims, and accompanying drawings, as listed below.

skill in the art will understand that the technology disclosed herein is not limited to the arrangements and/or instrumentality shown in the drawings.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">I. Overview</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Embodiments described herein relate to methods of determining whether a playback device is to rejoin a previous group of playback devices after experiencing a loss of power and a subsequent resumption of power. A playback device may experience a loss of power either because an internal power source, such as a battery, has run out of power or because a user has operated a button or switch that controls the application of power to the playback device, for example. The loss of power can result in the playback device disconnecting from a current group, and therefore stopping playback of media content. In certain circumstances, the loss of power may not have been intended, for example, the switch may control a secondary device associated with the playback device, such as a light. After operating the switch and inadvertently causing the playback device to turn off, the user may operate the switch again to turn the playback device back on. Based on certain criteria, such as the length of time the playback device was switched off, it may be automatically determined that the playback device is to rejoin the group when power is resumed. Rejoining the group means that the playback device can continue playing back media content with other members of the group. In some circumstances, the loss of power may have been intended, and so upon resumption of power, it may be determined that the playback device is not to rejoin the group. Accordingly, methods herein describe different rules and criteria used to assess whether the playback device is to rejoin the group. This decision process can, in some examples, attempt to determine user intent (i.e., determine whether the loss of power was intended) and take appropriate action without requiring the user to intervene. The methods described herein therefore provide a more efficient process of regrouping a playback device after a loss of power.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, a method comprises: playing back, by a first playback device, media content in synchrony with at least a second playback device, where the first and second playback devices are playing back the media content as members of a group. While playing back the media content, and after a loss of power at the first playback device, the method further comprises stopping, by the first playback device, playback of the media content. After the loss of power, and after a resumption of power to the first playback device, the method further comprises automatically determining to rejoin the group and joining the first playback device to the group. The remaining members of the group, such as at least the second playback device, can continue to play back the media content after the loss of power.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some examples, the method further comprises, after the loss of power, the first playback device leaving the group. In some examples, the first playback device comprises, or can access, at least two sources of power, such as a battery and an external power source. In those examples, a loss of power may mean a loss of just one source of power. Similarly, a resumption of power may mean a resumption of just one source of power.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some examples, the method comprises steps of automatically determining whether to rejoin the group, and if it is determined to rejoin the group, joining/adding the first playback device to the group, and if it is determined not to rejoin the group, not joining/adding the first playback device to the group. Not joining/adding the first playback device to the group may comprise awaiting, by the first playback device, a command to play back media content.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one example, the loss of power occurs after an operation of a button or switch, the button or switch being remote from the first playback device, and the resumption of power occurs after a subsequent operation of the button or switch. Accordingly, a user may operate a button or switch that is separate from the first playback device, where the operation causes a loss or resumption of power. The button or switch may be known as a &#x201c;power switch&#x201d;, because it controls the application of power to the first playback device. The button or switch may also control the application of power to another device, such as an illumination device (i.e., a light) associated with the first playback device. In a particular example, the first playback device and the illumination device form part of a single entity, such as a ceiling speaker. The button or switch is therefore also remote (or separate) from the ceiling speaker. In some examples, where the button or switch has a dual functionality, in that it controls the application of power to the first playback device and another device, such as the illumination device, a user may inadvertently power off the first playback device, while intending to only power off the other device.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some examples, such as when the first playback device comprises (or is powered by) a battery, the playback device may detect an input to the button or switch, and then cause the loss or resumption of power by turning off/on a power supply to the first playback device.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A separate or remote button or switch that controls the application of power may be useful if the first playback device is located out of reach of the user, such as when the device is attached to a ceiling or a light fitting.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some examples, the first playback device comprises a battery and the loss of power at the first playback device occurs when the battery is depleted. The first playback device may be a portable playback device that is powered by a battery when it is not coupled to an external power source. When the battery is depleted (i.e., is substantially &#x201c;empty&#x201d;), the first playback device may turn off and stop playback of the media content. The loss of power is therefore a loss of power from the battery.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Similarly, in some examples, the resumption of power to the first playback device occurs when the first playback device is connected to an external power source. An external power source may be a source of AC power, such as mains electricity or utility power. The external power source is a source of power that is external to the first playback device (and the ceiling speaker, in examples where the first playback device forms part of a ceiling speaker).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As briefly mentioned above, in some examples, automatically determining to rejoin the group comprises automatically determining to rejoin the group based on a time period between the loss of power and the resumption of power. For example, if the interruption of power occurs for a &#x201c;short&#x201d; time period (such as less than 5 minutes, 4 minutes, 3 minutes, 2 minutes, 1 minute, 30 seconds, 10 seconds, 5 seconds, etc.), it may be inferred that the loss of power occurred &#x201c;accidentally&#x201d; or against a user's intention, and therefore the user is likely to want the first playback device to rejoin the group once power has resumed. This method may therefore comprise determining to rejoin the group if the time period is less than a threshold time period.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some examples the time period is based on the type of playback device (or another device characteristic). For example, if the first playback device is a portable playback device, the time period may be longer than the time period for a playback device that is part of a ceiling speaker. The longer time period for a portable playback device is because it can allow a user longer to connect the playback device to an external power source, whereas a ceiling speaker may always be coupled to an external power source, and the shorter time period is because a user may need only to operate the button or switch again to resume power.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The time period may be determined by a device separate to the first playback device, such as a networked device. Networked devices include other members of the group playing back media content (such as the second playback device), other playback devices in the playback system, control devices, or computing devices in the cloud. Accordingly, in some examples, the method comprises determining, by a networked device, a time period between the loss of power and the resumption of power. Various methods of determining when the loss and resumption of power occur by the networked device are described later in this document. In a particular example, the networked device determines when the loss of power and resumption of power occur based on a loss/resumption of connectivity with the first playback device. Such a method may therefore comprise determining a time period between the loss of power and the resumption of power, by: after the loss of power and before the resumption of power: determining, by a networked device, a loss of connectivity with the first playback device and storing, by the networked device, a first timestamp associated with the loss of connectivity; and after the resumption of power: determining, by the networked device, a resumption of connectivity with the first playback device and storing, by the networked device, a second timestamp associated with the resumption of connectivity, wherein the time period is a time difference between the first and second timestamps.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some examples, the networked device transmits, to the first playback device, the time period and the first playback device determines whether to rejoin the group based on the time period. In an alternative example, the networked device determines whether the first playback device is to rejoin based on the time period, and transmits, to the first playback device, data indicating whether or not the first playback device is to rejoin.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The time period may be determined by the first playback device itself. Accordingly, the method may further comprise determining, by the first playback device, a time period between the loss of power and the resumption of power. The first playback device may be able to detect when the loss/resumption of power occurs in instances where it detects input to the button or switch, such as where the button or switch provides a control signal rather than itself disconnecting power, and/or where the first playback device has a battery to provide power the playback device even after a loss of another source of power.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In a particular example, the method comprises determining a time period between the loss of power and the resumption of power, by: in after the loss of power and before the resumption of power: detecting, by the first playback device, the loss of power, and storing a first timestamp associated with the loss of power; and after the resumption of power: detecting, by the first playback device, the resumption of power, and storing a second timestamp associated with the resumption of power, wherein the time period is a time difference between the first and second timestamps.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In another example, the method comprises determining a time period between the loss of power and the resumption of power, by: before the loss of power: detecting, by the first playback device, a first input to a button or switch indicating to power off the first playback device, and responsively storing a first timestamp associated with the loss of power; and before the resumption of power: detecting, by the first playback device, a second input to the button or switch indicating to power on the first playback device, and responsively storing a second timestamp, wherein the time period is a time difference between the first and second timestamps.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The period of time and/or one or more associated timestamps and/or the threshold may be stored as one or more state variables by the first playback device and/or a networked device.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some examples, the decision as to whether the first playback device is to rejoin the group is based on a state of charge of the battery. The method may comprise, before the loss of power, monitoring a state of charge of the battery and storing a current state of charge; wherein automatically determining to rejoin the group comprises: determining to rejoin the group based on the current state of charge being less than a threshold. Accordingly, if the battery is determined to have been less than a threshold (i.e., the battery is &#x201c;low&#x201d; or depleted) before the loss of power, it may be assumed that the loss of power was due to a depleted battery, and therefore was against a user's intention. The user may therefore be likely to want the first playback device to rejoin the group. Thus, upon resumption of power, the first playback device can check the state of charge of the battery prior to the loss of power (e.g., by reading the stored current state of charge) and determine whether it was below a certain threshold, such as below 5% of full battery capacity. The state of charge of the battery may be stored as one or more state variables by the first playback device and/or a networked device.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some examples, the monitoring and storing steps are performed by the first playback device. In another example, the monitoring and storing steps are performed by a networked device. In that case, the method may further comprise: before the loss of power, transmitting, by the first playback device to a networked device, the current state of charge of the battery. By receiving the current state of charge from the first playback device, the networked device is effectively monitoring the state of charge of the battery, this is true if the networked device receives and stores only one value or receives and stores a plurality of values. The current state of charge may be transmitted back to the first playback device after the resumption of power so that the first playback device can determine whether to rejoin the group, alternatively the networked device may determine whether the first playback device should rejoin the group and transmit a corresponding command or data to the first playback device.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In this example, the state of charge of the battery before loss of power is used to determine whether the loss of power was due to a depleted or low battery. However, in some examples, the state of charge of the battery after the resumption of power may be used to determine whether to rejoin the group. This is because the battery may still be below a threshold even after the resumption of power (i.e., even after being plugged in to an external power source). Accordingly, the method may instead comprise: after the resumption of power: determining a current state of charge of the battery and determining to rejoin the group based on the current state of charge being less than a threshold. For example, the threshold may be 5% of full battery capacity.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some examples, the decision as to whether the first playback device is to rejoin the group is based on one or more configuration states. Configuration states may include, for example, a device condition, a device identifier, a device property or characteristic, or members of the group prior to the loss of power and/or after the resumption of power. Accordingly, automatically determining to rejoin the group comprises: storing a configuration state of the first playback device and determining to rejoin the group based on the configuration state of the first playback device. As one example, a configuration state may indicate that the first playback device is a portable playback device, such as a SONOS MOVE playback device, and a set of rules (or a look up table) indicate that if the configuration state corresponds to a portable playback device, the playback device is to rejoin the group. As another example, a first configuration state may indicate members of the group prior to the loss of power and a second configuration state may indicate members of the group after the resumption of power. Upon resumption of power, if the first configuration state corresponds to the second configuration state (i.e., the members of the group have not changed), it is determined to rejoin the group. Accordingly, in some examples, the configuration state changes over time and, in other examples, the configuration state remains constant over time. The decision as to whether the first playback device is to rejoin the group may be based on a determination that the configuration state corresponds to a particular configuration state. Alternatively, the decision to rejoin may be based on a comparison of a first and second configuration state.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">As with the time period and the state of charge of the battery, the configuration state(s) may be monitored by the first playback device itself, or by a networked device. The configuration state(s) can be transmitted by the first playback device to a networked device and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">As mentioned, in some examples, the first playback device comprises a battery and is further electrically couplable to an external power source. Accordingly, the loss of power at the first playback device comprises loss of power from the external power source and the resumption of the power comprises resumption of power from the external power source. The method comprises: prior to the loss of power, powering the first playback device by the external power source; in response to the loss of power: powering the first playback device by the battery; and after the resumption of power: powering the first playback device by the external power source.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Accordingly, in some examples, the first playback device comprises a battery and is coupled to an external power source. When there is a loss of power from the external power source (because a user operated a switch, for example), the playback device may continue to run on battery power. This can allow the playback device to perform other operations, such as informing the other members of the group that it has left the group or is about to leave the group.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some examples, where the playback device comprises a battery, the method further comprises after the loss of power: powering the first playback device by the battery for a predetermined period of time; and automatically determining to rejoin the group comprises determining that the first playback device is being powered by the battery. Accordingly, in some examples, the battery may only power the first playback device for a certain length of time, such as less than 5 minutes. If, before expiry of this period of time, there is a resumption of power, it may be determined that the playback device is to rejoin the group. The fact that the first playback device is being powered by the battery may serve as an indicator that a short period of time has passed since the loss of power from the external power source. During this predetermined period of time, the device may be operating in a standby mode, and after the predetermined period of time, the device may be operating in an offline mode.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some examples, the method comprises, after the loss of power: outputting, by the first playback device, an audible alert. The audible alert serves to notify a user that the first playback device has experienced a loss of power and is no longer a member of the group (or is about to leave the group). In some examples, the first playback device may comprise a battery to enable the audible alert to be output even after the loss of power. The audible alert may be output by a speaker/transducer of the first playback device. In another example, one of the other members of the group additionally or alternatively output an audible alert in response to the loss of power at the first playback device.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The method may further comprise, after joining the first playback device to the group: determining, by the first playback device, that the members of the group are currently playing back media content and responsively playing back, by the first playback device, the media content in synchrony with at least the second playback device. Accordingly, as the first playback device rejoins the group, the device determines that the other members are still playing back media content. In some examples, however, after joining the first playback device to the group the method comprises determining, by the first playback device, that the members of the group are not currently playing back media content. In that case, the first playback device may await a command or instruction to play back media content.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In another embodiment, a playback device comprises: an interface configured to receive media content for playback, a speaker for reproducing the audio content, a storage, a power supply and a processing system. The storage comprises non-transitory computer-readable instructions that, when executed by the processing system, instruct the playback device to: play back, via the speaker, the media content in synchrony with at least a second playback device, wherein the playback device and the second playback devices are playing back the media content as members of a group; and while playing back the media content, and after a loss of power from the power supply: stop playback of the media content. The instructions further instruct the playback device to, after the loss of power, and after a resumption of power from the power supply: automatically determine to rejoin the group and join the playback device to the group.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some examples, the power supply comprises a battery and the loss of power at the playback device occurs when the battery is depleted.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some examples, the instructions, when executed by the processing system, further instruct the playback device to automatically determine to rejoin the group based on a time period between the loss of power and the resumption of power.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some examples, the instructions, when executed by the processing system, further instruct the playback device to: before the loss of power, monitor a state of charge of the battery and store, in the storage, a current state of charge; and automatically determine to rejoin the group based on the current state of charge being less than a threshold.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some examples, the instructions, when executed by the processing system, further instruct the playback device to: store, in the storage, a current configuration state of the playback device; and determine to rejoin the group based on the current configuration state of the playback device.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some examples, the power supply comprises a battery and an interface to couple the playback device to an external power source, wherein the loss of power at the playback device comprises a loss of power from the external power source and wherein the resumption of the power comprises a resumption of power from the external power source, wherein the instructions, when executed by the processing system, further instruct the playback device to: prior to the loss of power, power the playback device by the external power source; after the loss of power: power the playback device by the battery; and after the resumption of power: power the playback device by the external power source.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In a particular example, the playback device is a ceiling speaker. In other words, the playback device forms at least part of the ceiling speaker.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some examples, the ceiling speaker further comprises an illumination device. The instructions, when executed by the processing system, may instruct the illumination device to: prior to the loss of power, emit visible light from the illumination device; after a loss of power: cease to emit the visible light from the illumination device; and after the loss of power, and after a resumption of power: emit visible light from the illumination device. The loss/resumption of power may therefore also cause a loss/resumption of power to the illumination device.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some examples, the instructions, when executed by the processing system, further instruct the playback device to output, using the speaker, an audible alert after the loss of power.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In another embodiment, there is a playback device comprising: an interface configured to receive media content for playback, a speaker for reproducing the audio content, a storage, a power supply and a processing system. The storage comprises computer-readable instructions that, when executed by the processing system, instruct the playback device to perform any of the method steps described above or herein.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In another embodiment, there is provided a non-transitory computer-readable medium having computer program instructions embodied thereon, wherein the computer program instructions, when executed by a processing system of a playback device, instruct the playback device to: play back media content in synchrony with at least a second playback device, wherein the playback device and the second playback devices are playing back the media content as members of a group; while playing back the media content, and after a loss of power at the playback device: stop playback of the media content; and after the loss of power, and after a resumption of power to the playback device: automatically determine to rejoin the group and join the playback device to the group.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In another embodiment, there is a system comprising: a playback device as described above or herein; and a separate button or switch coupled to the playback device and configured to selectively control the application of power to the playback device from the power source.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some examples, the button or switch is configurable between a first state and a second state, wherein: in the first state, power is not supplied to the playback device from the external power source; and in the second state, power is supplied to the playback device from the external power source. Transitioning from the second state to the first state (in response to user input, for example) causes a loss of power at the first playback device and transitioning from the first state to the second state causes a resumption of power at to first playback device. For example, the button or switch may be coupled into a power supply circuit for the playback device, such as a mains supply circuit for a light-fitting to which the playback device is fitted. In other examples, the button or switch may be a remote control for the playback device sending control signals to cause the playback device to power on or power off.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In another embodiment, there is provided a method of recovering a first playback device from a loss of power, the method comprising: after a loss of power, and in response to a resumption of power to the first playback device: automatically determining to rejoin a group and joining the first playback device to the group, wherein as a member of the group, the first playback device is configured to play back media content in synchrony with at least a second playback device.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">While some examples described herein may refer to functions performed by given actors such as &#x201c;users,&#x201d; &#x201c;listeners,&#x201d; and/or other entities, it should be understood that this is for purposes of explanation only.

Suitable Playback Device Configurations</p><p id="p-0123" num="0117"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>I through <b>1</b>M</figref> show example configurations of playback devices in zones and zone groups. Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>M</figref>, in one example, a single playback device may belong to a zone. For example, the playback device <b>110</b><i>g </i>in the second bedroom <b>101</b><i>c </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) may belong to Zone C. In some implementations described below, multiple playback devices may be &#x201c;bonded&#x201d; to form a &#x201c;bonded pair&#x201d; which together form a single zone. For example, the playback device <b>110</b><i>l </i>(e.g., a left playback device) can be bonded to the playback device <b>110</b><i>m </i>(e.g., a right playback device) to form Zone B. Bonded playback devices may have different playback responsibilities (e.g., channel responsibilities). In another implementation described below, multiple playback devices may be merged to form a single zone. For example, the playback device <b>110</b><i>h </i>(e.g., a front playback device) may be merged with the playback device <b>110</b><i>i </i>(e.g., a subwoofer), and the playback devices <b>110</b><i>j </i>and <b>110</b><i>k </i>(e.g., left and right surround speakers, respectively) to form a single Zone D. In another example, the playback devices <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>n </i>can be merged to form a merged group or a zone group <b>108</b><i>b</i>. The merged playback devices <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>n </i>may not be specifically assigned different playback responsibilities. That is, the merged playback devices <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>n </i>may, aside from playing audio content in synchrony, each play audio content as they would if they were not merged.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0118">Each zone in the media playback system <b>100</b> may be provided for control as a single user interface (UI) entity. For example, Zone A may be provided as a single entity named Master Bathroom. Zone B may be provided as a single entity named Master Bedroom. Zone C may be provided as a single entity named Second Bedroom.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0119">Playback devices that are bonded may have different playback responsibilities, such as responsibilities for certain audio channels. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>I</figref>, the playback devices <b>110</b><i>l </i>and <b>110</b><i>m </i>may be bonded so as to produce or enhance a stereo effect of audio content. In this example, the playback device <b>110</b><i>l </i>may be configured to play a left channel audio component, while the playback device <b>110</b><i>m </i>may be configured to play a right channel audio component. In some implementations, such stereo bonding may be referred to as &#x201c;pairing.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0126" num="0120">Additionally, bonded playback devices may have additional and/or different respective speaker drivers. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>J</figref>, the playback device <b>110</b><i>h </i>named Front may be bonded with the playback device <b>110</b><i>i </i>named SUB. The Front device <b>110</b><i>h </i>can be configured to render a range of mid to high frequencies and the SUB device <b>110</b><i>i </i>can be configured render low frequencies. When unbonded, however, the Front device <b>110</b><i>h </i>can be configured render a full range of frequencies. As another example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>K</figref> shows the Front and SUB devices <b>110</b><i>h </i>and <b>110</b><i>i </i>further bonded with Left and Right playback devices <b>110</b><i>j </i>and <b>110</b><i>k</i>, respectively. In some implementations, the Right and Left devices <b>110</b><i>j </i>and <b>110</b><i>k </i>can be configured to form surround or &#x201c;satellite&#x201d; channels of a home theater system. The bonded playback devices <b>110</b><i>h</i>, <b>110</b><i>i</i>, <b>110</b><i>j</i>, and <b>110</b><i>k </i>may form a single Zone D (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>M</figref>).</p><p id="p-0127" num="0121">Playback devices that are merged may not have assigned playback responsibilities, and may each render the full range of audio content the respective playback device is capable of. Nevertheless, merged devices may be represented as a single UI entity (i.e., a zone, as discussed above). For instance, the playback devices <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>n </i>in the master bathroom have the single UI entity of Zone A. In one embodiment, the playback devices <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>n </i>may each output the full range of audio content each respective playback devices <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>n </i>are capable of, in synchrony.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0122">In some embodiments, an NMD is bonded or merged with another device so as to form a zone. For example, the NMD <b>120</b><i>b </i>may be bonded with the playback device <b>110</b><i>e</i>, which together form Zone F, named Living Room. In other embodiments, a stand-alone network microphone device may be in a zone by itself. In other embodiments, however, a stand-alone network microphone device may not be associated with a zone. Additional details regarding associating network microphone devices and playback devices as designated or default devices may be found, for example, in previously referenced U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/438,749.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0123">Zones of individual, bonded, and/or merged devices may be grouped to form a zone group. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>M</figref>, Zone A may be grouped with Zone B to form a zone group <b>108</b><i>a </i>that includes the two zones. Similarly, Zone G may be grouped with Zone H to form the zone group <b>108</b><i>b</i>. As another example, Zone A may be grouped with one or more other Zones C-I. The Zones A-I may be grouped and ungrouped in numerous ways. For example, three, four, five, or more (e.g., all) of the Zones A-I may be grouped. When grouped, the zones of individual and/or bonded playback devices may play back audio in synchrony with one another, as described in previously referenced U.S. Pat. No. 8,234,395. Playback devices may be dynamically grouped and ungrouped to form new or different groups that synchronously play back audio content.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0124">In various implementations, the zones in an environment may be the default name of a zone within the group or a combination of the names of the zones within a zone group. For example, Zone Group <b>108</b><i>b </i>can have be assigned a name such as &#x201c;Dining+Kitchen&#x201d;, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>M</figref>. In some embodiments, a zone group may be given a unique name selected by a user.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0125">Certain data may be stored in a memory of a playback device (e.g., the memory <b>112</b><i>b </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>) as one or more state variables that are periodically updated and used to describe the state of a playback zone, the playback device(s), and/or a zone group associated therewith. The memory may also include the data associated with the state of the other devices of the media system, and shared from time to time among the devices so that one or more of the devices have the most recent data associated with the system.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0126">In some embodiments, the memory may store instances of various variable types associated with the states. Variables instances may be stored with identifiers (e.g., tags) corresponding to type. For example, certain identifiers may be a first type &#x201c;a1&#x201d; to identify playback device(s) of a zone, a second type &#x201c;b1&#x201d; to identify playback device(s) that may be bonded in the zone, and a third type &#x201c;c1&#x201d; to identify a zone group to which the zone may belong. As a related example, identifiers associated with the second bedroom <b>101</b><i>c </i>may indicate that the playback device is the only playback device of the Zone C and not in a zone group. Identifiers associated with the Den may indicate that the Den is not grouped with other zones but includes bonded playback devices <b>110</b><i>h</i>-<b>110</b><i>k</i>. Identifiers associated with the Dining Room may indicate that the Dining Room is part of the Dining+Kitchen zone group <b>108</b><i>b </i>and that devices <b>110</b><i>b </i>and <b>110</b><i>d </i>are grouped (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>L</figref>). Identifiers associated with the Kitchen may indicate the same or similar information by virtue of the Kitchen being part of the Dining+Kitchen zone group <b>108</b><i>b</i>. Other example zone variables and identifiers are described below.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0127">In yet another example, the media playback system <b>100</b> may store variables or identifiers representing other associations of zones and zone groups, such as identifiers associated with Areas, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>M</figref>. An area may involve a cluster of zone groups and/or zones not within a zone group. For instance, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>M</figref> shows an Upper Area <b>109</b><i>a </i>including Zones A-D, and a Lower Area <b>109</b><i>b </i>including Zones E-I. In one aspect, an Area may be used to invoke a cluster of zone groups and/or zones that share one or more zones and/or zone groups of another cluster. In another aspect, this differs from a zone group, which does not share a zone with another zone group. Further examples of techniques for implementing Areas may be found, for example, in U.S. application Ser. No. 15/682,506 filed Aug. 21, 2017 and titled &#x201c;Room Association Based on Name,&#x201d; and U.S. Pat. No. 8,483,853 filed Sep. 11, 2007, and titled &#x201c;Controlling and manipulating groupings in a multi-zone media system.&#x201d; Each of these applications is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In some embodiments, the media playback system <b>100</b> may not implement Areas, in which case the system may not store variables associated with Areas.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">III.

The main body <b>210</b> can house any components of the playback device <b>204</b> (which includes any or all of the components described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C, <b>1</b>D, <b>1</b>F or <b>1</b>G</figref>), and the illumination device <b>206</b>. For example, the components (e.g., transducers, electronics <b>112</b>) of the playback device <b>204</b> may be housed together or separately. It will be appreciated that in other examples, the speaker grille <b>204</b> and light <b>206</b> may take different forms and/or be arranged differently. The ceiling speaker <b>202</b> may also be referred to as a ceiling unit or speaker unit or light unit or ceiling light, in certain examples.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0130"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> also depicts a button or switch <b>214</b>, separate to (i.e., arranged remote from) the ceiling speaker <b>202</b>. The button or switch <b>214</b> (referred to hereinafter as a &#x201c;switch&#x201d; for brevity) is electrically and/or communicatively coupled to the ceiling speaker <b>202</b> (and therefore also to the playback device <b>204</b> and the illumination device <b>206</b>). The switch <b>214</b> may comprise one or more buttons, knobs, dials, touch-sensitive surfaces, displays, or touchscreens, for example, and may be mounted on or attached to a surface (e.g., wall or counter).</p><p id="p-0137" num="0131">A user can provide an input to the switch <b>214</b>, to selectively control the application of power to the ceiling speaker <b>202</b> from a power source, such as mains power or another an external power source. Accordingly, a user can operate the switch <b>214</b> to turn on and off the ceiling speaker <b>202</b> (and therefore the playback device <b>204</b> and illumination device <b>206</b>). For example, if the switch is in a first state (such as being arranged in an &#x201c;off&#x201d; position), power is not supplied to the playback device <b>204</b> or the illumination device <b>206</b>. In that case, media content may not be played back by the playback device <b>204</b> and light may not be emitted from the illumination device <b>206</b>. User input can cause the switch to change to a second state. In this second state (such as being arranged in an &#x201c;on&#x201d; position), power is supplied to the playback device <b>204</b> and the illumination device <b>206</b>. In that case, media content may be played back by the playback device <b>204</b> and light may be emitted from the illumination device <b>206</b>. Switch <b>214</b> may therefore be a bistable device.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0132">In some implementations, the switch <b>214</b> may be a wireless or remote device that is configured to communicate and control an external power source via a network. As yet another example, a remote device in addition to or instead of the switch <b>214</b> can be used to control the external power source and/or other functionality (e.g., music playback).</p><p id="p-0139" num="0133">As will be explained in more detail below, the ceiling speaker <b>202</b> may comprise a battery, as well as being connected/connectable to an external power source. In such examples, the switch <b>214</b> selectively controls the application of power from the external power source. Thus, when the switch <b>214</b> is in the first (OFF) state, certain components of the ceiling speaker <b>202</b>, such as the playback device <b>204</b>, may still be powered by the battery, at least temporarily.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0134"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of at least a portion of a media playback system <b>300</b>, comprising the ceiling speaker <b>202</b>, the switch <b>214</b>, a network <b>104</b>, a control device <b>130</b><i>a</i>, and one or more additional playback devices.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the external power source <b>304</b> is coupled to the ceiling speaker <b>202</b> via the switch <b>214</b>. For example, one or more electrical wires are physically connected to the switch <b>214</b>. As shown, one or more further electrical wires are physically connected between the switch <b>214</b> and the ceiling speaker <b>202</b>. In this way, power can flow from the external power source <b>304</b> to the ceiling speaker <b>202</b> via the switch <b>214</b>. Operation of the switch <b>214</b> can interrupt the flow of power from the external power source <b>304</b> to the ceiling speaker <b>202</b>, which in turn causes a loss of power at the ceiling speaker <b>202</b>, and therefore the playback device <b>204</b> and illumination device <b>206</b>.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0136">As briefly mentioned, in some examples, the ceiling speaker <b>202</b> further comprises an internal power source, such as a battery <b>204</b><i>b</i>. In this example, the battery <b>204</b><i>b </i>is depicted as being part of the playback device <b>204</b>, however, in other examples, the battery <b>204</b><i>b </i>may be arranged anywhere within the ceiling speaker <b>202</b>. In some arrangements, the ceiling speaker <b>202</b> may not comprise an internal power source and may instead be powered solely by the external power source <b>304</b>.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0137">In certain examples, the battery <b>204</b><i>b </i>acts as a backup or redundant power source, should there be a loss of power from the external power source <b>304</b>. In some examples, the ceiling speaker <b>202</b> may be simultaneously powered by the battery <b>204</b><i>b </i>and the external power source <b>304</b>. In arrangements where the ceiling speaker <b>202</b> comprises a battery <b>204</b><i>b</i>, operation of the switch <b>214</b> can therefore still cause a loss of power at the ceiling speaker <b>202</b> by causing a loss of power from the external power source <b>304</b>. The battery <b>204</b><i>b </i>may have a capacity sufficient to sustain power usage of ceiling speaker <b>202</b> for a few minutes (e.g., 5 minutes) after loss of power to enable the ceiling speaker <b>202</b> to shut itself down.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0138">The ceiling speaker <b>202</b> may further comprise a network interface to facilitate the transmission of data between the ceiling speaker <b>202</b> and one or more other devices on the data network <b>104</b>. The network interface may be part of the ceiling speaker <b>202</b>, and/or may be integrated with the playback device <b>204</b> and/or illumination device <b>206</b>. As described previously, a network interface is configured to transmit and receive data corresponding to media content and other signals. The network interface may provide a wired and/or a wireless transmission of data.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0139">In some examples, the switch <b>214</b> also comprises a network interface to facilitate the transmission of data between the switch <b>214</b> and one or more other devices on the data network <b>104</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a communication link (shown with a dashed line) between the switch <b>214</b> and network <b>104</b>. Data may therefore be transmitted between the switch <b>214</b> and ceiling speaker <b>202</b> indirectly via the network <b>104</b>. However, in other examples, data may additionally or alternatively be transmitted directly between the switch <b>214</b> and ceiling speaker <b>202</b>. The network interface may provide a wired and/or a wireless transmission of data.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0140"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an alternative arrangement of the media playback system <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In contrast to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the external power source <b>304</b> of this example is directly coupled to the ceiling speaker <b>202</b>, rather than being coupled via the switch <b>214</b>.

In a first example, the switch <b>214</b> is physically coupled via one or more electrical wires. In this first example arrangement, operation of the switch <b>214</b> causes an interruption in the flow of power from the external power source <b>304</b> to the ceiling speaker <b>202</b> by breaking an electrical connection within the ceiling speaker <b>202</b> itself. In a second example, the switch <b>214</b> comprises a network interface to facilitate the transmission of data between the switch <b>214</b> and the ceiling speaker <b>202</b>. Data may be transmitted via wired or wireless means between the switch <b>214</b> and ceiling speaker <b>202</b> via the network <b>104</b> or may additionally or alternatively be transmitted directly between the switch <b>214</b> and ceiling speaker <b>202</b>. In this second example arrangement, operation of the switch <b>214</b> causes a data signal to be transmitted to a network interface of the ceiling speaker which causes a component of the ceiling speaker <b>202</b> to interrupt the flow of power from the external power source <b>304</b> to the ceiling speaker <b>202</b> by breaking an electrical connection within the ceiling speaker <b>202</b>. Suitable components include relays and solid-state switches.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0142">Accordingly, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and in the first example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, operation of the switch <b>214</b> causes a direct interruption of power, whereas in the second example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, operation of the switch <b>214</b> causes an indirect interruption of power, via the transmission of data which causes the ceiling speaker <b>202</b> to disconnect from power.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0143">In the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, the playback device <b>204</b> of the ceiling speaker <b>202</b> can be grouped with other playback devices in the playback system <b>300</b>. For example, as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>M</figref>, a group may be formed comprising the playback device <b>204</b> and at least a second playback device <b>302</b>. When arranged in the group, the playback devices <b>204</b>, <b>302</b> can be configured to play back the same media content in synchrony, from an audio content source. Playback devices within a group may be referred to as &#x201c;members&#x201d; of the group.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0144"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> depicts at least part of a playback system comprising a group of playback devices. In this example, the group comprises the playback device <b>204</b>, a second playback device <b>302</b> and a third playback device <b>306</b>. Here, the playback device <b>204</b> is referred to as a first playback device <b>204</b>. The dashed line surrounding the playback devices <b>204</b>, <b>302</b>, <b>306</b> illustrates members of the group. As such, at this moment in time, the first, second and third playback devices <b>204</b>, <b>302</b>, <b>306</b> are all members of the group. In this particular example, the group are playing back media content in synchrony. For example, a user has instructed the group of playback devices to play back a particular queue of media items, via a control device (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0151" num="0145">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, the switch <b>214</b> is arranged in the second (ON) state.

In examples where the first playback device <b>204</b> forms part of a ceiling speaker <b>202</b> and the ceiling speaker <b>202</b> also has an illumination device <b>206</b>, light may also be emitted by the illumination device <b>206</b> when the switch <b>214</b> is arranged in this second (ON) state.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0146"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> depicts the playback system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> at a later point in time. As is shown, the switch <b>214</b> is arranged in the first (OFF) state. As an example, the first playback device <b>204</b> is arranged in the master bathroom <b>101</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, and a user may operate the switch <b>214</b> after having been in the bathroom. Operating the switch <b>214</b> results in a loss of power at the first playback device <b>204</b>. As such, the first playback device <b>204</b> leaves the group, and so stops playing back media content. The group therefore no longer contains the first playback device <b>204</b>, and instead has only two members&#x2014;the second and third playback devices <b>302</b>, <b>306</b>. Assuming there are still media items in the playback queue, the second and third playback devices <b>302</b>, <b>306</b> will continue uninterrupted play back of media content in synchrony as members of the group. If the ceiling speaker <b>202</b> was operating as the group coordinator of the group at the time of loss of power, group coordinator responsibilities may be handed off to the second or third playback devices <b>302</b>, <b>206</b> including, for example, storing, tracking, or management of the playback queue. In some instances, storing, tracking, or management of the playback queue may be performed by a remote server in the cloud network, and the remote server may redirect playback queue responsibilities to the new group coordinator or other playback device in the group. When power is restored to the ceiling speaker <b>202</b>, the ceiling speaker may adopt the playback queue of the group by, for example, rejoining the group, requesting the playback queue from the remote server, and/or obtaining the queue from another playback device in the system. In examples where the first playback device <b>204</b> forms part of a ceiling speaker <b>202</b> and the ceiling speaker <b>202</b> also has an illumination device <b>206</b> which is in operation, light ceases to be emitted by the illumination device <b>206</b> when the switch <b>214</b> is arranged in this first (OFF) state.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0147">After having operated the switch <b>214</b>, the same user, or another user, may realize that the first playback device <b>204</b> is no longer playing back media content, and therefore operates the switch <b>214</b> again. This operation causes the switch <b>214</b> to move from the first (OFF) state, back to the second (ON) state. Operating the switch <b>214</b> results in a resumption of power to the first playback device <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0148">In some cases, it may be desirable for the first playback device <b>204</b> to rejoin the group so that it can resume playback of media content with other members of the group. For example, if a user turned the switch OFF without realizing that doing so would cause the first playback device <b>204</b> to stop playback of media content, upon resumption of power, it may be determined that the first playback device <b>204</b> should rejoin the group, because this action had been accidental or unintentional. This user behavior may be particularly prevalent in cases where the switch <b>214</b> also has an additional function, such as controlling the illumination device <b>206</b>. Accordingly, based on certain criteria, the playback system may deduce whether it had been intended for the first playback device <b>204</b> to stop playing back the media content, and therefore determine whether to rejoin the group when power is resumed. As one example, if it is determined that the time period between the loss of power and resumption of power was short (for example, less than 5 minutes), it may be automatically determined that the first playback device <b>204</b> is to rejoin the group.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0149">Accordingly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> depicts the playback system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> at a later point in time. As is shown, the switch <b>214</b> is again arranged in the second (ON) state. As an example, the user may operate the switch <b>214</b> immediately after realizing that the previous operation of the switch <b>214</b> had caused the first playback device <b>204</b> to stop playback of media content in the bathroom. Operating the switch <b>214</b> results in a resumption of power to the first playback device <b>204</b> and, in this example, it is automatically determined that the first playback device <b>204</b> is to rejoin the group. The first playback device <b>204</b> therefore rejoins the group, and, assuming there are still media items in the playback queue, resumes playback of media content in synchrony with the first and second playback devices <b>302</b>, <b>306</b>.

In this second state, power is supplied to the portable playback device <b>404</b> (from the battery <b>404</b><i>b</i>), and the portable playback device <b>404</b> is able to play back media content in synchrony with the other members of the group.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0162"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> depicts the playback system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> at a later point in time. As is shown, the switch <b>414</b> is arranged in the first (OFF) state. As an example, the portable playback device <b>404</b> is arranged on the outdoor patio <b>101</b><i>i </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, and a user may operate the switch <b>414</b> because he is about to move indoors, where the second and third playback devices <b>302</b>, <b>306</b> are located. Operating the switch <b>414</b> results in a loss of power at the portable playback device <b>404</b> and, as such, the portable playback device <b>404</b> leaves the group, so stops playing back the media content. The group therefore no longer contains the portable playback device <b>404</b>, and instead has only two members&#x2014;the second and third playback devices <b>302</b>, <b>306</b>. Assuming there are still media items in the playback queue, the second and third playback devices <b>302</b>, <b>306</b> will continue playing back media content in synchrony as members of the group.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0163">Given that the switch <b>414</b> is integrated with the portable playback device <b>404</b>, it may be unlikely that the user accidentally operated the switch. This is in contrast to a separate or remote switch as in the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>5</b>D</figref>, and especially in cases whether the separate switch has an additional purpose (such as controlling an illumination device). Accordingly, it may be assumed that when power is resumed (i.e., the switch <b>414</b> is arranged in the second (ON) state), the portable playback device <b>404</b> is not to rejoin the group. Thus, should the switch <b>414</b> be operated again (and be arranged in the second (ON) state), it may be automatically determined that the portable playback device <b>404</b> is not to rejoin the group.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0164">Accordingly, based on certain criteria, the playback system may deduce that it had been intended for the portable playback device <b>404</b> to stop playing back the media content, and determine not to rejoin the group when power is resumed. As one example, if it is determined that the playback device is a portable playback device (identified by a playback device identifier, for example), it may be automatically determined that the playback device <b>404</b> is not to rejoin the group. As another example, if it is determined that the playback device has an integrated switch <b>414</b>, it may be automatically determined that the playback device is not to rejoin the group.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0165">Accordingly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref> depicts the switch <b>414</b> arranged in the second (ON) state, which results in a resumption of power to the portable playback device <b>404</b> and, in this example, it is automatically determined that the portable playback device <b>404</b> is not to rejoin the group. The portable playback device <b>404</b> therefore does not join the group, and may instead form a separate group. When instructed, the portable playback device <b>404</b> may play back different media content to that being played back by the group containing the first and second playback devices <b>302</b>, <b>306</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>, the group contains the second and third playback devices <b>302</b>, <b>206</b>, but not the portable playback device <b>404</b>.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0166">In another example, it may be determined, based on certain criteria, that a loss of power was not intended, and instead it is determined that the playback device is to rejoin the group when power is resumed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>C</figref> depict such an example.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0167">Accordingly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> depicts at least part of a playback system comprising a group of playback devices.

Further example methods will be described below, in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0174"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> depicts an example method <b>500</b> implemented by one or more devices in a playback system, such as a first playback device. At block <b>502</b>, a first playback device plays back media content in synchrony with at least a second playback device. The first playback device may be, for example, the playback device <b>204</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>5</b>C</figref>, or the portable playback device <b>404</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>9</b>C</figref>. The first and second playback devices are playing back the media content as members of a group, and output audio into an environment. A user may have configured the group using the user interface <b>133</b> of a control device <b>130</b>, for example. In some examples the group comprises just the first and second playback devices, and in other examples the group comprises three or more playback devices, such as in the examples of <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>D, <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>C and <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>C. In a particular example, a user has selected an icon &#x201c;Play Everywhere&#x201d; within the user interface <b>133</b> to cause all available playback devices within the playback system to play back the media content. Accordingly, in this particular example, all playback devices within the playback system form a single group and simultaneously play back the media content. The &#x201c;Play Everywhere&#x201d; icon may be useful if the user is hosting a party, for example, and wishes to play back media in all rooms/areas that contain one or more playback devices. In examples where the user has selected the &#x201c;Play Everywhere&#x201d; icon, a temporary or ad-hoc group may be established until the user deselects the &#x201c;Play Everywhere&#x201d; icon.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0175">As briefly mentioned, members of the group may be identified through one or more state variables. For example, one or more state variables may identify the playback devices as members of a particular group, such as &#x201c;Group 1&#x201d; or a &#x201c;Living Room Group&#x201d; or a &#x201c;Play Everywhere Group&#x201d;. The state variable may be stored in memory <b>112</b><i>b </i>of any or all of the playback devices within the group and/or within memory <b>112</b><i>b </i>of any or all of the playback devices within the playback system. The state variable may additionally or alternatively be stored in memory <b>132</b><i>b </i>of one or more control devices <b>130</b> and/or in memory of one or more computing devices <b>106</b> in a cloud network <b>102</b>. State variables can be transmitted between various devices via network interfaces. For convenience, devices other than the first playback device may be referred to as &#x201c;networked devices&#x201d;. For example, other members of the group, other playback devices in the playback system, control devices and computing devices in the cloud may all be known as networked devices.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0176">At block <b>504</b>, while the members of the group play back the media content, there is a loss of power at the first playback device <b>204</b>, <b>404</b>.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0177">In a first example, as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>B and <b>8</b>B</figref>, the loss of power occurs in response to operation of a button or switch <b>214</b>, <b>414</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, the button or switch <b>214</b> is remote from the first playback device <b>204</b>, and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>, the button or switch <b>414</b> is integrated with the first playback device <b>404</b>. In some examples, operation of the switch causes a loss of power from an external power source <b>304</b> and in other examples, the operation of the switch causes a loss of from an internal power source, such as a battery.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0178">In a second example, as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>, the loss of power occurs in response to a battery of the first playback device <b>404</b> being depleted. For example, a state of charge of the battery falls below a threshold state of charge. The threshold may be the state of charge required to maintain operation of the first playback device as a member of the group, and may not always mean that the battery is fully depleted. In one example, the threshold state of charge is 5% of full battery capacity and, should the state of charge fall below this threshold, the battery is considered depleted. In another example, the threshold is 0% of full capacity.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0179">In some examples, the first playback device may have multiple sources of power, and the loss of power is a loss of power from one or more of the sources of power. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> depict a playback device <b>204</b> (or the ceiling speaker <b>202</b>) having a battery <b>204</b><i>b </i>as well as being connected to an external power source <b>304</b>. The loss of power may therefore be due to a loss of power from the external power source, such as when the switch <b>214</b> is operated. As another example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref> depict a playback device <b>404</b> having a battery <b>404</b><i>b </i>as well as being couplable to an external power source <b>304</b>. The loss of power may therefore be due to a loss of power from the battery <b>404</b><i>b</i>, such as when the battery <b>404</b><i>b </i>is depleted.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0180">In response to the loss of power, the first playback device stops playback of the media content in block <b>506</b>. In some examples, the loss of power causes the first playback device to immediately power off, thereby interrupting playback. For example, operation of a switch may instantaneously break an electrical connection from a power source, thereby causing an immediate loss of power to the first playback device. In other examples, the first playback device may detect an instruction, signal or command to power off or shut down the first playback device. For example, as described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the switch <b>214</b> may comprise a network interface to transmit data to the first playback device <b>204</b>. Receipt of the data by the first playback device <b>204</b> causes the first playback device <b>204</b> to power off, and thereby cause a loss of power. Accordingly, in this example, the first playback device may detect an input to the button or switch, and responsively, turn off the first playback device. Thus, in some examples, there may be a time delay between operation of the switch <b>214</b> and the loss of power. Turning off the first playback device comprises stopping playback of the media content. Thus, in this example, the first playback device is aware that it is to be powered off. When instructed to turn off, the first playback device may also inform the other members of the group and/or other networked devices that it is leaving the group and/or is about to be powered off. This can inform other members of the group that they are no longer required to transmit data, such as media content, to the first playback device.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0181">In either case, the loss of power results in the first playback device stopping playback of media content, and the other remaining members of group continue to play back the media content. Block <b>506</b> may comprise the first playback device leaving the group.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0182">In block <b>508</b>, there is a resumption of power to the first playback device. In a first example, as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>C and <b>8</b>C</figref>, the resumption of power occurs in response to operation of a button or switch <b>214</b>, <b>414</b>. In some examples, the operation of the switch causes a resumption of power from an external power source <b>304</b> and in other examples, the operation of the switch causes a resumption of power from a battery.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0183">In a second example, as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>, the resumption of power occurs in response to the first playback device being connected/coupled to an external power source (after having experienced a loss of power due to a depleted battery).</p><p id="p-0190" num="0184">In some examples, the first playback device may have access to multiple sources of power, and the resumption of power is a resumption of power from one or more of the sources of power. The examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> above include a playback device <b>204</b> (or the ceiling speaker <b>202</b>) having a battery <b>204</b><i>b </i>as well as being connected to an external power source <b>304</b>. The resumption of power may therefore be due to a resumption of power from the external power source, such as when the switch <b>214</b> is operated. The examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref> include a playback device <b>404</b> having a battery <b>404</b><i>b </i>as well as being couplable to an external power source <b>304</b>. The resumption of power may therefore be due to a resumption of power from an external power source, such as when the playback device <b>404</b> is coupled to the external power source <b>304</b>.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0185">After or in response to the resumption of power, in block <b>510</b>, it is automatically determined whether the first playback device is to rejoin the group. As briefly described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>9</b>C</figref>, it is determined whether the first playback device is to rejoin the group based on one or more criteria or rules. Different examples are described below. In this context, &#x201c;automatically determined&#x201d; may mean that the determination to rejoin the group is taken without user intervention or input. For example, the criteria or rules are assessed and a decision is taken to rejoin the group without receiving further input.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Rejoin Group Based on Time Period</heading><p id="p-0192" num="0186">In a first example, after the resumption of power, the decision as to whether the first playback device is to rejoin the group is based on a time period between the loss of power and the resumption of power. Accordingly, one or more devices may determine a first time associated with a loss of power at the first playback device and a second time associated with a resumption of power to the first playback device. The timestamp may be determined based on a counter or other time-based clock. The first time may be recorded as a first timestamp, and the second time may be recorded as a second timestamp, for example. As an example, it may be determined for the first playback device to rejoin the group in cases where the time period (the time difference between the first and second timestamps) is short (such as less than 5 minutes).</p><p id="p-0193" num="0187">It will be appreciated that the first time may not be the exact time at which the loss of power occurred, but may be a time corresponding to an associated event which preceded or followed the loss of power. For example, the first time may instead be the time at which the first playback device one of: (i) stopped playing back the media content, (ii) left the group, (iii) was determined to have left the group by one or more networked devices, (iv) was determined to have disconnected from the network <b>104</b> by one or more networked devices (or lost connectivity with a networked device), (v) detected a loss of power, or (vi) received an instruction or command to power off (such as an input from a switch), etc. Other examples are envisioned. The first time is therefore a time associated with the loss of power, rather than being the exact time at which power was lost. Similarly, the second time may not be the exact time at which there was a resumption of power, but may be a time corresponding to an associated event which preceded or followed the resumption of power. For example, the second time may instead be the time at which the first playback device: (i) detected a resumption of power, (ii) received an instruction or command to power on (such as an input from a switch), (iii) reconnected to the network <b>104</b>, or (iv) was determined to have (re)connected to the network <b>104</b> by one or more networked devices (or resumed connectivity with a networked device), etc. Other examples are envisioned. The second time is therefore a time associated with the resumption of power, rather than being the exact time at which power resumed.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0188">The first playback device may itself determine the time period between the loss of power and the resumption of power. For example, the first playback device may store in persistent or non-volatile storage the first timestamp and the second timestamp, when any of the above events occur. The first and second timestamps could be stored in a log file. Upon resumption of power, the first playback device may therefore determine the time period by determining the time difference between the first and second timestamps. The first playback device may itself be able determine the time period because it comprises a battery and/or because it can detect a loss/resumption of power (such as detecting user input to a switch).</p><p id="p-0195" num="0189">In another example, a networked device may determine the time period between the loss of power and the resumption of power. For example, it may store in memory or other storage the first timestamp and the second timestamp, when any of the above events occur. These events can be inferred by the networked playback device. For example, after the loss of power the networked device may cease to receive periodic transmissions of data (such as state variables and/or acknowledgements and/or keep alive messages) from the first playback device, and therefore determine/deduce that the first playback device has disconnected from the network <b>104</b> and/or has left the group. In another example, the networked device may receive data (such as a state variable) from the first playback device to indicate that the first playback device has experienced a loss of power, and/or is about to leave (or has left) the group. In one example, the first playback device itself determines the first timestamp and transmits this to the networked device. The first playback device may be able to communicate with the networked device even after a loss of power in cases where the first playback device has a battery. The networked device may therefore store in memory or other storage a first timestamp associated with the loss of power.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0190">In some instances, the networked device determining whether the first playback device is no longer part of the group may be the group coordinator of the group. The first playback device can send a message to the group coordinator of the group indicating that the first playback device is ungrouping from the group. In another example, the group coordinator can determine that the first playback device has left the group if the group coordinator can no longer reach the first playback device or is no longer receiving communications from the first playback device for a particular period of time (e.g., 30 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes). For example, the group coordinator may cease receiving communications (e.g., acknowledgement messages, keep alive messages) from the first playback device. After the group coordinator has determined that the first playback device has left group, the group coordinator updates and stores in the state information an indication that the first playback device has left the group, is no longer a member of the group, or is missing from the group or media playback system. The state information may be stored locally in each playback device or in a computing system remote from the media playback system.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0191">Similarly, upon resumption of power, the networked device may begin to receive periodic or aperiodic transmissions of data (such as state variables and/or acknowledgements and/or keep alive messages) from the first playback device, and therefore determine/deduce that the first playback device has (re)connected to the network <b>104</b>. In another example, the networked device may receive data (such as a state variable) from the first playback device to indicate that the first playback device has experienced a resumption of power. The networked device may therefore store in memory a second timestamp associated with the resumption of power. In one example, the first playback device itself determines the second timestamp and transmits this to the networked device or to the remote server.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0192">Upon resumption of power, the networked device may therefore determine the time period by determining the time difference between the first and second timestamps. In some examples, the determined time period is then transmitted from the networked device to the first playback device. In some examples, the networked device does not determine the time period, but instead transmits the first and second timestamps to the first playback device, or another playback device in the group.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0193">Regardless of how the time period is determined, it may be determined that the first playback device is to rejoin the group if the time period is less than a predetermined threshold. Conversely, it may be determined that the first playback device is to not rejoin the group if the time period is greater than the predetermined threshold. The threshold may be about 5 minutes, 4 minutes, 3 minutes, 2 minutes, 1 minute, 30 seconds, 20 seconds, 10 seconds or 5 seconds, for example. If the time period is less than the predetermined threshold, it may be assumed that the loss of power was accidental, and it is likely that a user would like the first playback device to rejoin the group. Such an example was described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, where it was determined that the time period between the first (OFF) state and the second (ON) state was short. Accordingly, based on the time period, it may be determined whether the first playback device is to rejoin the group.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0194">As another example, it may be determined that the first playback device is to rejoin the group based on the time of day. For example, the system may determine that the current time is during quiet hours or sleeping hours (e.g., 2:00 am) and prevent the first playback device from rejoining the group. In some instances, the user may set sleeping hours to start at a predetermined time and turn off when the alarm is activated or turned off.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0195">The determination as to whether the first playback device is to rejoin the group may be made by the first playback device itself, the networked device (such as a control device, a remote computing device, or another playback device). In a particular example, the determination is made by a group coordinator of the group.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">Rejoin Group Based on State of Charge</heading><p id="p-0202" num="0196">In a second example, after the resumption of power, the decision as to whether the first playback device is to rejoin the group may be additionally or alternatively based on the state of charge of an internal power source, such as a battery, being less than a threshold. Accordingly, one or more devices may monitor and determine the current state of charge of the battery of the first playback device and determine whether the first playback device is to rejoin the group based on the current state of charge. The current state of charge may be the state of charge prior to the loss of power (such as immediately before to the loss of power) or may be the state of charge after the resumption of power (such as immediately after the resumption of power). In some examples, the state of charge prior to the loss of power is substantially the same as the state of charge after the resumption of power.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0197">As an example, it may be determined for the first playback device to rejoin the group in cases where the current state of charge of the battery is below a threshold. In such a case, because the state of charge is less than the threshold, it may be inferred that the loss of power was due to a depleted battery. As such, the decision as to whether the first playback device is to rejoin the group may be additionally or alternatively based on a determination that the loss of power was due to a depleted battery.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0198">As mentioned, the state of charge of the battery can be monitored over time. In an example, the first playback device monitors the state of charge of the battery before the loss of power, determines a current state of charge of the battery and stores the current state of charge in persistent or non-volatile storage. In another example, the first playback device determines a current state of charge of the battery and transmits the current state of charge to another networked device, which then stores the current state of charge in memory. In this case, the networked device monitors the state of charge.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0199">The current state of charge may be saved as a state variable named &#x201c;current state of charge&#x201d;, for example. In some examples, the current state of charge state variable is associated with the first playback device.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0200">The current state of charge can be monitored/measured/determined periodically. For example, it may be determined once every 5 minutes, 4 minutes, 3 minutes, 2 minutes, 1 minute, 30 seconds, 20 seconds, 10 seconds, etc. The first playback device (or networked device) may therefore update/overwrite the current state of charge state variable periodically, or may store a history of the state of charge over time.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0201">As mentioned previously, the loss of power may be due to a depletion of the battery and the resumption of power may be due to the first playback device being connected to an external power source. Upon resumption of power, it may be determined whether the loss of power was due to a depleted battery. For example, the current state of charge can be determined. In examples where the current state of charge is the last known state of charge prior to the power loss, the current state of charge can be read from the memory of the first playback device or can be received from a networked device. In examples where the current state of charge is the first known state of charge after the resumption of power, the current state of charge can be read from the memory of the first playback device. The first playback device, or the networked device, can compare the current state of charge with a threshold state of charge and it may be determined that the first playback device is to rejoin the group if the current state of charge is less than the threshold. Conversely, it may be determined that the first playback device is to not rejoin the group if the current state of charge is greater than the threshold. The threshold may be about 5% of full battery capacity, for example. If the current state of charge is less than the threshold, it may be assumed that the loss of power was due to the battery being depleted, and it is likely that a user would like the first playback device to rejoin the group. Such an example was described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>. Accordingly, based on the current state of charge, it may be determined whether the first playback device is to rejoin the group.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0202">The determination as to whether the first playback device is to rejoin the group may be made by the first playback device itself, the networked device (such as a control device, a remote computing device, or another playback device). In a particular example, the determination is made by a group coordinator of the group.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">Rejoin Group Based on a Configuration State</heading><p id="p-0209" num="0203">In a third example, after the resumption of power, the decision as to whether the first playback device is to rejoin the group is based on a configuration state of the first playback device. Accordingly, one or more devices may determine a configuration state of the first playback device and determine whether the first playback device is to rejoin the group based on the configuration state. Configuration states may include, for example, a device condition, a device identifier, a device property or characteristic, or members of the group prior to the loss of power and/or after the resumption of power.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0204">A device condition is data that identifies the current mode or behavior of the first playback device, such as &#x201c;active&#x201d;, &#x201c;standby&#x201d;, &#x201c;offline&#x201d;, &#x201c;low power&#x201d;, &#x201c;charging&#x201d;, &#x201c;using battery power&#x201d;, &#x201c;using external power&#x201d;, &#x201c;portable mode&#x201d;, &#x201c;docked mode&#x201d; etc. A device identifier is data that identifies or is associated with the first playback device. Examples may include a device make or model, such as &#x201c;SONOS MOVE&#x201d;, or an alphanumeric string associated with a particular make or model, such as &#x201c;ASX101&#x201d;. A device property or characteristic is data that identifies a certain feature or component of the first playback device. Examples may identify whether the device &#x201c;has a battery&#x201d;, &#x201c;is portable&#x201d;, &#x201c;has integrated switch&#x201d; or &#x201c;is a ceiling speaker&#x201d;. Members of the group prior to the loss of power may identify the specific devices, or the number of devices, present in the group before the loss of power and members of the group after the resumption of power may identify the specific devices, or the number of devices, present in the group after the resumption of power.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0205">In some examples, the configuration state changes over time, such as a device condition or a listing of the current and previous members of the group. In other examples, the configuration state remains constant over time. Configuration states may be represented as one or more state variables. For example, for configuration states that remain constant over time, the configuration state may be represented as a single state variable and for configuration states that may change over time, the configuration states may be represented by a plurality of state variables, where each state variable is associated with a period in time. In this way, changes in configuration states can be determined.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0206">As an example, the decision as to whether the first playback device is to rejoin the group may be based on a determination that the configuration state corresponds to a particular configuration state. For example, the decision to rejoin may be based on a determination that the device identifier corresponds to a particular device identifier or based on a determination that the device property or characteristic corresponds to a particular device property or characteristic. As one example, the decision to rejoin may be based on a determination that the device is portable and/or has a battery.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0207">As another example, the decision as to whether the first playback device is to rejoin the group may be based on a determination that the configuration state has changed (i.e., a current configuration state does not correspond to a previous configuration state). As a first example, the decision to rejoin may be based on a determination that members of the group prior to the loss of power do not correspond to members of the group after the resumption of power. For example, there may be a change in the members of the group. New members may have been added to the group or existing members may have been removed from the group. If the makeup of the group has been modified (e.g., the number of devices and/or specific devices within the group prior to the loss of power do not correspond to the number of devices and/or specific devices within the group after the resumption of power), it may be determined that the first playback device is not to rejoin the group.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0208">For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the family room <b>101</b><i>d </i>comprises four playback devices <b>110</b><i>h</i>-<i>k </i>in a group, and the group comprises a first playback device. The family room group may be operating to provide surround sound in a home theatre environment, for example. The user may then switch off one or more of the playback devices in the group, including the first playback device, and reconfigure the group to have just two playback devices (for listening to audio, for example). At a later time, the user switches on the first playback device, and may move this device to another room. It is then determined that the members of the family room group prior to the loss of power to the first playback device do not correspond to the members of the family room group after the resumption of power (i.e., there were initially three other devices (not including the first playback device), and there are now only two devices). Accordingly, it is determined that the first playback device is not to rejoin the group. This may be useful because the reconfiguration of the family room group by the user indicates that the user intended these devices to specifically be in the group, and so it may be inferred that no further devices are to automatically join the group.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0209">As another example, the group may include all playback devices in the home such as playback devices in the bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom, and one of the playback devices (e.g., bathroom playback device) in the group loses power. When power is returned to the bathroom playback device, a device in the group (e.g., group coordinator) may determine that the bedroom playback device has been removed from the group, and in response to this change in the membership of the group, the group coordinator and/or bathroom playback device may decide not to rejoin the group that the bathroom playback device was previously a member of.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0210">Conversely, if the number of devices and/or specific devices within the group prior to the loss of power correspond to the number of devices and/or specific devices within the group after the resumption of power, it may be determined that the first playback device is to rejoin the group. Again, referring to the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> discussed above, there may be four playback devices <b>110</b><i>h</i>-<i>k </i>in a group in the family room <b>101</b><i>d</i>, where the group includes the first playback device. The family room group may be operating to provide surround sound in a home theatre environment, for example. There may then be a loss of power to the first playback device. At a later time, after power is resumed to first playback device, it is determined that the members of the family room group prior to the loss of power to the first playback device correspond to the members of the family room group after the resumption of power (i.e., there were initially three other devices (not including the first playback device), and there are still three other devices). Accordingly, it is determined that the first playback device is to rejoin the group.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0211">As a second example, the decision to rejoin may be based on a determination that a device condition has changed. For example, if the first playback device was operating in portable mode prior to the loss of power and is operating in docked mode after the resumption of power, it may be determined that the first playback device is to rejoin the group (i.e., this change may indicate that there was a loss of power due to a depleted battery). Conversely, if the first playback device was operating in portable mode prior to the loss of power and is operating in portable mode after the resumption of power, it may be determined that the first playback device is not to rejoin the group. As a third example, the decision to rejoin may be based on a determination that a device condition has changed. For example, if the first playback device was operating in &#x201c;active&#x201d; mode prior to the loss of power, then was operating in a &#x201c;standby&#x201d; mode and an &#x201c;offline&#x201d; mode after the loss power and before the resumption of power, it may be determined that the first playback device is not rejoin the group. Conversely, if the first playback device was operating in &#x201c;active&#x201d; mode prior to the loss of power, then was operating only in a &#x201c;standby&#x201d; mode after the loss power and before the resumption of power, it may be determined that the first playback device is to rejoin the group. The device may move from the standby mode to the offline mode after a certain period of time, such as after 5 minutes.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0212">The first playback device may itself store one or more configuration states of the first playback device. Additionally, or alternatively, one or more networked devices may store one or more configuration states of the first playback device. A configuration state may therefore be associated with the first playback device.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0213">The determination as to whether the first playback device is to rejoin the group may be made by the first playback device itself, the networked device (such as a control device, a remote computing device, or another playback device). In a particular example, the determination is made by a group coordinator of the group (i.e., a master playback device).</p><p id="p-0220" num="0214">Returning again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, block <b>510</b> comprises automatically determining whether the first playback device is to rejoin the group. Described above are various rules or criteria that may be assessed to make such a determination. It should be noted that the determination may, in some examples, be based on one or more of the above-described criteria. For example, the decision whether to rejoin the group may be based on satisfying two or more criteria, such as being based on one or more of: (i) the time period between the loss of power and the resumption of power being less that a threshold, (ii) the current state of charge being less than a threshold and (iii) based on a configuration state.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0215">If in block <b>510</b> it is determined that the first playback device is to rejoin the group, the method progresses to block <b>512</b>. In block <b>512</b>, the method comprises joining/adding the first playback device to the group. The method of joining may vary or comprise additional or alternative steps depending upon which device determined that the first playback device is to rejoin (whether it was the first playback device itself, or another networked device).</p><p id="p-0222" num="0216">For example, if the first playback device determined it was to rejoin in block <b>510</b>, then the first playback device may transmit a request to join the group to one or more networked devices, such as a control device, another playback device in the group (such as the group coordinator), another playback device in the playback system, or a computing device in the cloud. Receipt of this request may then trigger a grouping procedure. If another networked device determined that the first playback device is to rejoin the group in block <b>510</b>, then the networked device may transmit such an indication to the first playback device. Upon receipt of the indication, the first playback device may transmit a request to join the group to one or more of the networked devices, as described above. These networked devices include an intermediate device and a group coordinator. In one example, the first playback device transmits a request to join the group to an intermediate device, such as a hub. From here, the intermediate device transmits the request to a group coordinator. Receipt of this request by the group coordinator then triggers a grouping procedure. In another example, the first playback device transmits a request to join the group to an intermediate device, such as a hub. Receipt of this request by the intermediate device then triggers a grouping procedure. In a further example, the first playback device transmits a request to join the group to the group coordinator, and the group coordinator may transmit data to the intermediate device indicating that it is adding/joining the first playback device to the group.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0217">The request to join the group command message may comprise at least one of the following data fields: data identifying the group coordinator (or the intermediate device), a household identifier, data identifying the first playback device, an IP address of the first playback device, etc.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0218">In a further example, the grouping procedure may begin without requiring the first playback device to transmit a request. Alternative grouping procedures are envisaged.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0219">After the first playback device has rejoined the group, the method may comprise, in block <b>514</b>, playing back media content in synchrony with the other members of the group. In some examples, block <b>514</b> also comprises determining, by the first playback device, that the members of the group are currently playing back media content. Playing back the media content comprises receiving the media content from a media source.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0220">As an alternative to block <b>514</b>, the method may comprise determining, by the first playback device, that the members of the group are not currently playing back media content. For example, a user may have paused playback or there may be no media items in the playback queue. In response, the first playback device may await receipt of media content and/or await receipt of a command to begin playing back media content.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0221">If in block <b>510</b> it is determined that the first playback device is not to rejoin the group, the method progresses to block <b>516</b>. In block <b>516</b>, the method comprises not joining the first playback device to the group. Not joining the first playback device to the group may comprise forming a second group comprising only the first playback device. In response, the first playback device may await receipt of media content and/or await receipt of a command to begin playing back media content.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0000">Indication that the First Playback Device has been Switched Off</p><p id="p-0229" num="0222">As mentioned above in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>D</figref>, in some examples, the first playback device <b>204</b> (or the ceiling speaker <b>202</b>) may also comprise a battery <b>204</b><i>b</i>. Accordingly, when the switch is arranged in the first (OFF) state in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, the battery <b>204</b><i>b </i>may still provide power to at least some components of the ceiling speaker <b>202</b>, such as the first playback device <b>204</b>. As mentioned, the loss of power comprises loss of power from the external power source <b>304</b> and the resumption of the power comprises a resumption of power from the external power source <b>304</b>. Accordingly, prior to the loss of power, the first playback device is powered by the external power source, and in response to the loss of power, can be powered (at least partially) by the battery. After the resumption of power, the first playback device is again powered by the external power source.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0223">In certain examples, powering the first playback device by the battery may comprise powering the first playback device by the battery for a predetermined period of time, and after the predetermined period of time, ceasing to power the playback device by the battery. In some examples, given that the battery may only power the first playback device for a predetermined period of time after the loss of power, determining whether to rejoin the group in block <b>510</b> may comprise determining whether the first playback device is being powered by the battery. For example, if it is determined that the first playback device is being powered by the battery, it is determined to rejoin the group. Conversely, if it is determined that the first playback device is not being powered by the battery (or is no longer being powered by the battery), it is determined not to rejoin the group.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0224">As a result of having a battery, as well as being couplable to an external power source, the first playback device may also output an audible alert in response to loss of power. The battery can therefore provide power even after the loss of power from the external power source. The audible alert serves to notify a user that the first playback device has experienced a loss of power and is no longer a member of the group (or is about to leave the group). The audible alert may be, for example, an audible tone, such as a chime or alarm, or a spoken information (from a VAS, for example). Upon hearing the audible alert, the user may decide to take mitigating action, such as activate the switch to cause a resumption of power to the first playback device.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0225">In some examples, the first playback device may also output an audible alert in response to loss of power even if the first playback device does not have a battery. For example, as mentioned, the switch <b>214</b> may also comprise a network interface to facilitate the transmission of data between the switch and the first playback device. Operation of the switch can cause data to be transmitted to the first playback device before the first playback device experiences a loss of power. Accordingly, the first playback device may detect an input to the button or switch (i.e., may receive the data from the switch), and responsively, output an audible alert before the loss of power.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">IV.
