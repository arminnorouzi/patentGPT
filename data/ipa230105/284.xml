The mobile device can be configured to run an application program that is configured to communicate with the receiver of the moisture control apparatus, and is able to monitor the temperature, dew point, relative humidity, other moisture parameters, or combinations thereof outside the cooking chamber of the cooking device. The application program can be also configured to communicate to the user the time remaining on the cook, and can allow the user to re-program operating parameters of the moisture control apparatus.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The dispersal portion of the moisture control apparatus can be configured to provide a mist or fog of water particles to a cooking surface of the cooking chamber of the cooking device. The dispersal portion is coupled to a wall of the cooking chamber and is coupled to the control portion via a conduit (e.g., conduit for flow of liquid from the control portion into the dispersal portion). The dispersal portion can include at least a first conduit and an elbow connector. The first conduit can have an end coupled to the control portion and configured to receive water from the control portion. One end of the elbow connector can be attached to the opposite end of the first conduit. A misting or fogging nozzle can be attached to the other end of the elbow connector and can be positioned such that an outlet of the nozzle opens to the cooking surface of the cooking chamber.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The misting or fogging nozzle can have a conical dispersal pattern so as to disperse water over the entirety of the food (e.g., meat). If the cooking chamber of the cooking device is larger, additional conduits and tee connectors can be used to provide additional misting or fogging nozzles to adequately disperse water over the food. If additional connectors and conduits are used, the first conduit can be attached to a tee connector. An additional conduit can be attached to the opening located 180&#xb0; from the opening connected to the first conduit. Tee connectors and additional conduits can be included as necessary, with the final conduit being attached to the elbow connector. Each connector can have a misting or fogging nozzle attached thereto and can be positioned such that an outlet of each nozzle opens to the cooking surface of the cooking chamber.
