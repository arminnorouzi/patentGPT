The controller <b>12</b> provides for modulating the signal so that the information communicated to the target customer <b>28</b> via their interface indicates required information including the types of articles, the popularity of articles, the success of promoters, the number or comparative amount (e.g. low, medium, high) of promoters within the vicinity and the number or comparative amount (e.g. low, medium, high) of marked articles within their vicinity.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Thus a target customer <b>28</b> may receive information regarding the number of promoters and/or promoted articles within their communication vicinity or the promoter and/or article characteristics within their communication vicinity (depending on the characteristics they are looking for) thus prompting them to be alert for recording potential marked articles of interest by the system and process provided herein or even providing them with real time identification and position information of the promoter so that they can have direct contact with them.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, there is shown a target customer interface <b>24</b> being simultaneously superimposed on both a merchant interface <b>60</b> and a promoter interface <b>46</b>. In this example, the interface <b>24</b> includes a visual image <b>25</b> via a display <b>64</b> (such as a screen). Thus, when a target customer <b>28</b> captures/records a marker (e.g. M<b>1</b>) of an article (e.g. A<b>1</b>) as provided herein and a match between a marked article (e.g. A<b>1</b>-M<b>1</b>) is made with a merchant controller <b>36</b> (of the merchant that sold the article as provided herein) and of a promoter controller <b>34</b> (of the promoter that is promoting this given article), the main controller <b>12</b> executes the computer irnplementable step of providing the target customer interface <b>28</b> to be superimposed on the merchant interface <b>60</b> (i.e. website) which provides information on the article in question and on the promoter interface <b>46</b> which includes a visual image <b>47</b> (i.e. promoter system profile page) being displayed via display <b>64</b> and which provides information on other articles promoted (i.e. liked or bought or displayed on other occasions) by the promoter as well as links to further merchant interfaces related to those articles in their list. Thus, multiple merchant interfaces can be superimposed by the target customer interface <b>24</b>. Indeed, the target customer <b>28</b> can thus purchase an article or comment on articles appearing on one or more websites in tandem as well as review articles belonging to the same promoter. For example, shoes belonging to a given promoter may incite the target customer to see what other clothing articles this promoter is promoting and as such click on those products to prompt the merchant interfaces belonging to the merchants selling these products to be accessed.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In another embodiment, the promoter may provide marketing information on the marked article in order to further prompt the target customer <b>28</b> from taking action. In yet another embodiment, the marked articles may include further sensors that log information related to the use of the marked article. For example, a marker M<b>4</b> on shoes may log the amount of usage of an shoe such as article A<b>4</b> and this information is logged into the system database <b>32</b> and communicated to the target customer user via superimposed interfaces provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Sensors can include pressure sensors, biosensors, and the like. Thus the target customer <b>28</b> can simultaneously navigate one or more merchant interfaces <b>60</b> and one or more promoter interfaces <b>46</b> by having their interface <b>24</b> and more particularly the visual image <b>25</b> of their interlace tandemly superimposed on the merchant websites <b>60</b> and the promoter system profile pages <b>47</b>. Thus, the user can simultaneously navigate the one or more merchant websites and the one or more profile pages <b>47</b> or portions thereof.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The present system and method provide for a target customer user to access data regarding articles that are being used by people in their visual surroundings. Thus, a potential customer no longer needs to remember a pair of sneakers, a purse, a jacket or a bicycle they saw on the street, the bus, the park or the supermarket and try to find it online later on in the day. A potential customer can simply use their mobile handheld unit in a marker capturing proximity of the article to capture a marker if one is available and thus access data related to the article via the merchant controller as explained above to take an action such as purchasing the article. The user can also access information provided by the promoter related to the article as explained above and thus have hands on review from the person they saw using it or even a performance analysis from the sensors logging article use information as provided herein. Thus, a potential customer has real-time and accurate access to data related to an article they encountered in public display as well as a review, performance data and of course purchasing information directly from the merchant.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In an embodiment, the system and method herein provide for an ambient environment shopping area where system users can provide input on the articles they are wearing, riding on, carrying or otherwise associated with in public display. These comments, opinions and even sensor-based performance reports as well as the purchase information for real-time purchasing are accessible to other people within the marker capturing proximity in real time. People who like the same activity tend to congregate in common physical areas, gyms, parks, museums and as many of these same people have common apparel (running shoes, coats, watches), therefore there is a greater chance that target customers will find articles of interest in areas they tend to congregate to with like-minded people. Moreover, many of these areas are external and there is no need for packed malls or stores, thus allowing for greater social distancing if required as in pandemic or epidemic circumstances. In addition, people can seamlessly mix their social time with their shopping time.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Of course, the present system and method can still work within traditional shopping outlets. In an embodiment, the merchant controller communicates the availability of the article in stores nearby and provides a reservation for the article for a given period. Thus, the merchant controller communicates with the store controllers for this reservation and allocates a reservation number to the target customer to show the store personnel in order to try out the article and purchase it. In another implementation, the customer user simply orders the article online.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Moreover, the customer user can via a suitable screen such as a tablet or a smart phone having a foldable screen that is enlarged when unfolded, simultaneously via their interface navigate the merchant website (related to the article they captured the marker from) and the promoter system profile (of the promoter publicly promoting the article by using it as it was intended to be used). This &#x201c;in tandem&#x201d; navigation further provides an easy visual assessment of the product from the point of view of a promoter and the purchase information provided by the merchant. Indeed, the system and method provide for a customer user to immediately access information in real time regarding an article they are interested in that is simply displayed in public and have simultaneous visual access to the merchant website for shopping as well as to the promoter's information related to this article in order to take an action including purchasing, commenting and the like as provided herein. The system provides financial incentives to merchants, promoters and customers to thus populate the databanks of the system which results in more marked articles promoted in public by more promoters allowing customers greater access to desired and accurate information, reviews, performance data and the like as well as immediate purchase if desired.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The various features described herein can be combined in a variety of ways within the context of the present disclosure so as to provide still other embodiments.
