These systems generally rely on accurate information regarding the positions of a patient's anatomical features and surgical tools to provide surgical assistance, for example in the form of navigational assistance, robotic automation, or force feedback. To provide this position information, several varieties of tracking systems have been developed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some tracking systems, optical fibers are used to track objects in space. The optical fibers typically used in these systems include a number of sensing sections along their length known as fiber Bragg gratings. A fiber Bragg grating reflects a certain wavelength of light depending in part upon the strain experienced by the optical fiber at the sensing section. By analyzing the reflected wavelengths from multiple gratings, a three-dimensional model of the shape of the optical fiber may be generated. However, conventional fiber optic tracking systems suffer from a number of limitations. The measurement resolution of fiber optic tracking system is limited by the geometry of the hardware, and conventional hardware designs often do not provide sufficient resolution or accuracy for use in computer-assisted surgical systems. Conventional fiber optic tracking systems are also susceptible to errors caused by twisting of the optical fiber and internal friction between the optical fiber and a tube or casing used to protect the fiber, both of which affect the stress on the optical fiber and thus the wavelengths reflected by the fiber Bragg gratings.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, surgical tracking systems are best suited to tracking the position of a single anatomical feature relative to a surgical tool, navigational pointer, etc. Thus, conventional tracking systems may be difficult, impractical, and/or overly invasive to implement when a surgical procedure demands the tracking of multiple anatomical features in a limited amount of space. For example, in a spinal surgery which would benefit from the assistance of a computer-assisted surgical system, the relative positions of the vertebrae may shift by more than two degrees and greater than two millimeters due to patient breathing and the effects of surgical activity (e.g., surgical exposure, discectomy, endplate preparation, decompression, hardware implantation, etc.). If only one spinal segment is tracked in a multi-level procedure, errors in the calculated positions of the other spinal segments resulting from these shifts may be great enough to result in serious damage to critical neurologic structures. Thus, a tracking system well-suited for tracking multiple objects, such as multiple anatomical features, multiple spinal segments, and/or multiple surgical tools or objects, is needed.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One implementation of the present disclosure is a fiber optic tracking sensor. The fiber optic tracking sensor includes at least three optical fibers. Each optical fiber includes a plurality of fiber optic sensors positioned along a length of a sensing portion of the sensor and a shape-memory member coupled to the at least three optical fibers and providing support to the sensor. The at least three optical fibers are arranged in a spaced apart relationship, and each optical fiber is offset from a central longitudinal axis of the sensor.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, the fiber optic sensors include one or more of fiber Bragg gratings or Raleigh scattering, and the optical fiber includes one or more of standard telecommunications fiber, microstructured fiber, or hollow-core fiber. In some embodiments, the spaced apart relationship is an equilateral triangle.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, each optical fiber is surrounded by one of the plurality of tubes and wherein the tube surrounding each optical fiber is in contact with the tubes of the other two or more optical fibers forming a fiber core. The thicknesses of the tubes provides the spaced-apart relationship between the optical fibers and the offset from the central longitudinal axis of the tracking sensor. The fiber optic sensor may also include a sleeve positioned around the fiber core and between the fiber core and an outer tube. The sleeve may be made of one or more of a low-friction material or a thermally-insulating material.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the fiber optic tracking sensor may also include a central optical fiber. The central optical fiber is surrounded by an inner tube. The inner tube is surrounded by the shape-memory member. The shape-memory member includes at least three indentations forming a channel between the inner tube and the shape-memory member for the at least three optical fibers.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the shape-memory member includes a central wire. The fiber optic tracking sensor may include a sleeve surrounding the central wire and an outer tube surrounding the sleeve. The fiber optic tracking sensor may include a slotted tube between the central wire and the low friction sleeve, with the at least three optical fibers positioned in slots of the slotted tube. The central wire may include at least three indentations forming a channel between the central wire and the sleeve. The at least three optical fibers may be positioned at the at least three indentations.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the shape-memory member is made of one or more of a shape memory alloy, nitinol, polyether ether ketone, polytetrafluoroethylene, glass, metal, plastic, aluminum, or steel.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another implementation of the present disclosure is a computer-assisted surgical system. The computer-assisted surgical system includes a computing system including a processing circuit and a tracking circuit and a fiber optic tracking system in communication with the computing system to provide tracking data to the computing system. The fiber optic tracking system includes an interrogator and a sensor. The sensor includes at least three optical fibers, each optical fiber comprising a plurality of fiber optic sensors along a length of a sensing portion of the sensor. The at least three optical fibers are arranged in a spaced apart relationship, each optical fiber offset from a central longitudinal axis of the sensor. The offset of the at least three optical fibers from the central longitudinal axis of the sensor increases the resolution of tracking data for the surgical system.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, the computer-assisted surgical system includes a first attachment device for coupling the sensor to a first anatomical feature of a patient for tracking the first anatomical feature using the fiber optic tracking system and a second attachment device for coupling the sensor to a second anatomical feature of the patient for tracking the second anatomical feature using the fiber optic tracking system.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the computer-assisted surgical system includes an optical tracking system for registering the sensor with the first anatomical feature and the second anatomical feature so that tracking data from the sensor provides information on a position of the first anatomical feature and a position of the second anatomical feature. The computer-assisted surgical system may include a fiducial on the first attachment device.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another implementation of the present disclosure is a method of tracking anatomy of a patient using a fiber optic tracking system. The method includes coupling a fiber optic tracking sensor to the anatomy of the patient. The fiber optic tracking sensor includes at least three optical fibers, with each optical fiber including a plurality of fiber optic sensors along a length of a sensing portion of the sensor. The at least three optical fibers are arranged in a spaced apart relationship. Each optical fiber is offset from a central longitudinal axis of the sensor. The method includes registering the fiber optic tracking sensor with the anatomy to define the relationship between the tracking sensor and the anatomy. The method also includes transmitting light from an interrogator through the tracking sensor and receiving, at the transmitter, reflections from the sensor which provide strain data for the tracking sensor, transmitting the strain data to a tracking circuit to determine the shape of the tracking sensor, and determining a pose of the anatomy based on the shape of the tracking sensor.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, coupling the tracking sensor to the anatomy comprises coupling one or more attachment devices to the anatomy and coupling the tracking sensor to the one or more attachment devices. Each fiber optic sensor may be configured to reflect a particular wavelength of light back to the interrogator based on stress on the optical fiber at a location of the fiber optic sensor.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, registering the tracking sensor comprises using a probe of an optical tracking system to identify one or more points on the anatomy and one or more points on the sensor. In some embodiments, the method includes tracking one or more vertebrae fo the patient's spine.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">This summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting.

detail to exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring generally to the figures, systems and methods for fiber optic tracking are shown. More particularly, a computer-assisted surgical system is shown with a fiber optic tracking system that includes an improved fiber optic sensor. According to various embodiments, the fiber optic sensor includes at least three optical fibers arranged with one or more shape-memory members (e.g., tubes, rods, wires, etc.) and one or more thermally-insulating low-friction sleeves (e.g., made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)) to provide improved measurement resolution and accuracy, minimize twisting- and friction-based errors, and provide thermal insulation to minimize temperature-based errors. The one or more shape-memory members may be formed from any shape-memory material, for example a shape-memory alloy (e.g., nitinol), polyether ether ketone, PTFE, wrapped wire, and other materials including glass, metal (aluminum, steel), plastic, etc. The fiber optic tracking system is structured to simultaneously track the positions of multiple anatomical features, which may be particularly useful for tracking a series of vertebra in a spinal procedure, for example in a spine L<b>4</b> and L<b>5</b> fusion case or a discectomy. As such, the embodiments described herein relate to spinal anatomy and surgical procedures involving the spine. It should be understood that the systems and methods for fiber optic tracking described herein are also well suited for a variety of other surgical applications, for example in hip or knee replacement procedures, and/or for tracking other anatomical structures or bones, and that all such applications are within the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a computer-assisted surgical system <b>100</b> is shown, according to an exemplary embodiment. The computer-assisted surgical system <b>100</b> includes a computing system <b>102</b> communicably and operably coupled to a fiber optic tracking system <b>106</b> and, optionally, an optical tracking system <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the computing system <b>102</b> is also communicably and operably coupled to one or more additional surgical systems <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The computing system <b>102</b> is configured to complete the computing and processing functions of the computer-assisted surgical system <b>100</b> described herein. The computing system <b>102</b> includes a processing circuit <b>110</b> and a tracking circuit <b>112</b>. The processing circuit <b>110</b> includes one or more memory devices and a processor. The processor may be implemented as a general purpose processor, an application specific integrated circuit, one or more field programmable gate arrays, a digital signal processor, a group of processing components, or other suitable electronic processing components. The one or more memory devices (e.g., RAM, ROM, NVRAM, Flash Memory, hard disk storage, etc.) may store data and/or computer code for facilitating at least some of the various processes described herein. In this regard, the memory may include tangible, non-transient computer-readable media. The memory is communicably coupled to the processor and may store computer code for executing (by the processor) one or more processes described herein. When the processor executes instructions stored in the memory, the processor generally configures the computing system to complete such activities.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The tracking circuit <b>112</b> is configured to receive data from the optical tracking system <b>104</b> and, optionally, the fiber optic tracking system <b>106</b>, and analyze that data to determine the positions of multiple anatomical features of a patient. Details of this analysis are described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. As shown, the tracking circuit <b>112</b> is a part of the computing system <b>102</b>. In other embodiments, the tracking circuit <b>112</b> may be a separate, discrete component or be included with another component of the system <b>100</b> (e.g., included as part of the fiber optic tracking system <b>106</b> or the optical tracking system <b>104</b>). It should be understood that the structure of the tracking circuit <b>112</b> is highly configurable. In the example shown, the tracking circuit <b>112</b> is structured as machine-readable media (e.g., non-transient computer readable medium that stores instructions that are executable by a process or processors to perform at least some of the processes described herein) that may be stored in and executed by the processing circuit <b>110</b>. In alternative configurations, the tracking circuit <b>112</b> includes discrete processing components (e.g., processing and memory components with the same or similar configuration as described above for the processing circuit <b>110</b>).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In general, the fiber optic tracking system <b>106</b> is configured to provide data that can be processed to determine the relative positions of anatomical features of a patient. The fiber optic tracking system <b>106</b>, according to an exemplary embodiment, includes a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) interrogator <b>120</b> and a sensor <b>122</b>. The sensor <b>122</b> includes three optical fibers (fiber A <b>124</b>, fiber B <b>126</b>, and fiber C <b>128</b>). Each optical fiber <b>124</b>-<b>128</b> includes a series of fiber optic sensors, such as fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) <b>130</b>, distributed substantially evenly along a sensing portion <b>132</b> of the sensor <b>122</b>. In alternative embodiments, various other types of fiber optic sensors may be used, including fiber optic sensors based on Rayleigh scattering. The optical fibers <b>124</b>-<b>128</b> may include standard telecommunications fiber, microstructured fiber, or hollow-core fiber.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In various embodiments, various distributions and arrangements of the FBGs <b>130</b> along the optical fibers <b>124</b>-<b>128</b> are possible. For example, in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, each optical fiber <b>124</b>-<b>128</b> includes a plurality of FBGs <b>130</b> (e.g., fifteen FBGs <b>130</b>, twenty FBGs <b>130</b>, etc.) spaced apart along the length of the sensing portion <b>132</b>. As one illustrative example, in some embodiments each optical fiber <b>124</b>-<b>128</b> includes twenty FBGs <b>130</b> spaced approximately fifteen millimeters apart, so that the sensing portion <b>132</b> is approximately three hundred millimeters long (i.e., approximately one foot long). In other embodiments the FBGs <b>130</b> are positioned immediately adjacent to one another (i.e., zero spacing in between) and/or positioned to overlap one another. It should be understood that different numbers of FBGs <b>130</b>, different spacing of the FBGs <b>130</b>, and/or a different length of the sensing portion <b>132</b> are possible.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">A greater number of FBGs <b>130</b> and tighter spacing between the FBGs <b>130</b> may provide for better accuracy of the fiber optic tracking system <b>106</b> while also requiring greater computational power to process the data provided by the fiber optic tracking system <b>106</b>. An optimal number of FBGs <b>130</b> and/or spacing or overlap of FBGs <b>130</b> may therefore be determined by balancing improved accuracy versus increased computational expense associated with processing data from a greater number of FBGs <b>130</b>. Accordingly, various embodiments consistent with the present disclosure include overlapping FBGs <b>130</b> and a spacing of FBGs <b>130</b> between zero and three centimeters.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, for example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the FBGs <b>130</b> in fiber A <b>124</b>, fiber B <b>126</b>, and fiber C <b>128</b> are substantially aligned across fibers <b>124</b>-<b>128</b>, such that the FBGs <b>130</b> are grouped in triplets forming a sensing point corresponding to a particular position along the sensing portion <b>132</b>. In other embodiments, the FBGs <b>130</b> are not or need not be substantially aligned across the fibers <b>124</b>-<b>128</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">FBGs <b>130</b> are configured to reflect a particular wavelength of light while passing other wavelengths of light. The wavelength of light reflected by a particular FBG <b>130</b> shifts as the stress on the fiber at the position of the particular FBG <b>130</b> changes (i.e., a particular amount of wavelength shift from a reference wavelength corresponds to a particular amount of strain). In each fiber <b>124</b>-<b>128</b>, each FBG <b>130</b> is tuned such that the possible reflected wavelengths are different for each FBG, facilitating differentiation between light reflected by each FBG <b>130</b> and ensuring that the wavelengths that can be reflected by a downstream FBG <b>130</b> reach that FBG <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The interrogator <b>120</b> provides broad spectrum light to the fibers <b>124</b>-<b>128</b>, and receives light with the wavelengths reflected by the FBGs <b>130</b> in return. Because of the tuning of the FBGs <b>130</b>, for each fiber <b>124</b>-<b>128</b> the return signal includes a differentiable wavelength corresponding to particular FBG <b>130</b>. The interrogator <b>120</b> measures the wavelengths present in the return signal and provides the measured wavelengths to the computing system <b>102</b> for analysis. In alternative embodiments, a time division multiplexing interrogator is used that differentiates between the reflected light from each FBG based on the speed of light in in the fiber and the amount of time it takes for the reflected light to return to the interrogator.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The fiber optic tracking system <b>106</b> thereby provides a data point (e.g., wavelength) for each of the FBGs <b>130</b> that indicates the strain on the fiber at the location of the corresponding FBG <b>130</b>. The data therefore includes measurements of the strain on fiber A <b>124</b>, the strain on fiber B <b>126</b>, and the strain on fiber C <b>128</b> at discrete locations along the sensing portion <b>132</b> of the sensor <b>122</b>. As described in detail below, these data points can be used to generate a three-dimensional model of the sensor <b>122</b>. A sample can be repeatedly taken over time, at some cases at a high frequency, to provide updated data that can be used to dynamically update the three-dimensional model.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">A connecting portion <b>134</b> of the sensor <b>122</b> connects the sensing portion <b>132</b> to the interrogator <b>120</b>, where each fiber <b>124</b>-<b>128</b> is received by a separate port <b>136</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the connecting portion <b>134</b> may be any suitable length, thereby allowing the sensing portion <b>132</b> to be positioned in a sterile surgical field while the interrogator <b>120</b> is positioned outside of the sterile surgical field. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>, the sensor <b>122</b> may be coupled to a plurality of anatomical features and the interrogator <b>120</b> is positioned away from the sensing area. The wavelength data collected by the interrogator <b>120</b> is then used by the computing system <b>102</b> to simultaneously track the positions of the plurality of anatomical features. In other examples, the sensor <b>122</b> may be coupled to multiple surgical tools (e.g., cutting guides, retractors, burrs, saws, etc.) to simultaneously track the positions of the surgical tools. In other examples, the sensor <b>122</b> is coupled to a probe to track the position of the probe. In still other examples, the sensor <b>122</b> may be coupled to one or more elements of additional surgical systems <b>108</b> (e.g., surgical robot, handheld robotic device, etc.) to track the positions of one or more elements of the additional surgical systems <b>108</b>. For example, the sensor <b>122</b> may be coupled to various portions (e.g., joints, arms, end effectors, etc.) of a surgical robot to track the relative position of those various portions. In various other examples, the sensor <b>122</b> is coupled to a variety of one or more anatomical features, probes, surgical tools, robotic devices, etc. to simultaneously track a variety of types of objects.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The additional surgical systems <b>108</b> are systems, tools, accessories, etc. that provide assistance for the completion of a surgical procedure based, at least in part, on the tracking data provided by the fiber optic tracking system <b>106</b>. In some embodiments, for example, the additional surgical systems <b>108</b> include a surgical robot. Based in part on data from the fiber optic tracking system <b>106</b>, the surgical robot controls a surgical tool to carry out one or more surgical tasks. In some cases, the surgical robot is automatically actuated to complete one or more surgical tasks autonomously. In some cases, the surgical robot provides force feedback to a user to confine a surgical tool mounted on the surgical robot within a boundary defined relative to the tracked anatomy.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, the additional surgical systems <b>108</b> include a handheld robotic device. The handheld robotic device includes one or more actuators coupled to an end effector. The handheld robotic device is configured to control an end effector (e.g., a surgical too) in six degrees of freedom based on the position of the handheld robotic device, for example the handheld robotic device relative to one or more anatomical features of a patient and/or relative to a virtual control object generated by the computing system <b>102</b>. The handheld robotic device thereby facilitates the completion of a surgical task using the end effector. In some cases, the handheld robotic device may be coupled to the sensor <b>122</b> and tracked by the fiber optic tracking system <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Another example of an additional surgical system <b>108</b> that may be included in system <b>100</b> is a navigation system including a pointer and a display screen. The pointer (e.g., a probe) includes an optical tracker that can be tracked by the optical tracking system <b>104</b> and/or the fiber optic tracking system <b>106</b>. The display screen may display a representation of the pointer and a representation of the patient's anatomy to assist a surgeon in navigating the surgical field (e.g., to help a surgeon determine where to make an incision, determine an orientation at which to insert an implant or other surgical hardware, and/or to track surgical tools, etc.). The display may show the results of pre-operative or intraoperative imaging (e.g., CT, MRI, ultrasound), registered to the patient's anatomy using the optical tracking system <b>104</b>. In addition to registering the patient's anatomy, the intraoperative imaging can also register the shape of the fiber to improve the intraoperative tracking. Many varieties and combinations of additional surgical systems <b>108</b> that provide surgical assistance based on the improved tracking capabilities of the computer-assisted surgical system <b>100</b> may be included with the computer-assisted surgical system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The optical tracking system <b>104</b> is configured to facilitate a registration process for establishing a relationship between the sensor <b>122</b> and the patient's anatomy. In some embodiments, the optical tracking system <b>104</b> is also configured to register and track one or more components of the addition surgical system(s) <b>108</b> relative to the sensor <b>122</b> and the patient's anatomy. Accordingly, in the embodiment shown herein, the optical tracking system <b>104</b> includes fiducials that may be placed on various components of system <b>100</b>, a probe including one or more fiducials, and an optical tracker configured to detect the three-dimensional position of the fiducials. The probe may be touched to various points along the sensor <b>122</b> and at corresponding points on the patient's anatomy to determine a geometric relationship between the sensor <b>122</b> and the anatomy, which will remain substantially constant as the anatomy shifts. The geometric relationship is then used by the computing system <b>102</b> in translating the wavelength data provided by the fiber optic tracking system <b>106</b> into a model of the three-dimensional positions of anatomical features. Fiducials coupled to a tool, pointer, robotic arm, etc. of the additional surgical system(s) <b>108</b> are tracked by the optical tracker relative to fiducials coupled to the sensor <b>122</b> (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The computing system <b>102</b> is configured to use this tracking data to control the additional surgical systems <b>108</b> to provide guidance, navigation, force feedback, and/or automated robotic control based on a determination of the relative positions of the component(s) of the additional surgical system(s) and the patient's anatomical features.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">While an optical tracking system <b>104</b> is used for registration of the fiber optic tracking system <b>106</b> and other tracking functions in the embodiments shown herein, it should be understood that the fiber optic tracking system <b>106</b> may be used as a stand-alone tracking system, or may be used in combination with a variety of registration systems and methods. For example, in some embodiments, the fiber optic tracking system <b>106</b> is used in combination with an optical tracking system, a mechanical tracking system, an electromagnetic tracking system, and/or an inertial guidance system included in the computer-assisted surgical system <b>100</b> and used for registration of the sensor <b>122</b> and/or for tracking components of the additional surgical system(s) <b>108</b>. In some embodiments, one or more additional fiber optic tracking systems <b>106</b> are included for use in registration of the sensor <b>122</b> and/or for tracking components of the additional surgical system(s) <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some embodiments, the computer-assisted surgical system <b>100</b> includes a camera (i.e., video camera, RGB camera). In such embodiments, the camera may capture an image or series of images (i.e., video) of the sensor <b>122</b>. The computing system <b>102</b> receives the image or images from the camera and uses a machine vision (i.e., image recognition) approach to identify the shape of the sensor <b>122</b> in the image or images. The shape of the sensor <b>122</b> identified based on the image(s) from the camera may then be used to facilitate registration of the sensor <b>122</b>. The shape of the sensor <b>122</b> extracted from the image(s) from the camera may also compared to a shape of the sensor determined based on data from the fiber optic tracking system <b>106</b> to validate, calibrate, or otherwise improve the accuracy of the results of the fiber optic tracking system <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-B</figref>, perspective views of the fiber optic tracking system <b>106</b> in use in two surgical applications are shown, according to exemplary embodiments. More particularly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows the fiber optic tracking system <b>106</b> in use for tracking three anatomical features along the spine of a patient (i.e., to facilitate a spinal procedure). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> shows the fiber optic tracking system <b>106</b> in an example use to facilitate a procedure involving a patient's knee. The fiber optic tracking system <b>106</b> may also be used to track more or fewer anatomical features or objects (e.g., two, four, five, six, etc.) as needed for a particular procedure using a similar configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-B</figref>. Furthermore, it should be understood that the fiber optic tracking system <b>106</b> can be used for tracking various bones for various other types of procedures, for example, for tracking the bones of a hip joint for a hip procedure, bones in a shoulder for a shoulder procedure, bones in a foot for a foot procedure, etc. In various other cases, the fiber optic tracking system <b>106</b> may be used to track soft tissue (e.g., ligaments, muscles, organs, etc.), surgical tools, or various other objects relating to various surgical procedures, including for open or minimally invasive surgical approaches.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows the sensor <b>122</b> coupled to attachment devices, shown as a base <b>202</b>, a first bone clamp <b>204</b>, and a second bone clamp <b>206</b>. Various other attachment devices are contemplated by the present disclosure. The base <b>202</b> includes a pair of rods <b>210</b> coupled to the patient's sacrum, a crosspiece <b>212</b> joining the rods <b>210</b> and adjustably positionable along a height of the rods <b>210</b>, a fiducial member <b>215</b> extending from the crosspiece <b>212</b> away from the patient's sacrum, and a sensor clamp <b>214</b> extending from the crosspiece <b>212</b> towards the sacrum between the rods <b>210</b>. The sensor clamp <b>214</b> couples the sensor <b>122</b> to the base <b>202</b>, and the position of the crosspiece <b>212</b> is adjustable along the rods <b>210</b> to allow the distance between the sensor <b>122</b> and the sacrum to be adjusted.

The example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows a posterior approach to the spine, while the fiber optic tracking system <b>106</b> may also be suitable for anterior and lateral approaches including with an open, minimally invasive, or percutaneous approach.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> shows an example application of the fiber optic tracking system <b>106</b> for a knee procedure (e.g., total knee arthroplasty, partial knee arthroplasty). The base <b>202</b> is coupled to the patient's femur, and the first bone clamp <b>204</b> is clamped onto the patient's tibia. The sensor <b>122</b> is coupled to the base <b>202</b> and the first bone clamp <b>204</b> and runs from the base <b>202</b> to the first bone clamp <b>204</b>. The sensor <b>122</b> is secured with a fixed geometric relationship to the femur and a fixed geometric relationship to the tibia. The fiber optic tracking system <b>106</b> is thereby positioned to track the relative positions (location, orientation, etc.) of the femur and the tibia, for example to facilitate a knee arthroplasty procedure. Various other applications of the fiber optic tracking system <b>106</b> are contemplated by the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, the fiber optic tracking system <b>106</b> may be used in a minimally-invasive procedure.

In other implementations, the sensor <b>122</b> may be inserted into the patient (e.g., into a patient's bone, skin, etc.). For example, the sensor <b>122</b> may be included in a flexible endoscope or other minimally-invasive tool or robotic device. The sensor <b>122</b> may provide percutaneous or subcutaneous tracking.

In general, the sensor <b>122</b> is structured to maintain a geometric relationship between fiber A <b>124</b>, fiber B <b>126</b>, and fiber C <b>128</b>, protect the fibers <b>124</b>-<b>128</b> from damage, prevent twisting of the sensor <b>122</b>, limit thermal response of the FBGs <b>130</b>, and limit friction within the sensor <b>122</b>. In preferred embodiments, the geometric relationship is a spaced apart relationship between the fibers, with each fiber offset from the central longitudinal axis of the sensor <b>122</b>. In some embodiments, three fibers form an equilateral triangle.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Each fiber <b>124</b>-<b>128</b> is positioned within a casing <b>302</b>, and may be adhered (e.g., glued, otherwise coupled) to the corresponding casing <b>302</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, each casing <b>302</b> includes two concentric tubes (first tube <b>304</b> and second tube <b>306</b>) with circular cross-sections. The first tube <b>304</b> has an inner radius substantially similar to the radius of each fiber <b>124</b>-<b>128</b> and an outer radius substantially similar to an inner radius of the second tube <b>306</b>. The second tube <b>306</b> thereby fits snuggly around the first tube <b>304</b>, and the first tube <b>304</b> fits snuggly around a fiber <b>124</b>-<b>128</b> (i.e., fiber A <b>124</b>, fiber B <b>126</b>, or fiber C <b>128</b>). The first tube <b>304</b> and the second tube <b>306</b> are preferably made of nitinol, but may also be made of other suitable shape-memory materials (e.g. shape memory alloy, steel, aluminum).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The three second tubes <b>306</b> are positioned abutting one another, such that the casing <b>302</b> for each fiber (e.g., fiber A <b>124</b>) abuts the casings <b>302</b> for both of the other fibers (e.g., fiber B <b>126</b> and fiber C <b>128</b>). The casings <b>302</b> have substantially equal radii, and are positioned such that the fiber A <b>124</b>, fiber B <b>126</b>, and fiber C <b>128</b> form an equilateral triangle in the cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.

The low-friction sleeve <b>308</b> is preferably made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) (e.g., Teflon) or other material that slides with low friction along the casings <b>302</b> and provides thermal insulation. The low-friction sleeve <b>308</b> minimizes friction as bending of the sensor <b>122</b> causes the casings <b>302</b> and the fibers <b>124</b>-<b>128</b> to shift slightly along the length of the sensor <b>122</b>. The low-friction sleeve <b>308</b> thereby helps to minimize errors in the strain measurements of the FBGs <b>130</b> caused by friction. The low-friction sleeve <b>308</b> also provides thermal insulation for the fibers <b>124</b>-<b>128</b>, minimizing the risk of errors that might otherwise be caused by temperature changes in the fibers <b>124</b>-<b>128</b>. The low-friction sleeve <b>308</b> also allows for relative longitudinal rotation of the fibers <b>124</b>-<b>128</b> and the casings <b>302</b> to release torsional stress in the fibers <b>124</b>-<b>128</b>, improving the accuracy of the sensor <b>122</b>.

The outer tube <b>310</b> provides an outer, circular structure to the sensor <b>122</b> that supports the geometric relationship between fibers <b>124</b>-<b>128</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>4</b></figref>. The outer tube <b>310</b> fits snuggly around the low-friction sleeve <b>308</b>. The outer tube <b>310</b> is preferably made of nitinol, although other suitable shape-memory materials may be possible. The diameter of the outer tube <b>310</b> is between one and two millimeters, in the embodiment shown.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Nitinol is a preferred material for the first tube <b>304</b>, the second tube <b>306</b>, and the outer tube <b>310</b> due to its high elasticity, allowing the sensor <b>122</b> to be bent into a wide range of geometries to follow a patient's anatomical features (e.g., to join the base <b>202</b>, first bone clamp <b>204</b>, and second bone clamp <b>206</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> across a variety of possible arrangements) while still providing support and protection for the fibers <b>124</b>-<b>128</b>. Nitinol can be deformed up to 5% strain without damage, allowing the sensor <b>122</b> to be bent without damage. As another example, the outer tube <b>310</b> prevents non-path-based influences from altering the strain measured by the FBGs <b>130</b> by protecting the fibers <b>124</b>-<b>128</b> from pressure applied on the sensor <b>122</b> by the sensor clamps <b>214</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>230</b>, patient tissue, or other object. The casings <b>302</b> (i.e., first tubes <b>304</b> and second tubes <b>306</b>) similarly protect the fibers <b>124</b>-<b>128</b> from pressure or other influences potentially exerted by the neighboring casings <b>302</b> or the low-friction sleeve <b>308</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The offset between the fibers <b>124</b>-<b>128</b> in a sensor <b>122</b> designed according to the exemplary embodiments provides a significant increase in resolution as compared to conventional fiber optic approaches that use a single fiber. The maximal measurement resolution of an FBG sensor is determined by a scalar multiple of the offset between a neutral line along the center of the sensor and the FBGs. In a conventional, single fiber shape-sensing product, the offset is limited by the radius of the fiber and is therefore typically around <b>40</b>-<b>60</b> microns. In contrast, the sensor <b>122</b> includes three fibers <b>124</b>-<b>128</b> all separated from a neutral line that runs along a central axis <b>350</b> of the sensor <b>122</b>, substantially increasing the offset between the FBGs <b>130</b> and the neutral line. In preferred embodiments, the offset in the sensor <b>122</b> is approximately <b>400</b> microns. In some embodiments, the offset of the sensor <b>122</b> is greater than <b>400</b> microns. The measurement resolution of the sensor <b>122</b> is therefore roughly tenfold better than the resolution of conventional optical fiber sensors.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a visualization <b>500</b> of the kinematic model used by the tracking circuit <b>112</b> in determining the shape of the sensor <b>122</b> is shown, according to an exemplary embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows arc A <b>502</b> representing fiber A <b>124</b>, arc B <b>504</b> representing fiber B <b>126</b>, arc C <b>506</b> representing fiber C <b>128</b>, and neutral arc <b>508</b> that represents a center line extending along a central axis of the outer tube <b>310</b> (i.e., a central axis of the sensor <b>122</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> also shows an structural arc <b>510</b> corresponding to a secondary backbone of the sensor <b>122</b>.

The arcs <b>502</b>-<b>506</b> represent a segment of the sensing portion <b>132</b> corresponding to a triplet of FBGs <b>130</b> (i.e., an FBG <b>130</b> on each of fiber A <b>124</b>, fiber B <b>126</b>, and fiber C <b>128</b>).</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The tracking circuit <b>112</b> receives wavelength data from the fiber optic tracking system <b>106</b> associated with the strains on each fiber <b>124</b>-<b>128</b> at a series of points (i.e., the positions of the FBGs) along the sensing portion <b>132</b> of the sensor <b>122</b>. The strain on a fiber <b>124</b>-<b>128</b> at a particular point corresponds to a degree of curvature of that fiber <b>124</b>-<b>128</b> at that point. Additionally, the relative strain on the three fibers <b>124</b>-<b>128</b> at the particular point can be compared to determine a direction of the curvature at that point. That is, given the fixed geometric relationship of the fibers <b>124</b>-<b>128</b> in the sensor <b>122</b>, differences between the strain (and thus the degrees of curvature) experienced by the individual fibers <b>124</b>-<b>128</b> indicate that the sensor <b>122</b> curves towards the fiber(s) <b>124</b>-<b>128</b> with the lower degrees of curvature.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">For example, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, arc A <b>502</b> has the lowest degree of curvature, arc B <b>504</b> has a slightly higher degree of curvature, and arc C <b>506</b> has the greatest degree of curvature of the three arcs <b>502</b>-<b>506</b>. Given those relative degrees of curvature (i.e., relative strains) and the fixed geometric relationship between the three fibers <b>124</b>-<b>128</b> in the equilateral triangle of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, only one direction of curvature of the sensor <b>122</b> (i.e., of the neutral arc <b>508</b>) is possible, namely mostly towards fiber C <b>128</b> (i.e., arc C <b>506</b>) and slightly towards fiber B <b>126</b> (i.e., arc B <b>504</b>) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Based on this analysis and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the path of the neutral arc <b>508</b> can be characterized by two parameters, namely a bending angle &#x3b8; (shown by indicator <b>520</b>) and a twisting angle <b>6</b> (shown by indicator <b>522</b>). The bending angle &#x3b8; describes the degree to which the neutral arc <b>508</b> (and thus the sensor <b>122</b>) is bent within a bend plane <b>512</b>. The twisting angle <b>6</b> characterizes the rotation about the z-axis of the bend plane relative to the preceding bend plane. To model the three-dimensional shape of the sensor <b>122</b>, the tracking circuit <b>112</b> determines &#x3b8; and &#x3b4; for a plurality of segments of the sensor <b>122</b> and combines the resulting curves to generate an overall three-dimensional shape.

The sensor <b>122</b> may then be registered using the optical tracking system <b>104</b>. That is, the relationship between fiducial member <b>215</b> and sensor clamp <b>214</b> may be determined using the optical tracking system <b>104</b> and an optical probe, and then that relationship may be used to register the overall shape of the sensor <b>122</b> to a coordinate system used by the optical tracking system <b>104</b>.
