For example, a moderator may wish to understand attendee engagement and attendee questions associated with the online meeting so that the moderator can adjust content presentation as needed. Recognizing attendee engagement and topics of importance, however, can be difficult for a moderator that is presenting content. In addition to the difficulties and time consumption associated with a moderator effectively managing an online meeting, unnecessary computing and network resources are often consumed. For example, in some cases, an attendee may be disengaged from an online meeting (e.g., no longer present for the meeting, interacting with other systems, devices, or applications, etc.). In such a case, the attendee device may be consuming unnecessary resources to present the online meeting on the attendee device and/or to capture a video of the attendee. As another example, in cases that a presentation is being presented during an online meeting, which is not an interactive session, the attendee device may be consuming unnecessary resources to capture a video of the attendee. In addition, network resources (e.g., bandwidth) to transfer the audio and/or video streams over the network may be unnecessarily consumed. As another example, assume a number of messages, such as questions or comments, are input into the chat box during the online meeting. In addition to the time required by a moderator to review the messages, computing resources are used to process multiple scroll inputs and/or multiple screen rendering updates.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Various aspects of the technology described herein are generally directed to systems, methods, and computer storage media for, among other things, facilitating efficient online meeting management based on attendee engagement and message input.

However, the description itself is not intended to limit the scope of this patent. Rather, the inventors have contemplated that the claimed subject matter might also be embodied in other ways, to include different steps or combinations of steps similar to the ones described in this document, in conjunction with other present or future technologies. Moreover, although the terms &#x201c;step&#x201d; and &#x201c;block&#x201d; may be used herein to connote different elements of methods employed, the terms should not be interpreted as implying any particular order among or between various steps herein disclosed unless and except when the order of individual steps is explicitly described.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Overview</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Meeting management systems operate to provide teleconferencing, telecommuting, distance education, and social relations services. In particular, meeting management systems generally perform computing tasks to facilitate meetings among various individual or groups. For example, meeting management systems support scheduling, attendance tracking, user session mediation, and recording and distributing meeting content (e.g., audio and visual content, transcriptions of same, presentation materials). With the advancements of meeting management systems, a moderator, or presenter, may more often lead or conduct an online meeting (e.g., a class presentation). While moderating or presenting at an online meeting, a moderator may wish to manage the meeting to be most valuable to attendees. For example, a moderator may wish to understand attendee engagement of the online meeting so that the moderator can adjust content presentation as needed. For instance, in cases in which an attendee or set of attendees is disengaged from the online meeting, a moderator may desire to ask questions or otherwise engage the attendee(s). As another example, a moderator may wish to identify questions or comments that are more relevant or important to the attendees. Recognizing attendee engagement and topics of importance, however, can be difficult for a moderator that is presenting content. Recognition of attendee engagement is further complicated when attendees are not visible over video. Further, recognition of relevant or important topics can be difficult for a moderator, particularly when numerous questions or comments are input into a chat box during the meeting.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In addition to the difficulties and time consumption associated with a moderator effectively managing an online meeting, unnecessary computing and network resources are often consumed. For example, in some cases, an attendee may be disengaged from an online meeting (e.g., no longer present for the meeting, interacting with other systems, devices, or applications, etc.). In such a case, the attendee device may be consuming unnecessary resources to present the online meeting on the attendee device and/or to capture a video of the attendee. As another example, in cases that a presentation is being presented during an online meeting, which is not an interactive session, the attendee device may be consuming unnecessary resources to capture a video of the attendee. In addition, network resources (e.g., bandwidth) to transfer the audio and/or video streams over the network may be unnecessarily consumed. As another example, assume a number of messages, such as questions or comments, are input into the chat box during the online meeting. In addition to the time required by a moderator to review the messages, computing resources are used to process multiple scroll inputs and/or multiple screen rendering updates.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Accordingly, embodiments described herein are directed to facilitating efficient online meeting management, among other things, based on attendee engagement and message input. Advantageously, efficiencies of computing resources and moderator efforts can be enhanced using implementations described herein. In particular, in some embodiments, in accordance with an identified attendee engagement, computing resources can be preserved. For example, in cases in which an attendee is identified as disengaged, the attendee's video and/or audio connection may be terminated (or prompted for termination) or throttled to reduce unnecessary utilization of video and/or audio. By disconnecting or throttling an attendee's video and/or audio stream, utilization of computing resources of the attendee device is reduced as well as utilization of network resources communicating such video and/or audio streams.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In other embodiments, computing resources are preserved in accordance with identifying similar or relevant messages. In particular, messages identified as similar can be clustered to aggregate the messages. The clustered messages, or a representation thereof (e.g., a selected message of the cluster or a newly generated message to represent the cluster), can be presented to a moderator, for example, in a sorted or ranked order (e.g., based on number of messages for the cluster). In this regard, similar messages can be clustered, thereby reducing computing resources that may otherwise be used to process multiple scroll inputs to view all the messages and/or multiple screen rendering updates.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In operation, to facilitate meeting management in a resource efficient manner, embodiments herein include an engagement manager to manage attendee engagement and a message manager to manage messages input by attendees. In managing attendee engagement, engagement metrics may be determined for attendees, individually and/or as a group. Such engagement metrics generally indicate an extent of engagement for a particular attendee or for a set of attendees. As described herein, various types of engagement data may be used to determine engagement metrics. By way of example only, emotion data indicating emotion of an attendee(s), distraction data indicating a level of distraction of an attendee, interaction data indicating a level of interaction with the meeting, connection data indicating a level of signal connection strength, influx/outflux data indicating number or movement of individuals in the camera view, and/or the like may be used to identify engagement metrics. Based on the engagement metric, an action may be taken to enhance attendee engagement and/or conserve computing and/or network resources. For example, prompts or notifications can be provided to the moderator to alert the moderator as to engagement levels or provide suggestions for improving engagement levels. As another example, video and/or audio streams may be disconnected, or requested or suggested for disconnection, to conserve resources.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In managing messages for a meeting, messages may be collected and clustered based on similarity of message content relative to one another. The clustered messages may be scored and/or ranked, for example, to indicate a frequency value of similar messages. The clustered messages, or representations thereof, can then be presented to the moderator to facilitate efficiency of reviewing messages input by attendees that the moderator may desire to address. Various implementations are described herein, and the examples provided herein are not intended to be limiting.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Overview of Exemplary Environments for Facilitating Meeting Management Based on Attendee Engagement and Message Input</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a block diagram of an exemplary network environment <b>100</b> suitable for use in implementing embodiments of the invention is shown. Generally, the system <b>100</b> illustrates an environment suitable for facilitating efficient online meeting management, among other things, based on attendee engagement and message input. The network environment <b>100</b> includes attendee devices <b>102</b>A-<b>102</b>N (generally referred to herein as attendee device(s) <b>102</b>), a moderator device <b>104</b>, a meeting management engine <b>106</b>, a data store <b>108</b>, and data sources <b>110</b>A-<b>110</b>N (referred to generally as data source(s) <b>110</b>). The attendee device <b>102</b>, the moderator device <b>104</b>, the meeting management engine <b>106</b>, the data store <b>108</b>, and the data sources <b>110</b> can communicate through a network <b>112</b>, which may include any number of networks such as, for example, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, a cellular network, a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, a mobile network, or a combination of networks. The network environment <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an example of one suitable network environment and is not intended to suggest any limitation as to the scope of use or functionality of embodiments of the technology disclosed throughout this document. Neither should the exemplary network environment <b>100</b> be interpreted as having any dependency or requirement related to any single component or combination of components illustrated therein. For example, the attendee device <b>102</b>, the moderator device <b>104</b>, and the data sources <b>110</b> may be in communication with the meeting management engine <b>106</b> via a mobile network or the Internet, and the meeting management engine <b>106</b> may be in communication with data store <b>108</b> via a local area network. Further, although the environment <b>100</b> is illustrated with a network, one or more of the components may directly communicate with one another, for example, via HDMI (high-definition multimedia interface), DVI (digital visual interface), etc. Alternatively, one or more components may be integrated with one another, for example, at least a portion of the meeting management engine <b>106</b> and/or data store <b>108</b> may be integrated with the attendee device <b>102</b> or moderator device <b>104</b>. For instance, a portion of the meeting management engine <b>106</b> configured to manage online meetings may be performed via an attendee device and/or a moderator device, while another portion may be performed via a server in communication with such devices.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The attendee devices <b>102</b> and moderator device <b>104</b> can be any kind of computing device capable of participating in online meetings. For example, in an embodiment, the attendee devices <b>102</b> and moderator device <b>104</b> can be a computing device such as computing device <b>1100</b>, as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. In embodiments, the devices can be a personal computer (PC), a laptop computer, a workstation, a mobile computing device, a PDA, a cell phone, or the like.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The attendee devices <b>102</b> and moderator device <b>104</b> can include one or more processors, and one or more computer-readable media. The computer-readable media may include computer-readable instructions executable by the one or more processors. The instructions may be embodied by one or more applications, such as meeting application <b>120</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The meeting application(s) may generally be any application capable of facilitating online meetings. In some implementations, the meeting application <b>120</b> comprises a web application, which can run in a web browser, and could be hosted at least partially server-side. In addition, or instead, the meeting application <b>120</b> can comprise a dedicated application. In some cases, the application is integrated into the operating system (e.g., as a service).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In embodiments, content may be presented via a meeting application <b>120</b> operating on the attendee device <b>102</b> and/or moderator device <b>104</b>. In this regard, the attendee device <b>102</b> and/or moderator device <b>104</b>, via meeting application <b>120</b>, might be used to present, view, and/or hear content. Content may refer to any type of audio content and/or electronic content, such as a document, an image, a video, a live video, a slide deck, a file, online/web content, or the like. As such, a meeting application <b>120</b> may be used to present such various content. For example, MICROSOFT TEAMS may be a meeting application <b>120</b> to present content. The meeting application <b>120</b> can include any type of application that facilitates online meetings. Further, the meeting application <b>120</b> can obtain content in any manner, such as via data source <b>110</b>. In this way, data source <b>110</b> may communicate or provide content to the attendee device <b>102</b> and/or moderator device <b>104</b> (e.g., via network <b>112</b>). As described, a meeting application may be a stand-alone application, a mobile application, a web application, or the like. In some cases, the functionality described herein may be integrated directly with an application or may be an add-on, or plug-in, to an application.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Meeting application <b>120</b> generally enables communication between computing devices (e.g., attendee device <b>102</b> and moderator device <b>104</b>). In embodiments, video and/or audio communications may occur over a network. Accordingly, meeting attendees may communicate with one another over video and/or audio technologies. Such communications may provide videos including individuals or other content (e.g., documents via desktop sharing). In this regard, meeting application <b>120</b> may operate to obtain data via one or more sensors, such as microphones, cameras, etc. that may reside within the attendee and/or moderator device or operate remote such devices.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Meeting application <b>120</b> may operate on both the attending devices and the moderator device. The attendee devices <b>102</b> generally represent devices accessed or operated by attendees of an online meeting. An attendee may join the online meeting via audio and/or video. The moderator device <b>104</b> generally represents a device accessed or operated by a moderator of the online meeting. As can be appreciated, the moderator may be a presenter of the meeting or another individual moderating or managing the meeting. For example, a moderator of the meeting may be a class instructor of an online class being conducted via the meeting application <b>120</b>. As another example, a moderator may be a presenter or initiator of the meeting being conducted via meeting application <b>120</b>. In some cases, the moderator may be a host, or individual that initiates or establishes an online meeting, but need not be the case. As described herein, using various implementations, the moderator may be presented with information that is different from that presented to other meeting attendees. For example, a moderator may be presented with engagement metrics and/or message metrics, as described more fully herein. In embodiments, engagement metrics and/or message metrics may be shared with an organization (e.g., an entire organization) for better visibility of effectiveness of the moderator or presentation materials, such as course materials.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Attendee device <b>102</b> and moderator device <b>104</b> can be client devices on a client-side of operating environment <b>100</b>, while meeting management engine <b>106</b> can be on a server-side of operating environment <b>100</b>. Meeting management engine <b>106</b> may comprise server-side software designed to work in conjunction with client-side software on attendee and/or moderator device so as to implement any combination of the features and functionalities discussed in the present disclosure. An example of such client-side software is meeting application <b>120</b>. This division of operating environment <b>100</b> is provided to illustrate one example of a suitable environment, and it is noted that there is no requirement that meeting management engine <b>106</b>, attendee device <b>102</b>, and moderator device <b>104</b> remain as separate entities. For clarity of explanation, we will describe embodiments in which the attendee device <b>102</b>, the moderator device <b>104</b>, the meeting management engine <b>106</b>, the data store <b>108</b>, and the data sources <b>110</b> are separate, while understanding that this may not be the case in various configurations contemplated within the present technology.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The attendee device <b>102</b> and moderator device <b>104</b> can communicate with the meeting management engine <b>106</b> to facilitate the online meeting and meeting management. In embodiments, for example, an attendee utilizes the attendee device <b>102</b> and a moderator utilizes the moderator device <b>102</b> to facilitate meeting management via the network <b>112</b>. For instance, in some embodiments, the network <b>112</b> might be the Internet, and the attendee device <b>102</b> and moderator device <b>104</b> interact with the meeting management engine <b>112</b> to obtain and/or provide information. In other embodiments, for example, the network <b>112</b> might be an enterprise network associated with an organization. It should be apparent to those having skill in the relevant arts that any number of other implementation scenarios may be possible as well.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The meeting management engine <b>106</b> is generally configured to facilitate online meetings management, among other things, based on attendee engagement and message input. In particular, the meeting management engine <b>106</b> can obtain engagement data and message data, for example, from various attendee devices <b>102</b>. The meeting management engine <b>106</b> can then use such data to determine an engagement metric(s) and/or message metric(s). An engagement metric generally refers to any metric that indicates engagement of an attendee or a set of attendees (e.g., all attendees). A message metric generally refers to any metric pertaining to a message input by an attendee (e.g., via a chat box). Message input may be any input from an attendee that indicates a message. Message input may be an audio input or a text input, for example, in the form of an instant message or text message. Message input may also include reactions, such as &#x201c;like,&#x201d; interacting with an emoji, etc. (which can be treated in a different stream).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Based on the attendee engagement metric and/or the message metric, the meeting management engine <b>106</b> can initiate an appropriate action in association with the corresponding metric. As one example, assume an attendee engagement metric indicates overall attendee engagement in association with a meeting. In such a case, the meeting management engine may communicate with the moderator device to provide a notification of the overall attendee engagement. As another example, assume an attendee engagement metric indicates attendee engagement associated with various attendees of a meeting. In such a case, the meeting management engine may identify attendees lacking a certain amount of engagement and, thereafter, initiate a disconnection of the video feed associated with attendees lacking engagement to reduce resource utilization. As another example, a poor network quality of an attendee can result in a recommendation to automatically block video. As such, the meeting management engine may communicate with attendee devices and/or moderator devices, or other devices, to initiate an appropriate action in relation to determined metrics.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As described herein, to identify engagement metrics and/or message metrics, various types of engagement and/or message data may be used. In some cases, such data may be obtained from the attendee device <b>102</b> and/or moderator device <b>104</b>. Additionally or alternatively, such data may be obtained from various data sources, such as data sources <b>110</b>. Examples of data sources or services include a meeting application server that collects data, a video stream source, a facial detection system, an emotion detection system, a signal connection system, etc. Accordingly, such data sources <b>110</b> may provide data to the meeting management engine <b>106</b>, or data store <b>108</b> associated therewith, for use by the meeting management engine <b>106</b> to manage meetings. Such data sources <b>110</b> are not intended to be limited in type or number.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The meeting management engine <b>106</b> and/or data sources <b>110</b>, according to embodiments, can be implemented as server systems, program modules, virtual machines, components of a server or servers, networks, and the like. Various types of implementations that facilitate meeting management are within the scope of embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a meeting management engine <b>206</b>. In embodiments, the meeting management engine <b>206</b> includes an engagement manager <b>220</b> and a message manager <b>230</b>. According to embodiments described herein, the meeting management engine <b>206</b> can include any number of other components not illustrated. In some embodiments, one or more of the illustrated components <b>220</b> and <b>230</b> can be integrated into a single component or can be divided into a number of different components. Components <b>220</b> and <b>230</b> can be implemented on any number of machines and can be integrated, as desired, with any number of other functionalities or services. By way of example only, meeting manager <b>220</b> may operate at a server, while message manager <b>230</b>, or aspects thereof, may operate at another server.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The meeting management engine <b>206</b> can communicate with the data store <b>208</b>. The data store <b>208</b> is configured to store various types of information used by the meeting management engine <b>206</b>. In embodiments, meeting management engine <b>206</b>, an attendee device(s), a moderator device(s), and/or other devices or services provides data to the data store <b>208</b> for storage, which may be retrieved or referenced by the meeting management engine <b>206</b>. Examples of types of information stored in data store <b>208</b> may include, for example, distraction data, interaction data, emotion data, connection data, influx/outflux data, machine learning models, message metrics, engagement metrics, heuristical models, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The engagement manager <b>220</b> is generally configured to manage engagement associated with meetings. In this regard, the engagement manager <b>220</b> can manage attendee engagement in association with a meeting to facilitate automated meeting management. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the engagement manager <b>220</b> may include an engagement data obtainer <b>222</b>, an engagement metric generator <b>224</b>, and an engagement action controller <b>226</b>. According to embodiments, the engagement manager <b>220</b> can include any number of other components not illustrated. In some embodiments, one or more of the illustrated components <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, and <b>226</b> can be integrated into a single component or can be divided into a number of different components. Components <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, and <b>226</b> can be implemented on any number of machines and can be integrated, as desired, with any number of other functionalities or services.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The engagement data obtainer <b>220</b> can obtain (e.g., as input <b>238</b>) engagement data <b>240</b> associated with a meeting for which automated meeting management is being performed. Engagement data generally refers to any type of data related to or associated with engagement of attendees of a meeting. By way of example only, engagement data may include distraction data, interaction data, emotion data, connection data, influx/outflux data, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Distraction data generally refers to data indicating or associated with attendee distraction. In this regard, distraction data may indicate an attendee is distracted from a meeting based on attendee focus or interaction with another device, application, window, etc. For example, distraction data may include an indication of prolonged interaction of another application(s) by an attendee. Such distraction data can be identified based on attendee interactions with another application, device, or window. Accordingly, attendee interaction logs may be used to identify interactions occurring during the time of the meeting. Distraction data may include an indication of an interaction and/or a time of an interaction with a device, application, or window different than that presenting the meeting. Stated differently, distraction data may include interactions with devices, applications, and/or windows external to the device, application, and/or window presenting the meeting to the attendee. Distraction data may be collected at another device (e.g., a server or service, attendee device), such as a data source <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, that can collect such data and provide the data to the meeting management engine, or otherwise enable access to such data.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Interaction data generally refers to data indicating or associated with interactions of an attendee with the meeting. In this way, interaction data may indicate an attendee is interacting or participating in connection with the meeting. An attendee may interact in any number of ways, including providing text input (e.g., via a messaging box), providing audio input, presenting content, presence in front of a camera, and/or the like. Interaction data may include an indication of an interaction and/or a time of an interaction. Such interaction data may be collected at another device (e.g., a data source <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) and, thereafter, provided to the meeting management engine <b>206</b>. For example, interaction data may be collected at an attendee device (e.g., via various sensors or programs), or at a server associated with or providing the meeting, and provided to data store <b>208</b> accessible by the engagement data obtainer <b>222</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Emotion data generally refers to data indicating or associated with emotion(s) of an attendee of a meeting. In this regard, emotion data may indicate an emotion of an attendee during the meeting. An emotion may be any type of emotion, such as for example, happy, sad, surprised, confused, calm, angry, disgusted, etc. Emotion data may include an indication of an emotion and/or a time of an emotion. An emotion may be determined on a per frame basis or per a frame set basis. To this end, an attendee may have a single emotion associated with a meeting (e.g., as determined across a set of meeting frames) or various emotions (e.g., as determined for various single frames or subsets of frames). Such emotion data may be collected at another device and, thereafter, provided to the meeting management engine <b>206</b>. For example, emotion data may be collected at the attendee device (e.g., via various sensors and a face detection algorithm that detects emotions), or at a server (e.g., via a face detection algorithm that detects emotions of attendees).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Connection data generally refers to data indicating a network connection associated with a meeting. In this way, connection data may indicate a signal strength of a meeting connection associated with an attendee device. Connection data may include an indication of a signal strength and/or a time of a signal strength. Such connection data may be collected at another device and, thereafter, provided to the meeting management engine. For example, connection data may be collected at the attendee device, via a network component, or at a server and, upon collection, provided to data store <b>208</b> accessible to the engagement manager <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Influx and/or outflux data generally refers to data indicating number of individuals moving and/or amounts of individuals movement in the camera view. For example, influx and outflux data can indicate a number of people moving out of the camera view and into the camera view when a camera associated with an attendee device is on.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Engagement data may also include historical data related to engagement. Such historical data may be provided from the data store <b>208</b>. Historical data may be associated with an attendee, a meeting, a set of attendees, a set of meetings, etc.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As can be appreciated, engagement data associated with a meeting can be obtained by engagement data obtainer <b>222</b> in any number of ways. In this regard, engagement data may be received, retrieved, accessed, referenced, determined, identified, and/or the like. Such engagement data may be obtained via a data store, such as data store <b>208</b>. Alternatively or additionally, engagement data may be obtained from remote services or devices (e.g., data sources <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In some cases, engagement data is obtained as input, for example, from an attendee device or other device being used (e.g., computing device in meeting room). For example, a meeting application executing on an attendee device may be configured to collect various types of engagement data and provide the engagement data to the meeting management engine <b>206</b>, or a data store associated therewith (e.g., data store <b>208</b>). The attendee device, or portion thereof (e.g., application), may provide such data on a periodic basis, a continuous basis, or based on an occurrence of an event. Additionally or alternatively, a server (e.g., a server associated with meeting management engine or a server associated with another service) may collect engagement data and provide such data to the meeting management engine <b>206</b>, or a data store associated therewith. For instance, user interaction logs may be captured at a remote server, and data therein may be provided to or accessible by the meeting management engine <b>206</b>. As another example, emotion detection may be performed by a remote service and, such emotion data may be provided to the meeting management engine <b>206</b>, or corresponding data store. As can be appreciated, in embodiments, the engagement data obtainer <b>222</b> may obtain engagement data associated with any number of attendees (e.g., all attendees) of a meeting.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Upon obtaining engagement data (e.g., by obtaining such data from a remote source or determining such data), the engagement metric generator <b>224</b> can generate engagement metrics associated with the meeting. An engagement metric generally refers to a measure, score, value, or other indication of extent or measure of engagement in connection with a meeting. In various implementations, an engagement metric(s) can be determined in relation to a set of attendees (e.g., all attendees) or in relation to a particular attendee.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">One example of an engagement metric specific to a set of attendees is a meeting engagement metric. A meeting engagement metric indicates an extent, such as a percentage, that the attendees of the meeting are engaged in the meeting. One example of a meeting engagement metric includes a meeting engagement percent. A meeting engagement metric can be reflected as follows:</p><p id="p-0050" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Engagement %=&#x3a3;(<i>Wi</i>*Calm Emotion+<i>Wj</i>*Happy Emotion+<i>Wn</i>*Parameter <i>N</i>)/&#x3a3;(Attendee Count)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">wherein Emotions Set=(Calm, Sad, Surprised, Confused, Happy, Angry, Disgusted)</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">In this regard, the engagement percent is generated based on a number of attendees associated with a calm emotion, a number of attendees associated with a happy emotion, etc. divided by the total number of attendees. The corresponding weights can be learned across different domain and context. As can be appreciated, a meeting engagement percent can be determined on a periodic basis (e.g., minute basis), for example, when emotions are determined for attendees on such a periodic basis. In other embodiments, a meeting engagement percent may represent an entire meeting, for example, when emotions are determined in association with the attendees for the entirety of the meeting.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">With brief reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an example graphical user interface <b>300</b> having a graphical display of a meeting engagement metric over the duration of the meeting. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a graphical display <b>302</b> includes an engagement index that represents engagement percent over the duration of the meeting. In some cases, such a meeting engagement metric can be generated and presented in real time, such that a meeting moderator can view the meeting engagement metric during the meeting. In other cases, such a meeting engagement metric can be generated and presented at the conclusion of the meeting, at which point the moderator can view engagement metrics associated with the meeting.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">As described, an engagement metric(s) can additionally or alternatively be determined in relation to a particular attendee of a meeting. In such cases, obtained engagement data associated with an attendee can be used to determine an engagement metric for that attendee. Any type of engagement data associated with an attendee may be used. For example, in some cases, distraction data, interaction data, emotion data, connection data, and/or influx/outflux data associated with a particular attendee may be used to determine an engagement metric for that attendee.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">In some cases, an engagement metric for a particular attendee can be determined as follows:</p><p id="p-0056" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Engagement Metric: (<i>w</i><sub>1</sub>*distraction+<i>w</i><sub>2</sub>*interaction+<i>w</i><sub>3</sub>*emotion+<i>w</i><sub>n</sub>)/(<i>w</i><sub>1</sub><i>+w</i><sub>2</sub><i>+w</i><sub>3</sub><i>+ . . . +w</i><sub>n</sub>),<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0057" num="0054">wherein w is the weight given to the variation variable.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0055">In some embodiments, the engagement data (e.g., distraction data, interaction data, emotion data, connection data, and/or influx/outflux data) associated with an attendee of a meeting is input into a machine learned model or heuristic model that can provide, as output, an engagement metric associated with the attendee. In some cases, the input engagement data may be relevant specifically to the meeting for which engagement is being identified. In other cases, the input engagement data may be relevant to the attendee, but correspond with other meetings the attendee has attended. As can be appreciated, a machined learned model and/or heuristic model may output a value or score indicating an extent of engagement of an attendee or may output a classification (e.g., engaged or disengaged).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0056">In some cases, multiple engagement metrics representing various engagement scores may be generated (e.g., concurrently or serially). As one example, a first engagement metric (e.g., related to distraction data) may be determined and, if the first engagement metric exceeds a threshold (or falls below a threshold), a second engagement metric (e.g., related to interaction data, emotion data, influx/outflux data, and/or connection data) may be determined. Any number or types of engagement data may be used to generate various engagement metrics.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0057">Other types of engagement metrics identified may include terms of interest, attendee activity distribution, connection status, or the like. Terms of interest may include terms or phrases identified as obtaining attention or interest of attendees. Terms of interest may be identified in any number of ways, including use of emotion data throughout the meeting to identify a peak interest in attendees during the meeting. Such a time of peak(s) interest can be used to identify a topic or a discussion during the meeting that occurred at that time. One example of a terms of interest engagement metric <b>304</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the terms of interest that gained more attention or interest are indicated using a larger font, but can be indicated in any number of ways (e.g., sorted in a ranked order).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0058">Attendee activity distribution may indicate different portions of a meeting in association with engagement levels. The various portions of the meeting may be determined in any number of ways. For example, a meeting may be delineated into portions based on time, or topics covered. One example of portions of meetings is illustrated in an attendee activity distribution <b>306</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In this attendee activity distribution <b>306</b>, a meeting is separated into three portions, including lecture, interaction (QnA), and homework review. Further, the engagement levels may be based on any number or type of variables. For example, the engagement levels may be determined based on interaction data, distraction data, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0059">Connection status may indicate connection status associated with various attendees. In this regard, connection status may indicate when attendees joined a meeting or dropped from a meeting. As such, a moderator can be provided with meeting attendance information. Such a connection status may be identified based on connection data. One example of connection status is illustrated in a connection status portion <b>308</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the connection status may include an indication of attendees as well as a corresponding time the attendee dropped from the meeting.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0060">The engagement metrics can be stored for subsequent use or reference. In this regard, the identified or determined engagement metrics can be stored in the data store <b>208</b> for subsequent use to facilitate meeting management and, in particular, management of attendee engagement.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0061">The engagement action controller <b>226</b> is generally configured to control or manage actions in association with engagement metrics. In this regard, the engagement action controller <b>226</b> may initiate or implement various recommended actions <b>250</b>, depending on the particular engagement metric and/or configuration of implementation. In embodiments, the engagement action controller <b>226</b> can communicate engagement metrics, or data associated therewith, to the moderator device. In this way, a moderator of a meeting, such as a presenter or host of the meeting, can be provided with information related to how engaged attendees are in association with the meeting. As described, the engagement metrics may relate to a set of attendees, such as all attendees, or may be particular to attendees. Accordingly, the engagement action controller <b>226</b> may provide engagement metrics for the meeting and/or specific to individuals.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0062">The engagement action controller <b>226</b> may provide engagement metrics, and/or information associated therewith, at any time. For instance, engagement metrics may be determined or generated in a periodic manner. In response to generating engagement metrics, the engagement action controller <b>226</b> may provide such metrics to the moderator device for display on the moderator device. In other cases, engagement metrics may be generated in a continuous manner or at the end of the meeting. Although generally described herein as providing engagement metrics to the moderator device for display, as can be appreciated, in some embodiments, engagement metrics may additionally or alternatively be provided to attendee devices for display.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0063">The engagement action controller <b>226</b> may generate graphical displays to present engagement metrics. For examples, tables, graphs, charts, icons, etc. may be generated to represent engagement metrics. As one example, and as previously described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a graphical display can be generated that includes an engagement index representing attendee engagement over the duration of the meeting. As another example, a representation of individual attendees' engagement may be generated and/or provided. Individual attendee engagement may be represented in any number of ways. For instance, a list of attendees and corresponding engagement indicators, such as engagement scores or engagement levels (e.g., high, medium, low), may be presented. As another example, an icon, color, text, or other representation may be indicated in association with an attendee indicating the attendee is engaged or disengaged. For instance, assume each attendee is represented by text, icon or video that represents or presents an attendee on the user interface. Each attendee represented via the user interface that is identified as disengaged can be indicated via a colored border, an icon overlay, or the like.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0064">In some cases, an indication as to why the attendee is noted as disengaged may be presented. For example, in cases that an attendee has a poor connection, such an indication can be presented such that the moderator has an understanding as to why the attendee may be disengaged. Further, in some embodiments, the engagement action controller <b>226</b> may provide a suggested action to take in relation to the engagement metric. For example, if overall engagement of attendees is low, the engagement action controller <b>226</b> may provide a suggestion to pause the presentation and allow for comments or to return to a particular topic at which the level of engagement dropped. As another example, if an individual attendee engagement is indicated as low, the engagement action controller <b>226</b> may provide a suggestion to engage the particular attendee (e.g., ask the attendee a question or otherwise draw the attendee into a discussion) or follow-up with the particular attendee following the meeting.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0065">Importantly, and as described herein, the engagement action controller <b>220</b> may use the engagement metrics to initiate, request, or prompt resource management. As described, in cases in which an attendee, or set of attendees, is disengaged in a meeting, it may be desirable to reduce resource consumption by disengaging or throttling the video stream and/or audio stream (e.g., in a one-way or a two-way direction).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0066">In one implementation, the engagement action controller <b>220</b> may identify when an engagement metric for an individual falls below a threshold (or above a threshold) or when the engagement metric indicates a disengaged attendee. In such a case, the engagement action controller <b>220</b> may initiate disconnection or throttling of video and/or audio stream in a one-direction or bi-directional manner. For instance, the engagement action controller <b>220</b> may disconnect the video feed of the attendee such that the attendee is not presented via the meeting application (e.g., on the moderator device or other attendee devices) and/or such that the content being presented via a meeting application is not viewable to the attendee. Alternatively or additionally, the engagement action controller <b>220</b> may throttle the video feed of the attendee such that a lower video resolution is provided to the attendee. In other cases, the engagement action controller <b>220</b> may prompt the moderator via the moderator device and/or the attendee via the attendee device to provide a suggestion (e.g., via a dialog box) to disconnect the audio and/or video feed or to request whether the audio and/or video feed can be disconnected to preserve resources. In some cases, a transcript of the meeting may be automatically generated and provided to the attendee via the attendee device, for example, in cases the audio and/or video feed is disconnected (e.g., in real time or at the conclusion of the meeting).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0067">As can be appreciated, the engagement action controller <b>220</b> may similarly identify when an engagement metric for an individual or group rises above a threshold (or falls below a threshold) or when the engagement metric indicates an engaged attendee. In such a case, the engagement action controller <b>220</b> may initiate a connection of a video and/or audio stream in a one-direction or bi-direction manner, in cases in which the audio and/or video is disconnected. For instance, the engagement action controller <b>220</b> may connect the video feed of the attendee such that the attendee is presented via the meeting application (e.g., on the moderator device or other attendee devices) and/or such that the content being presented is viewable to the attendee. In cases in which audio and/or video streams are throttled, the throttling may be discontinued. In other cases, the engagement action controller <b>220</b> may prompt the moderator via the moderator device and/or the attendee via the attendee device to provide a suggestion (e.g., via a dialog box) to connect the audio and/or video feed or to request whether the audio and/or video feed can be connected.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0068">The specific action taken by the engagement action controller <b>220</b> may be defined via a default setting or a user selected setting (e.g., via the moderator or attendee). For example, a moderator may indicate or select visualizations and timing for providing visualizations of engagement metrics. As another example, an attendee may indicate or select whether to disconnect the audio and/or video feed in an automated manner or to provide a suggestion in cases that the attendee is identified as disengaged.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0069">Turning to the message manager <b>230</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the message manager <b>230</b> is generally configured to manage messages input by attendees during meetings. In this regard, the message manager <b>220</b> can manage messages input by various attendees via a message or chat portion in association with the meeting application. More specifically, a graphical user interface of a meeting application can include a number of different visual portions, including a message or chat box or area for inputting text messages. In this regard, during a meeting, an attendee may input text in a message portion. The textual input may include comments, questions, links, etc.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0070">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the message manager <b>230</b> may include a message data obtainer <b>232</b>, a message analyzer <b>234</b>, and a message action controller <b>236</b>. According to embodiments, the message manager <b>230</b> can include any number of other components not illustrated. In some embodiments, one or more of the illustrated components <b>232</b>, <b>234</b>, and <b>236</b> can be integrated into a single component or can be divided into a number of different components. Components <b>232</b>, <b>234</b>, and <b>236</b> can be implemented on any number of machines and can be integrated, as desired, with any number of other functionalities or services.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0071">The message data obtainer <b>232</b> can obtain message data <b>242</b> associated with a meeting for which automated meeting management is being performed. Message data <b>242</b> generally refers to any type of data related to or associated with messages input (e.g., via a message or chat box) by attendees of a meeting. By way of example only, message data includes text input by attendees and metadata associated therewith.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0072">As can be appreciated, message data associated with a meeting can be obtained by message data obtainer <b>232</b> in any number of ways. In this regard, message data may be received, retrieved, accessed, referenced, determined, identified, and/or the like. Such message data may be obtained via a data store, such as data store <b>208</b>. Alternatively or additionally, message data may be obtained from remote services or devices. In some cases, message data is obtained as input, for example, from an attendee device or other device being used (e.g., computing device in meeting room). For example, an application providing an online meeting on an attendee device may be configured to collect various message data and provide the message data to the meeting management engine <b>206</b>, or a data store associated therewith. The attendee device, or portion thereof (e.g., application), may provide such data on a periodic basis, a continuous basis, or based on an occurrence of an event. Additionally or alternatively, a server (e.g., a server associated with meeting management engine or a server associated with another service) may collect message data and provide such data to the meeting management engine <b>206</b>, or a data store associated therewith. For instance, message logs may be captured at a remote server, and data therein may be provided to or accessible by the meeting management engine <b>206</b>. As can be appreciated, in embodiments, the message data obtainer <b>232</b> may obtain message data associated with any number of attendees (e.g., all attendees) of a meeting.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0073">Upon obtaining message data (e.g., by obtaining such data from a remote source or attendee devices), the message analyzer <b>234</b> can analyze messages to identify message metrics associated with messages. A message metric generally refers to any metric pertaining to a message input by an attendee (e.g., via a chat box). Message input may be any input from an attendee that indicates a message. As one example, a message metric(s) may be associated with similar messages (e.g., questions), such as a number of similar messages, etc.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0074">In this regard, the message analyzer <b>234</b> may generate clusters of similar messages. In particular, clusters of similar text content may be identified. Combining or aggregating similar messages reduces the number of similar messages to be viewed, for example by a moderator. As such, a user, such as a moderator, need not scroll through duplicative messages, thereby reducing resource utilization (e.g., by reducing computing resources to process multiple scroll inputs and multiple screen rendering updates).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0075">Identifying clusters of similar messages may be performed in any number of ways. As one example, for each message associated with a meeting, intent of the message (e.g., question) can be identified. For instance, a natural language processing model can be used to identify intent of a message based on lexicons per tenant. In cases that the intent is identified as a new intent, a new entry in a database for that message can be created along with a frequency indication of &#x201c;1.&#x201d; In cases in which the intent has been previously identified in association with another message of the meeting, the frequency indication of a corresponding entry (e.g., a same or similar intent or question) can be increased by 1. As can be appreciated, the data structure may include entries of different intents, different questions, or the like. The identified clusters can be checked with historical clusters of a same topic and, thus, can be used to auto-reply or refer to relevant materials. A feedback mechanism can help the effectiveness of the auto-generated answers and/or help a moderator to prepare for a next session.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0076">In some embodiments, the message analyzer <b>234</b> may generate new or revised messages to facilitate aggregation of similar messages. For instance, assume multiple questions included in a chat box are generally repeated in different manners. In such a case, the message analyzer <b>234</b> may use a natural language processing model to facilitate combining similar messages together. By way of example only, assume that during a class lecture Bob asks &#x201c;how are the chemical bonds formed,&#x201d; Mary asks &#x201c;how are the bonds forming here,&#x201d; and Neha asks &#x201c;how is the chemical bond formation happening.&#x201d; In such a case, the message analyzer <b>234</b> can identify similarity in the questions and, as such, only one message or question may be provided to the moderator. For example, a moderator may be prompted with one question &#x201c;How are the chemical bonds formed?&#x201d; with an indication that the question, or similar question, was asked by three attendees. As can be appreciated, one of the questions may be selected for presentation, or as described above, a new question may be generated by aggregating aspects of multiple questions to form a new question.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0077">The message analyzer <b>234</b> can also rank the clusters of similar messages. In some cases, the clusters of similar messages may be ranked by popularity or number of messages in a cluster. For example, a cluster with a highest or greatest number of similar questions can be ranked higher than a cluster with a lower number of similar questions. In other cases, the clusters of similar messages may be ranked by importance, for example, to a meeting topic or to a topic in the meeting covered most recently or for the longest amount of time. As can be appreciated, the clusters of similar messages can be ranked based on any number of factors, and such factors may be default priorities or user selected priorities (e.g., selected by a moderator).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0078">The clusters of similar messages, or data associated therewith (e.g., frequency, rank, message representations, etc.), can be stored for subsequent use. In this regard, the identified or determined clusters of similar messages can be stored in the data store <b>208</b> for subsequent use to facilitate meeting management and, in particular, management of input messages.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0079">The message action controller <b>236</b> is generally configured to control or manage actions in association with input messages. In this regard, the message action controller <b>236</b> may initiate or implement various actions <b>250</b>, depending on the particular configuration of implementation. In some embodiments, the message action controller <b>236</b> can communicate clusters of similar messages, or data associated therewith, to the moderator device. In this way, a moderator of a meeting, such as a presenter or host of the meeting, can be provided with information related to which messages input by attendees are related or similar to one another in association with the meeting.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0080">The message action controller <b>236</b> may provide clusters of similar messages, and/or information associated therewith, at any time. For instance, similar messages may be determined or identified in a periodic manner. In response to identifying similar messages, the message action controller <b>236</b> may provide such data to the moderator device for display on the moderator device. Although generally described herein as providing clusters of similar messages, or data associated therewith, to the moderator device for display, as can be appreciated, in some embodiments, such information may additionally or alternatively be provided to attendee devices for display.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0081">As described, the message action controller <b>236</b> may provide clusters of similar messages, or data associated therewith, for presentation to a moderator. In this regard, tables, graphs, charts, icons, etc. may be generated to represent message metrics. In some cases, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, an indication or icon may be provided in association with a message to indicate a common, popular, or frequent question. For example, a &#x201c;commonly asked&#x201d; icon <b>402</b> may be provided in association with message <b>404</b> to illustrate to the moderator that message <b>404</b> is commonly or frequently asked. In some cases, a number of similar messages or reactions (e.g., thumbs up) may be included or provided to indicate the extent of popularity of a set of similar messages. As another example, the message action controller <b>236</b> may provide the moderator device with a generated message that represents an aggregation of messages.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0082">In embodiments, to determine whether or when to present an indication of message similarity, the message action controller <b>236</b> may utilize a message threshold value. A message threshold value can be any threshold that indicates whether to present an indication of message similarity (e.g., a notification of a repetitive message, a frequency of similar messages, etc.). For instance, assume a message threshold is three. In such a case, when three or more messages are identified as similar relative to one another, an indication of message similarity may be provided. For example, the messages may be aggregated and denoted as a common message.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0083">Further, the message action controller <b>236</b> can provide messages in a ranked order. For example, messages more frequently repeated (e.g., a cluster of similar questions) can be positioned at the top of a message box while messages less common can be positioned at the bottom of a chat box. As another example, messages most relevant to the current portion of the meeting or relevant to the most lengthy portion of the meeting can be ranked higher and, as such, positioned higher in the message box. As yet another example, the message action controller <b>236</b> can provide an automated response based on historical data and ranking. As described, providing similarity indications and ranking similar messages enables a more efficient use of computing resources as a moderator can more efficiently identify messages that are more likely to need addressed by the moderator.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Exemplary Implementations for Facilitating Efficient Meeting Management</heading><p id="p-0087" num="0084">As described, various implementations can be used in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>10</b></figref> provide example methods illustrating various aspects of efficient meeting management. Such methods may be performed by a meeting management engine, such as meeting management engine <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> or meeting management engine <b>206</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The flow diagrams represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>10</b></figref> are intended to be exemplary in nature and not limiting.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0085">Turning initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> provides an example flow diagram to manage engagement associated with an online meeting, in accordance with embodiments described herein. Initially, as illustrated at block <b>502</b>, engagement data associated with an attendee of an online meeting is obtained. Engagement data may include interaction data, distraction data, emotion data, influx/outflux data, connection data, and/or the like. Such engagement data may be obtained from any number or types of sources. At block <b>504</b>, an engagement metric is generated using the engagement data. The engagement metric generally indicates an extent of engagement of the attendee to the online meeting. In embodiments, the engagement metric is generated using a machine learned model. For example, engagement data associated with the attendee can be input into a machine learned model and, in response, an indication of engagement can be output. As another example, weights associated with each type of engagement data can be applied to the corresponding types of engagement data to generate an engagement metric. As yet another example, the engagement metric may be generated by generating a first engagement score using a first type of engagement data (e.g., distraction data) and determining the first engagement score indicates a low engagement of the attendee in relation to the first type of engagement data. Thereafter, based on the first engagement score indicating the low engagement of the attendee, a second engagement score is generated using a second type of engagement data associated with the attendee. (e.g., emotion data, interaction data, influx/outflux data, network connection data, etc.).</p><p id="p-0089" num="0086">At block <b>506</b>, a determination is made as to whether the engagement metric exceeds an engagement threshold value. In cases in which the engagement metric exceeds the engagement threshold value (indicating the attendee is engaged with the meeting), the process returns to block <b>502</b> to continue monitoring engagement of the attendee during the online meeting. If, however, the engagement metric falls below the engagement threshold value (indicating the attendee is not engaged with the meeting), at block <b>508</b>, a request to regulate a media stream of the online meeting associated with the attendee of the online meeting is provided. Such a request may automatically initiate a disconnection or throttling of an audio and/or video of the media stream. In such cases, the request may be provided to the attendee device, a server, or network component to initiate the disconnection or throttling of the audio and/or video stream. In other embodiments, the request may provide a prompt or a notification to the attendee device to request the attendee to initiate a disconnection or to confirm a disconnection or throttling is acceptable to the attendee.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0087">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> provides another example flow diagram to manage engagement associated with an online meeting, in accordance with embodiments described herein. Initially, as illustrated at block <b>602</b>, engagement data associated with a plurality of attendees of an online meeting is obtained. Engagement data may include interaction data, distraction data, emotion data, influx/outflux data, connection data, and/or the like. Such engagement data may be obtained from any number or types of sources. At block <b>604</b>, a meeting engagement metric is generated using the engagement data associated with the plurality of attendees. The meeting engagement metric generally indicates an extent of engagement of the plurality of attendees to the online meeting. Such a meeting engagement metric can be associated with a particular time, thereby reflecting overall engagement of the attendees at a particular time of the meeting. At block <b>606</b>, the meeting engagement metric is provided to a moderator device of the online meeting. In embodiments, the meeting engagement metric may be provided during the meeting or at the end of the meeting. In some cases, the meeting engagement metric may be one metric represented in a graphical display including a timeline of the meeting, such that the meeting engagement metric and other meeting engagement metric are graphically represented in association with the timeline to illustrate engagement throughout the timeframe of the meeting. A moderator can then view which points during the meeting are more interesting and less interesting to attendees.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0088">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a method flow for determining an engagement for an attendee of an online meeting, in accordance with embodiments described herein. Initially, at block <b>702</b>, a request is communicated to identify active non-meeting sessions associated with an attendee. In this regard, computing session data, external to a meeting application hosting an online meeting, in which an attendee is active is identified. In this way, at block <b>704</b>, distraction data associated with the attendee is obtained. At block <b>706</b>, a distraction score is determined. Generally, the distraction score may reflect or represent a level of interactivity with non-meeting applications, windows, devices, etc. At block <b>708</b>, a determination is made as to whether the distraction score exceeds a distraction threshold value. If so, the attendee is generally identified as having a low engagement with the online meeting, as indicated at block <b>710</b>. Based on a low engagement indicator, an appropriate action is initiated at block <b>712</b>. Such an action may include modifying video and/or audio in relation to the attendee device, providing a notification to the moderator device, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0089">Returning to block <b>708</b>, if a determination is made that the distraction score does not exceed a distraction threshold value, an engagement score is determined based on engagement data, as indicated at block <b>714</b>. In this regard, engagement data, which does not include the distraction data, can be used to determine an engagement score. For example, emotion data, interaction data, connection data, influx/outflux data, and/or the like, can be used to determine an engagement score associated with the user. At block <b>716</b>, a determination is made as to whether the engagement score is less than a minimum limit of an engagement threshold value. If so, the attendee is generally identified as having a low engagement with the online meeting, as indicated at block <b>710</b>. Thereafter, based on the low engagement indicator, an appropriate action is initiated at block <b>712</b>. Such an action may include modifying video and/or audio in relation to the attendee device, providing a notification to the moderator device, and/or the like. On the other hand, if, at block <b>716</b>, the engagement score is determined to be greater than the minimum limit of the engagement threshold value, the attendee is generally identified as having a high engagement with the online meeting, as shown at block <b>718</b>. As can be appreciated, in embodiments, an action may be initiated in response to identification of an attendee with a high engagement. For instance, reestablishing a video and/or audio connection may be initiated, or a moderator may be provided with data indicating a high attendee engagement.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0090">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a method flow for managing engagement associated with an attendee of an online meeting, in accordance with embodiments described herein. Initially, at block <b>802</b>, a determination is made as to whether engagement is high (e.g., exceeds a threshold) for an attendee of an online meeting. If so, the method continues to monitor the attendee's engagement in the online meeting. If not, a determination is made as to whether a video stream is operating in association with the attendee device. This is indicated at block <b>804</b>. If not, the method continues to monitor the attendee's engagement in the online meeting. On the other hand, if the video stream is operating, a prompt is provided to the attendee device to suggest to the attendee to terminate or disconnect the video stream or to request whether the video stream can be terminated or disconnected, as indicated at block <b>806</b>. At block <b>808</b>, a determination is made as to whether a response is received from the attendee. For example, an attendee may be prompted multiple times within a five minute time duration and, if no response, a determination is made that the attendee has not responded. If a response is received, an action corresponding with the received response can be implemented, as indicated at block <b>810</b>. On the other hand, if no response is received, at block <b>812</b>, termination of the video stream is automatically initiated. In such a case, a recording of the online meeting can be automatically generated and/or captured for the attendee. As can be appreciated, at various times during the process, engagement scores may be determined. For example, prior to prompting the attendee or prior to automatically initiating disconnection of the video stream, an engagement score may be determined to confirm attendee engagement remains low.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0091">With respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> provides a flow diagram related to facilitating efficient meeting management, in accordance with embodiments described herein. Initially, at block <b>902</b>, a plurality of messages input via a message box in association with an online meeting is obtained. Such messages may be input by multiple attendees of the online meeting. At block <b>904</b>, a set of messages from the plurality of messages may be clustered together based on similarity of textual content of the messages in the cluster of messages. In implementation, natural language processing may be used to identify intent of the messages and, based on such intent, the messages can be clustered together. At block <b>906</b>, an indication of a number of the messages in the cluster of messages is provided, for example, to a moderator device. In this regard, the count or frequency of messages that have similar content can be provided to a moderator for efficient review of the messages. In embodiments, the message content of each of the messages in the cluster or one of the messages in the cluster may be provided for concurrent presentation with the indication of the number of messages.

At block <b>1004</b>, intent associated with each message is obtained or generated. Thereafter, at block <b>1006</b>, for each message, a determination is made as to whether the intent is a new intent. If the intent associated with a message is a new intent, a new entry of the message intent is generated and stored with a frequency indicator of &#x201c;1.&#x201d; This is indicated at block <b>1008</b>. On the other hand, if the intent associated with the message is not a new intent, a frequency indicator associated with the existing intent is increased by one, as indicated at block <b>1010</b>. At block <b>1012</b>, a request to provide an optimized message list is obtained (e.g., provided from a moderator device). As such, at block <b>1014</b>, the optimized message list is provided.
