The device is operated as an IS-FET sensor, holding the measured potential between the drain electrode and an external reference electrode constant with a potentiometric circuit. Transduction occurs by changes in the effective CNT film gate potential with changes in the phase boundary potential of an ion-selective membrane (ISM) film. Moreover, the nitrate ISM film makes the device highly selective towards nitrate sensing. This printable IS-FET nitrate sensor enables real-time and high-resolution measurements and recording of nitrate ion in water at low cost.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="58.76mm" wi="158.75mm" file="US20230003684A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="272.97mm" wi="125.05mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230003684A1-20230105-D00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-D00002" he="183.90mm" wi="145.63mm" file="US20230003684A1-20230105-D00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-D00003" he="203.88mm" wi="115.82mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230003684A1-20230105-D00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-D00004" he="217.09mm" wi="165.78mm" file="US20230003684A1-20230105-D00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-D00005" he="138.26mm" wi="157.23mm" file="US20230003684A1-20230105-D00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-D00006" he="184.91mm" wi="164.59mm" file="US20230003684A1-20230105-D00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00007" num="00007"><img id="EMI-D00007" he="106.68mm" wi="160.10mm" file="US20230003684A1-20230105-D00007.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00008" num="00008"><img id="EMI-D00008" he="217.25mm" wi="112.18mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230003684A1-20230105-D00008.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00009" num="00009"><img id="EMI-D00009" he="139.19mm" wi="163.83mm" file="US20230003684A1-20230105-D00009.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00010" num="00010"><img id="EMI-D00010" he="227.58mm" wi="159.51mm" file="US20230003684A1-20230105-D00010.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00011" num="00011"><img id="EMI-D00011" he="197.78mm" wi="161.88mm" file="US20230003684A1-20230105-D00011.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><description id="description"><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims the priority benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

One source of water contamination, nitrate ions, is widely found in bodies of water due to the excessive use of agricultural fertilizers and the discharge of wastewater from living and other industrial activities. The presence of high concentrations of nitrate ions in water may damage aquatic organisms as well as human health. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has regulated the nitrate concentration in drinking water to 10 ppm. Therefore, there is a need for sensors that can detect nitrate ions at these low concentrations in drinking water, natural surface water, and domestic and industrial wastewater.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure provides a sensor comprising a substrate, a source electrode on the substrate, a drain electrode on the substrate, a carbon nanotube gating layer connecting the source electrode and the drain electrode, an ion selective membrane on the carbon nanotube gating layer, and a counter electrode on the substrate.

Once the presoaking process was completed, the devices were moved to a new solution in the next row and held for 20 minutes. This process was repeated until a 10-cycle test was performed in each of the seven solutions. A 50 mV voltage difference between the source and drain electrode was built into a PCB board with the circuitry as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> to measure the resistance of the CNT film, which was the output signal. The IS-FET nitrate sensing devices were connected to respective PCBs, which supplied the electrical excitations as well as recorded the output data into a CSV file inside a connected desktop PC.

Each device was placed in its own small plastic vial with 20 mL of 1.0 mM KNO<sub>3</sub>+0.1% ISA solution.

Ideally, the drain current of a nitrate device with excellent stability should stay the same with no current loss or increase under the constant electrochemical testing condition. Therefore, the flat curve of drain current indicates long-term stability of the nitrate device. In particular, when subjected to a Drifting Test as described in this Example, the nitrate device should experience a current change (either loss or increase) of no more than about 1.5 &#x3bc;A, preferably no more than about 1 &#x3bc;A, and even more preferably no more than about 0.5 &#x3bc;A. These Drifting Test results are preferably obtained at a time period of at least about 10 days, preferably at least about 15 days, more preferably at least about 20 days, and even more preferably at least about 24 days.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00001" nb-file="US20230003684A1-20230105-M00001.NB"><img id="EMI-M00001" he="12.70mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003684A1-20230105-M00001.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00002" nb-file="US20230003684A1-20230105-M00002.NB"><img id="EMI-M00002" he="6.01mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003684A1-20230105-M00002.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-claim-statement>We claim:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
