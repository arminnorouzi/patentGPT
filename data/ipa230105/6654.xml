Also, the various embodiments described herein are not necessarily mutually exclusive, as some embodiments can be combined with one or more other embodiments to form new embodiments.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Silicon-based FROs combine low phase noise with high accuracy. The high accuracy is achieved by a switched-cap feedback loop with novel auto-zeroing solution for offset compensation whereas the low phase noise is achieved using a voltage-controlled oscillator. The FRO has a best-in-class power supply rejection and can also operate at low supply voltages.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">With the new embodiments described herein, the frequency accuracy of the prior art feedback FRO solution is even further improved. The embodiments described herein are a further improvement of prior art solution found in U.S. Pat. No. 10,250,269, which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. The embodiments described herein include the following features: low phase noise (high figure of merit); high frequency stability over process and voltage; high accuracy; low Allan deviation; high power supply rejection; linear tuning range; and small area. The FRO solution illustrated by the embodiments described herein will decrease the cost of current products by: reduced trim costs; single trim at any temperature; possible replacement of X-tal; reducing bill of materials; smaller form factor; and increased reliability by eliminating a (mechanically sensitive) X-tal.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates the prior art solution as found in U.S. Pat. No. 10,250,269. The prior art FRO <b>100</b> is a ring oscillator with a switched-cap based feedback loop. The offset of the amplifier is removed by means of auto-zeroing. The auto-zeroing solution removes the offset and flicker noise and increases the effective gain which results in an increased accuracy and higher frequency stability. The FRO <b>100</b> includes a switched capacitor based frequency to voltage converter (F2V) <b>110</b>, a comparator <b>120</b>, and the voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) <b>130</b>. The VCO <b>130</b> outputs two frequencies that are fed back to the F2V <b>110</b> which are used to control two switches <b>113</b> and <b>114</b>. A switch capacitor <b>112</b> is used with a variable resistor <b>111</b> to control the output of the F2V <b>110</b>. The switch capacitor <b>112</b> looks like a resistor based upon the frequency of the signal across it. The switch capacitor <b>112</b> and the variable resistor <b>111</b> act as a voltage divider to produce a feedback voltage Vfb.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The comparator <b>120</b> may act as an integrator. The comparator <b>120</b> includes an amplifier <b>121</b>, switches <b>123</b> and <b>124</b>, an integration capacitor <b>122</b>, and a sampling capacitor <b>125</b>. The amplifier <b>121</b> may be an operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) or other type of appropriate amplifier. The amplifier <b>121</b> converts a voltage difference at the inputs to an output current. When the FRO is at the correct frequency, the output of the amplifier <b>121</b> is zero current. The switches <b>123</b> and <b>124</b> are switched so that a reference voltage Vref is applied to the input of the amplifier <b>120</b> which charges the sampling capacitor <b>125</b> until it reaches a voltage of Vref. Then the switches <b>123</b> and <b>124</b> are switched so that Vfb is input to the amplifier <b>121</b>, and the output current of the amplifier <b>121</b> will indicate any difference between Vfb and Vref. This output is integrated on Cint <b>122</b>. This will cause the input to the VCO <b>130</b> to adjust until the control loop settles.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates that a parasitic capacitance <b>126</b> is found at the output of the amplifier <b>121</b>. When Vref is not equal to Vint, then the effective gain is reduced due to the parasitic capacitance on Voo. The effective gain is reduced due to the fact that every period charge is needed to change the voltage Voo of the output of the amplifier <b>121</b> from Vref to Vint. First, Cpar <b>126</b> is quickly charged by Cint <b>122</b> due to the charge redistribution between Cint <b>122</b> and Cpar <b>126</b>, and the remaining voltage reduction is removed by the loop introducing an offset at the amplifier input in steady state (Vfb=Vref+Voffset). The offset reduces the frequency accuracy because Vref is not equal to Vfb and therefore not only dependent on R and C anymore.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The frequency inaccuracy due to Cpar <b>126</b> may be minimized by making the difference between the values Vref and Vint as small as possible. The difference however is process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) dependent. The embodiments described herein provide a solution to remove the frequency inaccuracy due to Cpar <b>126</b> in a robust way over PVT and to improve the auto-zeroing solution.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an FRO with a pre-charging amplifier to pre-charge the output of the amplifier <b>121</b> to Vint. The FRO <b>300</b> uses the same F2V <b>110</b> and VCO <b>130</b> as the FRO <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The Integrator <b>320</b> is similar to the comparator <b>120</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, with the addition of the pre-charge amplifier <b>327</b> and switches <b>328</b> and <b>329</b>. The pre-charge amplifier <b>327</b> may be, for example, an OTA or any other appropriate type of amplifier. The pre-charge amplifier <b>327</b> pre-charges the parasitic capacitance Cpar <b>126</b> to a voltage of Vint. This means that there will be no voltage reduction of Vint due to the need to charge Cpar <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A divider/phase generator <b>131</b> has been added to the output of the VCO <b>130</b>. The phase generator <b>131</b> generates three control signals Pha, Phb, and Phc. These control signals are used to control the various switches in the comparator <b>320</b>. Specifically, Pha controls switches <b>123</b> and <b>324</b>, Phb controls switch <b>329</b>, and Phc controls switch <b>328</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates the signals used to control the switchers in the comparator and how the comparator works. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a plot of Voo with pre-charge <b>405</b> and Voo without pre-charge <b>410</b>. Also plots of the controls signals Pha <b>415</b>, Phb <b>420</b>, and Phc <b>425</b> are shown. Pha controls switches <b>123</b> and <b>324</b>. When Pha <b>415</b> is high Vref is sampled and stored on the sampling capacitor <b>125</b>. When Pha <b>415</b> is low Vfb is input into the amplifier <b>121</b>. When Pha <b>415</b> goes low, then Phb <b>420</b> goes high to close switch <b>329</b>. This allows the pre-charge amplifier <b>327</b> to charge the parasitic capacitor <b>126</b> to be equal to Vint. Once Phb <b>420</b> goes low, Phc <b>425</b> goes high to close switch <b>328</b>. This allows the output of the amplifier <b>121</b> to be connected to the VCO <b>130</b>. As the input to the amplifier <b>121</b> is Vfb and the sampled Vref, the output of amplifier <b>121</b> is based upon the difference in the input voltages that will lead to correction of the frequency of the VCO <b>130</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a close up plot of the Voo when Phc <b>425</b> is high. As can be seen, the Voo with pre-charge <b>405</b> settles quickly to a constant value. The Voo without pre-charge <b>410</b> continues to rise during this period.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">During operation without pre-charging, Cpar <b>126</b> is quickly charged by Cint <b>122</b> when Vfb is applied to the amplifier <b>121</b>. The voltage over Cint <b>122</b> however is reduced due to the charge redistribution between Cint <b>122</b> and Cpar <b>126</b>. The voltage reduction is removed by the loop introducing an offset at the amplifier which effects a reduction of the effective gain.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">With pre-charging, Cpar <b>126</b> is first pre-charged with the pre-charge amplifier <b>121</b> to the same voltage as Vint when the control signal Phb <b>420</b> goes high and closes switch <b>329</b>. So, there will be no voltage reduction of Vint due to Cpar <b>126</b>, hence no offset is introduced at the amplifier <b>121</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates another embodiment of a comparator that compensates for parasitic capacitors at the output of the amplifier. The comparator <b>600</b> includes an amplifier <b>621</b>, switch <b>623</b>, integrating capacitor Cint <b>622</b>, and sampling capacitor <b>625</b>. The amplifier <b>621</b> includes two separate outputs <b>628</b> and <b>629</b> and an internal switch that switches between the two outputs. Further, each of the outputs <b>628</b> and <b>629</b> have their own parasitic capacitance Cpar<b>1</b> <b>626</b> and Cpar<b>2</b> <b>627</b>. The first output <b>628</b> is connected to the output of the comparator <b>600</b> and Cint <b>622</b>. The second output <b>629</b> is connected to the second input of the amplifier <b>621</b> and the sampling capacitor <b>625</b>. As a result the parasitic capacitances are independent from one another and only effect their respective outputs. As a result the value of Vint is stored on both Cint <b>622</b> and Cpar<b>2</b> <b>627</b>. This is accomplished by switching between the two outputs <b>628</b> and <b>629</b> of the amplifier <b>621</b>. In this way the value of both Vref&#x2032; and Vint are preserved during switching. Accordingly, the offset, due to Cpar<b>2</b> is removed, and therefore the FRO is only dependent on R and C. So, the effective gain of the amplifier is reestablished again.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a circuit implementation of the amplifier <b>621</b>.
