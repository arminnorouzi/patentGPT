No. 63/217,641, filed on Jul. 1, 2021, which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to workpiece processing systems. In particular, tube processing systems are described.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Tubes or pipes (hereinafter simply tubes) are a common type of workpiece that are often used for transferring fluids, either liquid or gas, from one location to another. Tubes can have structural purposes in addition or alternatively to transferring fluids, such as in conduit, roll cage, and handrail applications. This document will focus on tubular workpieces.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Bending tubes is also useful for many different applications. Bending a tube is often necessary to conform the tube to a specified shape for a given end product, such as a coil, a curved exhaust pipe, or a U-shaped conduit. Tube bending devices are generally used to bend tubes.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Forming notches or other cuts in tubes is useful for a variety of purposes and applications. For example, forming notches in a tube can enable coping round tubes or pipes together. Coping tubes together is useful to build various items, including roll cages, handrails, furniture, and gates. Tube notching devices are often employed to form notches in tubes.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Conventionally, operators must utilize two separate devices to bend and notch a tube. Relying on separate devices to bend and notch a tube is problematic for a host of reasons.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">One important drawback of needing two separate devices to bend and notch a tube is that accuracy and precision suffer. When an operator notches a tube in one machine and transfers the tube to another machine to bend, or vice-versa, he or she will often fail to align the tube accurately in the second machine to correspond perfectly with the alignment in the first machine. Aligning the tube inaccurately in the second machine results in the bend and the notch not aligning relative to each other as accurately as intended.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another drawback of relying on multiple devices involves expense. Purchasing two separate machines to bend and notch tubes is expensive. Further, additional expense derives from maintaining both machines.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Processing speed and convenience also suffer when separate devices are needed to bend and notch a tube. When an operator must use separate devices to bend and notch a tube, time is lost when the operator must set up each machine, transfer the tube from one machine to another, and align the tube as accurately as possible in each machine. Not only is using multiple machines slower, it is less convenient for the operator.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">An additional drawback of needing two separate machines is the space required for them. Processing tubes requires support for long tubes, such as standard length 20-foot tubes. Two separate machines to bend and notch tubes will each typically require supports sufficient to support 20-foot tubes or longer. Housing multiple machines with supports extending out nearly 20-feet can consume a lot of space in machine shops.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Thus, there exists a need for systems that improve upon and advance the design of known tube bending machines and tube notching machines. Examples of new and useful tube processing systems relevant to the needs existing in the field are discussed below.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Disclosure addressing one or more of the identified existing needs is provided in the detailed description below. Examples of references relevant to tube processing systems include U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 17/028,233 and 17/105,115. The complete disclosures of these listed patent applications are herein incorporated by reference for all purposes.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present disclosure is directed to tube processing systems for bending and notching a tube fed from a feed position.

For example, a &#x201c;substantially cylindrical&#x201d; object means that the object resembles a cylinder, but may have one or more deviations from a true cylinder.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">&#x201c;Comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; and &#x201c;having&#x201d; (and conjugations thereof) are used interchangeably to mean including but not necessarily limited to, and are open-ended terms not intended to exclude additional elements or method steps not expressly recited.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Terms such as &#x201c;first&#x201d;, &#x201c;second&#x201d;, and &#x201c;third&#x201d; are used to distinguish or identify various members of a group, or the like, and are not intended to denote a serial, chronological, or numerical limitation.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">&#x201c;Coupled&#x201d; means connected, either permanently or releasably, whether directly or indirectly through intervening components.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">&#x201c;Communicatively coupled&#x201d; means that an electronic device exchanges information with another electronic device, either wirelessly or with a wire-based connector, whether directly or indirectly through a communication network.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">&#x201c;Controllably coupled&#x201d; means that an electronic device controls operation of another electronic device.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Tube Processing Systems</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">With reference to the figures, tube processing systems will now be described. The tube processing systems discussed herein function to bend tubes and to notch tubes with a single machine.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The reader will appreciate from the figures and description below that the presently disclosed tube processing systems address many of the shortcomings of conventional approaches to bending and notching tubes. For example, the novel tube processing systems described herein remove the need for operators to use two separate devices to bend and notch a tube. Combing the functions of separate tube bending devices and tube notching devices into a single system is beneficial for many reasons.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">One important improvement over conventional approaches to bend and notch a tube is that the novel tube processing systems described in this document increase accuracy and precision. With the presently described novel tube processing systems, an operator does not need to align a tube multiple times on separate machines, which is prone to inaccuracy. By utilizing a single machine to bend and notch a tube, the bend and the notch may be aligned relative to each other more accurately.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The novel tube processing systems described herein are more cost effective than purchasing two separate machines to bend and notch a tube. Further, maintenance expenses are lower for the novel tube processing systems described in this document than the expenses required to maintain two separate machines.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Processing speed and convenience also improve when utilizing the novel tube processing systems herein to bend and notch a tube with a single machine. Processing time is saved because an operator does not need to set up multiple machines, transfer a tube from one machine to another, and align the tube as accurately as possible in each machine. In addition to improved processing speed, bending and notching a tube with a single machine is more convenient for the operator than having to use multiple machines.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Space savings is another benefit of the novel tube processing systems described below. With tube bending and notching functions provided by a single machine, only one support system for long tubes is needed rather than two separate support systems for separate machines. It is easier to find space in a machine shop to house a single machine with one support system extending out nearly 20-feet than it is to house two machines each having support systems extending out nearly 20-feet.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Contextual Details</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Ancillary features relevant to the tube processing systems described herein will first be described to provide context and to aid the discussion of the novel tube processing systems.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Tube</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Tube <b>101</b> is bent to defined parameters by the tube processing systems described below. The tube may be any currently known or later developed type of tube. The reader will appreciate that a variety of tube types exist and could be used in place of the tube shown in the figures. In addition to the types of tubes existing currently, it is contemplated that the tube processing systems described herein could be used with new types of tubes developed in the future.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The size of the tube may be varied as needed for a given application. In some examples, the tube is larger relative to the other components than depicted in the figures.
