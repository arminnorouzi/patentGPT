Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a three-dimensional data encoding method, a three-dimensional data decoding method, a three-dimensional data encoding device, and a three-dimensional data decoding device.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Devices or services utilizing three-dimensional data are expected to find their widespread use in a wide range of fields, such as computer vision that enables autonomous operations of cars or robots, map information, monitoring, infrastructure inspection, and video distribution. Three-dimensional data is obtained through various means including a distance sensor such as a rangefinder, as well as a stereo camera and a combination of a plurality of monocular cameras.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Methods of representing three-dimensional data include a method known as a point cloud scheme that represents the shape of a three-dimensional structure by a point cloud in a three-dimensional space. In the point cloud scheme, the positions and colors of a point cloud are stored. While point cloud is expected to be a mainstream method of representing three-dimensional data, a massive amount of data of a point cloud necessitates compression of the amount of three-dimensional data by encoding for accumulation and transmission, as in the case of a two-dimensional moving picture (examples include Moving Picture Experts Group-4 Advanced Video Coding (MPEG-4 AVC) and High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standardized by MPEG).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Meanwhile, point cloud compression is partially supported by, for example, an open-source library (Point Cloud Library) for point cloud-related processing.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, a technique for searching for and displaying a facility located in the surroundings of the vehicle by using three-dimensional map data is known (see, for example, Patent Literature (PTL) 1 (International Publication WO 2014/020663)).</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008"

adding a first information item to a bitstream, the first information item indicating whether a duplicated point is available, the duplicated point representing, using a single node, position information items of two or more three-dimensional points having a same position information item in a prediction tree showing a reference relation in predictive encoding; and adding second information items to the bitstream when the first information item indicates that the duplicated point is available, the second information items each corresponding to a different one of nodes included in the prediction tree, and indicating a total number of one or more three-dimensional points included in the different one of the nodes.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">According to this three-dimensional data encoding method, since a duplicated point is used, which is a single node that represents two or more three-dimensional points having the same geometry information and indicates the geometry information, the data amount can be reduced compared with a case where geometry information of each three-dimensional point is encoded. Since the first information allows switching of whether a duplicated point can be used, encoding of excessive information can be avoided when no duplicated point is used, for example. In this way, the three-dimensional data encoding method can improve the coding efficiency.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">For example, when the first information item indicates that the duplicated point is not available, the bitstream need not include the second information items.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">For example, each of the second information items may include a third information item indicating whether the total number of the one or more three-dimensional points included in the different one of the nodes is greater than one; and may further include a fourth information item when the third information item indicates that the total number of the one or more three-dimensional points included in the different one of the nodes is greater than one, the fourth information item indicating a value obtained by subtracting two from the total number of the one or more three-dimensional points included in the different one of the nodes is greater than one.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">According to this three-dimensional data encoding method, the coding efficiency can be improved.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">For example, the three-dimensional data encoding method may further include adding fifth information items to the bitstream, the fifth information items each corresponding to the different one of the nodes included in the prediction tree, and indicating a prediction mode used for predictive encoding of the different one of the nodes.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">For example, the three-dimensional data encoding method may further include generating, for each of the nodes included in the prediction tree, a prediction residual that is a difference between a position information item of a three-dimensional point included in the node and a prediction value. The bitstream may include prediction residuals of the nodes included in the prediction tree, the prediction residuals each being the prediction residual.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">For example, the bitstream may include, as one or more attribute information items of a node for which the duplicated point is used, a total number of the one or more attribute information items indicated in a second information item corresponding to the node.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">A three-dimensional data decoding method according to one aspect of the present disclosure includes: obtaining a first information item from a bitstream, the first information item indicating whether a duplicated point is available, the duplicated point representing, using a single node, position information items of two or more three-dimensional points having a same position information item in a prediction tree showing a reference relation in predictive encoding; and obtaining second information items from the bitstream when the first information item indicates that the duplicated point is available, the second information items each corresponding to a different one of nodes included in the prediction tree, and indicating a total number of one or more three-dimensional points included in the different one of the nodes.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">According to this three-dimensional data decoding method, a bitstream improved in coding efficiency can be decoded.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">For example, the second information items need not be obtained from the bitstream when the first information item indicates that the duplicated point is not available.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">For example, the second information items need not be obtained from the bitstream when the first information item indicates that the duplicated point is not available.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">For example, each of the second information items may include a third information item indicating whether the total number of the one or more three-dimensional points included in the different one of the nodes is greater than one; and may further include a fourth information item when the third information item indicates that the total number of the one or more three-dimensional points included in the different one of the nodes is greater than one, the fourth information item indicating a value obtained by subtracting two from the total number of the one or more three-dimensional points included in the different one of the nodes is greater than one.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">For example, the three-dimensional data decoding method may further include obtaining fifth information items from the bitstream, the fifth information items each corresponding to the different one of the nodes included in the prediction tree, and indicating a prediction mode used for predictive decoding of the different one of the nodes.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">For example, the three-dimensional data decoding method may further obtaining prediction residuals of the nodes included in the prediction tree, from the bitstream; and calculating, for each of the nodes included in the prediction tree, a position information item of a three-dimensional point included in the node, by adding a prediction value to a prediction residual of the node.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">For example, the bitstream may include, as one or more attribute information items of a node for which the duplicated point is used, a total number of the one or more attribute information items indicated in a second information item corresponding to the node.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">A three-dimensional data encoding device according to one aspect of the present disclosure includes a processor and memory.

Further, when client device <b>2002</b> finishes obtaining sensor information (YES in S<b>2005</b>), client device <b>2002</b> completes the process.</p><p id="p-0804" num="0796">Client device <b>2002</b> may select sensor information to be transmitted to server <b>2001</b>, in accordance with communication conditions. For example, when high-speed communication is available, client device <b>2002</b> preferentially transmits sensor information (e.g., information obtained by LiDAR) of which the data size held in storage <b>2012</b> is large. Additionally, when high-speed communication is not readily available, client device <b>2002</b> transmits sensor information (e.g., a visible light image) which has high priority and of which the data size held in storage <b>2012</b> is small. Accordingly, client device <b>2002</b> can efficiently transmit sensor information held in storage <b>2012</b>, in accordance with network conditions</p><p id="p-0805" num="0797">Client device <b>2002</b> may obtain, from server <b>2001</b>, time information indicating a current time and location information indicating a current location. Moreover, client device <b>2002</b> may determine an obtainment time and an obtainment location of sensor information based on the obtained time information and location information. In other words, client device <b>2002</b> may obtain time information from server <b>2001</b> and generate obtainment time information using the obtained time information. Client device <b>2002</b> may also obtain location information from server <b>2001</b> and generate obtainment location information using the obtained location information.</p><p id="p-0806" num="0798">For example, regarding time information, server <b>2001</b> and client device <b>2002</b> perform clock synchronization using a means such as the Network Time Protocol (NTP) or the Precision Time Protocol (PTP). This enables client device <b>2002</b> to obtain accurate time information. What's more, since it is possible to synchronize clocks between server <b>2001</b> and client devices <b>2002</b>, it is possible to synchronize times included in pieces of sensor information obtained by separate client devices <b>2002</b>. As a result, server <b>2001</b> can handle sensor information indicating a synchronized time. It should be noted that a means of synchronizing clocks may be any means other than the NTP or PTP. In addition, GPS information may be used as the time information and the location information.</p><p id="p-0807" num="0799">Server <b>2001</b> may specify a time or a location and obtain pieces of sensor information from client devices <b>2002</b>. For example, when an accident occurs, in order to search for a client device in the vicinity of the accident, server <b>2001</b> specifies an accident occurrence time and an accident occurrence location and broadcasts sensor information transmission requests to client devices <b>2002</b>. Then, client device <b>2002</b> having sensor information obtained at the corresponding time and location transmits the sensor information to server <b>2001</b>. In other words, client device <b>2002</b> receives, from server <b>2001</b>, a sensor information transmission request including specification information specifying a location and a time. When sensor information obtained at a location and a time indicated by the specification information is stored in storage <b>2012</b>, and client device <b>2002</b> determines that the mobile object is present in the environment in which the mobile object can transmit the sensor information to server <b>2001</b>, client device <b>2002</b> transmits, to server <b>2001</b>, the sensor information obtained at the location and the time indicated by the specification information. Consequently, server <b>2001</b> can obtain the pieces of sensor information pertaining to the occurrence of the accident from client devices <b>2002</b>, and use the pieces of sensor information for accident analysis etc.</p><p id="p-0808" num="0800">It should be noted that when client device <b>2002</b> receives a sensor information transmission request from server <b>2001</b>, client device <b>2002</b> may refuse to transmit sensor information. Additionally, client device <b>2002</b> may set in advance which pieces of sensor information can be transmitted. Alternatively, server <b>2001</b> may inquire of client device <b>2002</b> each time whether sensor information can be transmitted.</p><p id="p-0809" num="0801">A point may be given to client device <b>2002</b> that has transmitted sensor information to server <b>2001</b>. This point can be used in payment for, for example, gasoline expenses, electric vehicle (EV) charging expenses, a highway toll, or rental car expenses. After obtaining sensor information, server <b>2001</b> may delete information for specifying client device <b>2002</b> that has transmitted the sensor information. For example, this information is a network address of client device <b>2002</b>. Since this enables the anonymization of sensor information, a user of client device <b>2002</b> can securely transmit sensor information from client device <b>2002</b> to server <b>2001</b>. Server <b>2001</b> may include servers. For example, by servers sharing sensor information, even when one of the servers breaks down, the other servers can communicate with client device <b>2002</b>. Accordingly, it is possible to avoid service outage due to a server breakdown.</p><p id="p-0810" num="0802">A specified location specified by a sensor information transmission request indicates an accident occurrence location etc., and may be different from a position of client device <b>2002</b> at a specified time specified by the sensor information transmission request. For this reason, for example, by specifying, as a specified location, a range such as within XX meters of a surrounding area, server <b>2001</b> can request information from client device <b>2002</b> within the range. Similarly, server <b>2001</b> may also specify, as a specified time, a range such as within N seconds before and after a certain time. As a result, server <b>2001</b> can obtain sensor information from client device <b>2002</b> present for a time from t-N to t+N and in a location within XX meters from absolute position S. When client device <b>2002</b> transmits three-dimensional data such as LiDAR, client device <b>2002</b> may transmit data created immediately after time t.</p><p id="p-0811" num="0803">Server <b>2001</b> may separately specify information indicating, as a specified location, a location of client device <b>2002</b> from which sensor information is to be obtained, and a location at which sensor information is desirably obtained.

When client device <b>2002</b> selects three-dimensional data to be transmitted, client device <b>2002</b> selects one or more pieces of three-dimensional data so that the one or more pieces of three-dimensional data include at least the sensor information including the specified range. Each of the one or more pieces of three-dimensional data is a random-accessible unit of data. In addition, when client device <b>2002</b> transmits a visible light image, client device <b>2002</b> may transmit pieces of temporally continuous image data including at least a frame immediately before or immediately after time t.</p><p id="p-0812" num="0804">When client device <b>2002</b> can use physical networks such as 5G, Wi-Fi, or modes in 5G for transmitting sensor information, client device <b>2002</b> may select a network to be used according to the order of priority notified by server <b>2001</b>. Alternatively, client device <b>2002</b> may select a network that enables client device <b>2002</b> to ensure an appropriate bandwidth based on the size of transmit data. Alternatively, client device <b>2002</b> may select a network to be used, based on data transmission expenses etc. A transmission request from server <b>2001</b> may include information indicating a transmission deadline, for example, performing transmission when client device <b>2002</b> can start transmission by time t. When server <b>2001</b> cannot obtain sufficient sensor information within a time limit, server <b>2001</b> may issue a transmission request again.</p><p id="p-0813" num="0805">Sensor information may include header information indicating characteristics of sensor data along with compressed or uncompressed sensor data. Client device <b>2002</b> may transmit header information to server <b>2001</b> via a physical network or a communication protocol that is different from a physical network or a communication protocol used for sensor data. For example, client device <b>2002</b> transmits header information to server <b>2001</b> prior to transmitting sensor data. Server <b>2001</b> determines whether to obtain the sensor data of client device <b>2002</b>, based on a result of analysis of the header information. For example, header information may include information indicating a point cloud obtainment density, an elevation angle, or a frame rate of LiDAR, or information indicating, for example, a resolution, an SN ratio, or a frame rate of a visible light image.

Terminal <b>2021</b> is connected to network <b>2023</b> via communication device <b>2022</b>. Communication device <b>2022</b> communicates with terminal <b>2021</b> using one communication system or switching between communication systems. Communication device <b>2022</b> is a communication satellite that performs communication using, for example, (1) a base station compliant with Long-Term Evolution (LTE) etc., (2) an access point (AP) for Wi-Fi or millimeter-wave communication etc., (3) a low-power wide-area (LPWA) network gateway such as SIGFOX, LoRaWAN, or Wi-SUN, or (4) a satellite communication system such as DVB-S2.</p><p id="p-0828" num="0820">It should be noted that a base station may communicate with terminal <b>2021</b> using a system classified as an LPWA network such as Narrowband Internet of Things (NB IoT) or LTE-M, or switching between these systems.</p><p id="p-0829" num="0821">Here, although, in the example given, terminal <b>2021</b> has a function of communicating with communication device <b>2022</b> that uses two types of communication systems, and communicates with map server <b>2025</b> or data collection server <b>2024</b> using one of the communication systems or switching between the communication systems and between communication devices <b>2022</b> to be a direct communication partner; a configuration of the sensor information collection system and terminal <b>2021</b> is not limited to this. For example, terminal <b>2021</b> need not have a function of performing communication using communication systems, and may have a function of performing communication using one of the communication systems. Terminal <b>2021</b> may also support three or more communication systems. Additionally, each terminal <b>2021</b> may support a different communication system.</p><p id="p-0830" num="0822">Terminal <b>2021</b> includes, for example, the configuration of client device <b>902</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>103</b></figref>. Terminal <b>2021</b> estimates a self-location etc. using received three-dimensional data. Besides, terminal <b>2021</b> associates sensor data obtained from a sensor and position information obtained by self-location estimation to generate position-related data.</p><p id="p-0831" num="0823">Position information appended to position-related data indicates, for example, a position in a coordinate system used for three-dimensional data. For example, the position information is coordinate values represented using a value of a latitude and a value of a longitude. Here, terminal <b>2021</b> may include, in the position information, a coordinate system serving as a reference for the coordinate values and information indicating three-dimensional data used for location estimation, along with the coordinate values. Coordinate values may also include altitude information.</p><p id="p-0832" num="0824">The position information may be associated with a data unit or a space unit usable for encoding the above three-dimensional data. Such a unit is, for example, WLD, GOS, SPC, VLM, or VXL. Here, the position information is represented by, for example, an identifier for identifying a data unit such as the SPC corresponding to position-related data. It should be noted that the position information may include, for example, information indicating three-dimensional data obtained by encoding a three-dimensional space including a data unit such as the SPC or information indicating a detailed position within the SPC, in addition to the identifier for identifying the data unit such as the SPC. The information indicating the three-dimensional data is, for example, a file name of the three-dimensional data.</p><p id="p-0833" num="0825">As stated above, by generating position-related data associated with position information based on location estimation using three-dimensional data, the system can give more accurate position information to sensor information than when the system appends position information based on a self-location of a client device (terminal <b>2021</b>) obtained using a GPS to sensor information. As a result, even when another device uses the position-related data in another service, there is a possibility of more accurately determining a position corresponding to the position-related data in an actual space, by performing location estimation based on the same three-dimensional data.</p><p id="p-0834" num="0826">It should be noted that although the data transmitted from terminal <b>2021</b> is the position-related data in the example given in the present embodiment, the data transmitted from terminal <b>2021</b> may be data unassociated with position information. In other words, the transmission and reception of three-dimensional data or sensor data described in the other embodiments may be performed via network <b>2023</b> described in the present embodiment.</p><p id="p-0835" num="0827">Next, a different example of position information indicating a position in a three-dimensional or two-dimensional actual space or in a map space will be described. The position information appended to position-related data may be information indicating a relative position relative to a keypoint in three-dimensional data. Here, the keypoint serving as a reference for the position information is encoded as, for example, SWLD, and notified to terminal <b>2021</b> as three-dimensional data.</p><p id="p-0836" num="0828">The information indicating the relative position relative to the keypoint may be, for example, information that is represented by a vector from the keypoint to the point indicated by the position information, and indicates a direction and a distance from the keypoint to the point indicated by the position information. Alternatively, the information indicating the relative position relative to the keypoint may be information indicating an amount of displacement from the keypoint to the point indicated by the position information along each of the x axis, the y axis, and the z axis. Additionally, the information indicating the relative position relative to the keypoint may be information indicating a distance from each of three or more keypoints to the point indicated by the position information. It should be noted that the relative position need not be a relative position of the point indicated by the position information represented using each keypoint as a reference, and may be a relative position of each keypoint represented with respect to the point indicated by the position information. Examples of position information based on a relative position relative to a keypoint include information for identifying a keypoint to be a reference, and information indicating the relative position of the point indicated by the position information and relative to the keypoint. When the information indicating the relative position relative to the keypoint is provided separately from three-dimensional data, the information indicating the relative position relative to the keypoint may include, for example, coordinate axes used in deriving the relative position, information indicating a type of the three-dimensional data, and/or information indicating a magnitude per unit amount (e.g., a scale) of a value of the information indicating the relative position.</p><p id="p-0837" num="0829">The position information may include, for each keypoint, information indicating a relative position relative to the keypoint. When the position information is represented by relative positions relative to keypoints, terminal <b>2021</b> that intends to identify a position in an actual space indicated by the position information may calculate candidate points of the position indicated by the position information from positions of the keypoints each estimated from sensor data, and may determine that a point obtained by averaging the calculated candidate points is the point indicated by the position information. Since this configuration reduces the effects of errors when the positions of the keypoints are estimated from the sensor data, it is possible to improve the estimation accuracy for the point in the actual space indicated by the position information. Besides, when the position information includes information indicating relative positions relative to keypoints, if it is possible to detect any one of the keypoints regardless of the presence of keypoints undetectable due to a limitation such as a type or performance of a sensor included in terminal <b>2021</b>, it is possible to estimate a value of the point indicated by the position information.</p><p id="p-0838" num="0830">A point identifiable from sensor data can be used as a keypoint. Examples of the point identifiable from the sensor data include a point or a point within a region that satisfies a predetermined keypoint detection condition, such as the above-described three-dimensional feature or feature of visible light data is greater than or equal to a threshold value.</p><p id="p-0839" num="0831">Moreover, a marker etc. placed in an actual space may be used as a keypoint. In this case, the maker may be detected and located from data obtained using a sensor such as LiDAR or a camera. For example, the marker may be represented by a change in color or luminance value (degree of reflection), or a three-dimensional shape (e.g., unevenness). Coordinate values indicating a position of the marker, or a two-dimensional bar code or a bar code etc. generated from an identifier of the marker may be also used.</p><p id="p-0840" num="0832">Furthermore, a light source that transmits an optical signal may be used as a marker. When a light source of an optical signal is used as a marker, not only information for obtaining a position such as coordinate values or an identifier but also other data may be transmitted using an optical signal. For example, an optical signal may include contents of service corresponding to the position of the marker, an address for obtaining contents such as a URL, or an identifier of a wireless communication device for receiving service, and information indicating a wireless communication system etc. for connecting to the wireless communication device. The use of an optical communication device (a light source) as a marker not only facilitates the transmission of data other than information indicating a position but also makes it possible to dynamically change the data.</p><p id="p-0841" num="0833">Terminal <b>2021</b> finds out a correspondence relationship of keypoints between mutually different data using, for example, a common identifier used for the data, or information or a table indicating the correspondence relationship of the keypoints between the data. When there is no information indicating a correspondence relationship between keypoints, terminal <b>2021</b> may also determine that when coordinates of a keypoint in three-dimensional data are converted into a position in a space of another three-dimensional data, a keypoint closest to the position is a corresponding keypoint.</p><p id="p-0842" num="0834">When the position information based on the relative position described above is used, terminal <b>2021</b> that uses mutually different three-dimensional data or services can identify or estimate a position indicated by the position information with respect to a common keypoint included in or associated with each three-dimensional data. As a result, terminal <b>2021</b> that uses the mutually different three-dimensional data or the services can identify or estimate the same position with higher accuracy.</p><p id="p-0843" num="0835">Even when map data or three-dimensional data represented using mutually different coordinate systems are used, since it is possible to reduce the effects of errors caused by the conversion of a coordinate system, it is possible to coordinate services based on more accurate position information.</p><p id="p-0844" num="0836">Hereinafter, an example of functions provided by data collection server <b>2024</b> will be described. Data collection server <b>2024</b> may transfer received position-related data to another data server. When there are data servers, data collection server <b>2024</b> determines to which data server received position-related data is to be transferred, and transfers the position-related data to a data server determined as a transfer destination.</p><p id="p-0845" num="0837">Data collection server <b>2024</b> determines a transfer destination based on, for example, transfer destination server determination rules preset to data collection server <b>2024</b>. The transfer destination server determination rules are set by, for example, a transfer destination table in which identifiers respectively associated with terminals <b>2021</b> are associated with transfer destination data servers.</p><p id="p-0846" num="0838">Terminal <b>2021</b> appends an identifier associated with terminal <b>2021</b> to position-related data to be transmitted, and transmits the position-related data to data collection server <b>2024</b>. Data collection server <b>2024</b> determines a transfer destination data server corresponding to the identifier appended to the position-related data, based on the transfer destination server determination rules set out using the transfer destination table etc.; and transmits the position-related data to the determined data server. The transfer destination server determination rules may be specified based on a determination condition set using a time, a place, etc. at which position-related data is obtained. Here, examples of the identifier associated with transmission source terminal <b>2021</b> include an identifier unique to each terminal <b>2021</b> or an identifier indicating a group to which terminal <b>2021</b> belongs.</p><p id="p-0847" num="0839">The transfer destination table need not be a table in which identifiers associated with transmission source terminals are directly associated with transfer destination data servers. For example, data collection server <b>2024</b> holds a management table that stores tag information assigned to each identifier unique to terminal <b>2021</b>, and a transfer destination table in which the pieces of tag information are associated with transfer destination data servers. Data collection server <b>2024</b> may determine a transfer destination data server based on tag information, using the management table and the transfer destination table. Here, the tag information is, for example, control information for management or control information for providing service assigned to a type, a model number, an owner of terminal <b>2021</b> corresponding to the identifier, a group to which terminal <b>2021</b> belongs, or another identifier. Moreover, in the transfer destination able, identifiers unique to respective sensors may be used instead of the identifiers associated with transmission source terminals <b>2021</b>.
