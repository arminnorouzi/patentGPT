Such a fine steering adjustment is performed more often as the speed increases.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A yaw rate occurring in the vehicle from such a fine steering-angle adjustment is often smaller than the lower limit for the yaw rate visually recognizable by the driver. For example, it is difficult for the driver to accurately ascertain vehicle behavior occurring at the initial stage of steering when the vehicle begins to make a turn or in a fine steering range of corrective steering when the vehicle is traveling on a straight road.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In such a case, although vehicle behavior occurs due to a fine steering-angle adjustment, the driver may falsely recognize that the vehicle behavior has not occurred. This may cause the driver to further perform an inappropriate operation, such as either of an excessive steering operation and a delay in steering back the steering wheel.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Such an inappropriate operation may cause the actual travel line to deviate from the travel line (i.e., travel path) intended by the driver, resulting in an increased frequency of steering performed by the driver and an occurrence of wobbling of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">It is desirable to provide a vehicle-behavior notification device that notifies a driver of minute vehicle behavior that is difficult for the driver to visually recognize.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A vehicle-behavior notification device according to a first embodiment of the disclosure will be described below.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The vehicle-behavior notification device according to the first embodiment is equipped in an automobile, such as a car.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram schematically illustrating the configuration of the vehicle-behavior notification device according to the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A vehicle-behavior notification device <b>1</b> has a behavior control unit <b>100</b>, a hydraulic control unit <b>110</b>, a steering control unit <b>200</b>, and a behavior-display control unit <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Each unit may be a microcomputer having, for example, an information processor, such as a central processing unit (CPU), storage units, such as a random access memory (RAM) and a read-only memory (ROM), an input/output interface, and a bus that couples these units to one another.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The units are capable of transmitting various kinds of information via a vehicular local area network (LAN), such as a controller-area-network (CAN) communication system, or by directly communicating with each other.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The behavior control unit <b>100</b> serves as a braking controller that controls hydraulic service brakes (i.e., braking devices) (not illustrated) provided for the individual wheels of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The behavior control unit <b>100</b> is capable of individually controlling the brake fluid pressures of wheel cylinders <b>112</b> of the individual wheels and causing the service brakes for the individual wheels to generate desired braking forces by giving a command to the hydraulic control unit <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The behavior control unit <b>100</b> is coupled to, for example, a vehicle speed sensor <b>101</b> and a yaw rate sensor <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The vehicle speed sensor <b>101</b> is configured to detect the rotational speed (i.e., wheel speed) of each wheel.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The yaw rate sensor <b>102</b> is configured to detect a yaw rate as a rotational speed around the vertical axis of the vehicle body.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">An output from each of the vehicle speed sensor <b>101</b> and the yaw rate sensor <b>102</b> is to be used in, for example, antilock braking control and orientation stabilization control to be described below.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Antilock braking control involves, for example, reducing the brake fluid pressures on the wheels when wheel locking occurs during braking, so as to recover the rotation of the wheels.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Orientation stabilization control involves generating a braking-force difference between the left and right wheels when either of oversteer behavior and understeer behavior occurs in the vehicle, so as to generate a yaw moment in a direction for suppressing the behavior.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The behavior control unit <b>100</b> calculates a target yaw rate, serving as a yaw rate that may occur in the vehicle body during normal traveling, based on a steering angle of a steering device acquired from the steering control unit <b>200</b> and a vehicle speed detected by the vehicle speed sensor <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In accordance with a deviation between the actual yaw rate (i.e., real yaw rate) detected by the yaw rate sensor <b>102</b> and the target yaw rate, the behavior control unit <b>100</b> sets the direction and the magnitude of the yaw moment to be generated in the control of the braking forces.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The hydraulic control unit <b>110</b> is a hydraulic pressure controller that individually adjusts the brake fluid pressures of the wheel cylinders <b>112</b> of the individual wheels.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The hydraulic control unit <b>110</b> includes, for example, an electric pump for pressurizing the brake fluid, as well as a pressure increasing valve, a pressure reducing valve, and a pressure maintaining valve for controlling the brake fluid pressures of the wheel cylinders <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The hydraulic control unit <b>110</b> is coupled to, for example, a master cylinder <b>111</b> and the wheel cylinders <b>112</b> by using brake fluid pipes.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The master cylinder <b>111</b> pressurizes the brake fluid in accordance with an operation performed by the driver on the brake pedal (not illustrated) for a braking operation.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The brake fluid pressure generated by the master cylinder <b>111</b> is transmitted to each wheel cylinder <b>112</b> via the hydraulic control unit <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The hydraulic control unit <b>110</b> has a function for increasing and reducing the brake fluid pressures of the wheel cylinders <b>112</b> by increasing and reducing the brake fluid pressure generated by the master cylinder <b>111</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The wheel cylinders <b>112</b> are provided for the individual wheels and are each configured to generate a frictional force (i.e., braking force) according to the brake fluid pressure by, for example, pressing a brake pad against a disk rotor.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The steering control unit <b>200</b> is configured to control the steering device used for steering the front wheels serving as steering control wheels of the

steering device has, for example, a steering wheel <b>210</b>, a steering shaft <b>220</b>, an intermediate shaft <b>221</b>, a pinion shaft <b>222</b>, a rack shaft <b>230</b>, a rack housing <b>240</b>, tie rods <b>250</b>, housings <b>260</b>, and an actuator unit <b>270</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The steering wheel <b>210</b> is a ring-shaped operational member to be rotated by the driver for inputting a steering operation.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The steering wheel <b>210</b> is disposed facing the driver seat inside the vehicle cabin.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The steering shaft <b>220</b> is a rotating shaft whose one end is attached to the steering wheel <b>210</b> and that transmits a rotational motion of the steering wheel <b>210</b> to a rack-and-pinion mechanism that converts the rotational motion into a translational motion in the vehicle-width direction.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The end of the steering shaft <b>220</b> opposite from the steering wheel <b>210</b> is sequentially coupled to the intermediate shaft <b>221</b> and the pinion shaft <b>222</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Universal joints (i.e., Cardan joints) <b>223</b> and <b>224</b> capable of transmitting rotation in state where the shafts are bent are provided between the steering shaft <b>220</b> and the intermediate shaft <b>221</b> as well as between the intermediate shaft <b>221</b> and the pinion shaft <b>222</b>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The distal end of the pinion shaft <b>222</b> is provided with a pinion gear that meshes with a rack gear <b>231</b> of the rack shaft <b>230</b> to drive the rack shaft <b>230</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The rack shaft <b>230</b> is a columnar member whose longitudinal direction (i.e., axial direction) is disposed parallel to the vehicle-width direction.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The rack shaft <b>230</b> is supported in a translationally movable manner in the vehicle-width

The display mode (i.e., the notification mode) in each embodiment is an example and may be changed, where appropriate, without being limited thereto. For example, as alternatives to the image display device and the head-up display device, measuring devices, such as a pointer device, and various kinds of display devices, such as a bar-graph display device having an array of a plurality of light emitters, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), may be used. Moreover, the audio-information-based notification as in the fourth embodiment may be performed in combination with visual display.</li>        <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0180">3. As an alternative to each of the embodiments in which it is determined whether a steering operation is performed by the driver based on a steering angle, the determination may be performed using another technique. For example, an output from a torque sensor that detects a steering torque may be used to determine whether a steering operation is performed.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0174" num="0181">The vehicle-behavior notification device <b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> can be implemented by circuitry including at least one semiconductor integrated circuit such as at least one processor (e.g., a central processing unit (CPU)), at least one application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), and/or at least one field programmable gate array (FPGA).
