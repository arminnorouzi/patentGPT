Supply chain efficiencies rely on efficient inbound and outbound operations. Outbound operations are the actions required to get the final inventory/goods delivered to the end points such as receiving orders, checking, packing, and shipping. With ineffective logistic process, companies have tough times sourcing products and getting products delivered to the end points. There are few tools available which focus more on the managerial and operational part of the problem. For e.g. there are transportation management tools which aid in tracking and executing the delivery orders; however, the manager carries out the planning manually. Most of the tools focuses on warehouse management solutions. Intelligent tools for delivery/dispatch planning catering tailor made requirements specific to problem contexts are lacking. Generally, in small scale firm the dispatch planning happens manually. Manual process leads to slow reaction to changing demand or other variations that may occur and leads to sub optimal planning.

end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Other features of the present embodiments will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description that follows.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031">By way of example, one of the exemplary objectives of examples of this technology is to overcome the technical problem mentioned in the background section through a system for automated dispatch scheduling in warehouse outbound operations as described in various embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In supply chain management or inventory management, stores and warehouses are crucial as they facilitate movement of inventory to fulfill the demands in the market. In retail, demand forecasting is the practice of predicting which and how many products will customers buy over a specific period. Demand forecasting is typically done using historical data as well as external insights such as consumer trend, inflation, per capita income, employment index etc. and internal insights such as seasonality and trends of historical sales data available at store level. Forecasting helps retailers understand when they need to order new inventory from warehouse, and how much they need to procure/order. From warehouse perspective, an outbound side refers to the transport of inventory from the warehouse to stores. Based on the forecasted demand from the store, the warehouse needs to plan the delivery. The fact that one warehouse handles the request from multiple stores and one company may have various such stores, the outbound operation becomes complex as the supply chain network grows. Due to highly varying demand, the warehouses needed to act swiftly, in real-time so that the operations don't halt.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The present scenario comprises a network wherein each store is catered by a single warehouse. The planning process for such a scenario comprises developing a daily dispatch schedule from warehouses to stores. The dispatch schedule must adhere to many constraints like, the dispatch schedule should meet the store demands (SLA should be taken care) else it may lead to loss in sales. Typically, a store cannot receive the dispatch on all days of a week. Also, there are restrictions on the number of dispatches a store can receive in one week. Another constraint is that there may be labor availability/throughput restrictions at the warehouse. This planning process typically is an NP-hard problem.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Warehouse managers or production planners plan for the workforce to carry out the day-to-day operations in the facility. The challenge is to arrive at the schedule to handle daily outbound product flows. Generally, due to high variability in the demand and product outflow from the warehouse, workforce requirement is inconsistent. This may result in overtime or hiring of contractual labor to manage the surplus workload or no-work or firing on some other days. The present technique will make the dispatch scheduling far more competitive and dynamic with the changing business scenarios.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The main objective of the present technique is to generate an implementable output for throughput of the warehouse with minimal variation across the planning horizon through an ensemble approach. The disclosed technique provides a system for processing and generation of dispatch schedule that caters to the demand of every immediate downstream store that is served by the warehouse considering forecasted demand.

The weekly pattern may represent the delivery pattern to the store in a particular week. For Example, if Store-1 can receive two deliveries in a week, the pattern &#x2018;1010000&#x2019; represents that deliveries are accepted by the store on Sunday and Tuesday (can also be termed as &#x2018;order flag&#x2019; wherein each digit representing the day of a week in sequence, &#x2018;1&#x2019; representing &#x2018;delivery accepted/required&#x2019; and &#x2018;0&#x2019; representing &#x2018;deliver not required&#x2019;).

which represents variation in outbound operations, which is determined as summation of two aspects Z<sub>1 </sub>and Z<sub>2</sub>. First aspect Z<sub>1 </sub>indicates variation in daily output from the warehouse. For example, on day 1 the output is 11 and on day 2 the output is 12 and on day 3 the output is 10, sl1 will have the value 1 (i.e. 12&#x2212;11) and sl2 will have the value 2 (i.e. 12&#x2212;10). The total sum of sl1 and sl2 must be as low as possible. Second aspect Z<sub>2 </sub>indicates variation in supply for the required demand if supply is less than demand. For example, if demand from the warehouse is 50 units, the system through the algorithm may generate dispatch schedule in such a way to allocate supply as close to 50 units as possible and at the same time not deviate much from the balanced throughput. The variable sl3 is given more importance compared to sl1 and sl2 variables as can be seen by the co-efficient of 100 provided, thereby adding more weightage in the equation.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0094">Some of the constraints such as, but not limited to capacity constraints, minimum outbound, demand constraints, frequency constraints, slack constraints and/or link constraints may be considered based on the operation context and requirements to replicate the problem as close as possible to the real-world scenario.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0095">The capacity constraint may indicate the fulfilment capacity of the warehouse with respect to resources like manpower, machinery, inventory available in warehouse, etc. Physically it is not possible to transfer more units of inventory from the warehouse beyond the capacity of the warehouse.

Every store has a frequency requirement per week. (E.g. Store-1 accepts delivery just once per week, Store-2 twice per week, and so on). Consideration of demand at the store may not be required at the stock-keeping unit level. Aggregated demand converted in terms of inventory to be shipped may be considered so that there is a single demand number/quantity per store per day.

The genetic algorithm is a search heuristic algorithm that is inspired by Charles Darwin's theory of natural evolution and reflects the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction to produce offspring of the next generation. The genetic algorithm implementation follows a responsibility driven approach which means that each part of the genetic algorithm is isolated into individual classes making it possible to put together an optimizer satisfying the needs of a specific optimization problem. The most important part of the genetic algorithm is to define the evaluation function and population. The genetic algorithm may be configured to generate delivery schedules for the warehouse to cater requirement of stores, to ensure that the demands at the store are met by the given delivery schedule and to ensure that there is less variation in the daily warehouse outbound operations to minimize the variation (excess/less) in outbound operations.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a process flow diagram illustrating sequence of steps executed by the optimizer (automated dispatch scheduling system) to generate dispatch schedule plan using custom genetic algorithm, according to one or more embodiments. In one or more embodiments, a population may be defined as in step <b>802</b>. A population is a group of individuals wherein every individual is represented by a chromosome, and each chromosome comprises genes which are nothing but the variables for the given set of optimization problem. It is to be noted that the significant part of genetic algorithm lies in designing the chromosome, developing a fitness function, and determining the set of delivery patterns to avoid suboptimal/infeasible solution. A chromosome may comprise two parts that depend on the task that the chromosome needs to perform. The outcome of the custom genetic algorithm is to determine when to dispatch inventory/goods to the store and how much amount of inventory/goods to be included in each dispatch. To achieve the outcome, the chromosome may be designed by the optimizer/system as, for each week&#x2014;the first part of the chromosome comprises gene which may represent the pattern number for the store for a week; and the second part may comprise the amount of inventory that need to be delivered from the warehouse to that store in a week according to the selected pattern. For example, if there are &#x2018;x&#x2019; stores, the for a week, the first &#x2018;x&#x2019; genes may represent the patterns assigned to each store. Consider that Store-1 has delivery frequency 3, and a pattern Monday-Wednesday-Friday is selected for the store. Thus, for Store-1, amount of inventory to be included in all three delivery needs to be determined. This will result in addition of 3 genes to the chromosome representing the quantity to be delivered to the Store-1 in 3 days. So, if there are x stores and each has a delivery frequency of 2 then for 1 week the length of the chromosome will be x+2*x. Similarly, the chromosome will be built for the remaining weeks. The length of the chromosome will be proportional to number of stores, number of weeks and delivery frequency for each store.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">In an example embodiment, if Store-1 is opting for 3 deliveries in a week, then the possible delivery frequency combinations may be <sup>7</sup>C<sub>3</sub>, i.e., 35 as illustrated in Table 8.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00009" num="00009"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 8</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Exemplary delivery frequency combinations for Store-1</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="8"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="14pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Days</entry><entry>Sun</entry><entry>Mon</entry><entry>Tue</entry><entry>Wed</entry><entry>Thu</entry><entry>Fri</entry><entry>Sat</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="8" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Pattern 1</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>0</entry></row><row><entry>Pattern 2</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>0</entry></row><row><entry>Pattern 3</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>1</entry></row><row><entry>.</entry><entry>.</entry><entry>.</entry><entry>.</entry><entry>.</entry><entry>.</entry><entry>.</entry><entry>.</entry></row><row><entry>.</entry><entry>.</entry><entry>.</entry><entry>.</entry><entry>.</entry><entry>.</entry><entry>.</entry><entry>.</entry></row><row><entry>.</entry><entry>.</entry><entry>.</entry><entry>.</entry><entry>.</entry><entry>.</entry><entry>.</entry><entry>.</entry></row><row><entry>Pattern 35</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>0</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="8" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0119" num="0117">As illustrated in Table 8, there may be 35 possible combinations of delivery frequency but combinations where deliveries are scheduled on consecutive days are poor options and are not recommended.

Each of the generated chromosomes are evaluated/assessed for their performances using fitness value/scores. The higher the fitness score, better the solution. This scoring may be performed by&#x2014;determining the variance of the quantities delivered to the store which are present in the second part of the chromosomes; by identifying whether there a stock out or lost demand for the determined set of possible deliveries at each store; and by determining the inventory level maintained at the store. The variance of the quantities delivered may be determined by calculating sum of squares of the difference in units transferred daily and the mean and the whole expression being divided by the total number of days. If there is stock out or lost demand, the penalty value may be considered while determining the score which is proportional to the square of the stock out quantities. The concept of &#x2018;penalty&#x2019; is to make the algorithm give importance to the lost sales and try to send more units from warehouse to the stores without merely looking at balancing the throughput from the warehouse. Also, penalty values may be considered while scoring when the inventory level maintained at the store is too high or too low which may be defined based on safety stock (SS) levels. For example, if SS becomes less than half of actual capacity it is considered as too low and if SS is double the demand it is considered as too high. The fitness score of a chromosome is inverse of weighted sum of the above-mentioned factors. Thus, the chromosome with highest score may be considered as best fit (best solution) in the population generated. However, there may be another chromosome which may be better than the best fit obtained. To determine the best chromosome, mating pools may be identified comprising pair of chromosomes called as parents selected from the population, as in step <b>806</b>. The parent population is chosen based on fitness score of chromosomes such that a high-quality chromosome has a higher probability of being selected in the pool (fitness-proportionate selection). After selecting the parent population, cross-over/mating may be performed to generate offspring, as in step <b>808</b>. Each set of parents in the mating pool may produce two offspring i.e. two other chromosomes. Thus, if there are 100 individuals (chromosomes) in the population, the mating pool will have 50 sets of parents chosen probabilistically which will produce 2 offspring each. Therefore, we will now have 100 offspring forming the children population. The offspring may be generated using a random point crossover. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates representation of parent chromosomes <b>1002</b> and <b>1004</b> wherein that part <b>1</b> and part <b>2</b> are shaded different in each of the chromosomes <b>1002</b> and <b>1004</b> for representation purpose. The split points are selected randomly, and the mating/cross-over is performed which results in offspring chromosomes <b>1010</b> and <b>1012</b>. It should be observed that each part of the chromosome is treated as an independent chromosome. One point is chosen at random in each of the two parts of the chromosome and the genes are then exchanged as depicted in <b>1006</b> and <b>1008</b> to generate the offspring chromosomes. After crossing over of all the parents, the resultant may be an initial population and a children population, both of equal size.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0121">While mating/cross-over enhances the exploitation of the best solution and converges the algorithm towards a solution, the mutation <b>810</b> is a divergence operation that enables exploration by increasing the diversity and provides a mechanism for escaping from a local optimum. The mutation rate is the number of genes in each chromosome of the children population to be mutated. Let us suppose the mutation rate is 5%, then 5% of randomly selected genes in every chromosome of the children chromosome will be replaced by a random value that it can take. This may result in 100 mutated offspring as in step <b>812</b> constituting the mutated population.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0122">There are three population&#x2014;parent population (initial population), the children population, and the mutated population of equal size.
