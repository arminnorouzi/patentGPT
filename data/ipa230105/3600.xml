Fluorocarbons, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) became commonplace in air conditioning and refrigeration systems in the 20th century due to their favorable thermodynamic properties, their non-flammability, and their non-toxicity. However, while the inert nature of many CFCs and HCFCs made them preferred choices for use as refrigerants in air conditioning and refrigeration systems for many years, that same inert nature contributed to their long lifecycles in the atmosphere. After the discovery of ozone holes in the stratosphere over the polar regions in the early 1980s, air conditioning and refrigeration systems transitioned to hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants which were not ozone depleting, such as R-134a, R-143a, and R-410A. In the early 21st century, new refrigerants were developed to be even safer for the environment. These new refrigerants are commonly referred to as lower global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) has promulgated standards classifying various refrigerants according to their toxicity and flammability. For example, ASHRAE Standard 34 classifies refrigerants having a lower toxicity as Class A refrigerants, and refrigerants having a higher toxicity as Class B refrigerants. The flammability class of refrigerants is determined according to ASTM E681, Standard Test Method for Concentration Limits of Flammability of Chemicals (Vapors and Gases) at a temperature of 60&#xb0; C. and a pressure of 101 kPa. According to ASHRAE Standard 34, Class 1 refrigerants do not propagate a flame, Class 2L refrigerants have a lower flammability and a slow flame propagation (for example, a burning velocity less than 10 cm/s), Class 2 refrigerants have lower flammability and faster flame propagation (for example, a burning velocity of greater than 10 cm/s), while Class 3 refrigerants have a higher flammability and faster flame propagation (for example, a burning velocity greater than 10 cm/s). Under the ASHRAE Standard 34, the commonly used R-410A refrigerant has a Class A toxicity classification and a Class 1 flammability classification. Thus, R-410A is referred to as an A1 refrigerant under ASHRAE Standard 34.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">New lower GWP refrigerants include, but are not limited to, refrigerants such as R-1234yf, R-1234ze, R-32, R-454A, R-454C, R-455A, R-447A, R-452B, and R-454B. These refrigerants have a Class A toxicity classification and a Class 2L flammability classification under ASHRAE Standard 34. These refrigerants may be referred to as A2L refrigerants. Because A2L refrigerants have the ability to propagate a flame, precautions must be taken to prevent the accidental build-up of A2L refrigerants, particularly in enclosed spaces. However, A2L refrigerants will not ignite if their concentration level is below their lower flammability limit. Thus, there is the need to provide apparatus, systems, and methods for detecting A2L refrigerant leaks and the build-up of A2L refrigerants in air conditioning and refrigeration systems.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">New and useful systems, apparatuses, and methods for a sensor are set forth in the appended claims.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, some examples of the refrigeration cycle system <b>100</b> may include a refrigeration circuit including an evaporator unit <b>102</b> and a condenser unit <b>104</b>. According to some examples, the evaporator unit <b>102</b> may be located indoors and referred to as an indoor unit, while the condenser unit <b>104</b> may be located outdoors and referred to as an outdoor unit. The evaporator unit <b>102</b> may include an evaporator <b>106</b>, such as an evaporator coil, and the condenser unit <b>104</b> may include a compressor <b>108</b> and a condenser <b>110</b>. The evaporator <b>106</b>, compressor <b>108</b>, and the condenser <b>110</b> may be fluidly coupled, such as by a pipe, gas line, or liquid line. For example, the evaporator <b>106</b> may be fluidly coupled to the compressor <b>108</b> by a suction line. In some examples, the evaporator <b>106</b> may be fluidly coupled to the condenser <b>110</b> by a liquid line. According to exemplary embodiments, the compressor <b>108</b> may be fluidly coupled to the condenser <b>110</b> by a hot gas line.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The refrigeration cycle system <b>100</b> may circulate a working fluid within the refrigeration circuit. The working fluid may contain a refrigerant, such as an air-to-liquid (A2L) refrigerant. For example, the A2L refrigerant may include R-1234yf, R-1234ze, R-32, R-454A, R-454C, R-455A, R-447A, R-452B, or R-454B. Alternatively, the working fluid may be water.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In operation, the compressor <b>108</b> may receive the working fluid through a suction port, compress the working fluid, and discharge the compressed working fluid through a discharge port. After the working fluid is compressed by the compressor <b>108</b>, the working fluid gas be provided to the condenser <b>110</b> in a gas form through the hot gas line. The condenser <b>110</b> cools the working fluid, which condenses back into liquid form. The working fluid may be transported from the condenser <b>110</b> to the evaporator <b>106</b> through the liquid line. At the evaporator <b>106</b>, heat is absorbed by the working fluid, causing the working fluid to expand into a gas or liquid-gas mixture. As a result of the working fluid's phase change from liquid into gas in the evaporator <b>106</b>, the temperature of the working fluid is decreased, and the cooled gas may absorb heat energy from the evaporator <b>106</b>, cooling the exterior of the evaporator <b>106</b> in the process. A fan (not shown) may provide airflow over the cooled exterior of the evaporator <b>106</b>. As the air flows over the cooled exterior of the evaporator <b>106</b>, the evaporator <b>106</b> may absorb heat energy from the flowing air, cooling the air. This cooled air may then be provided via ductwork to an air conditioned environment, such as the interior of a room within a building.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The refrigeration cycle system <b>100</b> may also include various monitoring and control means, such as sensors, thermostats, and processors. For example, evaporator unit sensors <b>112</b> may be provided within a housing member of the evaporator unit <b>102</b>, and condenser unit sensors <b>114</b> may be provided within a housing member of the condenser unit <b>104</b>. The evaporator unit sensors <b>112</b> and condenser unit sensors <b>114</b> may be operatively coupled to a controller <b>116</b> (e.g., a processor). In some examples, a thermostat <b>118</b> may be provided to monitor the air conditioned environment. The thermostat <b>118</b> may also be operatively coupled to the controller <b>116</b>. In illustrative embodiments, additional ambient sensors <b>120</b> may also be provided and operatively coupled to the controller <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>4</b></figref>, an example sensor assembly <b>200</b> is illustrated. The sensor assembly <b>200</b> may be an example sensor of the evaporator unit sensors <b>112</b>, an example sensor of the condenser unit sensors <b>114</b>, or an example thermostat <b>118</b>, as previously described. The sensor assembly <b>200</b> may be a gas sensor, such as an A2L refrigerant sensor or other gas sensor.
