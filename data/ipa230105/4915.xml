Engineering knowledge <b>50</b> and know-how of service technicians is captured in a set of rules <b>56</b>. Building operational data is received and the rules <b>56</b> are applied against the building operational data to identify faults in the building system. In one example, the building operational data may include zone temperatures and zone setpoints. The mode of the equipment servicing the various zones may also be included. When a particular zone is in a cooling mode, and the zone temperature exceeds the zone temperature by a threshold amount, a rule may be triggered. The rule may capture engineering knowledge <b>50</b> and know-how of service technicians to identify this condition as a &#x201c;cooling valve stuck&#x201d; fault. The rule may also identify a symptom such as &#x201c;Zone Hot in Full Cooling&#x2014;Zone temp is higher than setpoint by 2&#xb0; C.&#x201d;, a result such as &#x201c;Comfort within the zone which is served by the asset is at risk, most probably the zone temperature cannot be kept&#x201d; and an impact on the relevant KPI such as &#x201c;Comfort Performance Indicator (KPI) will go down&#x201d;. Faults in a building system that do impact valves, actuators, heating or cooling coils will typically cause under-performing comfort KPIs. Faults like oscillation in control typically will typically cause under-performing energy and/or asset lifetime KPIs.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Rules <b>56</b> may distill years of experience in relating faults to root causes and resulting impacts on comfort, energy consumption and other KPIs, are provide a source of service cases <b>60</b>. In the example shown, anomaly Detection <b>58</b> employs machine learning (MI) algorithms to study operational data looking for situations that are outside of what is expected. As an example, if the performance efficiency of a chiller suddenly or gradually drops below an expected threshold, even if no faults are detected, this may be characterized as an anomaly. The Anomaly Detection <b>58</b> may itself also include a set of rules or the like that relate detected anomalies with both root causes and resulting impacts on comfort, energy consumption and other KPIs, which in turn provides another source of service cases <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Asset performance assessment <b>62</b> may include assigning an availability KPI for each asset. For example, in one example, if a particular asset (e.g. building component) has zero faults for a period of time, the asset availability would be determined to be 100% for that period of time. The corresponding KPI for that asset would also have a value of 100%. If a particular asset has one or more faults that span 50% of the period of time, the asset availability would be determined to be 50% for that period of time, and the corresponding KPI for that asset would be 50%. In some cases, the asset availability provides an indication of the relative fraction of time (during the period of time) that the particular asset is operating without any detected faults. An Asset KPIs with Relation to Service block <b>64</b> represents the output given to a facilities manager, in the form of one or more KPI's included in a hierarchal dashboard.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing how illustrative asset KPIs are determined. Data flow is as follows. Telemetry data is collected and the data is modeled in order to create a virtual building model that includes all assets, related points and supply relationships. In some cases, both the telemetry data and the resulting virtual building model may be stored in the cloud. Rules are used to analyze the data and identify faults. The impacts of those faults are determined from the rule or rules that triggered the fault. KPIs are calculated across zones and assets and are presented in a dashboard that include the KPIs, sometimes with links to the faults.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the example shown, an Analytics Engine <b>100</b> receives information from a weather block <b>102</b>, a building model <b>104</b> (which stores the virtual model) and a operational data form a Building Automation System <b>106</b>. The Analytics Engine <b>100</b> includes a Rules block <b>100</b><i>a </i>that stores and applies the rules to operational data, as well as an AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning) block <b>100</b><i>b </i>that analyzes operational data to detect anomalies in operation. Both the Rules block <b>100</b><i>a </i>and the AI/ML block <b>100</b><i>b </i>may output one or more service cases. The Service Management System <b>112</b> may maintain and track the status of generated service cases. An Asset Availability block <b>108</b> correlates asset KPIs with how the assets are serviced. The Asset Availability Service <b>110</b> calculates Asset KPIs based on the asset KPIs provided by the Asset Availability block <b>108</b> as discussed above with respect to the Anomaly Detection <b>58</b>, as well as the status of the service cases provided by the Service Management System <b>112</b>. The analytics engine <b>100</b> may also determine an impact, if any, of the one or more service cases on each of the one or more KPIs. In some cases, the analytics engine <b>100</b> may determine a root cause of each of the one or more faults/service cases.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flow diagram showing an illustrative method <b>120</b> for monitoring performance of a building system (such as the building system <b>12</b>) of a building (such as the building <b>14</b>) based on one or more Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), each of the one or more KPIs representing a corresponding measure of building performance.

The current time must therefore be before the close of October. If the user selects a shorter period of time, the graphical panel <b>316</b> may provide a bar graph divided into smaller units of time. Instead of months, the graphical panel <b>316</b> may show the KPI value or each week, or even for each day, depending on the selected period of time.

The system may also display a number of sub-KPI's that affect the selected KPI. The sub-KPI's may be sorted by performance. The operator may then select a sub-KPI that is underperforming. In response, the system may display KPIs for building components that are responsible for maintaining the performance of the selected sub-KPI. The system may also automatically display service cases that relate to the building components that are responsible for maintaining the performance of the selected sub-KPI. The building components that are responsible for maintaining the performance of the selected sub-KPI may be sorted by performance. The operator may then select a building component that is underperforming. The system may then display service cases that relate to the selected building component.
