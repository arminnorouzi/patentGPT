level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A variety of diseases exists that require regular treatment by delivery, particularly injection of a medicament. Such injection can be performed by using injection devices, which are applied either by medical personnel or by patients themselves.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Drug delivery devices particularly for usage by patients themselves may be equipped with electronics for measuring and storing data related to the usage. The usage related data may also be transmitted via a wireless link or a wireline connection to an external device such as a smartphone, a tablet or laptop computer, or in the cloud. For example, US 2019/0134305 A1 discloses a medication delivery device, for example an injection pen or a wearable pump, which can be paired with an external device for providing data captured from a flow sensor relating to medicine delivery to a patient to a paired external device. The device can have Bluetooth&#xae; communication and/or near field communication (NFC) circuits for proximity-based pairing and connectivity with the external device for real-time or deferred transfer of captured data to the external device.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another drug delivery device is disclosed e.g. in WO2019036576A1.

Transmission of data via NFC or Bluetooth from the accessory to an external device is described.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect the present disclosure provides a wireless data communication circuitry for a drug delivery device comprising a wireless communication processor for handling wireless data communication, a battery connector having a positive and a negative terminal, the positive terminal and the negative terminal being connected to respective terminals of the wireless communication processor for supplying the wireless communication processor with electrical energy from a battery connectable to the battery connector, and an arrangement of one or more capacitors, each one of the capacitors being connected in parallel to the positive terminal and the negative terminal of the battery connector and provided for backing up the supplying of the wireless communication processor with electrical energy from the battery connectable to the battery connector. The wireless communication processor may be configured to handle wireless data communication according to one or more wireless communication technologies, particularly low power wireless communication technologies including RF-based technologies such as Bluetooth&#xae; Low Energy, ANT (Adaptive Network Technology) from ANT Wireless, ZigBee&#x2122;, NFC (Near Field Communication), Wi-Fi&#x2122;. It turns out that the battery life for operating a wireless communication processor can be extended with connecting an arrangement of one or more capacitors in parallel to the positive and terminal of the battery connector. Particularly, this arrangement of capacitors may extend battery life with low power wireless communication technologies, which employ a kind burst mode data transmission periodically after several seconds or within a second.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In embodiments, each one of the capacitors is permanently connected in parallel to the positive and the negative terminal of the battery connector. Thus, the one or more capacitors are not &#x201c;switched&#x201d; out of the circuitry but are permanently connected. This allows the one or more capacitors to settle to a much a lower leakage current than it may be considered to be possible.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In embodiments, the wireless communication processor may particularly comprise a Bluetooth&#xae; communication circuitry with an antenna configured for Bluetooth&#xae; communication, wherein the Bluetooth&#xae; communication circuitry comprises a Bluetooth&#xae; Low Energy radio circuitry for wireless data communication.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In more specific embodiments, the arrangement of one or more capacitors may consist of four capacitors or five capacitors. Experiments have shown that an arrangement of four or five capacitors, particularly with different capacities, may increase battery life such that requirements of drug delivery devices and their duration of usage may be well met.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a specific embodiment, the arrangement of four capacitors or five capacitors may comprise two capacitors with a capacity of 220 microfarads and two or three capacitors with a capacity of 47 microfarads. Such an arrangement has been proven to be a suitable solution for extending the battery life of a typical button cell such as the cell type CR1225 with a terminal voltage around 3 volts and a capacity of about 48 milliampere-hour.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In specific embodiments, the arrangement of one or more capacitors may also comprise one or more of the following: a ceramic capacitor; a film capacitor; a polymer capacitor;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">a mica capacitor; an electrolytic capacitor; a tantalum capacitor.

The device <b>12</b> comprises an elongated body <b>120</b> having a pen-like shaped form for holding a drug cartridge and a dosage selection and delivery mechanism. At the lower end of the body <b>120</b>, a syringe <b>122</b> for expelling a drug dosage and injecting this dosage in a patient's body is provided. The body <b>120</b> comprises at its other, upper end a dial knob <b>124</b> for selecting a drug dosage and an injection knob <b>128</b> for delivery of a selected dosage. In an alternative device the dial knob may also be the injection knob.

The selected dosage is shown on a display <b>126</b> integrated in the body <b>120</b>. After dosage selection, the user may press the injection knob <b>128</b> in the direction of the longitudinal axis for expelling the selected dosage via the syringe <b>122</b> into a patient's body.

An active pharmaceutical ingredient (&#x201c;API&#x201d;), in the broadest terms, is a chemical structure that has a biological effect on humans or animals. In pharmacology, a drug or medicament is used in the treatment, cure, prevention, or diagnosis of disease or used to otherwise enhance physical or mental well-being. A drug or medicament may be used for a limited duration, or on a regular basis for chronic disorders.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0063">As described below, a drug or medicament can include at least one API, or combinations thereof, in various types of formulations, for the treatment of one or more diseases. Examples of API may include small molecules having a molecular weight of 500 Da or less; polypeptides, peptides and proteins (e.g., hormones, growth factors, antibodies, antibody fragments, and enzymes); carbohydrates and polysaccharides; and nucleic acids, double or single stranded DNA (including naked and cDNA), RNA, antisense nucleic acids such as antisense DNA and RNA, small interfering RNA (siRNA), ribozymes, genes, and oligonucleotides. Nucleic acids may be incorporated into molecular delivery systems such as vectors, plasmids, or liposomes. Mixtures of one or more drugs are also contemplated.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0064">The drug or medicament may be contained in a primary package or &#x201c;drug container&#x201d; adapted for use with a drug delivery device. The drug container may be, e.g., a cartridge, syringe, reservoir, or other solid or flexible vessel configured to provide a suitable chamber for storage (e.g., short- or long-term storage) of one or more drugs. For example, in some instances, the chamber may be designed to store a drug for at least one day (e.g., 1 to at least 30 days). In some instances, the chamber may be designed to store a drug for about 1 month to about 2 years. Storage may occur at room temperature (e.g., about 20&#xb0; C.), or refrigerated temperatures (e.g., from about &#x2212;4&#xb0; C. to about 4&#xb0; C.). In some instances, the drug container may be or may include a dual-chamber cartridge configured to store two or more components of the pharmaceutical formulation to-be-administered (e.g., an API and a diluent, or two different drugs) separately, one in each chamber. In such instances, the two chambers of the dual-chamber cartridge may be configured to allow mixing between the two or more components prior to and/or during dispensing into the human or animal body. For example, the two chambers may be configured such that they are in fluid communication with each other (e.g., by way of a conduit between the two chambers) and allow mixing of the two components when desired by a user prior to dispensing. Alternatively, or in addition, the two chambers may be configured to allow mixing as the components are being dispensed into the human or animal body.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0065">The drugs or medicaments contained in the drug delivery devices as described herein can be used for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of many different types of medical disorders.
