(e.g., flossing), and oral rinsing with antiseptic solutions are methods recommended by dental practitioners to prevent periodontal disease, gum disease (e.g., gingivitis), and/or tooth loss. However, for a variety of reasons, few individuals include all of these steps as part of their regular dental hygiene practice. Without adequate cleaning, bacteria levels in the mouth may rise and increase the likelihood of tooth decay, gum disease, and may even cause systemic inflammation. Elevated levels of inflammation have been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (e.g., developing atherosclerotic plaques, heart attack, stroke) and other diseases or conditions.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Currently, water flossers are available that provide high-speed fluid jets, as well as electric toothbrushes with vibrating bristles. The high-speed bristle motion may remove plaque and/or biofilms more efficiently than manual brushing. However, some oral care devices may be cumbersome and/or time-consuming to design and validate, thereby increasing their cost and increasing the barrier to entry for consumers. Accordingly, additional methods for manufacturing oral care devices may be desirable.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Described herein are methods of generating a model (e.g., template) of an oral insert that is configured to provide personal oral irrigation. The oral insert may comprise a fluid inlet port, fluid nozzles, manifolds, and a tray configured to retain teeth. The method may comprise displaying a graphical representation of the oral insert model, generating a geometry of the fluid nozzles based on oral scan data of a jaw, defining a tray surface that encloses the fluid nozzles based on the oral scan data, and generating a geometry of the manifolds that connect the fluid inlet port to the fluid nozzles on the graphical representation of the oral insert model. The manifolds may be configured to provide a predetermined range of hydraulic pressures to each of the fluid nozzles.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some variations, each of the manifolds may comprise a trunk coupled to the fluid inlet port and at least one of the fluid nozzles. In some variations, a diameter of the manifold may decrease along a length of the manifold from the fluid inlet port. In some variations, generating the geometry of the manifolds may further comprise identifying one or more step regions along a length of the manifold.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some variations, the one or more step regions of the manifold may be identified based on one or more of a location of the fluid nozzles. In some variations, the one or more step regions may comprise a step length and a taper angle. In some variations, generating the geometry of the manifolds may further comprise generating a branch coupled to the trunk and one or more of the fluid nozzles. In some variations, generating the geometry of the manifolds may further comprise generating a pressure port coupled to the trunk based on a number of the fluid nozzles. In some variations, generating the pressure port may further comprise connecting the pressure port between the trunk and a fluid outlet port of the oral insert.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some variations, generating the geometry of the manifolds may be based at least on curvature analysis of the manifolds. In some variations, intersections may be smoothed between one or more of the fluid inlet port, fluid nozzles, manifolds, branch, pressure port, and the tray surface. In some variations, the manifold may be configured to provide a substantially equal hydraulic pressure to each of the fluid nozzles.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Also described are methods of generating a model of an oral insert that comprises a fluid inlet port, fluid nozzles, manifolds, and a tray configured to retain teeth, the method comprising generating a geometry of the fluid nozzles based on oral scan data of a jaw, defining a tray surface that encloses the fluid nozzles based on the oral scan data, generating a geometry of the manifolds that connects the fluid inlet port to the fluid nozzles, and displaying a graphical representation of a geometric conflict between one or more of the fluid inlet port, the fluid nozzles, the manifolds, and the tray.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some variations, the geometric conflict may be identified between one or more of the fluid inlet port, the fluid nozzles, the manifolds, and the tray. In some variations, one or more of the geometries of the fluid nozzles and the manifolds may be modified in response to the geometric conflict. In some variations, modifying one or more of the geometries of the fluid nozzles and the manifolds may comprise linear optimization. In some variations, the linear optimization sequentially modifies the geometries of the fluid nozzles and the manifolds. In some variations, modifying one or more of the geometries of the fluid nozzles and the manifolds may comprise non-linear optimization. In some variations, the non-linear optimization may comprise measuring a quality of fluid nozzle positioning using a predetermined fitting function. In some variations, modifying one or more of the geometries of the fluid nozzles and the manifolds may comprise serial or parallel modification of the geometries of the fluid nozzles and the manifolds.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some variations, displaying the graphical representation of the geometric conflict may further comprise identifying one or more intersections and clearance conflicts between one or more of the fluid inlet port, the fluid nozzles, the manifolds, and the tray surface based on one or more of a wire representation and mesh representation. In some variations, displaying the graphical representation of the geometric conflict may further comprise identifying one or more kinks in the manifolds. In some variations, displaying the graphical representation of the geometric conflict may further comprise identifying one or more intersections and clearance conflicts between the fluid nozzle and the tray surface.

The geometry of the fluid nozzles comprise a fluid nozzle inlet, a fluid nozzle outlet, and a fluid nozzle clearance geometry.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some variations, the interproximal geometry may comprise one or more of a facial interproximal point, a lingual interproximal point, an occlusal interproximal point, and an interproximal plane. In some variations, the teeth geometry may comprise a longitudinal axis of the tooth. In some variations, the fluid nozzle clearance geometry may comprise a longitudinal axis between an in interproximal point and the fluid nozzle outlet with a length between about 2 mm and about 6 mm. In some variations, the longitudinal axis may extend from of the facial and lingual interproximal points.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some variations, the fluid nozzle clearance geometry may comprise a vertex angle between about 45 degrees and about 90 degrees. In some variations, the fluid nozzle clearance geometry may comprise an inlet comprising a first diameter and an outlet comprising a second diameter larger than the first diameter. In some variations, the fluid nozzle may comprise a first portion, a second portion, and a fluid nozzle angle between the first portion and the second portion. In some variations, the first portion may be between about 1 mm and about 2.5 mm. In some variations, the first angle may be between about 100 degrees and about 260 degrees. In some variations, a tray surface may define a surface that encloses the fluid nozzles based on the oral scan data. In some variations, the fluid nozzle inlet may comprise a manifold space reservation. In some variations, a geometry of the manifolds may be generated on the graphical representation that connects the fluid inlet port to the fluid nozzles. In some variations, intersections between one or more of the fluid inlet port, fluid nozzles, manifolds, and the tray may be smoothed. In some variations, one or more of the geometries of the fluid nozzles and the manifolds of the oral insert model may be optimized. In some variations, the teeth may comprise upper and lower teeth, and the jaw may comprise upper and lower jaws, and the tray comprises an upper and lower tray. In some variations, manufacturing the oral insert may be based on the model of the oral insert.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings

num="0035">Disclosed herein are methods and systems for manufacturing personalized oral care devices such as an oral insert. These devices may include an arrangement of fluid openings configured to output pressurized fluid for cleaning the surfaces of or interproximal spaces between one or more teeth. Generally, an oral care device model (e.g., oral insert model) may comprise an arrangement of fluid openings positioned to output a predetermined range of fluid flow specific to a user's oral anatomy. Other device structures in fluid communication with the fluid openings may include one or more of a manifold, fluid inlet, effluent port, and tray, as described in more detail herein. An oral care device manufactured based on the oral care device model may be held in the mouth of a user and coupled to a fluid source such as a fluid reservoir.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some variations, the oral insert may be designed for the unique oral anatomy of each user to improve one or more of cleaning efficiency and user comfort, which may increase adoption and promote consistent usage. For example, the dimensions of the oral insert may be optimized (e.g., reduced) for user comfort while comprising structures (e.g., manifolds, nozzles) configured to provide a predetermined hydraulic efficiency for optimal oral tissue care (e.g., gingiva cleaning, gingiva stimulation, teeth cleaning). Fluid egress from a plurality of fluid openings (e.g., nozzles) may clean multiple teeth simultaneously where the arrangement and spatial configuration of the fluid nozzles target specific oral anatomy features of a predetermined user to facilitate effective cleaning of oral tissue surfaces (e.g., gingiva, teeth).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Generally, the methods and systems for generating an oral care device model as described herein may streamline a production workflow by processing user oral scan data into a user anatomy model used to generate the structures of the oral care device model customized to the user's anatomy. In some variations, a customized oral care device model may be generated based on one or more of a plurality of scans of user oral anatomy and scans of a physical impression of the user anatomy. In some variations, an oral care device model may be generated based on the user oral data with structural features comprising a fluid inlet port, fluid nozzles, manifolds, tray, fluid outlet port (e.g., effluent port), and the like. For example, the oral care device model may be generated based on identified reference interproximal geometry and teeth geometry (e.g., gingival margins, interdental gingiva, interproximal regions, incisal edges, and contours of the occlusal, facial, lingual, mesial and distal surfaces of the teeth, etc.), corresponding to the user oral data, as described in more detail herein.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Also described herein are methods of optimizing an oral care device model. One or more structures (or representations of the structures) of an oral care device model may be initially generated. The geometry and location of one or more structures may be modified during and/or after initial generation to avoid structural conflicts, aid manufacturing, improve one or more of hydraulic efficiency, cleaning efficiency, user comfort, and/or other optimizations. Conventional manual optimization of an oral care device model generally relies on the skill, experience, and efficiency of a designer, which may lead to inconsistent design, time efficiency, and results. Furthermore, the number of structural elements, design parameters and requirements may be such that manual optimization techniques are impractical if even feasible. For example, hydraulic elements (e.g., manifold) of an oral insert may be constrained by a patient's unique oral anatomy, hydraulic performance criteria, and manufacturing constraints (e.g., minimum wall thicknesses). A change in a parameter value (e.g., manifold diameter) may optimize the oral insert in one dimension but may generate geometric conflicts (e.g., manifold-enclosure conflict) and/or reduce performance for a plurality of downstream structures (e.g., fluid nozzle flow rate) that may require additional modifications in geometry to meet each design requirement. Identifying geometric conflicts between the different structures of the oral care device model may add significant computational load for each potential modification. In some variations, the configuration of the structural features of an oral care device model may be optimized based on a predetermined set of structural constraints. For example, a device structure may be modified after detecting a proximity error between at least two structures (e.g., minimum wall thickness between manifold and tray, nozzle collision).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some variations, errors and/or inefficiencies (e.g., geometric conflicts, hydraulic inefficiencies) of one or more structures may be identified and then the structures may be modified to optimize the oral care device model. For example, a manifold connected to a plurality of fluid nozzles may be configured to provide a predetermined range of hydraulic pressures to each of the fluid nozzles. In turn, each of a plurality of fluid nozzles may be configured to provide a predetermined range of hydraulic pressures at an outlet of its fluid nozzle. However, if a conflict is identified between the geometry of the fluid nozzle and the geometry of a tray surface, then one or more of the fluid nozzle and tray surface may be modified to resolve the conflict. In turn, a corresponding manifold may be modified if necessary to ensure that the predetermined range of hydraulic pressures are provided to each of the fluid nozzles (e.g., by ensuring fluidic connection between the manifold and fluid nozzle). As another example, a manifold may comprise a path having a section with a kink with high tortuosity and turbulent fluid flow. The radius of curvature may be increased at the section with the kink to reduce tortuosity and turbulent fluid flow. Furthermore, one or more fluid nozzles may be repositioned and/or rotated along a length of the manifold to accommodate the change in manifold geometry.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some variations, the oral care devices described herein may be configured to clean teeth and/or disrupt biofilms that may form on or in between the teeth or restorations or around dental appliances, and within the gingival sulcus. However, it should be understood that the systems described herein may also be used for the application of medicaments or prophylactics to the oral cavity, teeth whitening, oral disinfection, antiseptic fluids, cleaning fluids, etc.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As used herein, user oral anatomy may comprise any oral and/or dental devices or implants, for example, permanent and removable dental restorations/prosthetics, orthodontic appliances, and etc. (e.g. crowns, bridges, implants, braces, retainers, dentures, and the like).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some variations, the systems, devices, and methods disclosed herein may comprise one or more systems, devices, and methods described in International Patent Application Serial No. PCT/US2018/040459, filed on Jun. 29, 2018, and International Patent Application Serial No. PCT/US2020/028311, filed on Apr. 15, 2020, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Oral Anatomy</heading><p id="p-0044" num="0043">It may be helpful to briefly identify and describe relevant oral anatomy. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref> are schematic depictions of oral anatomy and dental structures, illustrating the regions of the oral cavity described herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> depicts a top view of a set of teeth (<b>140</b>) of the mandible or lower jaw (though similar terminology may be used to refer to the teeth and structures of the maxilla or upper jaw). Each tooth (<b>142</b>) may have a facial surface (<b>144</b>) which is the region of the tooth that contacts the cheeks or lips and a lingual surface (<b>146</b>) which is the region of the tooth that contacts (or is nearest to) the tongue. Facial surfaces may be, for example, the buccal surfaces of the posterior teeth and the labial surfaces of the anterior teeth. Lingual surfaces may also be referred to as the palatal surfaces for maxillary teeth. Posterior teeth may have an occlusal surface (<b>148</b>) and the anterior teeth may have an incisal edge or surface (<b>150</b>). The occlusal (or incisal) surface is the region of the tooth that aids in chewing, and/or faces across from the occlusal (or incisal) surface of the opposing tooth. The surface of a tooth facing away from the arch midline may be referred to as the distal surface (<b>152</b>) while the surface of a tooth facing toward the arch midline (<b>151</b>) may be referred to as the mesial surface (<b>154</b>).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> depicts a side view of a single tooth (<b>142</b>), which may have a longitudinal axis (<b>156</b>) that extends along the longest dimension of the tooth (<b>142</b>) and/or is substantially perpendicular to the occlusal surface (<b>148</b>) or incisal edge (<b>150</b>) of the tooth. The edge or boundary of the gums (e.g., gingiva, gingival tissue) along the surfaces of the teeth or closest to the occlusal surfaces or incisal edge of the teeth may be referred to as the gingival margin (<b>158</b>). The gingival margin (<b>158</b>) may have one or more curves along the bottom of each tooth, and the radius of curvature and length of the gingival margin for each tooth may vary. A space or region (<b>160</b>) between the gingiva and the surfaces of the tooth may be referred to as a gingival sulcus (<b>160</b>). Interdental gingiva (<b>161</b>) may be the gum tissue located between two adjacent teeth. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> depicts a side view of a plurality of teeth (<b>142</b>). The space or gap between each tooth (<b>142</b>) may be referred to as the interproximal space or gap (<b>162</b>), and may be defined by the mesial surface of one tooth and the distal surface of the adjacent tooth, or the mesial surfaces of two teeth, in the case of central incisor teeth. The left side of a user's oral cavity may be the region of the oral cavity that is to the left of the interproximal space between the two central incisors (e.g., to the left of the arch midline), and the right side of a user's oral cavity may be the region of the oral cavity that is to the right of the interproximal space between the two central incisors (e.g., to the right of the arch midline).</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">I.

Generally, the oral care devices (e.g., oral inserts) comprise an arrangement of fluid openings (e.g., fluid nozzles) and corresponding fluid channels (e.g., manifolds) configured to provide a predetermined range of fluid flow based on at least one characteristic of the user's oral anatomy. Fluid egress from a plurality of fluid openings may clean multiple teeth simultaneously and the location and geometry of the fluid openings with respect to specific and unique structures of the user's mouth may help facilitate expeditious and/or effective cleaning of teeth surfaces.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Oral Care System</heading><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> depicts a block diagram of one variation of an oral care system (<b>200</b>) comprising an oral insert (<b>210</b>), handle (<b>230</b>), and fluid reservoir (<b>240</b>). The oral insert (<b>210</b>) may be releasably engaged with the handle (<b>230</b>) and fluid reservoir (<b>240</b>). A user may use the handle (<b>230</b>) to manipulate and position the oral insert (<b>210</b>) within oral anatomy. The oral insert (<b>210</b>) may be configured to be in fluid communication with the fluid reservoir (<b>240</b>). The oral insert (<b>210</b>) may output a predetermined volume of fluid received from the fluid reservoir (<b>240</b>). The fluid structures defined by the oral insert (<b>210</b>) may comprise a fluid inlet port (<b>212</b>), a set of manifolds (<b>214</b>), a set of nozzles (<b>216</b>), and a fluid outlet port (e.g., effluence port) (<b>218</b>). The oral insert (<b>210</b>) may define a tray (<b>220</b>) configured to retain teeth (e.g., upper teeth, lower teeth). In some variations, the tray (<b>220</b>) may be configured such that at least a portion of the tray (<b>220</b>) corresponds to a shape of the user's teeth.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The oral insert (<b>210</b>) may be configured to receive fluid from the fluid reservoir (<b>240</b>) at the fluid inlet port (<b>212</b>). The fluid inlet port (<b>212</b>) may be configured to be in fluid communication with the set of manifolds (<b>214</b>) and the set of nozzles (<b>216</b>). Fluid output from the set of nozzles (<b>216</b>) may be directed at the user's oral anatomy, for example, through the interproximal spaces between the teeth. After the fluid passes through and/or irrigates the user's oral anatomy, the fluid may then be guided to the fluid outlet port (<b>218</b>) to exit the user's oral cavity. In some variations, fluid may flow sequentially into the fluid inlet (<b>212</b>) and through the set of manifolds (<b>214</b>) and then respective nozzles (<b>216</b>). The set of nozzles (<b>216</b>) may be configured to output fluid toward oral anatomy. The fluid outlet port (<b>218</b>) may then receive the fluid (e.g., effluence) and channel it away from the oral anatomy.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some variations, the oral care device (<b>210</b>) may be configured to receive fluid from the handle (<b>230</b>) and/or fluid reservoir (<b>240</b>). In some variations, the handle (<b>230</b>) may comprise one or more of a fluid pump (<b>232</b>), manifold switch (<b>234</b>), and actuator (<b>236</b>). For example, the fluid inlet port (<b>212</b>) may be coupled to the fluid pump (<b>232</b>). The fluid pump (<b>232</b>) may be configured to output pressurized fluid to the oral insert (<b>210</b>). In some variations, the handle (<b>230</b>) may comprise a manifold switch (<b>234</b>) configured to select and route fluid into one or more of the manifolds (<b>214</b>). For example, the manifold switch (<b>234</b>) may be configured to output fluid sequentially to each manifold at a predetermined rate. This may allow control of fluid flow rates to increase user comfort by preventing an excess volume of pressurized fluid from entering and exiting a user's mouth. The handle (<b>230</b>) may comprise an actuator (<b>236</b>) configured to operate one or more of the fluid pump (<b>232</b>) and manifold switch (<b>234</b>).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some variations, the fluid reservoir (<b>240</b>) may be configured to hold a predetermined volume of fluid. For example, the fluid reservoir (<b>240</b>) may be configured to hold enough fluid for at least one cleaning cycle. Additionally or alternatively, the fluid reservoir (<b>240</b>) may be configured to couple to a fluid source to supply and/or augment the fluid held by the fluid reservoir (<b>240</b>).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Additionally or alternatively, the oral care system (<b>200</b>) may comprise one or more temperature control elements (e.g., heater, chiller). For example, one or more of the handle (<b>230</b>) and fluid reservoir (<b>240</b>) may comprise one or more of a heating element and a cooling element. In some variations, a heating element may be configured to control a temperature of the fluid. In some variations, the fluid may be set at a predetermined range of temperatures to improve cleaning efficacy (e.g., higher temperatures may help facilitate removal of hydrophobic food or biofilm residues, such as residues with fatty acids and/or oils, and/or dissolve and/or soften hardened food residues), and/or increase chemical activity of entrained, therapeutic additives. In some variations, a heating element may comprise an electrical-resistance type heating element, and/or a cooling element may be a thermoelectric cooler (e.g., a solid-state device such as a Peltier device).</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Computing System</heading><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> depicts a block diagram of a computing system configured to generate an oral care model (e.g., oral insert model) as described herein.

In some variations, one or more alignment features (<b>352</b>) may be located within the tray (<b>350</b>) to help seat the teeth within the tray (<b>350</b>). For example, an alignment feature (<b>350</b>) may comprise protrusions, slots, or recesses that receive and/or articulate with the user's teeth, gums, hard palate, soft palate, other oral structures, and/or may have contours that correspond to one or more teeth. These alignment features (<b>350</b>) may help to ensure that the oral insert is seated in a desired position in the user's mouth. In some variations, the side walls and bottom wall may have smoothed surfaces and/or contours that may or may not correspond with the anatomical contours of the one or more teeth.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some variations, the tray (<b>350</b>) may comprise a shape based on optical and/or digital oral anatomy data obtained using intraoral scanners or photographs (e.g., 3-D intraoral scans, 3-D scans of a dental impression), photographs, X-rays, physical impressions, intraoral and extraoral radiographs, computed tomography, including cone beam computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, combinations thereof, and the like.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">While some oral inserts may comprise a single tray (e.g., trough) to fit over either the maxillary teeth or the mandibular teeth, in other variations, an oral insert may comprise two opposing trays where one tray accommodates the maxillary teeth and the other tray accommodates the mandibular teeth (e.g., so that both upper (maxillary) and lower (mandibular) teeth may be irrigated simultaneously or in series with a single oral insert). A first set of fluid nozzles may be enclosed within a first tray to provide fluid flow to the mandibular teeth and a second set of fluid nozzles may be enclosed within a second tray to provide fluid flow to the maxillary teeth.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The oral inserts (<b>300</b>) described herein may also accommodate changes in dental geometry. For example, a user may have a broken or missing tooth, and/or may have new teeth or restorations. Some variations of an oral insert (<b>300</b>) may include one or more barriers (not shown) that may have a geometry that corresponds to the surface contours of one or more of the user's teeth. The barriers may be releasably coupled into the space of the tray (<b>350</b>) that corresponds to the missing or broken tooth, and may extend from the oral insert (<b>300</b>) up to the gingival margin (e.g., a few millimeters over the gingival margin). The barriers may help prevent fluid jets intended for the missing or broken tooth from intersecting the space where the tooth was previously located. The barriers may also be used to shield especially sensitive teeth or gums (e.g., due to tooth decay, retained roots, partially erupted teeth, and/or after a dental procedure) from fluid jets, as may be desirable for user comfort.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>F</figref> are schematic depictions of oral anatomy and oral insert geometry characterizing the oral insert. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> depicts a jaw (<b>401</b>) comprising a mandibular arch width (<b>402</b>).

In some variations, the mid-buccal widths (<b>412</b>, <b>413</b>) may be based on a respective maxillary arch width (not shown) or mandibular arch width (<b>402</b>). For example, the mid-buccal widths (<b>412</b>, <b>413</b>) may be larger by a predetermined range of mid-buccal values than a respective maxillary arch width or mandibular arch width. The mid-buccal width (<b>412</b>, <b>413</b>) of the oral insert (<b>403</b>) may provide bulk at the tightest part of the cheeks (e.g., around the maxillary and mandibular attachments of the buccinators muscle), which may be uncomfortable at the tightest part of the cheeks if the mid-buccal width is to large.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> depicts a lingual width (<b>420</b>) of the oral insert (<b>403</b>).

For example, the posterior height (<b>432</b>) may be larger by a predetermined value than a minimum distance between posterior molar cusps (<b>434</b>). The posterior height (<b>432</b>) may correspond to the largest jaw opening required for insertion of the oral insert. The posterior height (<b>432</b>) of the oral insert (<b>403</b>) may affect jaw opening during insertion of the oral insert (<b>403</b>). The posterior cavity height (<b>430</b>) of the oral insert (<b>403</b>) may define the largest vertical distance between the ultimate or penultimate molar buccal cusps and mid-buccal cavity wall.

The curvature angles (<b>442</b>, <b>444</b>) may affect one or more of lip deflection, lip curling, and pinching of oral tissue. The minimum radius (<b>440</b>) may define a minimum radius of any exposed edge of the oral insert (<b>403</b>) and may affect abrasion and pinching of oral tissue.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="2">II.

In some variations, generating the fluid inlet port geometry and the fluid outlet port geometry may further comprise calculating arch mid planes for one or more of the upper and lower jaws. In some variations, a geometry of the enclosure of the oral insert may be based on one or more of an initial or predetermined enclosure geometry, fluid nozzle geometry, manifold geometry, fluid inlet port geometry, fluid outlet port geometry, patient oral geometry, tray surface geometry, and clearance geometry (e.g., minimum wall thickness). In some variations, generating the enclosure geometry may further comprise calculating initial boundary and cross-section curves of the enclosure, initial boundary and cross-section curves for a fluid outlet port transition, surface quality and smoothness (e.g., inflection points), and section planes.

For example, an intersection between a manifold and a fluid nozzle may comprise one or more sharp edges that may inhibit smooth and consistent fluid flow. Filleting hydraulic intersections may improve fluid flow and hydraulic efficiency. In some variations, the surfaces of the oral insert structures may be combined and smoothed. In some variations, a user may control a degree of smoothing performed. For example, an exterior surface of the oral insert (e.g., enclosure, tray surface, fluid outlet port) may be smoothed for patient comfort and aesthetics.
