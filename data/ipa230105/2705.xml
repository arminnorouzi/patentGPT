Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method of preparing naturally degradable microcapsules and to microcapsules prepared according to the method.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">DISCUSSION OF RELATED ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Encapsulation methods are used for effective delivery of an active component, and even with the use of a small dose, precise delivery can be carried out to reduce problems relating to side effects, maintenance of stability of the active component and costs, and therefore, they are applied for various forms and purposes in industrial fields, such as targeted delivery of drugs in the medical/pharmaceutical field, maintaining the stability of perfumes in sanitary products and aroma at the time users desire, maintaining the stability of an efficacious substance against external stimuli such as light, heat and the like in the cosmetic field, insecticides in the agricultural field, and enhancing the stability and absorption efficiency of nutritional components in the food field.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">International organizations are pointing out microcapsules as one of the causes of microplastic pollution (a polymer that is arbitrarily made by a human having a diameter of 5 mm or less and accumulates without being degraded upon release into nature) that can accumulate without degradation in nature and cause serious environmental pollution. However, capsules made of inorganic particles for the purpose of deviating from the microplastic category are easily broken by the tension or impact generated during drying, and when they are made of natural polymers, there is a problem that the active component inside the capsules is eluted due to the micro porosity inherent in the material and the stability of the capsules cannot be maintained, and there is the problem that when crosslinking is used for reducing the micro porosity and increasing the stability, degradability is lowered. In addition, the use of a substance in which an ester bond is introduced so as to be easily degraded does not withstand the harsh conditions of the formulation (pH change, temperature change) and thus is degraded before use, but to this day, no solution is known or there is no solution.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The degradation of substances in the actual natural environment occurs by microorganisms and light, hydrolysis and the like, and in the degradability of substances specified by the international standard measurement method, a degradation method by microorganism and light is specified. More specifically, based on the OECD 301D test method, it is classified as a &#x201c;immediately degraded substance&#x201d; when the degradation by microorganisms is 60% or more in the dark at room temperature for 28 days, a &#x201c;biodegradable substance&#x201d; in the case of 20 to 60%, and a &#x201c;non-degradable substance&#x201d; below 20%, but based on the OECD 316 test method, a method for measuring the degree of degradation that occurs when light is irradiated for 12 hours and a total of 30 days using a xenon lamp in a water-based condition is shown. In the case where a hydrocarbon material is degraded into water and carbon dioxide, there is an example where degradation is promoted by introducing a photocatalyst because light alone has insufficient energy to induce chemical degradation in the actual natural environment, but there is a limit in that complete degradation is difficult in the case of a material having a hydrocarbon chain as a main component, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Meanwhile, since the active component is usually a monomolecular substance having high permeability or a strong oxidation property, and thus there is a problem that the active component is oxidized by an oxidizing material such as oxygen, active oxygen, and free radicals permeating from the external environment, there is an increasing interest in a method for enhancing the insulating property of a capsule membrane for maintaining the stability of the capsule against oxidation. Materials used for encapsulation for effective loading of the active component are used in a wide spectrum from an organic polymer to an inorganic material, and methods such as polymer interfacial polymerization, layer-by-layer through ionic bonding, solidification through a change in solubility depending on pH, and the like have been proposed for decreasing the permeability of a capsule membrane. However, even if the capsule membrane is reinforced by these methods, there is a limit that the active component is eluted in a harsh environment in the presence of a surfactant, an ionic component, and a solvent in the formulation.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, in the case of a capsule made by interfacial polymerization of polyurea, it has been reported that the release performance of the active component is excellent, but the active component is eluted by the surfactant and there is a problem in stability. In another example, in U.S. Pat. No. 9,944,886 B2 and J. Hitchcock et al., Long-Term Retention of Small, Volatile Molecular Species within Metallic Microcapsules, ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2015, 7, 27, 14808-14815, in the case of a capsule made of polymethacrylate which is a highly hydrophobic substance, a method of coating the capsule with a metal having an interatomic spacing of several angstroms (A) and from which the active component hardly escapes is used in order to solve this by being eluted in water in an organic solvent to improve the stability of the capsule, but the usable substance is limited to gold or silver, and there is a limit to commercialization. As another example, in U.S. Pat. No. 9,943,487 B2, dopamine is coated on the outer wall of the capsule in order to increase the stability of the capsules, and the stability against heat and an organic solvent is increased, but there is a problem that the production method is difficult and commercialization is limited.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, there is a need for the development of a capsule material which not only decomposes when discharged in nature and has high versatility and stability without causing environmental pollution, but also is easily produced, has high economic feasibility, and can easily control the activity of the active component.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present inventors have studied to develop microcapsules that maintain long-term stability and have excellent natural degradability by preventing the elution of an active substance to be loaded, and as a result, have found that when a Pickering emulsion is prepared using a first encapsulating component, a second encapsulating ingredient, a first capsule reinforcing component and a second capsule reinforcing component, and the Pickering emulsion is encapsulated, it is possible to produce microcapsules that not only have a high versatility and excellent in the nature and the stability but also can easily adjust the activity of the active substance, and completed the present invention based on the above.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method of preparing microcapsules having high versatility, natural degradability and stability, and microcapsules prepared by the method.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As a means for solving the above problems, the present invention provides a method of preparing a microcapsule, including:</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">preparing a Pickering emulsion by mixing a continuous phase 1 including inorganic particles and a first encapsulating component, and a dispersed phase 1 including a second encapsulating component and a first capsule reinforcing component; and</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">mixing and encapsulating a continuous phase 2 including the second capsule reinforcing component and the Pickering emulsion;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The first encapsulating component and the second capsule reinforcing component may each or both include two or more amine groups or hydroxyl groups,</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The second encapsulating component and the first capsule reinforcing component may each or both include two or more functional groups selected from the group consisting of an amine group, an isocyanate group, an acyl halide group, a chloroformate group, and an acrylate group.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition, it is possible to provide a microcapsule prepared according to the preparation method.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention may also provide microcapsules including an inorganic particle, a first encapsulating component, a second encapsulating component, a first capsule reinforcing component and a second capsule reinforcing component.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The first encapsulating component and the second capsule reinforcing component may have one or more identical functional groups, which may in particular be amine groups.

In the present invention, the type of inorganic particles is not limited as long as the inorganic particles are not dissolved in the aqueous phase and can be adsorbed to the dispersed phase. For example, the inorganic particles may be selected from metals such as titanium, vanadium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, niobium, molybdenum, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, silver, zinc, hafnium, tantalum, tungsten, iridium, platinum, gold, indium, tin, calcium, aluminum or magnesium; non-metals such as silica of phyllosilicate, inosilicate, sorosilicate or tectosilicate; or mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, the inorganic particles may be silica.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In addition, the inorganic particles may have a diameter of 1 to 900 nm, for example, a diameter of 1.5 to 750 nm, and a diameter of 2 to 500 nm.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the present invention, the content of the inorganic particles may be 0.001 to 5 parts by weight, such as 0.005 to 4 parts by weight, 0.01 to 3 parts by weight, 0.1 to 2 parts by weight, 0.5 to 1.5 parts by weight, based on the total weight of the composition for the preparation of microcapsules.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the present invention, the &#x201c;first encapsulating component&#x201d; refers to a biodegradable polymer, which can be included to dissolve in the continuous phase and undergo an interfacial polymerization reaction with a second encapsulating component present in the dispersed phase described below to form and readily degrade the outer wall of the capsule.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the present invention, the first encapsulating component is not particularly limited as long as it is a biodegradable polymer having an amine group and/or a hydroxyl group in the molecule. The biodegradable polymer may be a natural component or a synthetic component, and may be a monomer, an oligomer, or a polymer. The natural component may include polysaccharides such as cellulose, hyaluronic acid, xanthan gum, chitosan or heparin; some modified substances of polysaccharides such as hydroxyethylcellulose or hydroxypropylcellulose; nucleic acids such as DNA or RNA; proteins such as collagen, gelatin or silk fibroin; or a polypeptide such as polylysine, polyglutamic acid or polyarginine. The synthetic component may include a component having a hydroxyl group, a carboxyl group, or an amine group, such as polyester, polyphosphazane, polyamino acid or polyorthoester.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In addition, the first encapsulating component may include a component including an amine group and/or a hydroxyl group as well as a surface-modified component to include the functional group. That is, in the present invention, the first encapsulating component may include two or more amine groups; two or more hydroxyl groups; or both components having two or more amine groups and two or more hydroxyl groups.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In addition, the first encapsulating component may have a molecular weight of 200 Da to 1,000,000 Da, for example, a molecular weight of 500 Da to 500,000 Da, and a molecular weight of 1,000 Da to 100,000 Da.

In the present invention, when the molecular weight of the first encapsulating component is less than 200 Da or the content is less than 0.01 parts by weight, since there are few functional groups that can participate in the reaction for forming the outer wall of the microcapsule, a problem of no crosslinking may occur, and when the molecular weight of the first encapsulating component is more than 1,000,000 Da or the content is more than 20 parts by weight, the viscosity increases, so that the outer wall of the microcapsule is not formed and a hydrogel is formed.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one embodiment, the first encapsulating component may be chitosan.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The continuous phase 1 including the inorganic particles and the first encapsulating component may be mixed with the dispersed phase 1 including the second encapsulating component and the first capsule reinforcing component to prepare a Pickering emulsion.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Accordingly, the present invention includes the preparing a dispersed phase 1 including a second encapsulating component and a first capsule reinforcing component.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As the solvent of the dispersed phase 1, a solvent that is not mixed with the continuous phase may be selected.

In the present invention, the active substance is a substance that can be loaded in the microcapsule and maintain its activity, and means a substance whose activity is expressed when the outer wall of the microcapsule is destroyed. When the active substance is a liquid at room temperature, it may be included as a solvent in the dispersed phase.

reinforcing component used in combination with the biodegradable polymer as the first encapsulating polymer exhibits excellent biodegradability and stability even when aminobenzylamine and benzidinedisulfonic acid are used in addition to phenylenediamine. In addition, the use of naphthalene diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate and xylene diisocyanate as well as methyldiphenyl diisocyanate as the first capsule reinforcing component used in combination with the second encapsulating component showed a good degree of biodegradation and stability. Accordingly, when the microcapsule according to the present invention uses a combination of the first encapsulating component (biodegradable polymer) and the second capsule reinforcing component, and a combination of the second encapsulating component and the first capsule reinforcing component, it can show a remarkable effect in the stability and degree of biodegradation.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0112">On the other hand, in the case of Comparative Example 8, the stability of microcapsule was shown to be relatively very low. This is the result of Comparative Example 8 using cyclohexanediamine, a simple cyclic compound, not an aromatic compound, as the second capsule reinforcement component, for the preparation of microcapsules, and through this, it is shown that aromatic compounds, not simple cyclic compounds, are essential for the stability of the microcapsules.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Examples 19 to 22.

Through the above results, although the capsules are stably present in the form of a product, it can be confirmed that it means that degradation occurs when discharged into the natural world after use.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00001" cdx-file="US20230002706A1-20230105-C00001.CDX" mol-file="US20230002706A1-20230105-C00001.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00002" cdx-file="US20230002706A1-20230105-C00002.CDX" mol-file="US20230002706A1-20230105-C00002.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00003" cdx-file="US20230002706A1-20230105-C00003.CDX" mol-file="US20230002706A1-20230105-C00003.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00004" cdx-file="US20230002706A1-20230105-C00004.CDX" mol-file="US20230002706A1-20230105-C00004.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00005" cdx-file="US20230002706A1-20230105-C00005.CDX" mol-file="US20230002706A1-20230105-C00005.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00006" cdx-file="US20230002706A1-20230105-C00006.CDX" mol-file="US20230002706A1-20230105-C00006.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00007" cdx-file="US20230002706A1-20230105-C00007.CDX" mol-file="US20230002706A1-20230105-C00007.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00008" cdx-file="US20230002706A1-20230105-C00008.CDX" mol-file="US20230002706A1-20230105-C00008.MOL"/><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00001" nb-file="US20230002706A1-20230105-M00001.NB"><img id="EMI-M00001" he="5.67mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230002706A1-20230105-M00001.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00002" nb-file="US20230002706A1-20230105-M00002.NB"><img id="EMI-M00002" he="34.88mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230002706A1-20230105-M00002.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-01-25" num="01-25"><claim-text><b>1</b>-<b>25</b>.
