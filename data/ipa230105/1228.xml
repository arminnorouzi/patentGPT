The most common therapy for treating jaundice in infants is phototherapy. Phototherapy facilitates the transformation of the compounds causing jaundice (i.e., unconjugated bilirubin) into compounds that are more easily excreted by the infant. Phototherapy is, however, not limited to treating jaundice, but may be used to treat many other issues.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, photobiomodulation (PBM) uses visible (400-700 nm) and near-infrared (700-1100 nm) light to elicit photophysical and photochemical events by involving endogenous chromophores. PBM has been used to alleviate pain inflammation, and to promote wound healing and tissue regeneration.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The efficacy of the different phototherapies depends on four main factors: irradiance (light intensity), spectral range (wavelength or color), exposed skin surface area, and duration of exposure. Irradiance is a measurement of the light energy incident on the skin (power per surface area per wavelength). Proper application of phototherapy treatments requires assessment of each of these four factors.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure provides an illuminated bassinet including a light source for delivering therapeutic light and anti-bacterial light, where an interlock prevents the anti-bacterial light from being emitted while an infant is located in the bassinet.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure provides a surgical illuminator configured to concurrently or alternately emit different wavelengths of light for treating a physiological condition and for affecting perception of the surgical opening.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to one aspect, there is provided an illuminated bassinet for receiving an infant.

For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the electromagnetic radiation source <b>16</b> may be positioned above the cavity <b>14</b>. Alternatively, the electromagnetic radiation source <b>16</b> may be located within the cavity <b>14</b> or in any other suitable position for illuminating the cavity <b>14</b>. For example, the electromagnetic radiation source <b>16</b> may comprise multiple light emitting diodes (LEDs) positioned on side walls of the cavity <b>14</b>. Alternatively or additionally, the electromagnetic radiation source <b>16</b> may comprise a multi-wavelength light source or alternatively a combination of separate sources (e.g., multiple LEDs) emitting electromagnetic radiation having differing wavelengths. For example, the electromagnetic radiation source <b>16</b> may comprise separate sources located in different housings that are physically separate from one another.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The electromagnetic radiation source <b>16</b> is configured to emit multiple wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation <b>24</b> including anti-bacterial light <b>24</b><i>a </i>and therapeutic light <b>24</b><i>b</i>. The anti-bacterial light <b>24</b><i>a </i>comprises electromagnetic radiation having a wavelength that damages bacteria or retards or suppresses bacterial growth. For example, the anti-bacterial light <b>24</b><i>a </i>may have a wavelength of 400-410 nm, 255-280 nm, and/or any suitable wavelength shown to retard/suppress bacterial growth or to damage bacteria.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The therapeutic light <b>24</b><i>b </i>comprises electromagnetic radiation having a wavelength that treats a condition of the infant <b>22</b>. For example, the therapeutic light may be chosen to at least one of: treat jaundice or stimulate wound healing. As an example, the therapeutic light <b>24</b><i>b </i>may include a wavelength falling within a range of 460-470 nm or 720-740 nm.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The circuitry <b>18</b> is configured to control the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation <b>24</b> emitted by the electromagnetic radiation source <b>16</b>.

For example, the interlock <b>20</b> may comprise a combination of a cover configured to engage with a top of the housing and switches positioned such that the switches are toggled when the cover is positioned on the top of the housing. In this way, the interlock <b>20</b> may control the electromagnetic radiation source <b>16</b> such that anti-bacterial light <b>24</b><i>a </i>is only emitted when the lid is located on the top of the housing <b>12</b> (i.e., when the infant is not located within the cavity <b>14</b>). Alternatively or additionally, the interlock may include a sensor configured to directly sense a presence of an infant <b>22</b> within the cavity <b>14</b>.

For example, the circuitry <b>18</b> may receive a signal from the interlock <b>20</b>. The circuitry <b>18</b> may then determine whether an infant is located within the cavity <b>14</b> based on the received signal from the interlock <b>20</b>.

For example, the surgical illuminator <b>50</b> may include a same or similar electromagnetic radiation source <b>16</b> as described above in reference to the illuminated bassinet <b>10</b>.

For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> therapeutic light <b>24</b><i>d </i>in the red spectrum is emitted. In this example, the electromagnetic radiation <b>24</b> emitted by the electromagnetic radiation source <b>16</b> is a combination of the therapeutic light <b>24</b><i>d </i>and the perceiving light <b>24</b><i>c</i>. Because in this example the perceiving light <b>24</b><i>c </i>is white (i.e., is broad spectrum), the resulting total electromagnetic radiation emitted by the electromagnetic radiation source <b>16</b> will appear to be red shifted due to the inclusion of the therapeutic light <b>24</b><i>d. </i></p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the perceiving light <b>24</b><i>c </i>may be chosen to offset the perceived color change of the light emitted by the electromagnetic radiation source, such that concurrent emission of the therapeutic light <b>24</b><i>d </i>and the perceiving light <b>24</b><i>c </i>reduces the perceived color change of the light emitted by the electromagnetic radiation source <b>16</b>.

As an example, when performing surgery, there may be blood covering many of the tissues. To increase the visibility of the other tissues in the surgical cavity, the perceiving light may include a broad spectrum of wavelengths with the red component removed or the intensity of the red component made to be lower than the other wavelengths. That is, the perceiving light may have a larger component of green and blue light than red light.
