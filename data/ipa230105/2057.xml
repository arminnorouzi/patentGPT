These drive systems include an actuator and a transmission chain. The mechanical parts of these drive systems must be able to withstand loads corresponding to a sudden stop situation (generally called a &#x201c;crash&#x201d;) without the mechanical parts breaking and possibly injuring a passenger. The seat must therefore withstand thrusts of 9 to 16 g during a sudden stop. These mechanical parts must also be able to withstand sudden significant and repeated loads, experienced for example when the aircraft regains lift after passing through an air pocket or when an obese person drops violently on the seat. When faced with these situations, the mechanical parts of the transmission chain must neither break nor wear out prematurely, in order to limit the number of ground stops for maintenance purposes.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To achieve this objective, the mechanical parts of aircraft drive systems are overdesigned. However, this overdesign increases both the manufacturing cost of the mechanical parts and the weight of the aircraft. It is desirable to reduce the weight of the aircraft in order to reduce the amount of kerosene required to complete a given trip, and thus limit the cost of air transport and preserve the environment.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is also known, for example from document WO 2015/104378, to insert a mechanism for locking and unlocking the kinematic drive chain of a seat element.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRESENTATION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The invention improves the situation.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention relates to an aircraft seat comprising at least one actuator capable of generating movement and at least one movement transmission device comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">a frame provided with a through-bore extending in an axial direction, said frame comprising at least one bearing face and at least one braking face,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0008">a drive body suitable for being rotated relative to the frame about an axis extending in an axial direction, said drive body being arranged in the bore to move freely in translation along at least the axial direction relative to the frame, said drive body comprising at least one bearing face extending facing the bearing face of the frame and at least one braking face extending facing at least part of the braking face of the frame,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0009">at least one elastic element arranged between said at least one bearing face of the frame and said at least one bearing face of the drive body in order to keep said at least one braking face of the drive body at a defined distance from said at least one braking face of the frame, said at least one elastic element having a determined stiffness and being prestressed such that, when an axial load greater than a threshold load is applied to the drive body, said elastic element is compressed and said at least one braking face of the drive body comes into contact with said at least one braking face of the frame.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0008" num="0010">The aircraft seat according to the invention comprises a transmission device which makes it possible to counter an excessively large force so that the actuator and the mechanical parts of the transmission system do not need to withstand this force. Countering this force is carried out through a dedicated path of operation and eliminates the need to overdesign the normal path of operation.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0011">Advantageously, the transmission device is a purely mechanical system which does not require any external supply of energy. It does not require a control and execution system in order to operate. The transmission device is inserted into any rotary transmission system and does not interfere with its operation. Due to its locking servo function as well as its adaptability, the transmission device of the aircraft seat allows designing the actuator and the mechanical parts of the transmission system and ultimately allows savings in weight and/or a reduction in the technical requirements of the main transmission function.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0012">The features set forth in the following paragraphs may optionally be implemented.
