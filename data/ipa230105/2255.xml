More particularly, the present disclosure relates to an apparatus for treating water by liberating chlorine isotope using a RF system.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART.</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is known that presence of hazardous chemicals and soil composition in water effects when human beings or animals consume the water. As such, it is very important to treat water before it is consumed. Several methods and systems have been proposed in the past, which allow treating ground water or seawater.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although the available systems are effective in treating water, it is difficult to remove chlorine from the water. Specifically, it is difficult to remove chlorine from seawater. An example of a method was disclosed in past that can be used to remove chlorine in the water i.e., in a U.S. Pat. No. 9,581,021. In U.S Pat. No. 9,581,021, a system for extraction of volatiles from bodies in a vacuum is disclosed. The volatile containing solid may be subsurface heated with microwave or RF energy subliming volatiles that are captured with a containment structure that directs the flow of the volatile through a cold trap for collecting and condensing the volatile. In one variation, a sample, or an entire body may be enveloped in a sealed container for extraction of volatiles that are then collected and condensed. In a further variation, a planetary surface area is covered and the perimeter sealed at the surface. The area is then heated from above to release volatiles that are then collected and condensed. To heat layers below the surface that contain high concentrations of volatiles, a hollow auger can gain access to the subsurface volatile and microwave or RF energy can be delivered down the hollow auger with a coax cable and vapor can escape through the hollow auger to a capture apparatus.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Although the disclosure presented above, and other similar disclosures that are known are useful in treating water, they have several problems. This is because; the disclosures of above type cannot break the ionic bond between the sodium and chlorine molecules, and carbon dioxide in the water. As a result, the water is not treated completely.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Other documents describing the closest subject matter provide for a number of more or less complicated features that fail to solve the problem in an efficient and economical way. None of these patents suggest the novel features of the present invention. Specifically, none of the disclosures in the art disclose an apparatus for treating water, which uses a RF system to liberate chlorine isotope.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, there is a need in the art for an apparatus for treating water, which uses a RF system to liberate chlorine isotope.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is one of the main objects of the present invention to provide an apparatus for treating water and that avoids the drawbacks of the prior art.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is one object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for treating water.

The apparatus <b>100</b> comprises a feed tank <b>110</b>. The feed tank <b>110</b> may be used to store salt water. The size of the feed tank <b>110</b> may be selected depending on the effluent volume of the system. In preferred embodiment, nominal effluent volume will be 1500/gpm/5600/lpm, calculating that we will need a nominal saltwater feed tank capable of holding 8000 gallons of water.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The salt water may be received into the feed tank <b>110</b> from a variety of sources. It should be understood that if the source of the water produced water, the water would be passed through an oil/water separator, then through a 200-micron filtration system. Further, if the feed water is from a natural source such as an open sea water, lake, etc., then the water will pass through a &#xbc; inch strainer to strain out large debris, and then through a 20-micron filtration system. At the feed tank, carbon dioxide gas is added in the water for preprocessing. The water is preprocessed to lower the pH of the water and to entrain the carbon dioxide for use later in the process.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Further, the apparatus <b>100</b> may comprise a plurality of RF chambers <b>120</b>, each having an inlet <b>125</b> for receiving salt water into the RF chamber <b>120</b>. Further, each of the RF chambers <b>120</b> may comprise an outlet <b>130</b>. Further, each of the RF chambers <b>120</b> may comprise a vacuum tube <b>135</b> coupled to a vacuum manifold <b>140</b>. The outlet <b>130</b> may be coupled to a treated water effluent manifold <b>145</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the RF chamber <b>120</b> is explained. At the inlet <b>125</b>, an inlet valve <b>127</b> may be provided to control the flow of water into the RF chamber <b>120</b>. The RF chamber <b>120</b> further comprises chamber tubes (not shown) to receive the salt water inside the RF chamber <b>120</b>. The chamber tubes are provided in a coiled manner such that the salt water is raised to top of the RF chamber <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one implementation, the RF chamber <b>120</b> is provided with a recirculation pipe <b>155</b> to pump water back into the feed tank <b>110</b>. In one example, a pump <b>157</b> may be used to pump the water from the RF chamber <b>120</b> to the feed tank <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The RF chamber <b>120</b> may be provided with plurality of sensors such as a water level i.e., ultrasonic level indicator <b>161</b>, a pH/carbon dioxide indicator <b>162</b>, a temperature sensor <b>163</b>, a conductivity (sodium) indicator <b>164</b> and a salt concentration indicator (not shown). Each of ultrasonic level indicator <b>161</b>, the pH/carbon dioxide indicator <b>162</b>, the temperature sensor <b>163</b>, the conductivity (sodium) indicator <b>164</b> and the salt concentration indicator may be coupled to a control system <b>170</b> provided at the RF chamber <b>120</b>. It should be understood that the ultrasonic level indicator <b>161</b> is used to determine water level in the RF chamber <b>120</b>. The pH/carbon dioxide indicator <b>162</b> is used to determine the pH content/level in the water in RF chamber <b>120</b>. Further, the temperature sensor <b>163</b> is used to determine the temperature of water in the RF chamber <b>120</b>. The conductivity (sodium) indicator <b>164</b> is used to determine sodium content in water in the RF chamber <b>120</b>. The salt concentration indicator is used to determine salt concentration in water.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Further, the RF chamber <b>120</b> comprises a chemical/gas injection manifold <b>175</b> for storing chemicals. In one example, the chemical/gas injection manifold <b>175</b> may be used to store gases/chemicals such as carbon dioxide, carbon powder, or even hydrogen gas. The chemical/gas injection manifold <b>175</b> coupled to the RF chamber <b>120</b> via an injector tube (not shown). The injector tube may be provided with a valve <b>178</b> to control the flow of the chemicals injected into the RF chamber <b>120</b> or the chamber tubes.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">It should be understood that the control system <b>170</b> might indicate a computer used to operate the RF chamber. In one implementation, the control system <b>170</b> is electrically coupled to the inlet valve <b>127</b>, and the pump <b>157</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The recirculation pipe <b>155</b> may be provided in proximity to the feed tank <b>110</b> to return excess water in the RF chamber <b>120</b> to the feed tank <b>110</b>. The recirculation pipe <b>155</b> may be operated with the help of the pump <b>157</b> to turn the water over one time every 10 minutes. The control system <b>170</b> may operate the inlet valve <b>127</b> to admit water into the feed tank <b>110</b>. From the feed tank <b>110</b>, water will travel to the salt water feed manifold and then water is made to rise into the chamber tube. The level of the salt water in the chamber tube will be equal to water level in the feed tank <b>110</b>. This is based on Pascal's Principle for hydrostatic pressure. Using Pascal's Principle, automated pumps, valves, and associated controls are not required.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The RF chamber <b>120</b> further comprises a RF system <b>200</b>. The RF system <b>200</b> may comprise a frequency Oscillator/Generator <b>205</b>, a Pre-Amplifier <b>210</b>, a power Amplifier <b>215</b>, a RF Delivery system <b>220</b> and a Faraday Cage/Receiver <b>225</b>. It should be understood that the RF delivery system <b>220</b> and the Faraday Cage/Receiver <b>225</b> are placed in such a way that the chamber tube passes between them. It should be understood that the RF system <b>200</b> might be operated with the help of the control system <b>170</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In operation, when the water enters into the RF chamber <b>120</b>, the RF system <b>200</b> is employed to bombard RF energy on the water passing in the chamber tube as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. It should be understood that the water is bombarded with RF energy at predefined frequencies. In preferred embodiment, the predefined frequencies may include, but not limited to, 8.156 MHz and 9.790 MHz. The target isotope will determine the specific frequency used for the process desired.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">When the water is subjected to the RF bombardment, the atom or isotope targeted will begin to resonate. When the isotope resonates, it will break apart from its ionic bond, into its non-bonded state. When a chlorine isotope is liberated from the chlorine-sodium molecule, a suitable substitute has to be added to prevent a violent sodium-water reaction. Depending on geographic location or region of in which the apparatus is used, different compounds can be added to the saltwater feed tank to accomplish this goal, such as carbon dioxide, carbon powder, or even hydrogen gas. If carbon powder or carbon dioxide is added, the resulting compound will be sodium carbonate. If hydrogen is added, then the resulting compound would be sodium hydroxide.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">It should be understood that the RF energy is focused towards the salt solution i.e., the water passing through the chamber tubes <b>150</b>, such that any remaining RF energy will be captured by the faraday cage <b>225</b> and will be directed to an attenuator which will feed it back into power amplifier <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">After the RF energy breaks the ionic bond between the sodium and chlorine molecules, carbon dioxide (introduced in the salt water feed tank) will now bond ionically with the sodium. As a result of the RF energy bombardment, the chlorine in its excited state will not rebind with sodium. Since the upper third of the RF chamber <b>120</b> is in a vacuum, the newly liberated chlorine will come out of the solution into the vacuum area and be drawn up into the vacuum manifold <b>140</b>. Once in the vacuum manifold <b>140</b>, the chlorine gas will be directed to the inlet of a chlorine compressor (not shown), where it will be stored. In other words, top 30% of the RF chamber <b>120</b> is under a vacuum of mercury. This atmospheric pressure change will reduce the surface tension of the water, which will make it easier to release chlorine. Operating the upper &#x2153; under a vacuum allows assisting the RF system <b>200</b> in liberating the chlorine isotope and when the chlorine isotope is liberated, it will be routed through the chlorine gas discharge system and collected.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Further, after the RF energy breaks the ionic bond between the sodium and chlorine molecules, carbon dioxide (introduced in the salt water feed tank) will now bond ionically with the sodium. The solution, which is now clear of chlorine, will go into a syphon loop. The function of the loop is to allow the effluent stream a path while not allowing a leak into the vacuum system. Once the effluent has passed through the syphon loop, it will be directed toward the treated water manifold <b>145</b> where it will be stored for further (conventional purification steps) treatment.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As explained above, the RF chamber <b>120</b> comprises the outlet <b>130</b>, which is provided in a U-shape. The outlet <b>130</b> relies on the Clausius-Clapeyron Equation to estimate and ultimately control vapor pressure of the water. As known, Clausius-Clapeyron is a mathematical model for pressure increase, as a function of temperature increases. The vaporization curves of most liquids have a similar shape; vapor pressure increase as temperature increases. The Clausius-Clapeyron Equation provides an estimate of vapor pressure at any temperature if vapor pressure is known at one temperature, and if the enthalpy of vaporization (thermodynamic quantity equivalent to the total heat content of a system) is known.
