For the next advance technology device, Cu and Co recesses become more important for fully self-aligned via design. However, conventional high rate copper wet etchants cannot simultaneously achieve high cobalt etching rates due to (i) the difference of chemical properties of copper and cobalt and (ii) the galvanic corrosion effect between the two metals.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, it has been described (see <i>Journal of Applied Electrochemistry, </i>33: 403-10 (2003)) that a monoethanolamine based formulation including cupric chloride dihydrate can give a high copper etching rate. Although conventional wet etchants of copper provide high etch rates at high pH values, the cobalt etching rate is very low at high pH due to the formation of an inert Co(OH)<sub>2 </sub>layer on the cobalt surface.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This summary section does not specify every embodiment and/or incrementally novel aspect of the disclosed and claimed subject matter.
