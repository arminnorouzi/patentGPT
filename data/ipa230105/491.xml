The tool assembly includes first and second jaws which are movable in relation to each other between unapproximated and approximated positions. The first jaw supports an anvil assembly and the second jaw supports a cartridge assembly. The cartridge assembly includes a staple cartridge that houses a plurality of staples and can include a knife for severing tissue.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Some known surgical stapling apparatus are reposable, and a fired or spent staple cartridge can be replaced with an unfired or fresh staple cartridge to facilitate reuse of the surgical stapling apparatus. To prevent re-firing of a surgical stapling apparatus with a spent staple cartridge or to prevent firing of a surgical stapling apparatus which does not include a staple cartridge, it is known to provide a lockout mechanism which prevents advancement of a drive member of the surgical stapling apparatus. A lockout mechanism that prevents the use of the surgical stapling apparatus past its intended life cycle is desired.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The surgical stapling apparatus of this disclosure includes a firing lockout assembly for preventing the use of the surgical stapling apparatus beyond its intended life cycle. The firing lockout assembly locks a drive assembly of the surgical stapling apparatus to prevent firing of the surgical stapling apparatus after a pre-determined number of firing strokes thereby improving patient safety by preventing the surgical stapling apparatus or component(s) thereof (e.g., a loading unit) from being re-processed or used beyond its intended number of uses. The firing lockout assembly is mechanical and designed to be in-line with and iterated by existing drive assemblies (with minimal modifications thereto), thereby providing a simple and cost-effective safety feature for surgical stapling apparatus.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In aspects of the disclosure, a loading unit for a surgical stapling apparatus includes first and second jaw members, a drive beam, and a firing lockout assembly. The drive beam is axially movable within the loading unit during a firing sequence. The firing sequence includes an advancement stroke which moves the first and second jaw members to an approximated position and a retraction stroke which moves the first and second jaw members to an unapproximated position. The firing lockout assembly includes an iterating plate, a capture gear, and a lockout pin. The iterating plate is disposed adjacent to the drive beam and is incrementally movable proximally within the loading unit during the firing sequence of the drive beam. The capture gear is rotatable between first and second positions during the firing sequence of the drive beam and is configured to move the iterating plate. The lockout pin is configured to lock the drive beam after a pre-determined number of firing sequences.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The firing lockout assembly may have an unlocked state in which the lockout pin is disengaged from the drive beam and a locked state in which the lockout pin is engaged with the drive beam. In some aspects, the drive beam defines a lockout hole therethrough and the lockout pin is aligned with the lockout hole. The iterating plate blocks the lockout hole from the lockout pin until the pre-determined number of firing sequences has been reached. In certain aspects, the iterating plate defines a lockout window therethrough. The lockout window is axially offset relative to the lockout hole when the firing lockout assembly is in the unlocked state and the lockout window is aligned with the lockout hole when the firing lockout assembly is in the locked state. In some aspects, the lockout pin is loaded against the iterating plate by a lockout spring when the firing lockout assembly is in the unlocked state.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The iterating plate may include first and second teeth disposed on opposed longitudinal edges thereof and the capture gear may include first and second legs configured to alternatively engage the first and second teeth of the iterating plate. In some aspects, the first and second teeth are longitudinally offset with respect to each other. In certain aspects, when the capture gear is in the first position, the first leg of the capture gear engages one of the first teeth of the iterating plate and, when the capture gear is in the second position, the second leg of the capture gear engages one of the second teeth of the iterating plate that is distal to the one of the first teeth.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The capture gear may define an opening therethrough, and the firing lockout assembly may further include a pivot pin extending through the opening. In some aspects, the pivot pin includes a cylindrical body and a rail extending longitudinally along the length of the cylindrical body. In certain aspects, the opening defined in the capture gear includes a circular portion configured to receive the cylindrical body of the pivot pin and a detent configured to receive the rail. The capture gear is rotatable about the pivot pin between the first position, in which the rail is disposed within a first portion of the detent, and the second position, in which the rail is disposed within a second portion of the detent.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The drive beam may include a projection extending outwardly therefrom, and the capture gear may include an arm having a finger configured to engage the projection during the firing sequence to rotate the capture gear between the first and second positions.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In aspects of the disclosure, a surgical stapling apparatus including a handle assembly, an elongate tubular body extending distally from the handle assembly, and a loading unit extending distally from the elongate tubular body.
