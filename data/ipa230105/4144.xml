Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a device and method for interlinking a conventional automatic control system with an Internet of things (IOT), and more particularly, to an interlinking device that operates as a subordinate position device in both a conventional fieldbus-based automatic control system and an IoT system, and a method to interlink the automatic control system with the IoT system via a virtual input and output of the interlinking device.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">An Internet of Things (IoT) is a conceptual expression shared by the public as a way or technology for things to be connected to the Internet. In the present disclosure, an IoT system is defined as having the IoT built in for general users. The IoT system consists of an IoT protocol, an IoT device configured to exchange information on sensors and actuators based on the IoT protocol and an IoT platform configured to integrate and manage information of the IoT device and to provide users with status monitoring and setting change functions of the IoT device. The IoT platform and the IoT device have a relationship between supervisors and subordinates, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic view thereof. A message is used for information exchange between the IoT device and the IoT platform, and input-output messages are exchanged to read input information and write output information. In order for the IoT system to recognize input-output information of the IoT device, the IoT system's integrator has to register message metadata that define the input-output messages of the IoT device on the IoT platform.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An automatic control system is a system for automatically controlling an input value of a control target so that an output value of the control target coincides with a preset target value. The automatic control system consists of a fieldbus protocol, an input-output device configured to exchange the information on sensors and actuators based on the fieldbus protocol, and an operation device configured to integrate and manage information of the input-output device and provide the user with status monitoring and setting change functions of the input-output device. The operation device and the input-output device have a relationship between supervisors and subordinates, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic view thereof.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a use example of a conventional automatic control system. In conventional automatic control systems built before the concept of the IoT was generally established and its standard was determined, the user monitors and manages the input-output device through supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA). To this end, the integrator of the automatic control system has to code the tasks of the SCADA, configure a user interface (UI), and code the tasks of the operation device. In the case of interlinking a plurality of automatic control systems, a way of placing wide-area SCADA in the superior position of the conventional SCADA is used. In typical automatic control systems, the SCADA may be included in the automatic control system as necessary, or may replace the function of the operation device. The operation device may further include the function of the input-output device in addition to the function of operating the automatic control system. The input-output device may be a device that processes a digital input (DI), a digital output (DO), an analog input (AI), an analog output (AO), and a unique input or output information. Actual input information and output information are represented as electrical signals such as voltage, current, and resistance. When the input-output device is the DI, collected input information is obtained from an external DO or an on-off type sensor. When the input-output device is the DO, the output information is transmitted to an external DI or an on-off type actuator. When the input-output device is the AI, collected input information is obtained from an external AO or a multi-level type of sensor. When the input-output device is the AO, the output information is transmitted to an external AI or a multi-level type of actuator. The input-output device may process a plurality of complex input and output information.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a use example of the IoT system. The user of the IoT system monitors and manages the IoT device by accessing the IoT platform via a web or an app. To this end, the integrator of the IoT system registers the input-output information of the IoT device on the IoT platform and configures the UI. In typical IoT devices, since their input and output are physically determined, message metadata have been fixed, and only data can be changed on a level excluding message metadata for unused input and output information.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is three use cases for interlinking the IoT system with the conventional automatic control system using the conventional IoT technology. Similarly to the method for interlinking a plurality of automatic control systems, a method for placing a gateway on the top of the conventional automatic control system is applied to the use cases. The gateway should play a basic role in conforming the fieldbus protocol to the IoT protocol and conforming different information management systems for each SCADA manufacturer to an IoT information management system. Furthermore, according to the configuration of the automatic control system shown in the use cases, the gateway has to act as the operation device, the SCADA or the wide-area SCADA. When the gateway performs a complex function, it is referred to as an edge or a fog. When the gateway is entered between the IoT system and the automatic control system, the integrator has to perform gateway protocol confirming, information management system confirming, task coding, UI configuration, and so forth. Therefore, there is a problem that the integrator needs to have plenty of knowledge to interlink the IoT system with the conventional automatic control system using the gateway, and the interlinking method is also complicated.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Aspects of the present disclosure for solving the problems provide an interlinking device and an interlinking method for simplifying a construction task by minimizing knowledge that an integrator needs to acquire in order to interlink a conventional fieldbus-based automatic control system with an IoT system.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the present disclosure, an interlinking device for automatic control system and IoT system that exists at a subordinate position of the IoT platform, and simultaneously exists at a subordinate position of the operation device is provided. The interlinking device may comprise a fieldbus connection unit connected to an operation device based on a fieldbus protocol and configured to operate as an input-output device, a fieldbus virtual input-output memory configured to memorize input-output information exchanged with the operation device, an IoT connection unit connected to an IoT platform based on an IoT protocol and configured to operate as an IoT device, a message formation unit configured to apply message metadata received from the IoT platform via the IoT connection unit and a message processing unit configured to process an input-output message based on the message metadata and the input-output information. More specifically, the message metadata may further comprise an address of the fieldbus virtual input-output memory. The interlinking device is applied to interlinking of an automatic control system connected based on a conventional fieldbus protocol and an IoT system connected over an Ethernet communication network over by an IoT protocol or connected via a LPWA communication network.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the present disclosure, a method for interlinking an automatic system with an IoT system that can form a variable input-output message based on fieldbus virtual input-output memory address which is comprised in message metadata is provided. The method may comprise a message forming step of receiving and applying message metadata further including an address of a fieldbus virtual input-output memory from an IoT platform and a message processing step of processing an input-output message based on the message metadata and input-output information of the fieldbus virtual input-output memory. More specifically, the message processing step for interlinking an input message of the input-output message with output information of the input-output information, may comprise recognizing, by a message processing unit, a change in the message metadata and setting output information to be monitored, based on the address of the output information interlinked with the input message included in the message metadata and generating, by the message processing unit, the input message based on the message metadata and transmitting the input message to the IoT platform, when detecting a situation to be reported to the IoT platform from the output information to be monitored. More specifically, the message processing step for interlinking an output message of the input-output message with input information of the input-output information may comprise updating, by the message processor, the input information based on the address of the input information interlinked with the output message included in the message metadata. The interlinking method provides an input-output message interlinking when interlinkable input-output information is fixed as well as when it is added/deleted/changed; it also provides not only input-output message interworking formed with only input or output information, but also input-output message interlinking formed with complex input-output information.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to interlink a conventional automatic control system to which an IoT technology is not applied with an IoT system using an interlinking device and an interlinking method of the present disclosure, the integrator of the interlinking device only installs the interlinking device and connects both communication networks. The actual interlinking process is performed by the integrator of the automatic control system and the integrator of the IoT system, and only the integrator of the IoT system needs to learn knowledge to handle, based on addresses, input-output information disposed in a fieldbus virtual input-output memory inside the interlinking device. Accordingly, the present disclosure has the advantage of simplifying the integrator's task as compared to the interlinking using a gateway.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic view illustrating a relationship between an IoT platform and an IoT device in an IoT system.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic view illustrating a relationship between an operation device and an input-output device in an automatic control system.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example of a conventional automatic control system including SCADA.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example of an IoT system consisting only of an IoT device.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating three examples of interlinking the IoT system with an automatic control system using a gateway.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating interlinking between the IoT system and the automatic control system according to one embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating the configuration of an interlinking device according to one embodiment of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">While the present disclosure is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof are shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail.
