These services may include credit or loan underwriting that may extend a credit limit or balance to customers repayable at set billing cycles in return for the risk (and corresponding fees or payment) that is taken by extending such credit. The service provider may track customer data using expense management software, hardware, and other infrastructure to manage expenses and control user transactions. This includes issues with establishing and issuing payment instruments, tracking expenses and other accounting requirements, enforcing expense policies, and collecting auditing information and other transaction history data. However, conventional computing systems may merely establish rules about services that are extendable to customers. These conventional systems attempt to predict whether a customer may repay, however, may not accurately predict or forecast customer behaviors. This may adversely affect both the conventional systems, such as by increasing risk and/or fraud, as well as customers and other entities that may not receive proper extensions and offers of services.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, there is a need to address deficiencies with conventional computing systems used by service providers to forecast behaviors that predictively provide services to customers.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of a networked system suitable for implementing the processes described herein, according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is an exemplary decision tree of a machine learning model representing an algorithm trained to perform predictive forecasting of credit limits, according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is an exemplary neural network having layers that are trained to perform predictive forecasting of credit limits, according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is an exemplary diagram of a balance forecast determined using a machine learning model, according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is an exemplary diagram of a probability of default determined using a machine learning model, according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an exemplary flowchart for automatic adjustment of limits based on machine learning forecasting, according to an embodiment; and</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a block diagram of a computer system suitable for implementing one or more components in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, according to an embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures, wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Provided are methods for automatic adjustment of limits based on machine learning forecasting. Systems suitable for practicing methods of the present disclosure are also provided.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In service provider systems, such as credit provider systems and other financial service providers, underwriting systems may be utilized to extend credit or other loaned customers and other entities, such as businesses and companies, based on risk assessment and risk analysis processes performed by the service provider systems. With new companies, such as start-up businesses and enterprises, underwriting systems may have difficulty determining and adjusting extended balances due to the lack of data available for the start-up business, which affects the risk analysis processes for the underwriting systems. Further, the start-up businesses may have different and difficult to ascertain resources, which may further affect underwriting procedures. In order to solve these issues with lack of data for data processing of underwriting systems, an underwriting system may instead utilize intelligent decision-making through machine learning (ML) models that may predict data based on initial data input features. One or more ML models may take, as input, features and parameters for a business' or other entity's available data and predict, based on training data features and trained ML model layers, a risk assessment that may be associated with a probability of default and/or a forecasted global balance (e.g., account cash balance that an entity may have available with one or more financial institutions and/or in one or more accounts) available to the entity at a particular time or date. This allows a processing engine and operations of the underwriting system to dynamically adjust available credit or other extended loan balances and data in a predictive manner.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">An online credit and expense management system may provide data aggregators that monitor an entity's bank accounts and other financial accounts to determine global credit limits and available funds, cash or funds burn rate, and/or staleness of the aforementioned data. The financial accounts may include one or more credit accounts, debit cards, direct debit/credit through automated clearing house (ACH), wire transfers, gift cards, and other types of funding sources that may be issued to the entity by the online system and/or other financial service providers (e.g., banks). Thus, a networked system and provider may include a framework and architecture to provide payment gateways, billing platforms, eCommerce platforms, invoicing, and additional services. For example, a credit and underwriting provider system may offer services, software, online resources and portals, and infrastructure used to provide underwriting for the entity's (e.g., a business or company) available credit or loans, as well as operations for expenses, purchases, and other financial transactions.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The credit provider system may provide an electronic data processing framework that integrates into a payment network and/or computing system of a financial service provider at a point that allows for real-time data acquisition and/or periodic data retrieval and/or updating of global available balances and/or fund burn rates. For example, integration of the framework at a network node or point at or between an issuing and/or acquiring bank may allow for data about accounts and balances for an entity to be received in real-time, and thus the framework may perform real-time data processing. The data may also be acquired at certain intervals, such as from a pull and/or retrieval for the request from the corresponding banking system for the entity. Additionally, the system's framework may integrate with one or more client devices (e.g., personal computers, mobile devices, etc.), online scheduling resources, personnel management systems, and/or enterprise business software to receive data for an entity.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Finally, the entity may be required to select payment networks utilized for issuance of payment instruments and transaction processing, which may include payment cards, direct debit, payment wires, or other types of funding sources. The payment networks may correspond to resolution networks for payment processing using an account identifier, payment card, or the like during electronic and in-person transaction processing. These payment networks and financial service providers (e.g., banks and banking computing systems) may be selected and integrated with in order to determine and process data for entities when performing intelligent underwriting, as discussed herein.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In this regard, an entity, such as a company or other organization, may request credit underwriting and extension of credit from an underwriting system of a credit service provider, e.g., through a loan or credit account that provides one or more payment cards or other financial accounts. Initially, the entity may be onboarded by providing necessary documents to verify the entity's identity and/or business standing, such as incorporation documents, EIN, tax status and/or documents, and the like. In order to be processed for credit underwriting, the entity may further be required to provide certain data regarding the entity's financial status, accounts, and balances, such as initial seed money, investments, and global available balance(s) that may be used for repayment of extended credit or loans. In this regard, the entity may provide access or a link to, such as through an integration with one or more banking systems utilized by the entity for one or more available balances of funds. The entity may further provide information that may be used by one or more ML models to determine a cash or funds burn rate, as well as information associated with expenditures of the entity and how quickly the entity uses funds and/or what expenses the entity has.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The entity may be initially provided an extension of credit or other available balance, such as via one or more underwriting rules-based and/or ML model-based engines. In order to use this extension of credit, one or more payment instruments may be issued to users or employees of the entity, including sales, management, information technologies, or other employees. The payment instruments may correspond to various types of payment cards and/or account identifiers, which may be issued by the expense management system or by an associated partner (e.g., an issuing bank that provides credit cards or other financial instruments). During the course of business, an employee may engage in commerce with one or more merchants using a payment instrument, such as by making an in-person (e.g., at a merchant location or store) or online purchase from the merchant. Thus, the user may request electronic transaction processing through the account number or payment instrument identifier(s) provided to the user. Merchants (e.g., a seller or payment receiver, such as a business, fundraiser, healthcare provider, landlord, etc.) may correspond to any person or entity selling goods and/or services (referred to herein as an &#x201c;item&#x201d; or &#x201c;items&#x201d;) to the company's employees. Data accrued over time for the entity's expenditures, such as an expense management system provided by the credit service provider, may be further used to determine global available balances, burn rates, probability of default, and/or other assessments of the entity's risk.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">However, changes to available data may cause different underwriting rules and models to determine and output different available credit and/or credit extensions at different points in time and/or based on different data. For example, the entity may go through expenses and reduce their global available balances of funds, investments, or cash in one or more accounts. This may also affect burn rate, and therefore the entity may be expected to have more or less funds at different points in time (e.g., when the burn rate is lower or higher, respectively). Thus, the credit service provider may wish to change the extended credit limit based on their underwriting rules and/or models. However, previous inflexible systems may merely look at a probability of default prediction, which may only consider stale data (e.g., data for the entity that is one or more days, weeks, months, etc., old). This can result in the credit service provider either overly adjusting an extended credit limit, which may impact the entity's available credit negatively and experience, or not sufficiently adjusting the extended credit limit, which may risk repayment when insufficient global funds are available to the entity.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In this regard, the credit service provider may utilize an ML engine and one or more forecasting ML models to forecast a predicted global balance for the entity at a specific time or date, such as at a closing time or period for a billing cycle. The one or more forecasting models may be trained even without default data for the entity. The credit service provider may obtain training data for the forecasting ML models from one or more entities utilizing the credit service provider or a similar service provider. The data may correspond to global balances over time, changes to global balances over time (e.g., burn rate and/or processed transactions), variance due to staleness or other acquisition of data, and/or other behaviors of entities over time with regard to their available global balances and/or credit balances. Data features corresponding to this data may be extracted from the training data and used to train one or more ML models. When training the ML models, an exponential smoothing model and training framework may be used for training forecasting by one or more ML models, such as exponential smoothing forecasting. This may be trained using balances over time, transactions, and behaviors of the entities (e.g., burn rate and processed transactions). Further, with the data, large, abnormal, or single transactions for the entity may be excluded, such as those that may occur rarely or on a single basis and therefore not continue to contribute to burn rate.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In further embodiments, predicting a probability of default and/or delinquency (PD) ML model may further be trained using extracted training data, such as using XG Boost model training or other tree-based algorithm training (e.g., gradient boosting machine (GBM) models). The PD ML model may then segment entities into high, medium, and low risk based on their likelihood of repayment at the end of the billing cycle. The training data, and corresponding extracted features or attributes for model training, may be based on actual missed payments by the entity and/or other entities, and may utilize an affordability score as a risk measurement to determine whether entities will actually repay at a due date for account repayment. In this regard, a cash-based PD underwriting ML model may be used to predict and/or output the affordability score based on input features for the entity, the entity's global cash balance at a specific time, expenses and/or burn rates, historical spend or changes to a global cash balance, a staleness factor since data updating, and the like. Thereafter, one or more risk rules, models, and engines may be used to determine adjustments to an extended credit limit when dynamically underwriting an entity based on the affordability score determined from the ML model.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">For example, another affordability ML model may be used, after setting of a limit using the PD ML model, to determine if a score meets or exceeds a threshold, and thereafter dynamically adjust the available balance. This may allow for the level of the credit limit or balance to be less volatile with single large transactions, while accounting for increased or decreased burn rate. This may assist in creating less volatility at end of statement or billing cycle payments, which may have a large transaction for payment of a cycle, which affects dynamic forecasting of a credit balance and/or extended credit limit at certain times (e.g., end of a billing cycle and start of a next cycle). Further, a confidence interval for the affordability score may be used, which may add a range based on different risk thresholds and/or tiers for entities. This may also be set with the risk and underwriting system based on risk rules. A threshold limit or adjustment for the confidence interval may be utilized in order to determine when to dynamically adjust a credit limit or the like (e.g., at what date and based on what new data for the entity, such as an updated or refreshed global cash balance).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">When training an ML model, the extracted features are used as training data at an input layer, which is then used to weigh, balance, and assign values to nodes within hidden layers of the ML model. The training data may include annotated or unannotated data, for supervised or unsupervised learning, respectively, which is used to train and adjust each node. Each node may represent a mathematical relationship to other nodes within the model and between interconnected layers that represent decisions, such as in a decision tree. For example, an input layer may be interconnected to nodes within a first hidden layer, which may then be interconnected to nodes within a next hidden layer, and so on until an nth-hidden layer is the final hidden layer. This nth-hidden layer is then connected to output nodes or decisions, which provide a prediction and/or forecast that is learned from the training data by a computing system. Feedback from one or more data scientists may be used to adjust the value, weight, and/or relationship of nodes and more accurately provide predictions and forecasts. Once trained, the ML model(s) may be deployed in an intelligent underwriting system, which may provide predictive analysis without user input for dynamic balance adjustments. Thus, the underwriting system may provide predictive forecasting of an available global balance over time and at an end of a billing cycle for an entity. In various embodiments, one or more risk rules may also be implemented as safeguards to incorrect predictions, such as based on static rules allowing or preventing certain actions by the computing system.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Thereafter, the intelligent underwriting system may receive data for a credit or loan account of an entity that has an available balance extended by the credit service provider. The intelligent underwriting system may utilize the ML model(s) to predict and/or forecast a global available balance for the entity at a closing time for a billing cycle or repayment date of the credit account (e.g., to pay off a used amount of the available credit limit). The data for input to the ML model(s) may correspond to the current available global balance for the entity (or a last known available global balance with stale data), a burn rate of cash or other funds from expenses, and/or a staleness factor of how old the available data is with the credit service provider. For example, the global balance and/or burn rate may be determined using an integration with a banking computing network and/or system of a bank for the entity. However, the data may also be received from other sources, including users at the entity. The data may be required to be updated daily or some other interval, where if not updated, the data may be considered stale. With stale data, a staleness factor may be used as input to the ML model(s), which may affect a predictive confidence range or interval by increasing the size as old data may be less predictable.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The balance forecast for the global available balance of the entity may correspond to a predicted amount of funds that the entity may have available at this date. The balance forecast further includes a predictive confidence interval, such as a range, of predictive funds the entity may have available for their global balance. For example, an upper range may correspond to a 25% likelihood of having those available funds, while a lower range may correspond to a 75% likelihood of having those available funds. This interval may be affected in size, and lower ranges may be selected, based on the staleness factor of the data, such as by increasing the range and/or selecting lower ranges that have a higher likelihood of available funds (and thus repayment). Thereafter, based on this confidence interval and one or more risk rules or factor for the entity, the underwriting system, and/or other risk models, the intelligent underwriting system may automatically adjust, either up or down, the available balance for the entity with the credit account. Once predicted and dynamically adjusted, the credit service provider may continually or periodically adjust the available balance for the entity. This may occur daily or after another time-based interval, when new data is received (e.g., when stale data is updated, and a staleness factor is changed to reflect new data), or at another time.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">When using the extended credit to process a payment, the credit provider system may receive transaction data for the payment request from the payment network, for example, when the acquirer (e.g., the acquiring bank for the merchant that processes the payment instrument provided by the user) requests processing with the issuer (e.g., the issuing bank of the entity and/or credit provider system that issues the payment instrument). This occurs when the user causes a transaction to be generated, and the merchant generates a total for the transaction request, which the user can pay for by providing a payment instrument to the merchant. After receiving the payment instrument, the merchant may cause a payment request to be generated for payment of the transaction. In various embodiments, the user may be required to enter additional checkout information, such as a name, delivery location, or other personal or financial information that may be included in the transaction data for the transaction. In some embodiments, the payment instrument may previously be tokenized by the expense management system in order to further protect from fraud, where the digital token allows for backend identification of the payment instrument to the issuer and/or expense management system without exposing payment credentials.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In this regard, real-time bank data may be used to update ML model predictions quickly (e.g., hourly, daily, etc.) and, based on one or more updated predictions, the service providers processing engines may decide on whether to change a credit limit or other service extended to a user. Conventional ML underwriting ML models may not have real-time connections to data sources in order to provide faster and/or more real-time underwriting decisions. Thus, the updated prediction may be outside a confidence interval for an initial prediction utilized by conventional systems. If so, then the updated prediction may be considered more than noise and used to update the corresponding extended service. However, the ML models and engine may use a balance forecasting model in order to predict and account balance or other forecasted metrics. This may then be subsequently updated at later time intervals. The ML models for balance forecasting may be trained without default data for an entity, but instead assess whether a startup customer or other entity may default based on whether the entity has an available balance. This may be advantageous with certain entities that may have large available balances (e.g., cash), but little revenue, so their ability to repay debt is primarily based on how much cash the entity has on hand.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of a networked system <b>100</b> suitable for implementing the processes described herein, according to an embodiment.

For example, entity balance <b>306</b> may increase as new funds are added to the account of the business or other entity (e.g., a new round of funding, additional investments, revenue, etc.) or decrease from expenses and other expenditures by the entity. In this regard, based on the movement of global balance <b>302</b> over time <b>304</b>, entity balance <b>306</b> may be forecasted to be a certain global balance or amount at statement end <b>308</b>. In order to predict the balance or amount of funds for entity balance <b>306</b> at statement end <b>308</b>, the ML models and engines described herein may perform such predictions and forecasting.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">However, based on input features and attributes for an entity's data, the ML models and/or other artificial intelligence systems (e.g., rule-based engines, neural networks, and the like) may generate different decisions. For example, initially, an unadjusted forecast <b>314</b> may be determined based on initial risk rules without ML model forecasting, as described herein. Unadjusted forecast may be based on conventional risk analysis and/or risk projection rules and engines. This may correspond to a conventional projection that may initially be determined by an underwriting system when determining risk of credit or loan repayment. Thus, unadjusted forecast <b>314</b> may correspond to an initial level of credit extended to an entity by the underwriting system of the credit service provider.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">However, using the ML models, updated forecasted projections may be made, which may include a confidence interval based on staleness of an entity's banking data and other factors (e.g., changes to burn rate, global balance adjustments, and the like). For example, at a first time, additional global balance data may be received at a time for stale reading <b>310</b>. If this information is not adjusted up to statement end <b>308</b>, a stale confidence adjusted forecast <b>316</b> may be determined. This may be determined by the ML model(s) for global balance forecasting in order to account for a risk <b>320</b> caused by the stale entity data. Thus, staleness of the data may cause ML models to reduce a credit limit for extended credit in order to account for risk <b>320</b> in providing a higher forecast of global balance <b>302</b> for entity balance <b>306</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">However, at a later time along the axis for time <b>304</b>, up-to-date reading <b>312</b> may provide additional entity data. Since this data is provided later and closer to statement end <b>308</b>, a more accurate prediction or forecast of global balance <b>302</b> for entity balance <b>306</b> and/or less risk may be involved in providing a higher prediction of global balance <b>302</b> may be determined by the ML model(s). For example, up-to-date reading <b>312</b> may be used to provide an up-to-date confidence adjusted forecast <b>318</b> that accounts for less risk and/or risk <b>320</b> for a confidence interval associated with predicting global balance <b>302</b> for entity balance <b>306</b>. Thus, up-to-date confidence adjusted forecast <b>318</b> may correspond to a higher predicted global balance and therefore an increased credit limit when underwriting credit extended to the entity.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is an exemplary diagram <b>300</b><i>b </i>of a probability of default determined using a machine learning model, according to an embodiment. Diagram <b>300</b><i>b </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> includes a representation of a PD (e.g., a probability of default or delinquency for an entity) over a timeline or for a billing cycle (e.g., during the billing cycle and when approaching a repayment date), which may be predicted by credit provider server <b>130</b> using credit underwriting application <b>140</b> discussed in reference to system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In this regard, the PD may adjust a credit limit using one or more ML models, such as those trained in regard to the representations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In diagram <b>300</b><i>b</i>, a ML model may be trained for cash-based PD underwriting using a ML technique and algorithm, such as tree-based ML methods and algorithms. This may correspond to an XG boost model, however, other models may also be used including GBM and other tree-based algorithms. The cash-based PD underwriting ML model may provide additional stabilizations over a global balance forecasting ML model, such as the one described with regard to diagram <b>300</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>. This may be done by utilizing an affordability <b>322</b> that corresponds to a score, metric, or value determined from a ML model. An entity's score for affordability <b>322</b> therefore limits changing of credit limits over time and may provide more stable balances over a time period (e.g., a 90-day time period or for a billing cycle). Thus, affordability <b>322</b> may correspond to an output value of a ML model trained to determine which risk factors are most predictive of delinquency. This ML model therefore provides a risk estimate as an output for affordability <b>322</b>, which may be reassessed for customer risk with up-to-date information (e.g., new daily information, such as global cash balances, burn rates, expenses and historical spend, and the like). Without updating with more up-to-date information, a staleness factor may also affect affordability <b>322</b>, which may change the corresponding score for affordability <b>322</b> for an entity.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In this regard, affordability <b>322</b> may be determined by a ML model that is tuned to maximize limit stability, maximize credit limits to cover historical spend and other past expenses, and minimize credit loss when limits are set too high (e.g., an entity defaults on repayment). In this regard, when the ML model determines affordability <b>322</b>, an optimization may be executed using historical data and available global cash balances to balance between the aforementioned three aspects. Affordability <b>322</b> therefore provides a metric to determine when dynamic adjustment of a credit balance should be performed.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In diagram <b>300</b><i>b</i>, affordability <b>322</b> is plotted against a date <b>324</b> so that the chart of diagram <b>300</b><i>b </i>shows changes in affordability <b>322</b> over time. This is used to dynamically adjust credit limits or other balances or limits of available funds (e.g., an extendable loan or the like). A solid line is shown as a limit updating threshold <b>326</b>, which may be a threshold based on risk rules and/or models that indicates when affordability <b>322</b> exceeds limit updating threshold <b>326</b>, a credit limit or balance should be dynamically adjusted to reduce a credit limit. In other embodiments, when below limit updating threshold for a time period, such as a significant time period (e.g., one or multiple billing cycles) that indicates a credit limit is too low, dynamic adjustment may include increasing a credit limit.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">An affordability score <b>328</b> for an entity is therefore plotted in diagram <b>300</b><i>b </i>using affordability <b>322</b> over date <b>324</b>. This is shown with limit updating threshold <b>326</b> to determine if affordability score <b>328</b> for the entity exceeds limit updating threshold <b>326</b>, and a dynamic adjustment of a credit limit is required. A limit <b>330</b> shows a current credit limit or other available credit or loan for an entity and may be adjusted based on limit amounts <b>332</b>. When affordability score <b>328</b> exceeds limit updating threshold <b>326</b>, limit <b>330</b> dynamically decreases to provide a lower overall credit limit and reduce risk. This is caused when the ML model predictive output for affordability <b>322</b> indicates that the entity is riskier of defaulting or being delinquent in repayment (e.g., their PD score for affordability <b>322</b> indicates higher likelihood of delinquency).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in diagram <b>300</b><i>b</i>, for date <b>324</b> of Jul. 26, 2020, affordability score <b>328</b> for an entity exceeds limit updating threshold <b>326</b>. For example, at a location in diagram <b>300</b><i>b </i>for update the limit here <b>334</b>, affordability score <b>328</b> as the dashed line exceeds limit updating threshold <b>326</b> at a point <b>336</b>. Point <b>336</b> may be caused by a change to a global cash balance (e.g., a reduction of available cash, a large purchase that decreases a bank account, or the like), a change in historical spend or expenses, and the like. This therefore indicates a higher likelihood or probability of being delinquent in repayment or defaulting on the credit and repayment. Thus, limit <b>330</b> is shown as decreasing from $100,000 to $30,000 with limit amounts <b>332</b>. This corresponds to a dynamic adjustment of a credit limit using the cash-based PD ML model for predicting affordability <b>322</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an exemplary flowchart <b>400</b> for automatic adjustment of credit limits based on machine learning forecasting, according to an embodiment. Note that one or more steps, processes, and methods of flowchart <b>400</b> described herein may be omitted, performed in a different sequence, or combined as desired or appropriate.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">At step <b>402</b> of flowchart <b>400</b>, training data for entities using extending credit from a credit provider is obtained. Training data may correspond to transactions, expense behaviors, and/or global balance increases, such as those associated with using and/or receiving a global balance of funds available to the entities. The training data may therefore include changes to a global balance over time, which may also include burn rate and the like. At step <b>404</b>, training features are extracted from the training data, where the training features may correspond to data attributes, features, values, and the like that may be extracted for use in training nodes and layers within an ML model for decision-making. Thus, the training features may correspond to those features and data required by one or more mathematical computations or algorithms to train nodes of the ML model to perform decision-making and/or provide additional data to interconnected nodes for decision-making.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">At step <b>406</b>, an ML model for balance forecasting is trained. The ML model may be trained using the extracted features, attributes, and values from the training data. The ML model may correspond to an exponential smoothing model, and XG Boost model for PD (e.g., a probability of default or delinquency) in available funds for credit repayment at a data, or the like. The ML model may be trained and retrained or provided feedback for decision-making when results are not accurate or do not reach sufficient levels of accuracy. In this regard, the ML model may be trained to provide a predictive output or forecast on one or more anticipated global balances of an entity at a certain future date based on the input features. Where the input features include up-to-date information, a staleness factor may be zero, negligible, or otherwise indicate the current nature of the data. However, a staleness factor may further affect predictive decision-making and forecasting where the data may be stale, a certain number of days or other time period old, or the like.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">At step <b>408</b>, the ML model is deployed in an underwriting framework. Deployment may include implementing the ML model in an intelligent decision-making framework for underwriting credit amounts and limits extended to users. Once deployed, the underwriting framework may be used to perform predictive determination of future global balances for entities, which may assist in underwriting and acceptable risk for extending credit to entities. Thus, at step <b>410</b>, global balance features and a burn rate for an entity are determined. This may be retrieved from account data and/or uploaded or submitted data for the entity. However, integrations with one or more banking computing networks and/or systems may also be used to retrieve the data for the balances. Where a connection to the banking networks or systems is severed or unavailable, stale data from past available data may be used, but a staleness factor may also be considered for predicting and/or forecasting future global balances of the entity at particular dates.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">At step <b>412</b>, a predictive score for delinquency by the entity at a closing period of a billing cycle is predicted. In some embodiments, a balance forecast may be determined, which may correspond to an expected balance, which may correspond to a confidence interval having a range for an expected balance at the closing period. The confidence interval may have different sections or portions corresponding to different likelihood to repayment. For example, an upper 25% may have a low likelihood of repayment, and therefore be excluded under risk rules. However, other lower sections and/or global balance amounts may be predicted and used for underwriting based on acceptable risk. At step <b>414</b>, it is determined, from the predictive score, whether a balance adjustment is required.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">If no balance adjustment is required based on the predictive score (e.g., the likelihood of having an available cash balance is the same or within an acceptable margin of error from a current credit limit of extended credit or other loan amount), then flowchart <b>400</b> may proceed to step <b>416</b>, where the current credit balance and/or limit is retained. Thus, the credit balance extended to the entity may not be adjusted and may be maintained at a certain level. This may also occur where a model predicts, based on changes to the global balance, that an affordability score does not exceed a threshold requiring a reduction in the credit limit due to a risk score for the predictive model (e.g., exceeding a higher risk entity categorization from the risk model).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">However, if a balance adjusting is required at step <b>414</b>, flowchart <b>400</b> may proceed to step <b>418</b> where a credit balance and/or limit is dynamically adjusted. This may be performed by dynamically adjusting, without user input and/or request, the credit balance to reflect a predicted or forecasted available global balance of funds at a particular date or a PD score for repayment at that particular date. The new credit limit may be adjusted dynamically at particular time intervals and/or when new data is available and may reflect the currently forecasted global balance and/or affordability score. Where a confidence interval in the global balance is used, a particular global balance (and thus credit limit) may be selected based on risk assessments and/or sections of the confidence interval that are acceptable to the underwriting system. Similarly, an affordability score may be used to determine that an entity exceeds a threshold due to risk for the entity changing, which may cause the credit limit to be impacted and reduced until a further billing cycle.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Thus, using various embodiments discussed herein, companies can better (e.g., more efficiently and more accurately) predict and/or forecast upcoming data, which allows for more intelligent decision-making and provision of services.
