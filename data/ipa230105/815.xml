General</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">This application discloses the utility of sodium-glucose linked transporter (SGLT) inhibitors for the management hypertension, renal disease (e.g., chronic kidney disease) or heart failure in companion animals (in particular, felines and canines).</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Sodium-Glucose Linked Transporters (SGLTs)</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">SGLT proteins belong to a phylogenetically related collection of transporters genetically encoded by genes of the solute-linked carrier 5A (SLC5A) family. SGLT1 and SGLT2 are related transporters, encoded by SLC5A1 and SLC5A2, respectively, in humans, that are responsible for the reuptake of glucose from the renal filtrate. SGLT1 also plays a substantial role in the absorption of glucose from the intestine. Both transporters rely on the transmembrane electrochemical gradient for sodium to actively transport glucose across the cell membrane and into the cells of the renal proximal tubule. SGLT2, which cotransports one molecule of glucose and one sodium ion, is predominantly located in the initial portion of the proximal tubule, known as the pars convoluta, or convoluted portion of the proximal tubule, whereas SGLT1, which cotransports one molecule of glucose and two sodium ions, is predominantly located downstream of SGLT2, in the pars recta, or straight portion of the proximal tubule. Under ordinary circumstances SGLT2 takes up more than 90% of the glucose and SGLT1 takes up the remainder. SGLT2 has a weaker concentrative power than SGLT1, but accomplishes uptake by an energetically more favorable mechanism. Ultimately the Na<sup>+</sup> ions that are cotransported into the cell must be expelled by an energy-requiring (ATP-consuming) process.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Loss of SGLT2 function as a result of genetic mutation results in glucosuria but loss of function of SGLT1 does not. Nonetheless, when SGLT2 is inhibited, SGLT1 can partially compensate. Highly specific SGLT2 inhibitors developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in humans typically produce a maximum urinary glucose excretion of approximately 80 g per day in healthy volunteers, approximately half of the expected glomerular flux. The remainder is believed to be reabsorbed by SGLT1.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The diversion of glucose from the bloodstream to urine represents an attractive mechanism for the treatment of T2DM because individuals lacking SGLT2 are euglycemic and typically healthy, indicating that complete loss of the transporter is well-tolerated. In addition, T2DM is very frequently triggered by excess weight and the dissipation of plasma glucose in urine instead of assimilation into fat, thereby exacerbating the root cause of the disease, is seen as an appealing alternative to the use of insulin and insulin sensitizers and secretagogues, which tend to cause weight gain as a result of the action of insulin on adipocytes. However, one disadvantage of SGLT2 inhibition is that the mechanism is dependent on renal function, and as the latter wanes, so does the therapeutic benefit. This has been empirically demonstrated by measurement of the urinary glucose excretion by study populations with T2DM and varying degrees of renal compromise. No SGLT2 inhibitors have been approved to date for the treatment of T2DM in humans with advanced moderate CKD (stage 3b, corresponding to an eGFR of 30-44 mL min<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>).</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The kidneys are twin organs responsible for the excretion of waste products that develop in the course of resting metabolism in a large number of species. Except in rare conditions, such as hibernation, the usual consequences of ongoing metabolism result in the accumulation of decomposition products of nucleic acids, proteins and vitamins that if not discharged from the body would ultimately impair its proper functioning. In addition, as the principal organ for the elimination of dietary and environmental toxins, the kidney has an especially important role to play in the survival of terrestrial vertebrates. By far the largest fraction of ingested toxins in the diets of herbivores and omnivores is contributed by plant secondary metabolism, which in aggregate creates an extraordinary variety of toxic compounds to protect plants from consumption.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The kidney functions by a default release system, in which all of the contents of the plasma below approximately 50 kDa in mass are excreted, and then only the plasma contents of interest are reabsorbed. In this way toxins, and in general all soluble foreign compounds introduced into the bloodstream, are excreted by default. The process of selective reabsorption is quite expensive metabolically, and it has been estimated that approximately 25% of the resting energy requirements of humans are devoted to the process of renal filtration and reabsorption. The task is substantial because all of the water, electrolytes, vitamins and most metabolites must be reabsorbed.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Anatomically, the kidney is a bundle of individual tubes that follow complex paths from their origins in the glomeruli, the ball-like structures through which blood flows and plasma is released, to the ureter, the final collecting structure into which all of the individual tubes eventually fuse. Each individual structural unit of a glomerulus and tubule is called a nephron. A feedback loop is created within each nephron to control flow and is made possible by an anatomical organization in which a distal segment of each nephron loops back to come into contact with the glomerulus from which it emanated. A sensing mechanism allows the blood pressure across the glomerulus to increase or decrease as the filtrate flow in the tubule is sensed to be too low or too high, respectively. This control mechanism is referred to as tubuloglomerular feedback, and takes place in the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which as its name suggests, is a structure adjacent to the glomerulus in which the tubule and the blood supply (entering afferent arteriole and exiting efferent arteriole) are brought into apposition.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Loss of renal function typically results in mortality if not managed therapeutically. In humans, loss of renal function is most frequently due to chronic kidney disease (CKD), an indolent progressive condition that results in end stage renal disease (ESRD), a state that must be treated by dialysis or renal transplantation. Damage to the kidneys as a result of diabetes or hypertension are the two most common contributing factors for the progression of CKD in humans.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">CKD is also a common condition afflicting canines and felines. According to a publication of the International Renal Interest Society (IRIS), CKD has a prevalence in dogs of between 0.5 and 1% and a prevalence in cats of between 1 and 3% (http://www.iris-kidney.com/education/risk_factors.html). The incidence of CKD increases with age in both species, and CKD is a common cause of feline mortality.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">CKD is a progressive disorder and pharmacological or dietary interventions generally aim to slow the progression of the disease or its secondary complications. Damage to the kidneys is usually irreversible and there are no presently approved treatments to restore function to failing kidneys. As kidney function declines, the loss of individual nephrons manifests as a dwindling rate of filtration (a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate or GFR) and damage to the glomeruli results in a loss of integrity of the glomerular barrier function that allows the kidney to retain proteins of molecular mass greater than 50 kDa. As a result, proteinuria, the presence of abnormally large amounts of protein in urine, becomes apparent. Reductions in GFR have the effect of decreasing the rate at which toxins exit the body, and results in a generalized toxemia, or elevation of toxins in the blood and azotemia, the pathological accumulation of nitrogenous waste products, typically in the form of urea, in the blood.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Although it is possible to measure the GFR directly by infusion of appropriate tracer compounds into the bloodstream and measuring their disappearance as a function of time, in routine clinical practice, surrogate measures of the filtration rate are commonly employed. The most widely used of these in both human and animal medical practice is the measurement of the serum creatinine concentration. Creatinine is produced endogenously by muscle at a constant rate per gram of muscle at rest, with levels elevated somewhat by exertion. It is excreted by the kidney predominantly by glomerular filtration (in humans about 15% is excreted by an active transport process in the proximal tubule) and is not reabsorbed. Creatinine levels change little with time in most individuals, and as the GFR declines, the creatinine concentration in the blood increases.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Most measurements are made of serum creatinine. Serum is the liquid phase remaining after coagulation of blood and consists of plasma (the liquid phase of blood), and platelet proteins released upon coagulation. The relationship between the serum creatinine and the GFR is calculated by one or more equations, such as the Cockcroft-Gault equation or the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation for humans, that result in a derived quantity referred to as the estimated glomerular filtration rate, or eGFR. eGFR in humans is usually expressed in the form appropriate to a standard human with a surface area of 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, so that eGFR is expressed in mL min<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. In veterinary practice, normalization by body mass instead of surface area is generally performed or the creatinine concentration per se is taken to be an indicator of renal health. The IRIS staging system for classifying CKD severity divides cats and dogs into four stages from healthy to severely diseased (http://www.iris-kidney.com/pdf/IRIS_Staging_of_CKD_modified_2019.pdf). The serum creatinine concentrations (often referred to interchangeably as blood creatinine in veterinary literature) for the four stages in dogs, expressed as mg of creatinine per dL of serum (mg dL<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), are &#x3c;1.4, 1.4-2.8, 2.9-5.0 and &#x3e;5.0 mg dL<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. Expressed as &#x3bc;mol per liter, these are &#x3c;125, 125-250, 251-440 and &#x3e;440 &#x3bc;mol L<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. For cats the four stages are &#x3c;1.6, 1.6-2.8, 2.9-5.0 and &#x3e;5.0 mg dL<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, or &#x3c;140, 140-250, 251-440 and &#x3e;440 &#x3bc;mol L<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. Serum creatinine can be influenced by diet to some extent, as it and its precursor compound, creatine, can be found in meat. Hence a shift in diet away from carbohydrates, for example, would typically produce an increase in serum creatinine.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Another surrogate measure of renal function is the concentration of blood urea nitrogen (BUN, actually measured as serum or plasma urea nitrogen), which quantifies the amount of nitrogen in serum/plasma in the form of urea. Urea is formed by the liver as a detoxification of ammonia, produced predominantly from amino acid catabolism. Urea undergoes glomerular filtration but is also reabsorbed to a certain extent, with a net excretion of 30-50% of the filtrate urea. As with creatinine, the BUN increases with decreasing glomerular filtration.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Recently, a new analyte for the detection and estimation of renal disease, symmetrical dimethylarginine (SDMA), has become more frequently included in clinical chemistry panels for the assessment of companion animal health (http://www.iris-kidney.com/pdf/003-5559.001-iris-website-symmetric-dimethylarginine-pdf 220116-final.pdf). Methylation of arginine in vivo typically occurs on protein arginine residues and is carried out by specific protein arginine methylases, and reversed by specific protein arginine demethylases. SDMA bears one methyl group on each of the arginine guanidino group primary amine moieties, whereas asymmetrical dimethylarginine bears both methyl groups on one of the guanidino group primary amines. SDMA is produced by specific protein methylases and released upon protein degradation. It undergoes glomerular filtration but is not reabsorbed by the kidney and thus can serve as an indicator of glomerular filtration rate. It has the theoretical advantage of being little affected by diet. It has been proposed to be more sensitive than creatinine for the early detection of CKD, and because its production is not limited to muscle, changes in body composition are less likely to affect SDMA than to affect creatinine.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">IRIS staging of CKD informed by SDMA is modified by adding SDMA criteria to the creatinine-based classification system. If a dog is considered healthy by creatinine (stage 1, &#x3c;1.4 mg dL<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) but has an SDMA that is persistently &#x3e;18 &#x3bc;g dL<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, the dog should be advanced to IRIS stage 2 and managed as such. Similarly, if the dog is at IRIS stage 2 and has an SDMA that is persistently &#x3e;35 &#x3bc;g dL<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, the dog should be advanced to stage 3 and so managed, and if the dog is at stage 3 and has an SDMA that is persistently &#x3e;54 &#x3bc;g dL<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, the dog should be advanced to stage 4 and so managed. For cats the threshold values for advancement in stage are 18, 25 and 38 &#x3bc;g dL<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>of SDMA.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As mentioned above, proteinuria is a manifestation of renal disease and the degree of proteinuria is a measure of disease severity. The most abundant protein in plasma is albumin, and the degree of proteinuria in humans is often presented as the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio or UACr. Albuminuria stage A1 is described by a UACr of &#x3c;30 mg g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, stage A2 by 30&#x2264;UACr&#x2264;300 mg g<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and stage A3 by UACr&#x3e;300 mg g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. These are sometimes described in units of mg mmol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, for which the values are all 10-fold lower (e.g., &#x3c;3 mg mmol<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>for stage A1).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Because the kidneys are a major source of the main growth factor for the proliferation of erythrocyte precursors, erythropoietin, advanced renal disease is often associated with an abnormally low number of erythrocytes and blood hemoglobin, manifestations of anemia. Because inorganic phosphate cannot be excreted, hyperphosphatemia is an important problem that has adverse consequences for bone health and often leads to an increase in parathyroid hormone known as secondary hyperparathyroidism. A diet low in phosphorus is considered mandatory for human patients undergoing dialysis, and stoichiometric binders of dietary phosphate are often prescribed to induce phosphate excretion in stool.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Inhibition of SGLT2 in diabetic humans has been found to produce modest elevations in BUN and serum creatinine, which early in the history of the development of SGLT2 inhibitors were interpreted as potentially adverse effects. However, the apparent decrease in eGFR has been found to be reversible and appears to represent an influence of SGLT2 inhibition on tubuloglomerular feedback resulting in decreased glomerular flow that is renoprotective over a sufficiently great period of time.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In a clinical trial evaluating the effects of the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin in diabetic subjects with stage A3 albuminuria (all of whom were being treated with angiotensin system inhibitors), after a median period of 2.62 years, an interim assessment of safety and efficacy established that the trial should be halted because the continued administration of placebo was no longer justified (Perkovic et al., 2019, N Engl J Med 380:2295; doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1811744). The risk of suffering any of the composite primary endpoint triad of end-stage kidney disease, a doubling of the serum creatinine level, or death from renal or cardiovascular causes, was 30% lower in the canagliflozin group than in the placebo group. Subjects assigned to the active arm experienced a prompt reduction in UACr that was evident at the first measurement at 6 months and remained approximately constant for up to 42 months. The eGFR of participants in the active arm dropped immediately, but then declined at a substantially slower rate than that for the participants in the placebo arm, and by study conclusion was higher for subjects who had been randomized to the active arm for the longest time than for the corresponding subjects in the control arm.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">That these findings were neither specific to canagliflozin nor peculiar to the population chosen for study was supported by a meta-analysis of the effects of the SGLT2 inhibitors canagliflozin, dapagliflozin or empagliflozin that showed that SGLT2 inhibition decreased the likelihood of dialysis, transplantation, or death from renal disease by 33% compared to placebo, with good consistency observed between studies (Neuen et al., 2019, Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol 7:845; doi: 10.1016/S2213-8587(19)30256-6). Baseline albuminuria and use of angiotensin system inhibitors, enrollment criteria for the canagliflozin study (Perkovic et al., op. cit.), were not prerequisites for the renoprotective effect (Neuen et al., op. cit.).</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Canine CKD</heading><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Canine CKD has many similarities to human disease. Clinical signs that reflect decreased renal function may include evidence of systemic malaise and toxemia/azotemia in the form of one or more of anorexia, nausea, vomiting and weight loss. Signs of dehydration may also be present. Laboratory testing, in addition to identifying elevated creatinine, BUN and SDMA, may reveal acidosis, hypokalemia (low potassium) and anemia.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The management of canine CKD recommended by IRIS emphasizes control of hypertension in stage 1 disease by renin-angiotensin system (RAS) antagonists, followed by calcium channel blockers if RAS antagonists alone cannot produce an adequate hypotensive effect (http://www.iris-kidney.com/pdf/IRIS-DOG-Treatment_Recommendations_2019.pdf). In stage 2 more intensive intervention to control hypertension may be necessary and a renal diet should be begun if the urinary protein to creatinine ratio signifies borderline pathology (0.2 to 0.5) or frank proteinuria (ratio of UP/C&#x3e;0.5). Anti-platelet agents (aspirin or clopidogrel) should be initiated if the serum albumin is &#x3c;2.0 g dL<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. Phosphate binders can be initiated if the serum phosphorus is &#x2265;4.6 mg dL<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. In stages 3 and 4, renal diets should be prescribed and the urine protein to creatinine ratio routinely measured. Metabolic acidosis should be managed with sodium bicarbonate or potassium citrate (if hypokalemia is present). Nausea and vomiting should be managed with anti-emetics. Omeprazole should be used to reduce gastric acidity if gastric bleeding or emesis-associated esophagitis is suspected. In stage 4 dialysis or renal transplantation can be considered. A feeding tube may be required to prevent malnutrition and/or dehydration</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">There is relatively little experimental support for the effectiveness of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor benazepril for canine CKD, however. In a blinded clinical trial enrolling 49 client-owned dogs with a primary endpoint measuring the difference in renal survival time between the placebo and benazepril cohorts, significance was not realized (King et al., 2017, J Vet Intern Med 31:1113; doi: 10.1111/jvim.14726). Renal survival time was the time to a composite of death, euthanasia or administration of parenteral fluids for renal failure. Although the primary endpoint was not met, proteinuria, as measured by the urinary protein to creatinine ratio, was significantly improved in the benazepril arm (p=0.0032).</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">Feline CKD</heading><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Feline and canine CKD are managed pharmacologically by very similar strategies. A calcium channel blocker (CCB) or renin-angiotensin system antagonist is generally prescribed. A comparison of the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) telmisartan with benazepril showed that telmisartan was noninferior to benazepril and produced a reduction in the urinary protein to creatinine ratio that was significant at all time points (7, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 days) whereas the change for benazepril was not significant (Sent et al. 2015 J Vet Intern Med 29:1479. doi: 10.1111/jvim.13639).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The management of feline CKD recommended by IRIS emphasizes control of hypertension in stage 1 disease by the CCB amlodipine or the ARB telmisartan (http://www.iris-kidney.com/pdf/IRIS_CAT_Treatment_Recommendations_2019.pdf). Use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers is contraindicated in the setting of dehydration or hypovolemia. Cats that show urinary protein loss and low plasma protein levels may be at risk for thrombosis as in dogs, although there is relatively little published literature to support this. Cats in stage 2 should be managed as in stage 1, but if proteinuria is present, a renal diet should be initiated. If plasma phosphate levels remain intractably high, phosphate binders should be administered. In stage 3 a renal diet should always be prescribed, and phosphate binders may be needed. Metabolic acidosis should be managed with bicarbonate or potassium citrate as in dogs. Anti-emetics and appetite stimulants such as mirtazapine may be required. Intravenous fluids may be needed to control dehydration. Treatment of anemia with erythropoietin may be required. In stage 4 disease a feeding tube may be necessary, as well as routine administration of intravenous fluids. Dialysis or renal transplantation can be considered.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">Heart Failure</heading><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Heart failure is a syndrome with diverse etiologies resulting in a common manifestation. Heart failure can develop following many conditions or events, for example following chronic adrenergic stimulation, or as a result of genetic factors, as a consequence of infection by cardiotropic viruses, as a manifestation of advanced trypanosomal disease, as an outcome of irreversible ischemic damage, such as follows a myocardial infarction, as a result of deterioration of function of the mitral or aortic valve, as a result of autoimmune disease, such as an autoimmune myocarditis, or as a result of poorly understood spontaneous syndromes, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The organismic consequences of a failing heart are for the most part similar. The inability to supply an appropriate pressure differential across the vasculature results in a fluctuating peripheral edema and a poor tissue perfusion that has consequences for both support of vital organs and resistance to infection. Limitation of the ability both to appropriately perfuse the lung and to distribute the oxygenated blood supply to other organs results in a chronic hypoxia that must be managed by provision of air enriched in oxygen, or even to 100% oxygen in severe cases. The peripheral edema increases the back pressure on the heart, taxing it further and leading to or exacerbating pre-existing hypertension. In many cases, the constant strain on the heart causes an adaptive hypertrophic response but the enlarged heart does not have a commensurately improved performance, and the overall vitality of the organism dwindles. Secondary adverse cardiovascular outcomes, such as myocardial infarct, atrial and/or ventricular fibrillation and stroke are common, and the risk of cardiovascular death is greatly elevated.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In humans the accumulation of peripheral interstitial fluid in heart failure is managed therapeutically with diuretics, particularly members of the loop diuretic class, which block the Na&#x2014;K&#x2014;Cl cotransporter 2 (NKCC2) expressed in the kidney in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. NKCC2 cotransports one Na<sup>+</sup>, one K<sup>+</sup> and 2 Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> ions in an electroneutral reabsorption of critical filtrate electrolytes. It is the most important transporter for the reabsorption of sodium ions. Management of exacerbations of heart failure in humans is typically carried out by intravenous infusion of loop diuretics. The most widely used loop diuretic in the US is furosemide, whereas torsemide is more frequently prescribed in the EU. Bumetanide is another commonly prescribed loop diuretic.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Other medications typically prescribed for heart failure in humans include RAS inhibitors, which predominantly consist of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, which respectively prevent the formation of angiotensin II and block its effect on angiotensin II receptor 1. These medications reduce blood pressure and are renoprotective, and have been shown to provide a survival benefit in heart failure.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Another common class of medication that is often co-prescribed in heart failure is a &#x3b2;-adrenergic receptor blocker, usually a &#x3b2;<sub>1</sub>-selective agent such as atenolol or metoprolol or the mixed &#x3b2; and &#x3b1; receptor antagonist carvedilol. These medications protect against exacerbation of heart failure caused by chronic adrenergic stimulation. The latter can be caused by sympathetic nervous system adaptive responses to low cardiac output that are ultimately destructive as they increasingly tax the failing heart.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The body also mobilizes endogenous compensatory mechanisms in an attempt to effect sodium homeostasis. Typically, in advanced disease the plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide is greatly increased. As its name suggests, atrial natriuretic peptide is a peptide hormone produced predominantly in the right atrium of the heart that increases the secretion of sodium by the kidneys. It is induced by stress in the atrial wall resulting from inadequate ventricular outflow and/or back pressure on the atrium and has effects at multiple locations in the kidneys by multiple mechanisms, including actions on NKCC2.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Because elimination of sodium ions is central to the homeostatic response to heart failure, drugs that produce natriuresis are especially important for the management of heart failure. Because reuptake of glucose by SGLT family transporters is accompanied by cotransport of sodium ions, SGLT inhibitors allow both glucose and sodium to remain in the tubular filtrate and thus affect sodium balance in the nephron.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Recently it has been demonstrated that the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin improves survival in human trial participants with heart failure and diabetes (Wiviott et al., 2019, N Engl J Med 380:347; doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1812389) or with heart failure with and without diabetes (McMurray et al., 2019, N Engl J Med; doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1911303). In the latter study a treatment effect of similar magnitude could be observed whether the subjects had diabetes or not. The protective effect of SGLT2 inhibition in heart failure appears to be a class effect, as it has been demonstrated in humans for canagliflozin and empagliflozin as well.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Heart failure in humans is often classified by the New York Heart Association scale, which has four levels of severity, I through IV, with level I representing health or minimal disease. This scale is often referenced in veterinary medicine, with the following interpretations: an animal with modified New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II heart failure has fatigue, shortness of breath, coughing, etc., apparent when ordinary exercise is exceeded; an animal with modified NYHA Class III heart failure is comfortable at rest, but exercise capacity is minimal; and an animal with modified NYHA Class IV heart failure has no capacity for exercise and disabling clinical signs are present even at rest.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">Canine Heart Failure</heading><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Canine heart failure (Beaumier et al., 2018, J Vet Intern Med 32: 944; doi: 10.1111/jvim.15126) is most frequently caused by mitral valve disease, which is also common in humans. The mitral valve lies between the left atrium and left ventricle and prevents backflow from the ventricle into the atrium when the ventricle contracts. The most common form of mitral valve disease in dogs and humans is a chronic condition called myxomatous degeneration, in which the valve annulus becomes stretched and the chordae, the connective tissue structures holding the valve leaflets in place, become elongated. The leaflets themselves are often thickened, and loss of valvular integrity results in prolapse on systole (ventricular contraction) which, with increasing disease severity, results in mitral regurgitation, or backflow of blood into the left atrium. If the mitral valve is compromised to the point of regurgitation, the cardiac output per stroke decreases. The fraction of blood in the ventricle that enters the aorta upon systole is known as the ejection fraction. A reduced ejection fraction is a common characteristic of heart failure, although forms of heart failure in humans with preserved ejection fraction are frequently observed clinically.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Dogs in heart failure typically exhibit pulmonary edema and varying degrees of skeletal muscle loss that in its most severe manifestation is a form of cachexia, a life-threatening starvation-like syndrome characterized by extreme muscle wasting. In one series of 54 dogs in advanced heart failure, median survival was 281 days and at the time of the diagnosis of stage D disease (the most severe), 64% of the animals exhibited cachexia (Beaumier et al., op. cit.). Dogs receiving elevated doses of furosemide fared better than dogs receiving lower doses in this study.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Renal functional decline reflected by increased BUN is a common comorbidity of canine heart failure, and can limit the maximum dose of some medications that can be employed.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Canine heart failure is usually managed with furosemide combined with an ACE inhibitor (frequently enalapril or benazepril), pimobendan (a potentiator of myocardial contraction that also causes peripheral vasodilation), and sometimes spironolactone (a potassium-sparing diuretic that also protects against aldosterone-mediated cardiac fibrosis).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Pimobendan has been shown to extend the survival of dogs with stage C heart failure compared to benazepril in a single blind study (H&#xe4;ggstr&#xf6;m et al., 2008, J Vet Intern Med 22:1124; doi: 10.1111/j.1939-1676.2008.0150.x). The primary endpoint was a composite of either cardiac death, euthanasia for heart failure, or a treatment failure causing the investigator to remove the dog from the trial. The latter could be prompted by any of the following: persistent dyspnea, progressive ascites, severe cardiac cachexia, or severe exercise intolerance (attributable to a cardiac cause), despite receiving or failing to tolerate a diuretic dosage of furosemide (12 mg kg<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>day<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) and spironolactone (6 mg kg<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>day<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). The median survival was 267 days for dogs assigned to the pimobendan group and 140 days for dogs assigned to the benazepril group, with a hazard ratio of 0.688, 95% CI 0.516 to 0.916, p=0.0099.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Pimobendan has also been shown to extend the survival of dogs with stage B heart failure compared to placebo in a much longer study (Boswood et al., 2016, J Vet Intern Med 30:176; doi: 10.1111/jvim.14586) that had a composite primary endpoint of the onset of congestive heart failure (CHF), cardiac-related death, or euthanasia. In the pimobendan cohort the median time to the primary endpoint was 1228 days (95% CI: 856-NA), whereas the median time to primary endpoint was 766 days (95% CI: 667-875) in the placebo group (p=0.0038). The hazard ratio for the pimobendan group was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.47-0.87) compared with the placebo group.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">Feline Heart Failure</heading><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Feline heart failure is usually the result of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a condition in cats that is very similar to the analogous condition in humans, but that has a much higher prevalence in cats, affecting 10-15% of the population (Freeman et al., 2017, Cardiol Res 8:139; doi: 10.14740/cr578w). Feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is often asymptomatic, but can have severe consequences. The signs of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are sudden death, syncope (abrupt loss of consciousness), congestive heart failure and aortic thromboembolism (clot formation in the aorta). After diagnosis, most cats die of heart failure, embolism or sudden death. As in dogs, cachexia is a common comorbidity of heart failure in cats.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Management of symptomatic feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is similar to that of canine heart failure, with furosemide and RAS inhibitors (usually enalapril or benazepril) frequently recommended. However, a recent report of a prospective, randomized blinded study of the ACE inhibitor benazepril in 151 client-owned cats with heart disease confirmed by echocardiography showed no benefit for the primary endpoint of treatment failure (King et al., 2019, J Vet Intern Med; doi: 10.1111/jvim.15572). Anti-platelet agents such as aspirin or clopidogrel are often prescribed to reduce the risk of aortic thromboembolism. Pimobendan, although not approved for use in cats, is often mentioned in veterinary publications on feline heart failure, together with digoxin, another positive inotrope (agent that increases the strength of heart contractions). As in the management of canine disease, spironolactone is also a frequently prescribed medication.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="2">Hypertension</heading><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Hypertension is a widespread but poorly understood disease. The vast majority of human hypertension has no known cause and is referred to as primary or essential hypertension. Essential hypertension is often observed in the setting of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, which is associated with changes to the arteries that result in stiffening and decreased compliance that are widely believed to contribute to the severity and rate of progression of the disease but a direct demonstration that atherosclerosis causes hypertension has not been made. Inadequately treated hypertension has one of the largest estimated adverse effects on human longevity because of the prevalence of the condition.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The current understanding of canine and feline hypertension is incomplete. As in humans the canine or feline disease is observed in the setting of other conditions, such as CKD or heart failure, but establishing causation can be challenging. The kidney, for example, is both a target of the adverse effects of hypertension on organ systems as well as a critical organ for the maintenance of blood pressure. Dysregulation of fluid balance in heart failure increases peripheral load and taxes the failing heart, which must work harder, exacerbating the hypertension.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="1">II.

By therapeutic benefit is meant amelioration of the underlying disorder being treated. Also, a therapeutic benefit is achieved with the amelioration of one or more of the physiological symptoms associated with the underlying disorder such that an improvement is observed in the patient, notwithstanding that the patient may still be afflicted with the underlying disorder.

Detailed Description of Embodiments</heading><p id="p-0115" num="0114">As mentioned above, the current application is drawn to the discovery that despite their initial development for the use in treating metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes, sodium-glucose linked transporter (SGLT) inhibitors can be used in the management of hypertension, renal disease (e.g., chronic kidney disease) or heart failure in companion animals (in particular, felines and canines).</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">A. Sodium-Glucose Linked Transporter (SGLT) Inhibitors</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">A variety of compounds that inhibit a sodium-dependent glucose transporter (SGLT) as well as prodrugs thereof are known in the art, each of which can be used in the presently described methods.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">SGLT inhibitors have been or are being developed to treat human metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes and allied conditions. Among them are atigliflozin, bexagliflozin, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, enavogliflozin, ertugliflozin, henagliflozin, ipragliflozin, janagliflozin, licogliflozin, luseogliflozin, mizagliflozin, remogliflozin, sergliflozin, sotagliflozin, tianagliflozin and tofogliflozin. In addition, velagliflozin is being developed for the management of animal forms of diabetes and related morbidities.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">SGLT inhibitors produce glucosuria but not hypoglycemia and are expected to produce changes in sodium ion balance in the renal proximal tubule that may have consequences downstream of their location in the nephron. Because the SGLT1 transporter has a 2:1 sodium ion to glucose stoichiometry for reuptake, dual inhibition of both SGLT1 and SGLT2 is expected to have greater effects on natriuresis than inhibition of SGLT2 alone. Inhibition of SGLT1 alone is not expected to produce substantial changes to tubular electrolyte homeostasis because humans lacking SGLT1 usually do not exhibit glucosuria, indicating that SGLT2 can nearly completely compensate for a loss of SGLT1.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">Many of the SGLT inhibitors are selective for human SGLT2 compared to human SGLT1. Others have lower selectivity, such as licogliflozin or sotagliflozin, and some are more active against SGLT1 than SGLT2, such as mizagliflozin. Selectivity can be species-dependent, so that high selectivity for human SGLT2 does not necessarily indicate high selectivity for, for example, cat or dog SGLT2. And depending on the disease indication a greater or lesser degree of inhibition of one or the other SGLT protein may be desirable.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">In some embodiments, a compound that

More particularly, compounds or prodrugs that inhibit an SGLT can be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions, together or separately, by formulation with appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents, and can be formulated into preparations in solid, semi-solid, liquid or gaseous forms, such as tablets, capsules, pills, powders, granules, dragees, gels, slurries, ointments, solutions, suppositories, injections, inhalants and aerosols. As such, administration of a compound of the present disclosure can be achieved in various ways, including oral, buccal, parenteral, intravenous, intradermal (e.g., subcutaneous, intramuscular), transdermal, etc., administration.</p><p id="p-0308" num="0280">As recognized in the art, drugs for companion animals can be administered by a variety of means and in a variety of dosage forms. In some embodiments, oral dosage forms, such as oral liquid dosage forms, oral semi-solid dosage forms and oral solid dosage forms, including medicated foods and dosage forms are used. Because of the wide range in body masses of cats and dogs, oral liquid or semi-solid dosage forms that readily permit dosage adjustment for the mass of the animal are contemplated in the current disclosure.</p><p id="p-0309" num="0281">Oral liquid dosage forms are often provided as a bottle plus a dispensing syringe or a calibrated dropper or if the medication is to be dispensed dropwise the bottle assembly may contain a narrow apical orifice and a flexible bottom portion allowing the contents to be expelled in drops by squeezing when the bottle is inverted.</p><p id="p-0310" num="0282">Oral liquid dosage forms can be clear solutions, emulsions or suspensions, such as colloidal suspensions or coarse suspensions. They are often predominantly aqueous but may contain medically acceptable co-solvents such as ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerol or polyethylene glycols (also called PEGs or macrogols) of low molecular weight, such as PEG 200, PEG 300 or PEG 400. Oral liquid dosage forms may also be based on shelf-stable edible oils, such as canola, coconut, corn, cottonseed, olive, palm, peanut, safflower, sesame or sunflower oil, or mixtures thereof, or mixtures of glycerol or propylene glycol esterified with short or medium chain alkanoic acids with appropriately low melting points to exhibit liquefaction at room temperature. Non-metabolizable oils such as mineral oil may also be used but are less common bases for oral liquid formulations.</p><p id="p-0311" num="0283">Oral liquid dosage forms containing ethanol are often referred to as elixirs and those containing sugars are often referred to as syrups. Oils and related nonaqueous solvents may be dispersed as emulsions in water, for example oil-in-water emulsions, or with the phases reversed, as water-in-oil emulsions. Oral liquid dosage forms may contain one or more solubilizers or surfactants such as ionic or nonionic detergents, as well as dispersants, thickening agents, emulsion or suspension stabilizers and agents to improve palatability (palatants, for example sodium acid pyrophosphate for feline dosage forms) or acceptability to the animal being treated, such as flavoring agents or sweeteners. Oral liquid dosage forms may also contain stability-promoting excipients such as buffers, anti-oxidants, and preservatives or anti-microbial agents. They may also be colored to provide a distinguishing characteristic to avoid inadvertent dosing with an inappropriate agent.</p><p id="p-0312" num="0284">Pharmaceutically acceptable solubilizers and surfactants are well-known in the art and include ionic detergents such as ammonium or sodium lauryl (dodecyl) sulfate or sodium lauryl sulfosuccinate or sodium lauryl sulfoacetate or sodium lauroyl sarcosinate or cocobetaine. Other surfactants include nonionic detergents such as esterified sugars or dehydrated sugar mixtures such as sorbitan monoesters in the stearate, oleate, palmitate or laurate forms or oleate sesquiesters, that are frequently used to produce water-in-oil or oil-in-water emulsions, or bearing an additional pendant polyethoxyethanol side chain such as PEG-20 sorbitan isostearate or PEG-40 sorbitan diisostearate that are often used as emulsifiers, similar structures in which sorbitan is replaced by glycerol or propylene glycol, such as glyceryl stearate/PEG stearate, glyceryl stearate/PEG-100 stearate, lauroyl PEG-32 glycerides, PEG 6-32 stearate/glycol stearate, PEG-120 glyceryl stearate or various sugar ethers or esters such as PEG-120 methyl glucose dioleate, PEG-20 methyl glucose sesquistearate, alkanoyl glucosides or maltosides, fatty esters of polyethylene glycols such as PEG-5 oleate or stearate, or PEG-40 castor oil, or block copolymers of polypropylene glycol and polyethylene glycol, such as poloxamers. Nonionic detergents based octylphenoxy polyethoxyethanol, such as the octoxynols, bearing various lengths of the polyethylene glycol joined as an ether linkage to octylphenol are well-known in the art.</p><p id="p-0313" num="0285">Various means to gauge the acceptability of an oral liquid dosage form to a dog or cat are well known in the art and include administration of the candidate dosage form to a diverse test population and determining the acceptability for example using various scoring systems based on behavioral responses to the test article, such as evasive or aversive responses, hypersalivation, foaming, spitting, vomiting or fractious behavior.</p><p id="p-0314" num="0286">Bexagliflozin is well-tolerated by felines and canines and does not seem to have an objectionable flavor for animals of either species. Taste masking to prevent aversive responses to bexagliflozin itself is rarely necessary but may be helpful to promote acceptance of excipients in the formulation. Felines lack sweet taste receptors and sweeteners are less important for feline oral liquid dosage forms. Bexagliflozin has a solubility in water at 25&#xb0; C. of approximately 0.5 mg mL<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, but is more soluble in ethanol, propylene glycol and PEGs.</p><heading id="h-0099" level="1">IV.

It has been recognized in human clinical practice that an undesirable side effect of PPAR-&#x3b3; agonists of the thiazolidinedione class is fluid retention and edema, which limits their use in patients with congestive heart failure. The mechanism of action of the thiazolidinediones is believed to be through stimulation of expression of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in the kidney, resulting in an increased uptake of sodium ions from the distal tubule. Sodium retention and the associated expansion of extracellular fluid volume are characteristic features of congestive heart failure in multiple species. ENaC blockers such as amiloride have been shown to prevent PPAR-&#x3b3;-mediated fluid retention in mice (Guan et al., 2005, Nat Med 11:861; doi: 10.1038/nm1278) and rats (Chen et al., 2005, J Pharmacol Exp Ther 2312:718; doi: 10.1124/jpet.104.074088).</p><p id="p-0317" num="0289">A study was undertaken to assess the ability of bexagliflozin delivered in drinking water for 7 days to prevent PPAR-&#x3b3; agonist-mediated plasma expansion in Sprague-Dawley rats. The sodium channel blocker amiloride was delivered in drinking water to a third group of rats as a comparator. Plasma expansion was measured by hematocrit.</p><p id="p-0318" num="0290">On day 1, rats were weighed and received an admixed diet (ad lib) containing 0.03% pioglitazone in place of standard chow. Food weight was recorded to measure consumption over the course of the experiment. Rats were also given drinking water containing bexagliflozin or amiloride at the appropriate concentrations. Full bottles were pre-weighed and the weights recorded to allow consumption to be measured over the course of the experiment.</p><p id="p-0319" num="0291">On days 1 and 7, rats were warmed using a heating pad and lightly anesthetized using isoflurane. Using a sterile scalpel blade, a small tail nick was made on the distal one third of the tail. Blood was collected in a heparinized microcapillary tube sealed with putty at one end and stored on ice until centrifugation (5000 rpm, 5 min). Plasma volume was determined using a microhematocrit capillary tube reader card.</p><p id="p-0320" num="0292">On day 7, rats, food and water bottles were again weighed and recorded and hematocrits were determined using blood collected by a tail nick.</p><p id="p-0321" num="0293">Significant main effects of time (F<sub>(1,27)</sub>=64.9; p&#x3c;0.0001) and treatment (F<sub>(2,27)</sub>=3.73; p=0.037), as well as a significant interaction (F<sub>(2,27)</sub>=3.51; p=0.044) were revealed by 2-way ANOVA. Day 1 mean plasma volumes were similar (approximately 53% of blood volume) among the treatment groups (F<sub>(2,27)</sub>=0.45; p=0.64). However, after consuming a pioglitazone-containing diet for 7 days, plasma volumes were significantly different (F<sub>(2,27)</sub>=7.32; p=0.003), with bexagliflozin-treated rats displaying significantly less plasma expansion than vehicle treated rats (p&#x3c;0.01) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and Table 1). Although day 7 plasma volumes were significantly increased compared to day 1 plasma volumes in rats receiving vehicle or amiloride (p&#x3c;0.001), plasma expansion in bexagliflozin treated rats did not reach significance (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and Table 1). Analysis of the change in plasma volume resulted in similar results (F<sub>(2,27)</sub>=3.51; p&#x3c;0.044) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and Table 1). Pair-wise comparisons of the change in volume were also similar to those from the day 7 analyses, as bexagliflozin-treated rats displayed significantly less plasma expansion than vehicle-treated rats (p&#x3c;0.05).</p><p id="p-0322" num="0294">Significant main effects of time (F<sub>(1,27)</sub>=303.8; p&#x3c;0.0001) and treatment (F<sub>(2,27)</sub>=18.6; p&#x3c;0.0001), as well as a significant interaction (F<sub>(2,27)</sub>=18.6; p&#x3c;0.0001) were revealed by the 2-way ANOVA of the body mass gain. Animals were assigned to treatment groups stratified by body mass, and body mass gains were expressed as gains from day 1 values. Mass gain was observed over the course of the experiment, with a significant difference among day 7 group means expressed as percent mass gain (F<sub>(2,27)</sub>=18.6; p&#x3c;0.0001; Table 2). All rats gained significant mass over the 7 days of treatment (p&#x3c;0.0001). However, those receiving bexagliflozin gained significantly less mass than those receiving vehicle; 4.8% gain compared to 12.3% gain (p&#x3c;0.01). Analysis of the change in mass resulted in similar test statistic results (F<sub>(2,27)</sub>=18.6; p&#x3c;0.0001; Table 2). Pair-wise comparisons were also similar to those from the day 7 analyses, as bexagliflozin-treated rats displayed significantly less mass gain than untreated rats (p&#x2264;0.01). The increase in body mass in the untreated rats is explicable as a combination of the normal gain of a growing rat and the extracellular fluid volume expansion promoted by pioglitazone. The lower mass exhibited by bexagliflozin-treated rats is consistent with the effects observed on plasma volume, although effects on weight gain due to caloric wasting as a result of glucosuria may also have been present.</p><p id="p-0323" num="0295">However, daily food consumption was similar between treatment groups with slightly lower consumption observed in the amiloride treated rats and slightly higher consumption observed in the bexagliflozin treated rats, resulting in a significant overall test statistic (F<sub>(2,27)</sub>=3.94; p=0.032). Neither treatment group was found to consume a significantly different amount of food than vehicle treated rats (Table 3). As a result, animals received similar levels of pioglitazone exposure (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), with the bexagliflozin cohort receiving the highest dose. Thus, a reduction in plasma volume expansion was detected despite a higher dose of pioglitazone.</p><p id="p-0324" num="0296">Daily water consumption was significantly different between treatment groups over the 7 days of the experiment (F<sub>(2,27)</sub>=53.8; p&#x3c;0.0001). This was attributed to the previously recognized tendency of bexagliflozin to increase water consumption to compensate for diuresis. The intergroup difference was significant between the bexagliflozin and control cohorts (p&#x2264;0.01; Table 4). Daily doses of bexagliflozin and amiloride were about 50% higher than targeted, resulting in approximately 4.5 mg kg<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>day<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>bexagliflozin and 1.5 mg kg<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>day<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>amiloride (Table 4).</p><p id="p-0325" num="0297">The results of this experiment indicate that bexagliflozin substantially attenuates pioglitazone-mediated plasma expansion. The intended positive control, amiloride, was markedly less effective than bexagliflozin and did not produce the anticipated effect. These data support the utility of bexagliflozin for the management of heart failure in dogs and cats.</p><p id="p-0326" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Effects of Bexagliflozin or Amiloride on Plasma Volume</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="28pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Group</entry><entry>Control</entry><entry>Bexagliflozin</entry><entry>Amiloride</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Day 1</entry><entry>53.5 &#xb1;

Groups of four purpose-bred beagles per cohort were administered ascending doses of bexagliflozin in the form of a proline co-crystal consisting of two moles of L-proline for every mole of bexagliflozin. The co-crystal was dissolved in 10% PEG400 and administered by oral gavage to dogs that had been fasted overnight. Control dogs were administered 10% PEG400. One hour after dosing, glucose solution (2 g kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, 5 ml kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) was administered by gavage. Serum glucose concentrations were quantitated by an automated clinical chemistry analyzer for samples collected before dosing, before glucose challenge, and 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after glucose challenge. Urine was collected from 0 to 4 h, 4 to 8 h and 8 to 24 h after dosing for electrolyte analyses (Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and glucose measurement. Whole blood samples of approximately 500 &#x3bc;L were collected from the cephalic vein 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h after dosing for pharmacokinetic analysis. Doses ranged in strength from 0.02 to 2.0 mg kg<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>bexagliflozin.</p><p id="p-0331" num="0299">Bexagliflozin was rapidly absorbed with a T<sub>max </sub>of approximately 0.5 h. C<sub>max </sub>and AUC were roughly dose proportional over the entire dosing range and the elimination half-life ranged from 1.67 to 5.23 h (Table 5 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). Only modest changes in serum glucose concentration were seen around the time of administration of glucose by gavage (Table 6), and presumably reflect bexagliflozin blockade of enteric uptake of glucose, assumed to be an effect on SGLT1.</p><p id="p-0332" num="0300">A good correlation was seen between glucosuria and exposure to bexagliflozin and the urinary glucose excretion was fit well to the dose by a simple logistic model with an ED<sub>50 </sub>of 0.116 mg kg<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and an E<sub>max </sub>of 24.69 g of glucose in 24 h (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). Urine output increased in the treatment group, consistent with an osmotic diuresis or with a role for the inhibited transporters in water reuptake in the proximal tubule. Trends toward increased urinary electrolyte excretion were seen in the treatment group. Table 7 shows that the increase in urine volume and urine Na<sup>+</sup> content was statistically significant for dogs in the highest dose group compared to dogs in the vehicle group. There was no significant change in food consumption in the treatment group in comparison with the control. A trend toward higher water consumption was observed in the treatment group but did not reach statistical significance.</p><p id="p-0333" num="0301">Although many factors influence the variation in pharmacological activity of compounds administered to experimental animals, the practical import of the identification of the potent effect of bexagliflozin on dogs can be understood in relation to the previously characterized activity of the compound in cats. Cats administered bexagliflozin tablets of varying strengths have been found to respond with a urinary glucose excretion that is well-described by a simple logistic model with an ED<sub>50 </sub>of approximately 0.5 mg kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, which makes bexagliflozin approximately 4 times more potent by ED<sub>50 </sub>in dogs than in cats. The average mass of the dogs in the study above was 5.84 kg, leading to a maximum urinary glucose excretion of 4.23 g glucose per kg of body mass. Comparable studies of healthy cats have produced an E<sub>max </sub>of 2.21 g of glucose per kg of body mass, indicating that bexagliflozin has a more profound effect on canine glucose disposition than on feline disposition. Inasmuch as the effects on renal physiology are mediated at the level of the nephron, it is clear that canine and feline responses to bexagliflozin are highly similar and effects found in cats are likely to be replicated in dogs.

Bexagliflozin causes a profound loss of glucose in dogs and as such would be expected to exacerbate the clinical condition of dogs with heart failure. Hence, it is counterintuitive that bexagliflozin will reduce the progression of the clinical condition of dogs in this state, and especially unexpected that bexagliflozin will promote an improvement in musculature in some animals, despite the wasting influence typically evidenced in its most severe form as a heart failure-related cachexia.</p><heading id="h-0102" level="1">Example 3: Bexagliflozin Effects on Measures of Renal Health in Cats with Diabetes</heading><p id="p-0338" num="0303">In studies exploring the utility of bexagliflozin for the management of feline diabetes, animals with diabetes were presented for veterinary care and were, if eligible according to the enrollment criteria, with their owners' consent entered into one or more studies investigating the effects of bexagliflozin on glycemic control and clinical signs of hyperglycemia. Venous blood specimens were collected at regular intervals and analyzed for standard parameters of interest for routine clinical care, including creatinine, BUN and SDMA. Owners were advised to provide a diet low in carbohydrates as an element of the disease management plan. An important consequence of the shift to a low carbohydrate diet is the increase in dietary protein (contributing to BUN) and specifically dietary muscle-derived protein (contributing to creatinine).</p><p id="p-0339" num="0304"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> show the measured concentrations of creatinine, BUN and SDMA in cats as a function of time in the study. The initial measurement precedes the administration of bexagliflozin and the change in diet. Considerable variation can be seen in the individual values.</p><p id="p-0340" num="0305">To identify treatment-related trends, the data for each of the three analytes were analyzed by a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis of covariance, with cat as a categorical (class) effect and day of measurement and initial value at the baseline visit as continuous covariates. Because the diets of many of the animals were changed at the baseline visit, and the effects of diet on creatinine and BUN are generally thought to be prompt, the analysis considered only changes in analyte values over the non-baseline visit days.</p><p id="p-0341" num="0306">The model-adjusted estimate for the population mean creatinine concentration was 1.367 mg dL<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, with an estimated coefficient for day of measurement of 0.000928.

Day of measurement was not a significant effect, p=0.5338.</p><p id="p-0344" num="0309">As discussed above, creatinine, BUN and SDMA are related measures of renal health for which increasing concentration signifies a dwindling renal function. It is therefore unexpected that the trends diverge, with creatinine increasing, and BUN and SDMA decreasing.</p><p id="p-0345" num="0310">The key to reconciling this apparent discrepancy lies in other factors that influence creatinine concentration that are consequences of the effective management of diabetes with bexagliflozin.</p><p id="p-0346" num="0311">Cats presented by owners to veterinarians for diabetes are often in a state of advanced disease and occasionally moribund. Weight loss despite an apparently ravenous appetite is frequently observed, and is one of the well-recognized symptoms of the disease, which is also marked by polydipsia (excessive drinking), polyphagia (excessive food consumption) and polyuria (excessive urination). The beneficial effects of bexagliflozin for promoting weight gain and reducing the clinical signs of hyperglycemia have been disclosed in U.S. Patent Application No. 62/818,589.</p><p id="p-0347" num="0312">Assessments by both owners and veterinarians of correlative measures of cat vitality were also collected over the course of various studies. Some of the relevant measures for this analysis are the subjective impressions of cat musculature, solicited from both owners and veterinarians, and owner views of cat overall activity as well as leaping ability. The rating instrument was a 4-point scale with 0=excellent, 1=good, 2=fair and 3=poor. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> show that both veterinarians and owners, respectively considered that the musculature of study cats had improved, and the effect was statistically significant (p-values are shown in a figure inset). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> show that owners considered that their cats were more active and had better leaping ability. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows that the mean cat weight increased, and that the effect was highly significant (the confidence intervals show the population variation, whereas the effect for individual cats relative to their weights at study entry was highly significant).</p><p id="p-0348" num="0313">Together, these data provide a picture of increasing vitality among the enrolled cats that is accompanied by an increase in weight and musculature. Hence, in this context it can be appreciated that increasing musculature and activity can account for an increase in creatinine even when broader and more sensitive indicators of renal dysfunction point to improvements in health. Even though creatinine is often the reference measurement for renal assessments, the more sensitive and putatively more specific SDMA assay did not corroborate the creatinine predictions.</p><heading id="h-0103" level="1">Example 4: Bexagliflozin Effects on Measures of Cardiac Health in Dogs and Cats with Heart Failure</heading><p id="p-0349" num="0314">The natriuretic and diuretic actions of bexagliflozin will benefit dogs and cats with heart failure by providing relief from the systemic adverse consequences of hypervolemia and fluid retention, as demonstrated by the prevention of pioglitazone-mediated fluid retention in rats. In addition, bexagliflozin can improve the overall health and vitality of the animal, attenuating or even reversing the deleterious consequences of chronic heart overload on skeletal muscle mass and fitness.</p><heading id="h-0104" level="1">Example 5: Bexagliflozin Treatment of Dogs with Heart Failure</heading><p id="p-0350" num="0315">Bexagliflozin can be administered to dogs with heart failure as an oral solution, such as a flavored oral solution, or as a combination of tablets and/or half-tablets to allow delivery of a dose adjusted for body mass, such 50 &#x3bc;g kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, 100 &#x3bc;g kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, 200 &#x3bc;g kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, 400 &#x3bc;g kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, 800 &#x3bc;g kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, 1600 &#x3bc;g kg<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>or 3200 &#x3bc;g kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. These doses will produce 30%, 46%, 63%, 77%, 87%, 93%, 96% or 98% of the maximum pharmacodynamic effect based on the results observed in beagle dogs. Doses may be adjusted as necessary to accommodate the needs of the dog, for example reduced if deleterious effects such as diarrhea or vomiting are observed, or increased if the desired pharmacological effect has not been reached. Dosage may be divided, for example into two equal portions to be administered approximately 12 h apart. A dose of approximately 1 mg kg<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>delivered once daily will produce approximately 90% of the maximum pharmacological effect and is likely to represent a frequently prescribed dosage level for dogs with heart failure. Dogs exposed to this amount of bexagliflozin do not show signs of enteric inhibition of SGLT1, for example as manifested by diarrhea or loose stools, although they may initially consume more water and tend to eat more than usual to compensate for the loss of fluid and calories as a result of the glucosuria. Supplementation of the diet may be necessary to promote the maximum vitality of the dog. Bexagliflozin-treated dogs will show increased activity, for example, more spontaneous activity and more willingness to engage with their owners in play. They will need to urinate more and should be provided with an ample supply of clean water to replenish their extracellular volume once the excess volume has been shed. Dogs with heart failure managed by bexagliflozin will experience fewer episodes of volume expansion requiring hospitalization or intensive intervention to alleviate pulmonary edema and its clinical signs. Dogs with heart failure managed by bexagliflozin will, compared to dogs not so managed, experience a longer time to one or more of the following: (i) cardiac death, (ii) euthanasia for heart failure or (iii) evidence of treatment failure such as persistent dyspnea, progressive ascites, severe cardiac cachexia, or severe exercise intolerance despite receiving or failing to tolerate a diuretic dosage of furosemide (12 mg kg<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>day<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) and spironolactone (6 mg kg<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>day<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). Owner mean ratings of dog musculature will, on average, improve as a result of the salutary effects of bexagliflozin, even though bexagliflozin promotes caloric wasting and would be anticipated to result in an exacerbation of cardiac cachexia and its prodromes. Bexagliflozin will be useful for the management of the signs of mild, moderate, or severe (modified NYHA Class II, III, or IV) congestive heart failure in dogs due to atrioventricular valvular insufficiency or dilated cardiomyopathy. Bexagliflozin can be dosed with other medications for the management of heart failure, such as pimobendan, furosemide, RAS blocking agents and spironolactone.</p><heading id="h-0105" level="1">Example 6: Bexagliflozin Treatment of Cats with Heart Failure</heading><p id="p-0351" num="0316">Bexagliflozin can be administered to cats with heart failure as an oral solid dosage form, such as a tablet, or as an oral solution, such as a flavored oral solution, to allow delivery of a dose adjusted for body mass, such 200 &#x3bc;g kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, 400 &#x3bc;g kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, 800 &#x3bc;g kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, 1600 &#x3bc;g kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, 3200 &#x3bc;g kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, 6400 &#x3bc;g kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, 12800 &#x3bc;g kg<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>or 25600 &#x3bc;g kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. These doses will produce 28%, 44%, 61%, 76%, 86%, 93%, 96% or 98% of the maximum pharmacodynamic effect based on the results observed in purpose-bred cats. Doses may be adjusted as necessary to accommodate the needs of the cat, for example, reduced if deleterious effects such as diarrhea or vomiting are observed, or increased if the desired pharmacological effect has not been reached. A dose of 2.5 mg kg<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>to 5 mg kg<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>delivered once daily will produce approximately 83% to 91% of the maximum pharmacological effect and is likely to represent a frequently prescribed dosage range for cats with heart failure. Dosage may be divided, for example, into two equal portions to be administered approximately 12 h apart. Alternatively, a single dosage strength of 15 mg, for example, a tablet containing 15 mg of bexagliflozin, can be administered to a cat without adjustment for body mass. The fixed dosage can also be divided into equal portions for b.i.d. dosing if desired. Cats exposed to this amount of bexagliflozin can occasionally show signs of enteric inhibition of SGLT1, for example, as manifested by diarrhea or loose stools, for which a diet containing a higher proportion of metabolizable energy in the form of protein or fat may be advised. Diarrhea and loose stools are generally dependent on carbohydrate in the diet and low-carbohydrate diets are preferred if enteric side effects are observed. Supplementation of the diet may be necessary to promote the maximum vitality of the cat. Bexagliflozin-treated cats often show increased activity, for example, more spontaneous activity and display enhanced abilities to jump as reported by their owners. They will need to urinate more and should be provided with an ample supply of clean water to replenish their extracellular volume once the excess volume has been shed. Cats with heart failure managed by bexagliflozin will experience fewer episodes of volume expansion requiring hospitalization or intensive intervention to alleviate pulmonary edema and its clinical signs. Cats with heart failure managed by bexagliflozin will, compared to cats not so managed, experience a longer time to one or more of the following: (i) death (including euthanasia) or (ii) withdrawal of the cat from treatment because of worsening of clinical condition related to heart disease, such as a persistent and unacceptably high heart rate, a need for repeated thoracocentesis to alleviate pulmonary edema, or a ventricular arrhythmia requiring treatment. Owner mean ratings of cat musculature will, on average, improve as a result of the salutary effects of bexagliflozin, even though bexagliflozin promotes caloric wasting and would be anticipated to result in an exacerbation of cardiac cachexia and its prodromes. Bexagliflozin will be useful for the management of the signs of mild, moderate, or severe (modified NYHA Class II, 111, or IV) congestive heart failure in cats due to atrioventricular valvular insufficiency or dilated cardiomyopathy. Bexagliflozin can be dosed with other medications for the management of heart failure, such as pimobendan, furosemide, RAS blocking agents and spironolactone.</p><heading id="h-0106" level="1">Example 7: Bexagliflozin Treatment of Dogs with Chronic Kidney Disease</heading><p id="p-0352" num="0317">Bexagliflozin can be administered to dogs with chronic kidney disease as described above for the treatment of heart failure. A dose of 1 mg kg<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>will produce approximately 90% of the maximum pharmacological effect and is likely to represent a frequently prescribed dosage level for dogs with CKD. Dogs administered bexagliflozin will tolerate carbohydrate in the diet well, but reduction in the amount of carbohydrate may be necessary if persistent diarrhea or loose stools are observed. Dogs on a renal diet may need supplementation in the number of daily calories provided to accommodate the effects of the renal glucosuria. A preferred supplementation is by a mixture of edible fats and carbohydrates, as a reduced protein content is preferred. Dogs on a renal diet will still benefit from the myoprotective effects of bexagliflozin, although these may be manifest as a reduced rate of muscle loss instead of overt muscle gain. Dogs with CKD, especially dogs with proteinuria, will experience a treatment-related benefit defined as a composite of the occurrence of death (including euthanasia) or the need for administration of parenteral fluids related to renal failure. Dogs with CKD will experience a slowing in the rate of progression of proteinuria, measured by the urinary protein to creatinine ratio. Some dogs with signs of muscle loss or cachexia will gain weight as a result of the actions of bexagliflozin on renal health. Bexagliflozin will, in general, retard the advancement of CKD in dogs but is not expected to meaningfully affect the health or vitality of dogs with stage D CKD, as dogs with this degree of renal impairment may have very little renal filtration capacity and hence there is little opportunity for the palliative consequences of bexagliflozin on renal transporters to be exerted.</p><heading id="h-0107" level="1">Example 8: Bexagliflozin Treatment of Cats with Chronic Kidney Disease</heading><p id="p-0353" num="0318">Bexagliflozin can be administered to cats with chronic kidney disease as described above for the treatment of heart failure. A dose of 2.5 mg kg<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>to 5 mg kg<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>will produce approximately 83% to 91% of the maximum pharmacological effect and is likely to represent a frequently prescribed dosage range for cats with CKD. A single dosage strength of 15 mg, for example a tablet containing 15 mg of bexagliflozin, can be administered to a cat without adjustment for body mass. The fixed dosage can also be divided into equal portions for bid dosing if desired.

The hypotensive effect of bexagliflozin is mild, but the overall effects are beneficial for the health of the dog. Dogs with hypertension managed by bexagliflozin will typically lose a small amount of weight which will be beneficial if they are overweight or obese&#x2014;as is often the case for hypertensive dogs&#x2014;but will otherwise be healthy. Dogs with hypertension managed with bexagliflozin will need to have adequate water provided to accommodate their increased urine output. A supplementation of the diet may be necessary. If diarrhea or loose stools are observed, the dose can be reduced or the diet changed to provide a decreased fraction of metabolizable energy in the form of carbohydrates. Dogs will tolerate bexagliflozin well and owners will express satisfaction with the health of their dogs compared to owners of dogs whose disease is not managed by bexagliflozin.</p><heading id="h-0109" level="1">Example 10: Bexagliflozin Treatment of Cats with Hypertension</heading><p id="p-0355" num="0320">Bexagliflozin has substantial hypotensive effects in cats.
