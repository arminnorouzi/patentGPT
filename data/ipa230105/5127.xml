The samples must be prepared, appropriate test equipment must be provided, and test protocols must be strictly followed. Well trained personnel are needed for this reason.

A sample can be a small piece of a material or a complete workpiece. Foam samples include porous materials such as polymer foams, zeolites, carrier bodies for exhaust catalysts. The inner structure of the sample refers to the distribution of phase boundaries within the sample, for example the phase boundary between a void and the polymer in polymer foams. Features of the inner structure can be on different size scales depending on the sample and the resolution of the images, for example in the micro-range, i.e. 0.1 to 1000 &#x3bc;m, or on the nanoscale, i.e. 1 to 100 nm.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Material properties can be mechanical properties such as Young's modulus, elasticity, tear resistance, wear resistance, friction coefficient; thermal properties such as heat capacity, heat conductivity; electric properties such as electric conductivity or resistivity, dielectric constant; or optical properties such as transparency, refractive index, diffusivity.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A representation of the sample in the context of the present invention is a data structure containing the inner structure of the sample. The representation associates each location in the sample information about the material or a void at that location. The representation can be two-dimensional or three-dimensional, preferably three-dimensional. It is possible that the representation already exists from previous work, is received from a remote computer or a cloud, or is generated on the same computer as the steps of the method according to the present invention. Preferably, the representation is generated from images showing the inner structure of the sample. The representation can have various formats including bitmap like pixel or voxel data, point cloud, triangulated surface model such as in standard triangulation language (STL). The format of the representation has to be suitable to include information about the material and/or void.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Images of a sample can be provided in various ways. For example, they can be obtained directly from a measurement apparatus or obtained from a database containing previous measurements. Various measurements are available, for example photography, optical microscopy or electron microscopy on cut or broken samples or non-destructive methods such computer tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, sonography, or confocal microscopy. The images are usually taken from parallel planes in the sample, however the planes can also stand at an angle to each other. The distance between the planes from which the images are taken is normally not more than the largest feature of the inner structure of the sample. The number of images can vary. More images usually lead to more accurate results. However, the number of images increases the computing time, in particular if the resolution of the images is high. Therefore, it is usually best to use the lowest number of images which result in a sufficient accuracy for a certain sample. The number can range from 5 to 1000, for example 10 to 50 or 100 to 400. The resolution of the images should be high enough such that the features can be clearly recognized, but not too high so the computing time is does not become too long. Typical resolutions of images are between 10&#xd7;10 to 1024&#xd7;1024 pixels, wherein the images do not have to be quadratic, so 768&#xd7;1024 or 512&#xd7;288 pixels can be used equally well. Preferably, the images are in gray-scale or are converted into gray scale.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Preferably, prior to generating a representation from the images, the images are preprocessed in order to facilitate detection of phase boundaries. Preprocessing can include adjusting brightness, contrast, noise removal, applying thresholds or combinations thereof. Even more preferably, the preprocessing parameters yielding best results in the method according to the present invention are saved and automatically proposed to a user or directly applied to further images to be preprocessed.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Generation of a representation from images can be achieved in various ways. Most of them involve edge or surface detection or segmentation determining the respective phase boundaries. The edge detection converts 3D voxel data into 3D surface data, for example by assigning a threshold gray value to edge voxels, interpolation between voxel gray values, search for maximum gray value derivatives, mid gray value between light air voxel and dark material voxel levels, or local adaptive gray threshold. Reducing noise and artifacts as well as interpolation is subject to many publications known to the skilled person.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Preferably, the representation is generated from images by segmenting the gray-scale image by applying a threshold algorithm, thereby converting the gray-scale into an image in which each color represents one phase, i.e. a certain material or a void. For example, in a foam, the material could be white and the void black. In a composite material containing three materials, the first material could be white, the second material gray and the third material black. In some cases, the segmented image may already be sufficient for the representation. However, to reliably extract structural features from the representation, it is often useful to apply further methods. Preferably, the segmented image is subject to a distance function which assigns each pixel or voxel the distance to the nearest pixel or voxel with a different color. Preferably, after applying the distance function, a watershed algorithm is applied to identify objects such as pores, embedded particles, walls, struts, or nodes. When overflooding the watershed algorithm, it is also possible to determine the center of walls, struts and nodes.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The method according to the present invention comprises (b) extracting at least one structural feature from the representation. Structural features are all features of a sample which are directly linked to its inner structure. Structural features may be related to walls, i.e. the material in between two particles of a different material or between two pores, for example their thickness, curvature, planar expansion or moments. Structural features may also be related to struts, i.e. the material in between three particles of a different material or between three pores, for example their cross section, length, curvature, or moments. Structural features may also be related to nodes, i.e. the material in between four particles of a different material or between four pores, for example their volume, or moments. Structural features may also be related to pores or particles, for example their volume, sphericity, moments. Structural features may also be related to cells, for example their local density, moments. Structural features may also be related to a graph, such as the foam graph, for example connection of pores, walls, cells, struts and nodes.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">By evaluating these features, more complex structural features can be obtained. An example is the isolated evaluation of absolute values and their spatial distribution, such as determine gradient in strut length in a sample. Another example is the evaluation under consideration of structural features, which are often relevant in physical models, such as strut length related to size of adjacent pores. Another example is the evaluation of foam graph, such as the number of walls per pore or struts per wall.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to the present invention, the at least one structural feature comprises walls, struts, or nodes. If only one structural feature is extracted, it has to either of walls, struts, or nodes. Typically, more than one structural feature is extracted. In this case, at least one of the structural features is walls, struts, or nodes and the others can be one or more of the remaining of walls, struts, or nodes or other structural features as described above. Preferably, the structural features comprise at least two of walls, struts, or nodes, in particular the structural features comprise all, i.e. walls, struts, and nodes.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The extraction of structural features can be achieved in various ways. Suitable algorithms include watershed, distances evaluations, component analysis, local voxel evaluation, or preferably combinations thereof such as at least two of these. These methods are well available in image processing libraries, for example SciKit-image, OpenCV, SimpleCV, NumPy, SciPy, PIL/Pillow, Mahotas, ITK, GraphicsMagick or Cairo. Extracting structural features from a representation has several advantages over other methods such as a measurement method: It is more flexible as it can extract very different features otherwise only accessible by different measurement methods. In many cases, it is more accurate as it tends to be less susceptible to artifacts or disturbing sources.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The method according to the present invention comprises (c) providing the at least one structural feature to a material model suitable for obtaining at least one material property from the structural feature. It is possible to determine only one material property, or, preferably, more than one material properties, such as at least two or at least three.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">A material model generally refers to a model which receives structural features as input and outputs associated material properties. Material models include physical models and data-driven models. Physical models employ laws of nature, for example thermodynamics or classical mechanics, to translate structural features into material properties. Quite a few physical models for materials having a cellular structure are for example summarized by L. Gibson and M. Ashby in Cellular Solids, Cambridge University Press, ISBN 978-0-521-49911-8. The physical model may be validated with experimental data.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Data-driven model are trained mathematical models which are parametrized according to a training data to input structural features and output associated material properties without involving any knowledge of laws of physics. The data-driven model is preferably a data-driven machine learning model. The material model can be a linear or polynomial regression, a random forest model, a Bayesian network or a neural network. Preferably, the data-driven model is simplified by using only those structural features into account which, after having been train with historical data, have a significant influence on the material property of interest. In this way, the required amount of historical data is reduced and still a robust model with high accuracy is obtained.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Historical data in the context of the present invention refers to data sets including at least one structural feature and at least one material property. Such data is usually obtained by measurement of historical samples, usually by an appropriate method to directly or indirectly obtain the respective material property, for example mechanical testing such as indentation. The associated structural features can either be obtained by analyzing images of the samples similar to the method described above or they are obtained by analysis methods specialized for each structural feature.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The material model can be run on the same system as the other steps of the process or it can be run on a remote system, for example on a server or in a cloud. In this case, the structural features are sent to the remote system executing the material model and the result is received from the remote system. This is usually achieved via a communication interface.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Usually, the type of material, i.e. the chemical composition of each phase in the sample, influences the relationship between structural features and material features. In case samples are different to each other in terms of their type of material, it is preferable to take into account information about the type of material for each phase in the sample. In this way, one usually arrives at more accurate material features. The type of material can be given as general material classes, such as ceramics, resin, visco-elastic polymer such as rubber, or metals. The type of material can also be given more specifically by referring to its chemical composition, for example polystyrene, zeolite, melamine-formaldehyde resin, oak wood, boron glass. Hence, preferably, the type of material for each phase in the sample is provided.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Usually, the type of material is taken into account by choosing an appropriate model. It is either possible to set up a separate model for each type of material. This makes sense if only a few different types of materials are of interest, for example in a factory which produces a small number of different products. Alternatively, the model can use the type of material for each phase as additional input parameters. Obviously, for data-driven models, the historic data used to train the model needs to be labelled appropriately with the type of material for each phase in the sample. For physical models, typically the properties of the bulk material are chosen as these can be easily obtained from databases. The error arising from the fact that the properties of materials in small structures deviate from bulk materials is for most applications acceptable.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The method according to the present invention comprises (d) outputting the at least one material property received from the material model. Outputting can mean writing the material property on a non-transitory data storage medium, display it on a user interface or transmit it to another program either locally or on a remote system, preferably the at least one material property is output onto a user interface.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The method for determining a material property of a sample preferably comprises</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">(a1) providing images of a foam sample,</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">(a2) providing the type of material for each phase in the sample,</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">(a3) converting the images to a representation,</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">(b) extracting at least one structural feature from the representation, wherein the at least one structural feature comprises walls, struts, or nodes,</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">(c) providing the at least one structural feature to a material model which is a physical model or a data-driven model which has been trained based on historical data including structural features and the type of material, and</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">(d) outputting the at least one material property received from the material model.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">An example how the invention can be implemented is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.
