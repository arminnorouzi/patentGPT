Therefore, capacity expansion needs to be performed for network devices.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently, a common capacity expansion method is based on a fixed threshold. Specifically, performance indicator data of a network device is periodically collected, and a collected performance indicator value is compared with the fixed threshold. If the collected performance indicator value is greater than the threshold, capacity expansion needs to be performed for the network device. If the collected performance indicator value is less than or equal to the threshold, capacity expansion does not need to be performed for the network device.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This capacity expansion method is passive. It takes a long time (about three to six months) from identifying a need of capacity expansion for a network device to completing the capacity expansion. During this period, user experience may be affected, which may lead to user churn. In addition, revenue of service providers is positively correlated to traffic. Before the capacity expansion of network device is complete, the traffic that should have been increased is suppressed, which may affect the revenue of service providers.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This application provides a network device capacity expansion method and a related apparatus, to reduce an amount of time for network device capacity expansion and reduce losses caused by network capacity expansion.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a first aspect, an embodiment of this application provides a network device capacity expansion method, including: obtaining network performance data of a target network device; determining a state of the target network device based on the network performance data of the target network device; and determining, based on the state of the target network device, whether to perform capacity expansion for the target network device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the foregoing technical solution, it only needs to learn about current throughput information and packet loss information of the target network device to determine a current state of the target network device. The current state of the target network device may reflect currently suppressed traffic of the target network device. The suppressed traffic is traffic that should be transmitted continuously at a throughput but falls back due to packet loss. Alternatively, in other words, the suppressed traffic is traffic that should be reached as compared with a baseline network device, but is suppressed due to a packet loss rate. In this way, whether capacity expansion needs to be performed for the target network device may be determined in time based on the current state of the target network device, without a need to wait until congestion occurs. In other words, the foregoing technical solution can reduce an amount of time for capacity expansion, thereby reducing adverse effects (for example, user churn, revenue decrease of service providers, and the like) caused by time-consuming capacity expansion.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Optionally, the network performance data may include throughput information and packet loss information.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">With reference to the first aspect, in a possible implementation of the first aspect, the determining a state of the target network device based on the network performance data of the target network device includes: determining a baseline network device; determining state decision information based on network performance statistics data of the baseline network device, where packet loss statistics information of the baseline network device satisfies target packet loss information; and determining the state of the target network device based on the network performance data of the target network device and the state decision information.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Optionally, the network performance statistics data may include throughput statistics information and packet loss statistics information.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">With reference to the first aspect, in a possible implementation of the first aspect, the determining a state of the target network device based on the network performance data of the target network device includes: determining the state of the target network device based on a state decision model and the network performance data of the target network device.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the foregoing technical solution, the state of the target network device may be directly determined by using a pre-trained decision model.
