It relates in particular to a process for producing high-purity hydrosilylation products, and also to the products that may be produced by this process and to the use thereof, particularly as surfactants.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Hydrosilylation products are understood by a person skilled in the art to be preferably SiC-bonded organomodified siloxanes, especially polyether siloxanes, which with their widely adjustable surfactant characteristics represent an industrially very important substance class.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Hydrosilylation reactions of siloxanes bearing SiH groups and/or silanes with compounds comprising a C&#x2550;C double bond are carried out continuously or discontinuously and in each case in the presence of a noble metal catalyst.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Appropriate catalytically active compounds of platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium and osmium are known to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the prior art, usually employed is the platinum metal-catalyzed addition of siloxanes bearing SiH groups and silanes to olefinically functionalized compounds, such as to allyl polyethers, as described for example in the book &#x201c;Chemie and Technologie der Silicone&#x201d; [Chemistry and Technology of Silicones], Verlag Chemie, 1960, page 43, and in the patent literature.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The catalysts which have become established in current operational practice are predominantly Pt catalysts such as hexachloroplatinic acid (U.S. Pat. No. 2,823,218), cis-diamminedichloridoplatinum(II) and Karstedt's catalyst (U.S. Pat. No. 3,775,452).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The platinum catalysts are mostly present in the reaction mixture as homogeneous catalysts and may often remain in the final product. However, due to increasing market requirements, there also exists an ever-growing demand for Pt-free products. In addition to ecological aspects, such as the recovery of important noble metal resources, also increasingly in focus is the improvement of intrinsic product quality.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Hydrosilylation products having elevated noble metal content in general and elevated Pt content in particular usually exhibit the problem of darker colour of the product directly after production, however sometimes the colour also changes over time, both however representing a distinct quality defect. A further quality defect is also the slow formation of black particles, frequently occurring with ageing, due to precipitating noble metal.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">These facts frequently result in customer complaints and this quality defect consequently should be remedied.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Diverse solution approaches are known in the prior art, such as is apparent from the scientific article <i>Ind. Eng. Chem. Res </i>2012, 51, 16457-16466 and the literature cited therein.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition to membrane technology, solvent extraction and selective precipitation, the use of adsorbents is broadly established.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Suitable adsorbents are, for example, acidic or basic ion exchangers, chelating agents or functionalized silica gels (WO 2017213809 A1), activated carbon (CN 20150692397) or carbon black (CN 201510199280).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">An efficient removal of noble metal can also be achieved by the use of supported catalysts. DE 1272550 B and DE 1545046 B2 describe, for example the use of elemental platinum on aluminium oxide as carrier substance for the hydrosilylation of organopolysiloxanes. Isolation of the catalyst is easily possible by simple filtration but the disadvantage here is that the supported catalyst has to be specially prepared.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">U.S. Pat. No. 8,497,338 B2 describes a process based on this concept, where the hydrosilylation process is carried out in such a way that the reaction medium is fed through a catalyst fixed bed.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition to the problem that such a fixed bed can bleed and after a certain service life has to be exchanged with considerable technical and personnel effort, substantial investments are also required to build new plants which enable a hydrosilylation reaction on the fixed bed in continuous mode.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Since hydrosilylation reactions are predominantly carried out in batchwise or semi-batchwise mode, there is a need to facilitate a simple and particularly inexpensive process for producing hydrosilylation products, in which especially the provision of particularly high-purity hydrosilylation products is facilitated.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Only recently was such a process registered under European file number EP 20154483, which is based on the use of magnesium or aluminium silicates, optionally in the presence of water, during hydrosilylation.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Surprisingly, in the context of the present invention, it has now been found that the use of magnesium oxide as adsorbent enables a highly efficient process for preparing high-purity hydrosilylation products. The use of magnesium oxide as adsorbent gives additional flexibility to those skilled in the art, since the adsorbent may be added before, during or after the hydrosilylation reaction and in all cases results in high-purity hydrosilylation products.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the context of the present invention, it has been found, surprisingly, that carrying out a noble metal-catalyzed hydrosilylation of a H-functional siloxane with an unsaturated organic compound when using magnesium oxide, which is added as a further separate component, results in colour-reduced and preferably colourless, and thus particularly high-purity, hydrosilylation products. The colour reduction arises compared to an otherwise analogous procedure but without using separately added magnesium oxide, which may be added before, during of after the hydrosilylation reaction.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Surprisingly, in the context of the present invention, it has further been found that even a magnesium oxide post-treatment of a noble metal-catalyzed hydrosilylation product produced from a H-functional siloxane with an unsaturated organic compound, likewise results in high-purity hydrosilylation products, wherein magnesium oxide may be added for the post-treatment as a further separate component after completion of the hydrosilylation reaction.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present invention accordingly relates to a process for producing organically modified polysiloxanes and/or silanes by hydrosilylation, comprising the following steps:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0022">a) reacting at least one SiH-functional siloxane and/or silane with at least one unsaturated organic compound in the presence of a noble metal catalyst,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0023">optionally in the presence of water,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0024">b) optional distillation,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0025">c) final separation of solids, especially by filtration,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0026">wherein magnesium oxide is added as a further separate component before, during and/or after completion of the hydrosilylation reaction.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0023" num="0027">Accordingly, in the process according to the invention, at least 4 different components are added: (i) SiH-functional siloxane and/or silane; (ii) unsaturated organic compound; (iii) noble metal catalyst; (iv) magnesium oxide. Components (iii) and (iv) to be added are different components.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0028">The present invention also relates to hydrosilylation products, produced by the process according to the invention, and also to the use thereof, for example as surfactants.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0029">The terms &#x201c;polysiloxane&#x201d; and &#x201c;siloxane&#x201d; are used synonymously in the context of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0030">The subject matter of the invention will be described by way of example below, without any intention that the invention be restricted to these illustrative embodiments. Where ranges, general formulae or classes of compounds are specified below, these are intended to encompass not only the corresponding ranges or groups of compounds that are explicitly mentioned but also all subranges and subgroups of compounds that can be obtained by taking out individual values (ranges) or compounds. Where documents are cited in the context of the present description, the entire content thereof, particularly with regard to the subject matter that forms the context in which the document has been cited, is intended to belong entirely to the disclosure content of the present invention. Where chemical (empirical) formulae are used in the present invention, the specified indices can be not only absolute numbers but also average values. For polymeric compounds, the indices preferably represent average values. Unless stated otherwise, percentages are figures in per cent by weight. If measured values are reported hereinbelow, these measurements, unless stated otherwise, have been conducted under standard conditions (20&#xb0; C. and 1013 mbar). When average values are reported below, the values in question are weight averages, unless stated otherwise.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0031">The word fragment &#x201c;poly&#x201d; encompasses in the context of this invention not just compounds having at least 3 repeating units of one or more monomers in the molecule, but in particular also compositions of compounds having a molecular weight distribution and having an average molecular weight of at least 200 g/mol. This definition takes account of the fact that it is customary in the field of industry in question to refer to such compounds as polymers even if they do not appear to conform to a polymer definition as per OECD or REACH guidelines.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0032">In the process according to the invention, SiH-functional siloxanes are used. These are known as such to those skilled in the art. The provision of the SiH-functional siloxanes for the process according to the invention is preferably effected by performing the known prior art process of equilibration, preferably over a sulfonated resin. The equilibration of branched or linear, optionally hydrosilylated poly(organo)siloxanes having end and/or pendant SiH functions is described in detail in the prior art, for example in the documents EP 1439 200 A1, DE 10 2007 055 485 A1 and DE 10 2008 041 601. These documents are hereby incorporated by reference and are considered to form part of the disclosure of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0033">In the context of the hydrosilylation, any organic unsaturated compounds can be used as reaction partners of the SiH-functional siloxanes. Preference is given to using terminally unsaturated organic compounds.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0034">For instance, in addition to terminally unsaturated allyl-functional polyethers, other low molecular weight terminally unsaturated organic compounds may also be used.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0035">Preference is given to using terminally unsaturated polyethers such as allyl- or methallyl-functional polyethers, particularly preferably allyl polyethers. These polyethers can be produced by known processes which can be found in the prior art. The alkoxylation of unsaturated starter compounds can be produced under base, acid, or double metal cyanide (DMC) catalysis.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0036">As an introduction to this topic, reference is made to the monograph &#x201c;<i>Alkylene oxides and their polymers&#x201d;</i> by F.E. Bailey, Marcel Dekker Verlag, 1991. The production and use of DMC alkoxylation catalysts has been known since the 1960s and is outlined in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,427,256, 3,427,334, 3,427,335, 3,278,457, 3,278,458 and 3,278,459 for example. Even more effective DMC catalysts, specifically zinc-cobalt hexacyano complexes, have been developed in the meantime, for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,470,813 and 5,482,908.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0037">The terminal hydroxyl groups of the polyethers may remain in free form or may be modified partly or completely in order to be able to optimize compatibility in the later application matrix.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0038">Conceivable modifications include not only further condensation or addition reactions with isocyanates for example, but also transesterifications, esterifications and etherifications. In the context of the present invention, the terminal hydroxyl groups of the polyethers preferably remain in free form or are in acetylated or methylated form.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0039">The terminally unsaturated organic compounds that may be used are preferably alkene compounds bearing further substituents. It is possible to use, for example, allyl glycol, allyl glycidyl ether, glycerol monoallyl ether, allylanisole, allylphenol, eugenol, hexenol, C6-C20-alkene, vinylcyclohexene monoxide, undecylenic acid and/or methyl undecylenoate, particular preference being given to allyl glycol, tetradecene, hexadecene, octadecene, eugenol and/or glycerol monoallyl ether.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0040">In addition to or instead of terminally unsaturated compounds, it is also possible to use compounds having internal double bonds such as norbornene derivatives or even internal alkyne compounds. However, particular preference is given to using terminally unsaturated alkenes and polyethers.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0041">In the process according to the invention, as already mentioned in the introduction, any noble metal catalyst may be used which catalyzes an SiC bond formation reaction between an SiH-functional polysiloxane and an unsaturated compound. These are well known to a person skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0042">Applicable catalytically active noble metal compounds are based in particular on compounds or complexes of platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium and/or osmium.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0043">In the context of the present invention, preferably applicable are platinum compounds such as hexachloroplatinic acid, cis-diamminedichloridoplatinum(II) and/or Karstedt's catalyst.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0044">Pt(0) compounds such as the Karstedt complex are particularly preferably applicable as catalysts in accordance with the invention, particular preference being given to complexes having divinyltetramethyldisiloxane radicals.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0045">In addition, however, other stable zerovalent platinum-olefin complexes are suitable, such as bis-(1,5-cyclooctadiene)platinum(0) and tris(norbornene)platinum(0), diplatinum tris(heptadiene-1,6), platinum (&#x3b7;2,&#x3b7;2-1,2,6,7-heptadiene-1,6)(&#x3b7;2-1,2-heptadiene-1,6) and/or platinum (&#x3b7;2-ethylene)(&#x3b7;2,&#x3b7;2-1,2,6,7-heptadiene-1,6).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0046">In the context of the invention, any available quality of magnesium oxide can be used.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0047">Preference is given to using magnesium oxide having a purity of &#x3e;85%, more preferably &#x3e;90%, even more preferably &#x2265;92% and most preferably &#x2265;97% and the bulk density is preferably &#x3c;1 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, more preferably &#x2264;0.75 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>and most preferably &#x2264;0.35 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. The bulk density is obtained as the quotient of the mass and the occupied volume. The bulk density can accordingly be determined by charging the substance in question into a measuring box, measuring beaker or measuring cylinder and then establishing the weight. In this way, mass per occupied volume can be determined. The bulk density is preferably determined in accordance with DIN ISO 697: 1984-01. The terms bulk density and apparent density are used synonymously.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0048">The particle size of the magnesium oxide that may be used is preferably &#x3c;10 mesh (2.00 mm), more preferably &#x3c;120 mesh (0.125 mm), even more preferably &#x3c;350 mesh (0.042 mm). The optimal particle size can always be adjusted to the particular application since smaller particle sizes hamper the final filtration/removal of the magnesium oxide from the reaction mixture and may result in uneconomically long filtration times. The particle size can be determined by sieve analysis. The sieve analysis can preferably be carried out in accordance with DIN 66165-1:1987-04 and DIN 66165-2:1987-04.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0049">&#x201c;Mesh&#x201d; is a known angloamerican unit and identifies the mesh size of sieves. What is meant here is the mesh numbers of the U S Bureau of Standards. The figures are the established measure in the expert field for describing the particle size, since a particle which passes through the openings of the sieve must be smaller than the mesh size of the sieve. There are conversion tables to convert the mesh numbers of the U S Bureau of Standards to mesh sizes in mm. With respect to the mesh numbers, reference is furthermore made to U S A-Standard ASTM E11 or ASTM E11-61.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0050">The specific surface area of the magnesium oxide may be adjusted to the specific application, whereby greater surface areas effect a more efficient purification, as is plausible to those skilled in the art. The specific surface area may be preferably &#x3e;10 m<sup>2</sup>/g, more preferably between 30-50 m<sup>2</sup>/g. The specific surface area can be determined in accordance with DIN ISO 9277: 2003-05 (BET method), or in a simplified manner also in accordance with DIN 66132: 1975-07.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0051">It has been found, surprisingly, that the use of magnesium oxide according to the invention, which is added as a further separate component, in the context of the noble metal-catalyzed hydrosilylation of an H-functional siloxane with an unsaturated organic compound, results in colour-reduced, preferably colourless, final products.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0052">The magnesium oxide may be added before, during and/or after completion of the noble metal-catalyzed hydrosilylation.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0053">When carrying out the process according to the invention, it is preferable to ensure sufficient mixing. This also applies in particular to all preferred embodiments of the process according to the invention and is self-evident to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0054">In a preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention, a SiH-siloxane and an unsaturated organic compound are initially charged and temperature-adjusted, together with magnesium oxide; the noble metal catalyst is then added and the reaction mixture is stirred at the optimally adjusted temperature until the SiH value of the reaction mixture verifies a virtually quantitative conversion (preferably &#x3e;99%).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0055">In an alternative preferred embodiment, however, it may also be advantageous to initially charge and temperature-adjust the unsaturated organic compound with magnesium oxide and catalyst, and only then to add the SiH-functional siloxane in a controlled manner.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0056">In a further preferred embodiment, it may be advantageous to firstly initially charge the SiH-functional siloxane together with the magnesium oxide, to add the catalyst and only then to meter in the unsaturated organic compound in a controlled manner.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0057">In a further preferred embodiment, it may be advantageous to add the magnesium oxide to the reaction mixture only after completion of the hydrosilylation and to stir at the optimal temperature adjusted to the respective reaction mixture.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0058">The reaction mixture of all previously listed embodiments can be purified by distillation as required in order to remove low molecular weight impurities for example.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0059">Finally, the reaction mixture is freed from solid constituents, such as magnesium oxide for example, especially by filtration, and this gives a colour-reduced, especially colourless, hydrosilylation product, particularly polyether siloxane.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0060">It has also been found, surprisingly, that contrary to the teaching of the particularly preferred embodiment of the process of the aforementioned European patent application with the file number EP 20154483, the use of a combination of magnesium oxide and water, in the present case no even better quality product can generally be obtained. Use of the combination of magnesium oxide and water is explicitly possible, but to avoid the final separation step by distillation it is preferable to dispense with it.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0061">The visual appearance (particularly in the form of an even lighter product) is comparable, irrespective of whether the hydrosilylation is carried out in the presence or absence of water, but the presence of water in addition to magnesium oxide has no negative influence at all on the reaction.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0062">The amount of magnesium oxide used can be selected within broad ranges. Particularly with respect to cost-benefit analysis, amounts of preferably 0.01 to 5% by weight magnesium oxide, in a ratio to the total amount, have proven to be useful. Particular preference is given to using 0.02 to 2% by weight, especially preferably 0.1 to 0.6% by weight magnesium oxide, % by weight based on the total reaction mass. This corresponds to a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0063">The optional amount of water used can be selected within broad ranges.
