Shims assume the shape of the gap and can support a compressive load to prevent undue distortion and damage to structural parts when fastened together, typically using mechanical fasteners. Shims are used in industrial applications, such as in automotive and aerospace manufacturing. Various forms of shims are also used in residential and commercial construction.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Various types of shims are available. Solid shims may be made of the same material as the interfacing parts. Laminated peelable shims may be made of foil layers that can be removed one-by-one until a favorable fit is achieved. Liquid shim materials work well in filling irregular or tapered interfaces and are typically used to fill gaps less than 0.7 millimeters in width.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Determining the necessity, size, and shape of a given shim is often an iterative and labor-intensive process. Generally, parts are temporarily assembled and then visually inspected and measured for gaps between the skin and substructure. The parts may then be dismantled and a trial shim would be fabricated. The parts may then be reassembled with the shim temporarily secured in place, to check the fit. This is a second temporary assembly operation and such operations may need to be repeated until a proper fit is achieved.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Liquid shims are not structural adhesives, as the bondline does not reside in the primary load path. In mechanically-fastened joints, shear load is borne by the fastener and not the shimming material. In these assemblies, the only loads borne by the liquid shim are compressive loads.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Provided herein is a liquid shimming composition that can also function as an adhesive. When cured, this shimming composition provides high peel strength, along with excellent hot/wet bond performance, and enables simplification of the manufacturing process by eliminating the need to apply a separate adhesive.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a first aspect, a two-part curable shimming adhesive is provided. The adhesive comprises: a base part comprising: a multifunctional epoxy resin having an epoxide functionality of at least three; and a difunctional epoxy resin miscibly blended with the multifunctional epoxy resin; and a hardener part comprising a polyetheramine; wherein either the base part or hardener part further comprises an inorganic filler present in an amount from 10 percent to 60 percent, relative to the overall weight of the two-part curable shimming adhesive, and a phosphoric acid ester.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DEFINITIONS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As used herein:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">&#x201c;alkyl&#x201d; refers to straight chain and branched alkyl groups and cycloalkyl groups having from 1 to 40 carbon atoms, 1 to 20 carbon atoms, 1 to 12 carbons or, in some embodiments, from 1 to 8 carbon atoms;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">&#x201c;ambient conditions&#x201d; means at a temperature of 23&#xb0; C. and a pressure of 1 atmosphere (i.e., 101.3 kPa);</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">&#x201c;ambient temperature&#x201d; refers to a temperature of 23&#xb0; C.;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">&#x201c;average&#x201d; refers to a number average unless otherwise specified;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">&#x201c;cure&#x201d; refers to chemically crosslinking, such as by exposing to radiation in any form, heating, or allowing to undergo a chemical reaction that results in hardening or an increase in viscosity (e.g., under ambient temperature or heated conditions);</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">&#x201c;cycloalkyl&#x201d; refers to cyclic alkyl groups such as, but not limited to, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, and cyclooctyl groups;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">&#x201c;organic group&#x201d; refers to any carbon-containing functional group;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">&#x201c;polymeric&#x201d; refers to a molecule having a plurality of repeating units;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">&#x201c;substantially&#x201d; means a majority of, or mostly, as in at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.9%, 99.99%, or at least 99.999% or more, or 100%; and</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">&#x201c;substituted&#x201d; in conjunction with a molecule or an organic group as defined herein refers to the state in which one or more hydrogen atoms contained therein are replaced by one or more non-hydrogen atoms.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;preferred&#x201d; and &#x201c;preferably&#x201d; refer to embodiments described herein that can afford certain benefits, under certain circumstances. However, other embodiments may also be preferred, under the same or other circumstances. Furthermore, the recitation of one or more preferred embodiments does not imply that other embodiments are not useful and is not intended to exclude other embodiments from the scope of the invention.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;the&#x201d; component may include one or more of the components and equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art. Further, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; means one or all of the listed elements or a combination of any two or more of the listed elements.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In methods described herein, steps can be carried out in any order without departing from the principles of the disclosure, except when a temporal or operational sequence is explicitly recited. Furthermore, specified acts can be carried out concurrently unless explicit claim language recites that they be carried out separately. For example, a claimed act of doing X and a claimed act of doing Y can be conducted simultaneously within a single operation, and the resulting process will fall within the literal scope of the claimed process.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">It is noted that the term &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; and variations thereof, do not have a limiting meaning where these terms appear in the accompanying description. Moreover, &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; &#x201c;the,&#x201d; &#x201c;at least one,&#x201d; and &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein. Relative terms such as left, right, forward, rearward, top, bottom, side, upper, lower, horizontal, and vertical may be used herein and, if so, are from the perspective observed in the particular figure. These terms are used only to simplify the description, however, and not to limit the scope of the invention in any way.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Reference throughout this specification to &#x201c;one embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;certain embodiments,&#x201d; &#x201c;one or more embodiments&#x201d; or &#x201c;an embodiment&#x201d; means that a particular feature, structure, material, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the invention. Thus, the appearances of the phrases such as &#x201c;in one or more embodiments,&#x201d; &#x201c;in certain embodiments,&#x201d; &#x201c;in one embodiment&#x201d; or &#x201c;in an embodiment&#x201d; in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily referring to the same embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Provided herein are curable two-part compositions used to make shims for bonded assemblies. The bonded assemblies, in some instances, may be used in automotive, aerospace, marine, residential, architectural or other commercial or industrial applications.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, the shimmed parts are aircraft components. Aircraft components include the skin and substructure of the aircraft. Aircraft substructures are not particularly limited and can include, for example, springers, spars, ribs, and other framing elements in the aircraft's wings and fuselage.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Structural shims are fly-away components of the aircraft and are made from stiff, load-bearing materials. These shims are used to fill gaps between assembled parts that would otherwise produce dimpling or buckling of the part, and associated stress concentrations. These stress concentrations, if severe, can cause fasteners to fail and ultimately cause significant damage to the aircraft. Accordingly, it is desirable to provide compositions that can readily flow or spread (i.e., a liquid or paste) before curing, allowing it to form a customized shim that precisely fits the gap in which it is to be installed.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The provided curable shimming adhesive is preferably a two-part composition that includes a base part and a curative part. The curable adhesive can be cured by mixing the base part and curative part together. For convenience to the user, curing generally takes place at ambient temperature.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Base Part</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The base part of the curable two-part shimming adhesive is comprised of a blend of epoxy resins. More particularly, the blend includes a difunctional epoxy resin and a multifunctional epoxy resin having an epoxide functionality of at least two and preferably three or more.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The difunctional epoxy resin has an epoxide functionality of exactly two, and can be miscibly blended with the multifunctional epoxy resin. The multifunctional epoxy resin can have an epoxide functionality of at least 2.1, at least 2.2, at least 2.3, at least 2.4, at least 2.5, at least 2.6, at least 2.7, at least 2.8, at least 2.9, or at least 3. The multifunctional epoxy resin may also be comprised of two or more resins having respective epoxide functionalities greater than two.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Epoxy resins include glycidated resins, cycloaliphatic resins, and epoxidized oils. The glycidated resins can be the reaction product of a glycidyl ether, such as epichlorohydrin, and a bisphenol compound such as bisphenol A. Various examples of epoxy resins include C4-C28 alkyl glycidyl ethers; C2-C28 alkyl-and alkenyl-glycidyl esters; C1-C28 alkyl-, mono- and poly-phenol glycidyl ethers; polyglycidyl ethers of pyrocatechol, resorcinol, hydroquinone, 4,4&#x2032;-dihydroxydiphenyl methane (or bisphenol F), 4,4&#x2032;-dihydroxy-3,3&#x2032;-dimethyldiphenyl methane, 4,4&#x2032;-dihydroxydiphenyl dimethyl methane (or bisphenol A), 4,4&#x2032;-dihydroxydiphenyl methyl methane, 4,4&#x2032;-dihydroxydiphenyl cyclohexane, 4,4&#x2032;-dihydroxy-3,3&#x2032;-dimethyldiphenyl propane, 4,4&#x2032;-dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone, and tris (4-hydroxyphynyl)methane; polyglycidyl ethers of the chlorination and bromination products of the above-mentioned diphenols; polyglycidyl ethers of novolacs; polyglycidyl ethers of diphenols obtained by esterifying ethers of diphenols obtained by esterifying salts of an aromatic hydrocarboxylic acid with a dihaloalkane or dihalogen dialkyl ether; polyglycidyl ethers of polyphenols obtained by condensing phenols and long-chain halogen paraffins containing at least two halogen atoms; N,N&#x2032;-diglycidyl-aniline; N,N&#x2032;-dimethyl-N,N&#x2032;-diglycidyl-4,4&#x2032;-diaminodiphenyl methane; N,N,N&#x2032;,N&#x2032;-tetraglycidyl-4,4&#x2032;-diaminodiphenyl methane; N,N&#x2032;-diglycidyl-4-aminophenyl glycidyl ether; N,N,N&#x2032;,N&#x2032;-tetraglycidyl-1,3-propylene bis-4-aminobenzoate; phenol novolac epoxy resin; cresol novolac epoxy resin; and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Representative non-limiting examples of suitable epoxy resins include bis-4,4&#x2032;-(1-methylethylidene) phenol diglycidyl ether and (chloromethyl) epoxide bisphenol A diglycidyl ether. Commercially available epoxy resins that can be used in the practice of this invention include those sold under the trade designation ARALDITE by Huntsman Corporation, The Woodlands, Tex. and EPON by Hexion Inc., Columbus, Ohio. Suitable epoxy resins also include glycidyl ethers of trihydric phenols such as tris(hydroxyphenyl) methane. Such resins are commercially available under the trade designation TACTIX by Huntsman Corporation, The Woodlands, Tex.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, an epoxy novolac resin may be used. In some embodiments, the multifunctional epoxy resins include a tetrafunctional epoxy resin based on meta-xylenediamine, such as those sold under the trade designation ERISYS by Emerald Performance Materials LLC, Vancouver, Wash.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">It can be advantageous to use a mixture of epoxy resins whose constituents are selected to provide the desired viscosity characteristics before curing. In some embodiments, the multifunctional epoxy resin includes a trifunctional epoxy resin, such as triphenyl methane triglycidyl ether, or other glycidyl ether with three or more epoxide groups per molecule. The trifunctional epoxy resin is, in some instances, a solid epoxy resin at ambient temperature. Optionally the trifunctional epoxy resin is blended with a tetrafunctional epoxy resin, such as 4,4&#x2032;-methylenebis(N,N-diglycidylaniline). The difunctional epoxy resin can be a bisphenol A/epichlorohydrin derived liquid epoxy resin, or other glycidyl ether with two epoxide groups per molecule.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The relative amounts of multifunctional epoxy resin and the difunctional epoxy resin can be adjusted to obtain suitable crosslink density, which in turn affects important adhesive properties such as glass transition temperature, tensile strength, and shear strength. Low viscosity difunctional epoxy resins in suitable amounts can also help the uncured adhesive flow and wet the bonding surfaces of a substrate for improved bond strength. In the provided shimming adhesives, the multifunctional epoxy resin and the difunctional epoxy resin can be present in a relative weight ratio of from 1:1 to 6:1, from 1:1 to 4:1, from 1:1 to 2:1, or in some embodiments, less than, equal to, or greater than 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, or 6:1, relative to each other.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a preferred embodiment, the multifunctional epoxy resin includes both a trifunctional epoxy resin and tetrafunctional epoxy resin in relative amounts that balance the competing properties of stiffness and adhesiveness in the cured shimming adhesive. It was discovered that certain epoxy resins, such as solid or semi-solid triphenyl methane triglycidyl ethers, were found to increase adhesive stiffness, while others such as the liquid tetrafunctional 4,4&#x2032;-methylenebis(N,N-diglycidylaniline) were found to enhance adhesive strength.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In keeping with these considerations, the trifunctional epoxy resin and the tetrafunctional epoxy resin can be present in a relative weight ratio of from 1:1 to 8:1, from 1:1 to 6:1, from 1:1 to 4:1, or in some embodiments, less than, equal to, or greater than 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1, 7:1, or 8:1, relative to each other.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The epoxy resin or resins in the base part can have any suitable molecular weight. The weight average molecular weight can be from 100 g/mol to 50,000 g/mol, from 175 g/mol to 20,000 g/mol, from 250 g/mol to 10,000 g/mol, or in some embodiments less than, equal to, or greater than 100 g/mol; 125; 150; 175; 200; 250; 300; 350; 400; 450; 500; 550; 600; 650; 700; 750; 800; 850; 900; 950; 1000; 2000; 5000; 7000; 10,000; 20,000; 30,000; 40,000; or 50,000 g/mol.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The total mixture of the base part and curative part generally includes at least 20 weight percent epoxy resin based on a combined weight of the base part and the hardener part (i.e., based on a total weight of the shimming adhesive composition). For example, the shimming adhesive can include at least 25 weight percent, at least 30 weight percent, at least 40 weight percent, or at least 50 weight percent epoxy resin. The shimming adhesive can include up to 90 weight percent epoxy resin.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, the base part further includes an inorganic filler to enhance the compressive strength of the cured shimming adhesive. Many useful inorganic fillers are possible. Examples include naturally occurring or synthetic materials such as silicon dioxide; nitrides (e.g., silicon nitride); glasses and fillers derived from, for example, Zr, Sr, Ce, Sb, Sn, Ba, Zn, and Al; feldspar; borosilicate glass; zirconia; titania; and micrometer and sub-micrometer fumed silica particles (e.g., pyrogenic silicas such as those available under the trade designations AEROSIL, including &#x201c;OX 50,&#x201d; &#x201c;130,&#x201d; &#x201c;150&#x201d; and &#x201c;200&#x201d; silicas from Degussa Corp., Akron, Ohio and CAB-O-OSIL M5 silica from Cabot Corp., Tuscola, Ill.). In a preferred embodiment, the inorganic filler includes fumed silica. The fumed silica optionally has a median particle size in the range of from 1 to 10 micrometers.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The inorganic filler or fillers can be present in any suitable amount. The filler can be from 10 percent to 60 percent, from 12 percent to 45 percent, from 15 percent to 30 percent, or in some embodiments, less than, equal to, or greater than 10 percent, 12, 15, 17, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, or 60 percent, relative to the overall weight of the two-part curable shimming adhesive.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">To facilitate dispersion of the inorganic filler in the matrix resins, the base part can further include a phosphoric acid ester. The phosphoric acid ester can be, in some cases, a phosphoric acid polyester copolymer containing acid groups. Useful phosphoric acid esters are available under the trade designation BYK W 9010, by Altana AG, Wesel, Germany.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The inorganic filler and phosphoric acid ester can be present in a relative weight ratio of from 100:3 to 1000:3, 100:3 to 500:3, from 100:3 to 300:3, or in some embodiments, less than, equal to, or greater than 100:3, 150:3, 200:3, 250:3, 300:3, 350:3, 400:3, 450:3, 500:3, 600:3, 700:3, 800:3, 900:3, or 1000:3.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The base part can, in some embodiments, include other toughening components. Exemplary toughening components can include, for example, core-shell rubber particles.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Core-shell particles are filler particles having two or more distinct concentric parts: a core and at one or more shell layers surrounding the core. In some embodiments, the core-shell particle is a core-shell rubber (CSR) particle having an elastomeric core and made from either a physically crosslinked or microphase-separated polymer, while the shell layer is made from a non-elastomeric glassy polymer. Advantageously, the rubbery, elastomeric core can enhance toughness in the cured shimming adhesive, while the glassy polymeric shell can provide compatibility between the filler particle and the matrix.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In exemplary composite applications, the core-shell particles can have a particle diameter in the range of from 10 nm to 800 nm, from 50 nm to 500 nm, or from 80 nm to 300 nm, or in some embodiments, less than, equal to, or greater than 5 nm, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 70, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, or 1000 nm.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The core-shell particles may be uniformly dispersed in the composition, or at least partially aggregated. Aggregated core-shell particles may be in physical contact with one or more other core-shell particles. In some embodiments, the core-shell particles form long chains of aggregated particles that extend across the bulk of the curable resin. Such aggregated core-shell particle chains may be linear or branched. The core-shell particle chains may themselves be uniformly distributed throughout the bulk of the curable resin. The configuration of such aggregates can be substantially preserved when the shimming adhesive is cured.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The core-shell rubber toughener can present in an amount of from 1 percent to 20 percent, from 1 percent to 15 percent, from 1 percent to 10 percent, or in some embodiments, less than, equal to, or greater than 1 percent, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 percent of the overall weight of the base part of the two-part curable shimming adhesive.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Further technical aspects of core-shell particles are described elsewhere, such as in co-pending International Publication No. WO 2019/005800 (Chen et al.).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The base part optionally contains one or more reactive diluents. Reactive diluents, which lower the viscosity of the epoxy resin components, are generally epoxy resins having either a branched aliphatic backbone that is saturated or a cyclic backbone. Examples of reactive diluents include, but are not limited to, the diglycidyl ether of resorcinol, the diglycidyl ether of cyclohexane dimethanol, the diglycidyl ether of neopentyl glycol, and the triglycidyl ether of trimethylolpropane.

The cyclic moiety may be substituted by primary amino groups, i.e. the primary amino groups may be bonded directly to the ring. Preferably, the cyclic moiety is substituted by one or more residues carrying the primary amino group, optionally at a terminal position. That residue may be, for example, a linear or branched aminoalkyl group, preferably with the primary amino group at the terminal position.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The curative can contain at least one, preferably at least two primary amino groups (&#x2014;NH<sub>2 </sub>groups) at a terminal position. Most preferred embodiments contain two primary amino groups and both are at the terminal position of the molecule. The at least one cyclic moiety is typically a five- or six-membered ring, which may be a hydrocarbon or a heterohydrocarbon ring. The heterohydrocarbon ring typically contains one, or more than one, heteroatom selected from nitrogen and oxygen atoms.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Examples of suitable curatives include but are not limited to cyclohexanes containing one or more terminal primary amino groups and/or aminoalkyl residues with one or more terminal primary amino groups, piperazines containing one or more terminal primary amino groups and/or aminoalkyl residues with one or more terminal primary amino groups, and morpholines containing one or more terminal primary amino and/or aminoalkyl groups with terminal primary amino groups. Particular examples include but are not limited to bis or tris aminoalkyl piperazines or morpholines. Specific examples include, but are not limited to, 1-amino-3-aminomethyl-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexane (also called isophorone diamine) and N,N-bis(3 aminopropyl) piperazine.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The curatives may be aliphatic cyclic (poly)amines as described above or they may be adducts of such aliphatic cyclic polyamines with one or more epoxy resins, with the proviso that the aliphatic cyclic polyamines are used in molar excess to ensure the adducts contain at least two primary amine groups, preferably at a terminal position of the adduct. Preferably, the epoxy resin used to form the adduct is the same or a similar one to one of the epoxy resins used in the epoxy component. For example, the first curative is a diamine and is reacted with an epoxy resin having two glycidyl groups to form an adduct, the first primary curative may be used in a molar ratio of diamine to epoxy resin greater than or equal to 2:1 to form an amine-containing adduct having two amino groups. A molar excess of the amine is often used so that the curative includes both the amine-containing adduct plus free (non-reacted) amine curative. For example, the molar ratio of the amine curative to epoxy resin with two glycidyl groups can be greater than 2.5:1, greater than 3:1, greater than 3.5:1, or greater than 4:1.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Useful aliphatic amines need not be cyclic and can include linear and/or branched polyetheramines.

At time of use, these parts are mixed to provide a homogeneous, reactive mixture. The amount of each part included in the mixture can be selected to provide the desired molar ratio of epoxide groups from the base part to amine hydrogen atoms from the hardener part. The ratio of amine hydrogen equivalent weight of the curative(s) to epoxy equivalent weight can be selected such that sufficient amine groups are present to fully react with the epoxide groups in the epoxy resins, and any other reactive diluents or additives, if present.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0066">The shimming adhesive, now mixed, can then be disposed between the bonding surfaces of two or more respective substrates and then allowed to cure, thereby providing a bonded assembly. In a preferred method of bonding, two substrates are mated with each other with the reactive mixture disposed therebetween, and the two substrates further secured to each other using a mechanical fastener that extends through the substrates and reactive mixture while it is in the process of curing. The provided compositions can be especially suitable as shim materials, in particular for filling residual gaps between components of an assembly, while simultaneously acting as an adhesive capable of supporting a tensile, shear, and peel loads.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0067">In many embodiments the shimming adhesive compositions will have a low viscosity at ambient temperature, enabling it to be injected or otherwise applied by syringe.

For example, the cured shim compositions may have a cohesive strength, as measured by overlap shear strength, of at least 2500 psi (17.2 MPa). For example, overlap shear strength can be at least 3000 psi (20.7 MPa) or at least 3200 psi (22.1 MPa).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0070">Substrate materials can include metals (e.g., steel, iron, copper, aluminum, or alloys thereof) and composites. The composites typically contain one or more type of fibers embedded in a resin. Typical fibers include carbon fibers, glass fibers and combination thereof. The resin may be an epoxy resin, a phenolic resin, a polyamide resin or combinations thereof or other resins. Preferably, the compositions are applied to fill residual gaps between composite materials, most preferably fiber-reinforced resins, including carbon fiber and glass fiber reinforced epoxy composites.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0071">In many embodiments the shimming adhesive compositions will demonstrate high compression strength properties at ambient temperature and elevated temperatures, along with high peel resistance at non-elevated temperatures, such as at ambient temperature.
