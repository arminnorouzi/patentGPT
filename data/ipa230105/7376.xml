The band may be a headband that is configured to be positioned relative to (e.g., over) a user's head and/or neck to hold the acoustic element(s) relative to (e.g., over, in, or on) the user's ear(s). The user's comfort, the sound quality of the acoustic element(s), and/or other objectives often are improved when the earpiece fits snugly on, over and/or around the user's ear(s). Due to variations in the shape and size of peoples' heads, as well as variations in personal preferences regarding the positioning and fit of personal acoustic systems, it is often difficult to design earphones that comfortably adjust to and/or fit large groups of people.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The foregoing discussion is intended only to illustrate various aspects of the related art in the field and should not be taken as a disavowal of claim scope.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a general aspect, the present invention is directed to an assembly, such as a personal acoustic system, that comprises a headband, an earpiece, and an elastomeric grommet flexibly connecting the band to the earpiece. The headband comprises a first mount, and the earpiece comprises a second mount and an electroacoustic speaker. The elastomeric grommet is positioned intermediate the first mount and the second mount. The elastomeric grommet can be flexible&#x2014;more flexible than the headband or earpiece&#x2014;such that the elastomeric grommet will flex or deform in response to small external forces and loads, such as forces or loads caused by the position or movement of the user's head, and the other components (e.g., the band and the earpiece) will not. Accordingly, such small external forces will result in the relative change in the position and orientation between the headband and the earpiece to enhance the user's comfort level and/or fit when wearing the personal acoustic system. In various implementations, the assembly could also comprise a second earpiece and a second elastomeric grommet flexibly connecting the headband to the second earpiece.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another general aspect, the present invention is directed to a method of manufacturing such a headphone assembly. The manufacturing method can comprise molding an elastomeric grommet at an end of a band of the headphone assembly and connecting the elastomeric grommet to a mount of an earpiece of the headphone assembly. The earpiece comprises an electroacoustic speaker. Co-molding the elastomeric grommet and the band of the headphone assembly can form a lasting and close-fitting connection between the elastomeric grommet and the band.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">These and other benefits of the present invention will be apparent from the description to follow.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Various features of the embodiments described herein are set forth with particularity in the appended claims.

end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The exemplifications set out herein illustrate various embodiments of the present disclosure, in at least one form, and such exemplifications are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the claims in any manner.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A personal acoustic system can include a band and at least one acoustic element operably coupled to the band. For example, the personal acoustic system can include at least one earpiece&#x2014;one at each end of the band, for example&#x2014;and at least one acoustic element can be positioned and/or housed within each earpiece. The earpiece(s) can be coupled to the band. For example, the band can include a pair of earpieces, and each earpiece can be adapted for placement relative to one of the user's ears. The earpiece(s) of the system can be flexibly mounted to the band such that the position and orientation of the earpiece(s) can adjust to the shape and size of the user's head and/or neck, as well as the placement preferences of the user, when the band is placed relative to and/or about the user's head. For example, an earpiece can be flexibly mounted to each end of the band. When the band is placed relative to the user's head, the flexibly-mounted earpiece(s) can be configured to rotate, articulate, shift and/or pivot to accommodate the user and comfortably fit about, on, around, and/or relative to the user's ears.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In certain instances, at least one pivot linkage and/or ball joint can be positioned intermediate the band and each earpiece to flexibly connect the earpiece to the band. The pivot linkage(s) and/or the ball joint(s) can move and/or rotate to effect adjustments to the positioning and orientation of the earpiece relative to the user's head. However, in certain circumstances, such moving linkages and/or joints can be susceptible to wear and/or failure as a result of long-term and/or rigorous use, for example. Additionally, complicated mechanical assemblies having multiple moving parts can be expensive and time-consuming to manufacture and/or assemble, which can increase the cost of the personal acoustic system.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In other instances, as described in greater detail herein, a flexible mount comprising an elastomeric member can be positioned intermediate the band and each earpiece to flexibly connect each earpiece to the band. The elastomeric member can comprise an elastomeric material that permits flexing and/or deformation of the elastomeric member, such that when the elastomeric member flexes or deforms, the relative position and orientation of the band to the earpiece correspondingly changes. For example, the modulus of elasticity of the elastomeric member can be less than the modulus of elasticity of the adjacent components of the personal acoustic system. In particular, the modulus of elasticity of the elastomeric member can be less than the modulus of elasticity of the band, the earpiece and/or the mounting portions of the band and/or the earpiece. That way, the elastomeric member will flex or deform in response to small external forces and loads (such as forces or loads caused by the position or movement of the user's head) and the other components (e.g., the band and the earpiece) will not, so that the small external forces will result in the relative change in the position and orientation between the band to the earpiece to enhance the user's comfort level and/or fit when wearing the personal acoustic system.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As the elastomeric member between the band and the earpiece flexes between a neutral configuration and at least one flexed or deformed configuration, the earpiece can shift relative to the band. For example, the earpiece can be oriented at different angle(s) relative to the band. As a result, the earpiece can be adjustably positioned relative to the user's ears. In certain instances, a flexible mount comprising the elastomeric member can be free of moving linkages and/or joints, and thus, can resist wear and/or premature failure. Such a flexible mount can also define a low profile while providing suitable adjustability. Moreover, a flexible mount that is free of moving linkages and/or joints can be more cost-effectively manufactured and/or assembled, which can reduce the cost of the personal acoustic system.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>8</b></figref>, a personal acoustic system <b>100</b>, as well as subassemblies and components thereof, are depicted. The personal acoustic system <b>100</b> includes a band <b>120</b>, earpieces <b>160</b> at respective ends of the band <b>120</b>, and flexible mounts <b>140</b> connecting the earpieces <b>160</b> to the band <b>120</b>. The personal acoustic system <b>100</b> can be adapted for use as an audio headphone system, noise cancellation or abatement system, noise isolation system, and/or various other suitable uses. A flexible mount <b>140</b> is positioned intermediate the band <b>120</b> and each earpiece <b>160</b> to flexibly secure each earpiece <b>160</b> to the band <b>120</b>.

Moreover, the band <b>420</b> includes a first end and a second end, and a yoke <b>426</b> extending from each end, similar to the bands <b>120</b> and <b>320</b>, for example. In various instances, the flexible mount <b>440</b> comprises an elastomeric material, such as a thermoplastic elastomer and/or silicone, for example. The flexible mount <b>440</b> is resilient such that the flexible mount <b>440</b> can deform from a neutral orientation to a deformed orientation when an external load is applied and can resume the neutral orientation when the external load is removed. Referring to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>15</b></figref>, a plurality of relief features <b>442</b> are defined into the flexible mount <b>440</b> to further facilitate flexing and/or deformation of the flexible mount <b>440</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The flexible mount <b>440</b> is connected to the yoke <b>426</b> of the band <b>420</b>. For example, the flexible mount <b>440</b> can be integrally formed with the yoke <b>426</b>. In certain instances, the flexible mount <b>440</b> and the yoke <b>426</b> form a co-molded and/or injection-molded subassembly. The flexible mount <b>440</b> can be positioned at least partially within an inner mounting surface of the yoke <b>426</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the flexible mount <b>440</b> can be secured to the yoke <b>426</b> with adhesives and/or fasteners, for example.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In certain instances, the flexible mount <b>440</b> includes an inner mounting portion <b>444</b>. The inner mounting portion <b>444</b> defines a flange protruding radially inward. In various instances, the inner mounting portion <b>444</b> is configured to be retained between the mounting portion <b>464</b> of the earpiece <b>460</b> and a clip <b>490</b>. For example, the clip <b>490</b>, which includes a plurality of spring members and/or cantilevered arms <b>492</b>, is configured to engage the mounting portion <b>464</b> of the earpiece <b>460</b>. When the clip <b>490</b> is engaged with the earpiece <b>460</b>, the flange <b>444</b> of the flexible mount <b>440</b> can be retained between the clip <b>490</b> and the earpiece <b>460</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>-<b>15</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In certain instances, the clip <b>490</b> can snap-fit into engagement with the mounting portion <b>464</b> of the earpiece <b>460</b>. Moreover, the flange <b>444</b> can extend into a groove defined between the clip <b>490</b> and the mounting portion <b>464</b> of the earpiece <b>460</b>. In such instances, the flexible mount <b>440</b>, and thus the yoke <b>426</b> connected thereto, can be flexibly coupled to the earpiece <b>460</b> when the clip <b>490</b> is locked to the mounting portion <b>464</b>. The flexible mount <b>440</b> can permit articulation of the earpiece <b>460</b> relative to the band <b>420</b> such that the placement of the earpiece <b>460</b> can be adjusted based on the shape of the user's head and/or the user's placement preferences.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">To assemble the personal acoustic system <b>400</b>, the flexible mount <b>440</b> can be integrally formed with the yoke <b>426</b> by at least one of the various molding techniques described herein. For example, the yoke <b>426</b> can be formed with an injection-molding process, and thereafter the flexible mount <b>44</b> can be co-molded with the yoke <b>426</b>. In other instances, the flexible mount <b>440</b> can be coupled to the yoke <b>426</b> by at least one of the various coupling means described herein. Thereafter, the flexible mount <b>440</b> can be positioned in abutting engagement with the earpiece <b>460</b> such that the flange <b>444</b> of the flexible mount <b>440</b> is positioned in a portion of the groove defined by the mounting portion <b>464</b> of the earpiece <b>460</b>. The clip <b>490</b> can then be snap-fit into engagement with the mounting portion <b>464</b> to hold the flexible mount <b>440</b> in abutting engagement with the earpiece <b>460</b>. For example, the cantilevered arms <b>492</b> can be inserted into at least one aperture in the mounting portion <b>464</b> of the earpiece <b>460</b>. When the clip <b>490</b> is engaged with the earpiece <b>460</b>, the flexible mount <b>440</b> and the band <b>460</b> connected thereto can be secured to the earpiece <b>460</b>. In various instances, the assembling method can further include mounting a second earpiece to the opposite end of the band <b>420</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In various embodiments, therefore, the present invention is directed to an assembly that comprises a headband, an earpiece, and an elastomeric grommet flexibly connecting the band to the earpiece. The headband comprises a first mount, and the earpiece comprises a second mount and an electroacoustic speaker. The elastomeric grommet is positioned intermediate the first mount and the second mount. The assembly could also comprise a second earpiece connected in a similar manner at an opposite end of the headband.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In various implementations, the first mount comprises an annular inner surface, and the second mount comprises an annular outer surface. The annular outer surface of the second mount can comprise a groove, in which case the elastomeric grommet can be positioned at least partially within the groove. Similarly, the elastomeric grommet could comprises a groove, and the annular inner surface can be positioned at least partially within the groove. Also, either or both of the first and second mounts could have a notched profile that prevent rotation of the elastomeric grommet relative to the earpiece or headband, as the case may be.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Preferably, the elastomeric grommet and the first mount are comprised of different materials. The elastomeric grommet, for example, could comprise thermoplastic elastomer or silicone, whereas the headband and earpiece may comprise rigid, non-elastomeric plastic or steel.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Further, the elastomeric grommet and the headband could comprise a co-molded, integrally-formed subassembly. In such an embodiment, the headphone assembly could be manufactured by molding (e.g., co-molding) the elastomeric grommet at an end of the headband of the headphone assembly and connecting the elastomeric grommet to the mount of the earpiece. The same process could be used for a headphone assembly with a second earpiece at the other end of the headband.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the overall structure, function, manufacture, and use of the embodiments as described in the specification and illustrated in the accompanying drawings.
