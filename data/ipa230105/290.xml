The systems include combinations of components that produce foams with a density and stability for use with beverages. A disclosed cylindrical valve actuator provides a smooth dispensing channel that minimizes any disruption of the foam as it is being dispensed. It has been found, in one aspect, that the combinations of the cylindrical valve actuator and the formulations produces foams with a density and stability for use with beverages.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">As an example, the systems described herein are designed for use with dairy blends having certain formulations and designed to be dispensed into or onto hot or cold beverages to create a sit-on-top foam layer topping or an immediately mixing swirling topping. The toppings are not &#x201c;whipped&#x201d; as for prior art whipped dairy toppings which are typically high in fat, thick, and stabilized with emulsifiers and gum additives such as sorbitan monostearates or mono or diglycerides.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A cappuccino is a coffee-based beverage that includes espresso topped with foamed milk, and typically including steamed milk. A latte is a coffee-based beverage that includes espresso mixed with steamed milk. Many coffee shops prepare variations of these drinks, including macchiatos, which include milk foam only. While aspects of the disclosure are described primarily in reference to making espresso-based beverages, it should be understood that the formulations and dispensers can be used to provide a dairy based topping to any beverage, or even to a food product.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one aspect, a formulation is a combination of a propellant and a dairy blend liquid product designed to be dispensed onto a hot or cold beverage from a container fitted with an actuator as a foamed topping and sit on top of the beverage for an amount of time so that the foam layer can be consumed simultaneously with the lower beverage. For example, the foaming dairy blend dispensed onto a cup of coffee would resemble a cappuccino or a macchiato.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another aspect, a formulation is a combination of a propellant and a dairy blend liquid product designed to be dispensed onto a hot or cold beverage from a container fitted with an actuator where it immediately mixes with the beverage in a swirl pattern. It can also create a small foam layer on top of the beverage.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Dispensers</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an aerosol container <b>10</b> having a body <b>11</b> and valve actuator <b>56</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the valve actuator <b>56</b> as including a generally cylindrical body <b>58</b> having a generally uniform diameter, an upper or discharge end <b>88</b>, and a lower or base end. The discharge end of the actuator includes a cylindrical edge portion <b>90</b>. At the base end, the actuator is formed with an outwardly extending flange <b>66</b> and a downwardly extending skirt <b>68</b>. The underside of the flange <b>66</b> is provided with a downwardly facing annular stop shoulder <b>70</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). Valve actuator <b>56</b> can be attached to the valve assembly <b>15</b> and body <b>11</b> of aerosol container <b>10</b> as described below.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A tilt valve assembly <b>15</b>, including actuator <b>56</b>, is shown in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The valve assembly <b>15</b> comprises generally a mounting cup <b>12</b>, a valve body <b>26</b>, a valve stem <b>40</b>, a sealing gasket <b>52</b>, and a biasing element <b>54</b> which can be a spring. The mounting cup <b>12</b> is of generally circular configuration and includes a peripheral lip <b>14</b>, by which the cup is mounted on top of aerosol container <b>10</b>. Centrally formed within the cup is a pedestal <b>20</b>. The pedestal includes a top <b>21</b> having a central stem opening <b>22</b>. The mounting cup can have a protective sealing laminate <b>24</b> on a surface facing the interior of the aerosol container. The mounting cup can be made of metal.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The valve assembly <b>15</b> also includes a valve body <b>26</b> which has an upper portion <b>28</b> and lower slotted portion <b>30</b>. The valve body <b>26</b> is securely attached to the mounting cup <b>12</b> by crimping the mounting cup along a surface <b>32</b> on the valve body <b>26</b> formed at the junction of the upper and lower valve body portions. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, the lower valve body portion <b>30</b> further includes a plurality of equally spaced slots <b>34</b>, the slots being of predetermined length and width. The slots are disposed inside the aerosol container <b>10</b> and provide a large surface area through which the mixture of product/propellent can enter the valve assembly <b>15</b>. The valve body <b>26</b> can have six equally spaced slots <b>34</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> but the number of slots can vary.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the valve assembly <b>15</b> also includes a valve stem <b>40</b> which comprises a hollow cylindrical stem element <b>48</b>, and a sealing ring <b>42</b>, which includes an annular lip <b>44</b>. The valve stem <b>40</b> further includes a plurality of metering orifices <b>46</b> which are formed into the stem element <b>48</b> adjacent the junction of the stem element <b>48</b> and the sealing ring <b>42</b> and below an upper edge <b>50</b> of the annular lip <b>44</b>. The stem element <b>48</b> can include four metering orifices. However, the number and the shape and/or size of the metering orifices can vary depending upon the viscosity of the product to be dispensed from the aerosol container <b>10</b>. The valve stem <b>40</b> and the valve body <b>26</b> can be formed from an inert, nontoxic, plastic material, such as polypropylene.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, an elastomeric gasket <b>52</b> is disposed between an undersurface <b>23</b> of the top <b>21</b> of the pedestal <b>20</b> and the annular lip <b>44</b> of the valve stem <b>40</b>. The gasket <b>52</b>, among other functions, serves to close out and seal against fluid leaks along the open upper portion <b>28</b> of the valve body <b>26</b>. Disposed through the center of the gasket <b>52</b> is the stem element <b>48</b> of the valve stem <b>40</b>. The gasket <b>52</b> forms a fluid tight seal around the perimeter of the stem element <b>48</b> sufficient to prevent pressurized product/propellant from escaping along the exterior of the valve stem <b>40</b>. Disposed between the sealing ring <b>42</b> of the valve stem <b>40</b> and a base <b>35</b> of the valve body <b>26</b> is a biasing element <b>54</b>. The biasing element <b>54</b> biases the upper edge <b>50</b> of the annular lip <b>44</b> of the valve stem <b>40</b> upwardly so that the lip <b>44</b> makes full peripheral contact against the gasket <b>52</b>, thereby sealing off and preventing the product/propellant mixture from escaping from the aerosol container <b>10</b>, via the metering orifices <b>46</b> in the valve stem <b>40</b>. Thus, the biasing element <b>54</b> functions to keep the valve assembly <b>15</b> in a vertically directed or normally closed position. The biasing element <b>54</b> can be a compression spring in the form of a coil wound about an axis coincident with the longitudinal axis of the valve stem <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Valve actuator <b>56</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and generally described above. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> when attached to aerosol container <b>10</b> and valve assembly <b>15</b>, the inside of the skirt <b>68</b> of actuator <b>56</b> generally conforms to the shape of the mounting cup pedestal <b>20</b>. When the actuator is placed over the mounting cup pedestal <b>20</b>, the skirt <b>68</b> extends downwardly to cover most of the pedestal <b>20</b> creating a pleasing aesthetic appearance.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Intermediate the upper and lower ends of the actuator <b>56</b> is a transverse support partition <b>72</b>. Extending downwardly from the support partition is a generally centrally aligned nipple <b>76</b>, which slidably fits over the stem element <b>48</b>. The nipple <b>76</b> and the stem element <b>48</b> can be fitted with retaining means such as ribs <b>78</b>, located on the inside circumference of the nipple <b>76</b> and outer circumference of the stem element <b>48</b> respectively. When pressed together the rib <b>78</b> on the nipple <b>76</b> snaps over the rib <b>78</b> on the stem element <b>48</b> and thereby locks the actuator <b>56</b> to the valve stem <b>40</b>. Those skilled in the art will understand that various combinations of ribs, or ribs and grooves, or other locking features are possible. Alternatively, a friction fit between the nipple <b>76</b> and the stem element <b>48</b>, or a friction fit between the skirt <b>68</b> and the mounting cup pedestal <b>20</b>, can also be used.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, defined in the transverse support partition <b>72</b> of the actuator <b>56</b> is a central passageway <b>74</b>. A flow deflector <b>80</b> is oriented between passageway <b>74</b> and cylindrical end portion <b>90</b>. The flow deflector <b>80</b> can have one or more prongs associated with one or more legs <b>81</b>. The underside of deflector <b>80</b> creates an impact surface at a predetermined distance from the passageway <b>74</b>. The deflector <b>80</b> is aligned generally with passageway <b>74</b> and functions to promote mixing and foaming of the product/propellant in an expansion chamber <b>60</b> which is defined by the interior of the body portion <b>58</b> of the actuator <b>56</b>. It should be noted that the flow deflector <b>80</b> rises into and is surrounded by the expansion chamber <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">An alternate actuator <b>92</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. In this embodiment, the discharge end <b>93</b> of the actuator includes a plurality of peripherally spaced slots <b>94</b> defining inwardly curved fingers <b>96</b>. The inwardly curving fingers form what is generally referred to in the art as a &#x201c;tulip top.&#x201d; The actuator <b>92</b> can include, for example, five or six equally spaced fingers. The remainder of the actuator <b>92</b> is generally the same as actuator <b>56</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Another alternative actuator <b>100</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. This actuator includes a generally cylindrical body <b>102</b>, slightly shorter than that of the actuator shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, having an upper or discharge end <b>104</b> and a lower or base end. The discharge end of the actuator includes a generally flat tip. At the base end, the actuator is formed with an outwardly extending flange <b>106</b> and a downwardly extending skirt <b>108</b>. Intermediate the upper and lower ends of the actuator <b>100</b> is a transverse support partition <b>110</b> having a tapered central passageway <b>112</b> therethrough. The top surface of transverse support partition <b>110</b> is concave. Flow deflector <b>114</b> is oriented between passageway <b>112</b> and discharge end <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">For use in the systems described herein, aerosol container <b>10</b> is equipped with a valve assembly such as valve assembly <b>15</b> and actuator <b>56</b> (or <b>92</b> or <b>100</b>) and loaded with propellant and a liquid product. A user inverts the container <b>10</b> which causes liquid product in the container <b>10</b> to enter the valve body <b>26</b> through the radially spaced slots <b>34</b>. The propellent gas inside container <b>10</b> is then located above the liquid product.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The user applies a lateral force to the actuator <b>56</b> (or <b>92</b> or <b>100</b>), typically using an index finger. The lateral force causes the valve stem <b>40</b> to tilt, whereby the sealing ring <b>42</b> moves downwardly away from the gasket <b>52</b> to form a gap between the ring and the gasket. The gap allows liquid product to enter the stem element <b>48</b> of the valve stem <b>40</b> via the metering orifices <b>46</b>. The product passes through the stem element and into the central passageway <b>74</b> of the actuator. Upon exiting the central passageway, the liquid product impacts the flow deflector <b>80</b> where it is forced past the deflector <b>80</b> and into the expansion chamber <b>60</b>. Mixing of the propellent and liquid product to form a foam begins to occur in the stem element <b>48</b> and is substantially complete upon impacting the flow deflector <b>80</b>. The flow deflector <b>80</b> helps to promote uniform mixing and foaming of the propellent/product. The expansion chamber forms the foamed product into its final dispensed shape. The foamed product subsequently exits the actuator from the end <b>88</b> (or <b>93</b> or <b>104</b>).</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Formulations</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Toppings having desired properties were designed using certain dairy liquid product formulations in combination with certain propellants. When dispensed from a dispenser as described above, or as currently known, the result is a foamed topping having desired characteristics.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Nitrous Oxide Propellant</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one aspect, the topping is a foaming dairy blend designed to be dispensed onto a hot or cold beverage and remain on top of the beverage for an amount of time so that the foam layer can be consumed simultaneously with the lower beverage. For example, the foaming dairy blend dispensed onto a cup of coffee would resemble a cappuccino or a macchiato. The optimized formula disclosed here results in a foam that is elastic compared to prior art whipped foams, so that it can be consumed with the beverage and does not float away from the tipped edge of a cup near the consumer's lips. Other foams will be rigid (non-elastic) in a way that causes them to float away to the opposite edge of the cup when tipped to drink, making it impossible to sip two distinct layers simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The foaming dairy blend is created from a liquid product and a propellant. The propellant in this embodiment can be nitrous oxide. The amount of propellant can be from about 1.5% to 4.0% by total weight of the formulation. For example, the propellant can be from about 1.5%, 2.0%, 2.5%, 3.0%, 3.5%, 4.0% to about 1.5%, 2.0%, 2.5%, 3.0%, 3.5%, 4.0% by total weight of the formulation.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The liquid product includes one or more dairy products, such as cream, half and half, whole milk, skim milk, and nonfat dry milk. A sweetener can be added, such as, for example, sugar. Flavors such as vanilla can be added and salt can be added. An emulsifying agent can be added to enhance the elasticity of the foam and promote stability and shelf life. The emulsifier can be lecithin, such as soy lecithin. Importantly, the formulations minimize the use of non-clean ingredients such as carrageenan, sorbitan monostearate, and mono and di glycerides, for example.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Total milkfat percentage in the formulations can range from about 0.5 to 18.0% by weight. A desired formulation is 8.25+/&#x2212;0.65% milkfat. A combination of types of milk can be used to achieve this percentage of milkfat. For example, 9% total milkfat could be achieved using 21.95% by weight heavy cream at 41% milkfat or 50% by weight half and half (18% fat) or 30% by weight of cream (30% fat) or 18.98% heavy cream (41% fat) in conjunction with 50% whole milk (3.25% fat). Other combination are of course possible.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Reducing the fat percentage too far would not allow for the same foam characteristics or layering effect since the propellant would not be incorporated into the liquid product (as described below). Increasing the fat content considerably would mean that the liquid product is too thick to incorporate gas (as described below) because it would not be free flowing enough.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">For example, heavy cream can be used, having about 36% to 41% milkfat for example. The heavy cream is used to add fat, foaming, and flavor to the product. Heavy cream can be from about 0% to about 50% by total weight of the formulation. For example, heavy cream can be from about 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 50% to about 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 50% by total weight of the formulation.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Skim milk can be used as the main liquid component although partially skim or whole milk can be used (or a combination). The milk component provides the milk proteins that cause foaming. The skim milk component can be from about 5% to about 98% by total weight of the formulation. For example, the milk component can be from about 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98% to about 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98% by total weight of the formulation. Nonfat dry milk can be added to increase the dairy flavor, add some protein, and add to the stability and texture of the foam. Nonfat dry milk can be from about 0% to about 5.00% by total weight of the formulation. For example, nonfat dry milk can be from about 0%, 0.50%, 1.00%, 1.50%, 2.00%, 2.50%, 3.00%, 3.50%. 4.00%. 4.50%, 5.00% to about 0%, 0.50%, 1.00%, 1.50%, 2.00%, 2.50%, 3.00%, 3.50%. 4.00%. 4.50%, 5.00% by total weight of the formulation. Whey protein concentrates or similar solids such as maltodextrins or gums can be used to provide similar effects.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">An emulsifier can be used in the formulation. The emulsifier can be from about 0.5% to about 3.0% by total weight of the formulation. For example, the emulsifier can be from about 0.50%, 0.75%, 1.00%, 1.25%, 1.50%, 1.75%, 2.00%, 2.25%, 2.50%, 2.75%, 3.00% to about 0.50%, 0.75%, 1.00%, 1.25%, 1.50%, 1.75%, 2.00%, 2.25%, 2.50%, 2.75%, 3.00% by total weight of the formulation. An example emulsifier is lecithin. For example, powdered soy lecithin can be used for emulsification and foaming. The emulsifier allows the foam to be elastic/flexible for dispensing, and so that the foam moves with the beverage to be sipped. The emulsifier allows for the foam to melt into the beverage with time and does not add viscosity or gelling. Deoiled, dry lecithin is preferred since it has increased solubility in water. Liquid lecithins could be used as well. Other lecithins could be used if they had similar solubility and foaming capacity, regardless of plant source or liquid/solid state. For example, lecithin from other plant sources, such as sunflower and canola lecithin can be used.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">A variety of sweeteners can be added, or no sweetener. The sweetener can be from about 0% to about 45% by total weight of the formulation. For example, the sweetener can be from about 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45% to about 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45% by total weight of the formulation. One sweetener that can be used is white granulated sugar which, in addition to providing sweetness, strengthens the foam enough that it stays layered for several minutes in hot coffee. If the sugar content is very high, it will form a weak gel to provide additional stabilization of the microbubble foam</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">A variety of flavors can be added. The flavoring can be about 0% to about 5% by total weight of the formulation. In addition, salt can be added to the formulation. Salt can be from about 0 to about 0.3% by total weight of the formulation. For example, salt can be from about 0%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3% to about 0%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3% by total weight of the formulation.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The ranges in the formulation indicated in Table 1 produce a foam that sits on top of the beverage for several minutes rather than immediately disseminating into the beverage. Note that the milkfat percentage can be achieved by various combinations of the heavy cream (or using other milkfat containing products as discussed above).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="119pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="84pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Ingredient</entry><entry>% by weight</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>MILKFAT</entry><entry>0.5 to 18.0%<sup>&#x2003;</sup></entry></row><row><entry/><entry>CREAM, HEAVY (36% fat)</entry><entry>0 to 50.0%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>CREAM, HEAVY (41% fat)</entry><entry>0 to 43.9%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>SKIM MILK</entry><entry>5.0 to 98.0%<sup>&#x2003;</sup></entry></row><row><entry/><entry>NONFAT DRY MILK</entry><entry>&#x2002;0 to 5.0%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>SUGAR, WHITE, GRANULATED</entry><entry><sup>&#x2003;</sup>0 to 45%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>SOY, LECITHIN, POWDER</entry><entry>0.5 to 3.0%&#x2009;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>FLAVOR, VANILLA</entry><entry>N/A</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>SALT</entry><entry>&#x2002;0 to 0.3%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">A formulation according to this composition is combined with the propellant nitrous oxide in an aerosol can. Nitrous oxide is very soluble in milkfat so when the can is shaken, gas is incorporated into the fat colloids which have been dispersed into and stabilized by the other ingredients. This results in a protein-stabilized emulsion encapsulating a foam. The density and fat content are important; the product must be fully-flowable to readily mix with the propellant. The fat content and emulsifier content are important because they allow for encapsulation of the nitrous oxide. The density will vary depending on the fat content and total solids and may range from about 0.8 to 1.1 g/ml.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">Because the propellant is incorporated into the composition, the product expelled from the aerosol can is a consumer-visible foam. The foam forms from expansion (high pressure-inside of can to low-pressure outside of can) when nitrous oxide is solubilized into the formula. During expulsion, the nitrous oxide dissipates, leaving the foam behind.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">The use of the valve actuator described above, having a multi-pronged deflector and a flat tip, creates additional foam which is slow to dispense dependent on the actuator diameter. The resulting foam is free-flowing and elastic, with enough surface tension to sit on top of a beverage, due to the lecithin functionality, fat/nitrous interactions, and sugar stabilization to delay incorporation into the beverage for a few minutes.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">Nitrogen Propellant</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">In another aspect the dairy blend is designed to be dispensed onto a hot or cold beverage where it immediately mixes with the beverage in a swirl pattern. It can also create a small foam layer on top of the beverage. For example, the dairy blend dispensed into a cup of coffee would resemble a latte.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">The dairy blend is created from a liquid product and a propellant. The propellant in this embodiment can be nitrogen gas. The amount of propellant ranges from about 0.8% to 1.3% by weight. For example, the propellant can be 0.8%, 0.9%, 1.0%, 1.1%, 1.2%, 1.3% to 0.8%, 0.9%, 1.0%, 1.1%, 1.2%, 1.3%. Using nitrogen gas as the propellant provides the &#x201c;nitro&#x201d; effect, dispensing with velocity, where the foamed product will mix with the beverage in a swirling pattern.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">The liquid product includes one or more dairy products, such as cream, half and half, whole milk, skim milk, and nonfat dry milk. A sweetener may be added, such as, for example, sugar. Flavors such as vanilla may be added and salt may be added. An emulsifying agent may be added to enhance the elasticity of the foam. In some aspects the emulsifier is lecithin, such as soy lecithin. Importantly, the formulations minimize the use of non-clean ingredients such as carrageenan sorbitan monostearate, and mono and di glycerides, for example.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">Milkfat percentage in the formulations can range from about 0 to 30%. A desired formulation is 8.25+/&#x2212;0.65% milkfat. A combination of types of milk can be used to achieve this percentage of milkfat. For example, 9% total milkfat could be achieved using 21.95% by weight heavy cream at 41% milkfat or 50% by weight half and half (18% fat) or 30% by weight of cream (30% fat) or 18.98% heavy cream (41% fat) in combination with 50% whole milk (3.25% fat). The 0% milkfat formulation could be formulated from a skim milk/high sugar/high lecithin formula.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">Reducing the fat percentage too far would not allow for the same characteristics as the product would be too thin and have limited swirling since the density difference between the beverage and the product would be too low.

The ingredient to ingredient interactions are more important to manage than the ingredient to propellant interactions, because the adjustments in formula are less likely to influence ingredient to propellant interactions (and ultimately create undesirable product characteristics). Evacuation and evacuation velocity are the priorities, as propellant to product interactions would be minimal due to nitrogen gas being inert.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0059">A formulation according to this composition is combined with the propellant nitrogen in an aerosol can. Nitrogen gas is not soluble in milkfat so when the can is shaken, gas is not incorporated into the fat colloids which have been dispersed into and stabilized by the other ingredients. Lecithin-trapped microbubbles of nitrogen will form in the base during manual shaking, but will dissociate back to the headspace within a few seconds</p><p id="p-0063" num="0060">Because nitrogen is not incorporated into the stabilized emulsion pre-dispense, there is limited surface tension to prevent the creamer from mixing into the beverage. The degree of swirling will be increased as the density or solubility differences between the beverage and creamer increase, generally achieved by increasing fat content. A thin foam layer forms from entrapped microbubbles of air and nitrogen, amplified with the velocity of product hitting the beverage surface. The effect of the actuator valve is minimal for this embodiment so the valve as described above can be used, or a prior art valve.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0061">Aerosol Container</p><p id="p-0065" num="0062">With regards to the aerosol container, for either the nitrous or nitrogen propellant, a two piece steel can, having dimensions 211&#xd7;604 or 211&#xd7;713, for example, may be used.

The propellant should maintain a pressure high enough to evacuate the product from the container.
