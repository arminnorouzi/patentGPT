Typical wireless communication systems may employ multiple-access technologies capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources. Examples of such multiple-access technologies include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) systems, and time division synchronous code division multiple access (TD-SCDMA) systems.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">These multiple access technologies have been adopted in various telecommunication standards to provide a common protocol that enables different wireless devices to communicate on a municipal, national, regional, and even global level. An example telecommunication standard is 5G New Radio (NR). 5G NR is part of a continuous mobile broadband evolution promulgated by Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to meet new requirements associated with latency, reliability, security, scalability (e.g., with Internet of Things (IoT)), and other requirements. 5G NR includes services associated with enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine type communications (mMTC), and ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC). Some aspects of 5G NR may be based on the 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard. There exists a need for further improvements in 5G NR technology. These improvements may also be applicable to other multi-access technologies and the telecommunication standards that employ these technologies.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated aspects, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all aspects nor delineate the scope of any or all aspects. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of one or more aspects in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an aspect of the disclosure, a method, a computer-readable medium, and an apparatus are provided. The method may include a user equipment (UE), a base station, and a core network including an Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF). In some aspects, the UE may initiate an update of the paging subgroup identifier (ID) assigned to the UE by transmitting paging assistance information to the AMF. The paging assistance information may include at least one of a paging probability, a mobility profile, or a power profile of the UE. In one aspect, the paging assistance information may be transmitted in one or more of a registration request message or a registration update message, and the paging subgroup ID may be received in a registration acceptance message from the core network. In another aspect, the paging subgroup ID is received in a radio resource control (RRC) release message from the base station.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The base station may initiate an update of the paging subgroup ID assigned to the UE based on the change of RRC connection between the UE and the base station. The core network including the AMF may transmit an updated paging subgroup ID to the UE. In one aspect, the RRC state change includes a change of an RRC connection with the first UE to an RRC inactive state, and the base station may transmit paging assistance information to the network based on the RRC state change for the UE. The Core network including the AMF may configure an updated paging subgroup ID in response to the paging assistance information.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The core network including the AMF may configure a set of candidate subgroups associated with the UE, and the base station may update the paging subgroup ID of the UE based on releasing the RRC connection to the RRC inactive state. The core network may receive a UE capability indicating whether the UE supports subgrouping assigned by the network, and transmit the updated paging subgroup ID to the UE.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The core network including the AMF may receive, from a second UE, a second UE capability indicating that the second UE does not support subgrouping assigned by the network, and transmit, to the base station, a second paging notification including an indication that the second UE does not support subgrouping assigned by the network. The base station may transmit the second paging indication to the second UE in the second paging occasion with the subgroup ID based on the UE-ID of the second UE based on the second paging notification received from the network.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The UE may receive system information indicates a number of the UE subgroups assigned by at least one of the network or the base station, and monitor paging channel using the subgroup ID based on the UE receiving an assignment of the subgroup ID and the subgroup ID being less than the number of the subgroups indicated in the system information.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the one or more aspects comprise the features hereinafter fully described and particularly pointed out in the claims. The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative features of the one or more aspects. These features are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of various aspects may be employed, and this description is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a wireless communications system and an access network.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a first frame, in accordance with various aspects of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of DL channels within a subframe, in accordance with various aspects of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a second frame, in accordance with various aspects of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of UL channels within a subframe, in accordance with various aspects of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a base station and user equipment (UE) in an access network.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a communication diagram of a method of wireless communication.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a communication diagram of a method of wireless communication.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a communication diagram of a method of wireless communication.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a communication diagram of a method of wireless communication.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a flowchart of a method of wireless communication.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a flowchart of a method of wireless communication.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a flowchart of a method of wireless communication.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a flowchart of a method of wireless communication.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a flowchart of a method of wireless communication.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a flowchart of a method of wireless communication.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a hardware implementation for an example apparatus.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a hardware implementation for an example apparatus.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a hardware implementation for an example apparatus.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The detailed description set forth below in connection with the appended drawings is intended as a description of various configurations and is not intended to represent the only configurations in which the concepts described herein may be practiced. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of various concepts. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that these concepts may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring such concepts.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Several aspects of telecommunication systems will now be presented with reference to various apparatus and methods. These apparatus and methods will be described in the following detailed description and illustrated in the accompanying drawings by various blocks, components, circuits, processes, algorithms, etc. (collectively referred to as &#x201c;elements&#x201d;). These elements may be implemented using electronic hardware, computer software, or any combination thereof. Whether such elements are implemented as hardware or software depends upon the particular application and design constraints imposed on the overall system.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">By way of example, an element, or any portion of an element, or any combination of elements may be implemented as a &#x201c;processing system&#x201d; that includes one or more processors. Examples of processors include microprocessors, microcontrollers, graphics processing units (GPUs), central processing units (CPUs), application processors, digital signal processors (DSPs), reduced instruction set computing (RISC) processors, systems on a chip (SoC), baseband processors, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), programmable logic devices (PLDs), state machines, gated logic, discrete hardware circuits, and other suitable hardware configured to perform the various functionality described throughout this disclosure. One or more processors in the processing system may execute software. Software shall be construed broadly to mean instructions, instruction sets, code, code segments, program code, programs, subprograms, software components, applications, software applications, software packages, routines, subroutines, objects, executables, threads of execution, procedures, functions, etc., whether referred to as software, firmware, middleware, microcode, hardware description language, or otherwise.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Accordingly, in one or more example embodiments, the functions described may be implemented in hardware, software, or any combination thereof. If implemented in software, the functions may be stored on or encoded as one or more instructions or code on a computer-readable medium. Computer-readable media includes computer storage media. Storage media may be any available media that can be accessed by a computer.

Innovations described herein may be implemented across many differing platform types, devices, systems, shapes, sizes, and packaging arrangements. For example, implementations and/or uses may come about via integrated chip implementations and other non-module-component based devices (e.g., end-user devices, vehicles, communication devices, computing devices, industrial equipment, retail/purchasing devices, medical devices, artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled devices, etc.). While some examples may or may not be specifically directed to use cases or applications, a wide assortment of applicability of described innovations may occur. Implementations may range a spectrum from chip-level or modular components to non-modular, non-chip-level implementations and further to aggregate, distributed, or original equipment manufacturer (OEM) devices or systems incorporating one or more aspects of the described innovations. In some practical settings, devices incorporating described aspects and features may also include additional components and features for implementation and practice of claimed and described aspect. For example, transmission and reception of wireless signals necessarily includes a number of components for analog and digital purposes (e.g., hardware components including antenna, RF-chains, power amplifiers, modulators, buffer, processor(s), interleaver, adders/summers, etc.). It is intended that innovations described herein may be practiced in a wide variety of devices, chip-level components, systems, distributed arrangements, aggregated or disaggregated components, end-user devices, etc. of varying sizes, shapes, and constitution.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a wireless communications system and an access network <b>100</b>.

A heterogeneous network may also include Home Evolved Node Bs (eNBs) (HeNBs), which may provide service to a restricted group known as a closed subscriber group (CSG). The communication links <b>120</b> between the base stations <b>102</b> and the UEs <b>104</b> may include uplink (UL) (also referred to as reverse link) transmissions from a UE <b>104</b> to a base station <b>102</b> and/or downlink (DL) (also referred to as forward link) transmissions from a base station <b>102</b> to a UE <b>104</b>.

The communication links may be through one or more carriers. The base stations <b>102</b>/UEs <b>104</b> may use spectrum up to Y MHz (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 20, 100, 400, etc. MHz) bandwidth per carrier allocated in a carrier aggregation of up to a total of Yx MHz (x component carriers) used for transmission in each direction. The carriers may or may not be adjacent to each other. Allocation of carriers may be asymmetric with respect to DL and UL (e.g., more or fewer carriers may be allocated for DL than for UL). The component carriers may include a primary component carrier and one or more secondary component carriers. A primary component carrier may be referred to as a primary cell (PCell) and a secondary component carrier may be referred to as a secondary cell (SCell).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Certain UEs <b>104</b> may communicate with each other using device-to-device (D2D) communication link <b>158</b>. The D2D communication link <b>158</b> may use the DL/UL WWAN spectrum.

The small cell <b>102</b>&#x2032;, employing NR in an unlicensed frequency spectrum, may boost coverage to and/or increase capacity of the access network.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The electromagnetic spectrum is often subdivided, based on frequency/wavelength, into various classes, bands, channels, etc. In 5G NR, two initial operating bands have been identified as frequency range designations FR1 (410 MHz-7.125 GHz) and FR2 (24.25 GHz-52.6 GHz). Although a portion of FR1 is greater than 6 GHz, FR1 is often referred to (interchangeably) as a &#x201c;sub-6 GHz&#x201d; band in various documents and articles. A similar nomenclature issue sometimes occurs with regard to FR2, which is often referred to (interchangeably) as a &#x201c;millimeter wave&#x201d; band in documents and articles, despite being different from the extremely high frequency (EHF) band (30 GHz-300 GHz) which is identified by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) as a &#x201c;millimeter wave&#x201d; band.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The frequencies between FR1 and FR2 are often referred to as mid-band frequencies. Recent 5G NR studies have identified an operating band for these mid-band frequencies as frequency range designation FR3 (7.125 GHz-24.25 GHz). Frequency bands falling within FR3 may inherit FR1 characteristics and/or FR2 characteristics, and thus may effectively extend features of FR1 and/or FR2 into mid-band frequencies. In addition, higher frequency bands are currently being explored to extend 5G NR operation beyond 52.6 GHz. For example, three higher operating bands have been identified as frequency range designations FR4a or FR4-1 (52.6 GHz-71 GHz), FR4 (52.6 GHz-114.25 GHz), and FR5 (114.25 GHz-300 GHz). Each of these higher frequency bands falls within the EHF band.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">With the above aspects in mind, unless specifically stated otherwise, it should be understood that the term &#x201c;sub-6 GHz&#x201d; or the like if used herein may broadly represent frequencies that may be less than 6 GHz, may be within FR1, or may include mid-band frequencies.

In one aspect, the UE context modification message may include a set of candidate subgroups associated with the RRC state change. For example, at <b>724</b>, the AMF <b>706</b> may transmit, to a base station <b>704</b>, a UE context setup message including the updated paging subgroup ID of the UE <b>702</b> based on the RRC state change for the UE <b>702</b>.

The RAN paging assistance information indicates an expected paging probability of the UE. That is, the RAN paging assistance information may include the probability of the UE receiving a paging message expected from the base station. For example, at <b>732</b>, the AMF <b>706</b> may receive, from the base station <b>704</b>, an indication about a change in the RRC connection with the UE <b>702</b> to an RRC idle state.

For example, at <b>734</b>, the AMF <b>706</b> may transmit, to the base station <b>704</b>, an updated paging subgroup ID of the UE <b>702</b> in response to receiving the indication from the base station <b>704</b>.

That is, when the AMF assigns or updates a paging subgroup of the UE, the AMF may also determine a set of candidate subgroups for the UE in the RRC inactive state. After the AMF configures a subgroup for UE, the AMF may provide the information to base station. The AMF may also choose to provide, to base station, the set of candidate subgroups for UE in the RRC inactive state, for use in RRC inactive state. The base station may receive the set of candidate subgroups from the AMF, and the before the base station releases the RRC connection of the UE to RRC inactive state, base station has the option of assigning the UE with a different subgroup selected from the set of candidate subgroup provided by the AMF. Accordingly, the base station may have more control in which paging subgroup to use for the UE in the RRC inactive state, based on its prediction on UE's paging characteristics, e.g., UPAI. The base station may provide the updated paging subgroup ID to the UE in the RRC release message, and the base station may notify the AMF of the UE's updated paging subgroup. For example, the base station may transmit, to the AMF, the RRC inactive transition report including the updated paging subgroup of the UE.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0173">At <b>1216</b>, the core network including the AMF may receive, from the base station, the updated paging subgroup ID of the UE. The updated paging subgroup ID of the UE may be transmitted to the AMF <b>706</b> of the core network including AMF <b>706</b> via the RRC inactive transition report. For example, at <b>738</b>, the core network including the AMF <b>706</b> may receive, from the base station <b>704</b>, the updated paging subgroup ID of the UE <b>702</b>.

When the base station is about to release the UE into the RRC idle state, the AMF may determine to update the paging subgroup of the UE if the AMF anticipate a change in the paging probability in the UE in the RRC idle state. As the AMF is involved in the procedure of releasing the RRC connection to the RRC idle state, the AMF may determine to update the paging subgroup of the UE. For example, at <b>740</b>, the base station <b>704</b> and the AMF <b>706</b> may determine to release the UE <b>702</b> into the RRC idle state.
