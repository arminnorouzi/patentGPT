For example, the liquid phase method has the disadvantages of low production, high costs, being a complex process, and the like. The mechanical method is disadvantageous because it is difficult to grade a powder after preparation, and its purity, fineness and morphology cannot be guaranteed. The rotary electrode method and the gas atomization method are major methods for preparing a high performance alloy powder, but they have the disadvantages of low production efficiency and large energy consumption. The jet mill method and the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation method are suitable for industrialized production of large batches, but have high selectivity for primary metal and alloy. Furthermore, an impurity content, especially an oxygen content, of a metal powder or an alloy powder has a great impact on its performance At present, the impurity content of the metal powder or the alloy powder is mainly controlled by controlling raw material purity and vacuum degree, leading to high costs. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop a new method of preparing a high purity alloy powder material.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In view of the above, it is necessary to provide a method of preparing an aluminum-containing alloy powder and an application thereof for the above problems.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The method of preparing an aluminum-containing alloy powder includes the following steps:</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">At step 1, selecting initial alloy raw materials, melting the initial alloy raw materials based on an ingredient ratio of the initial alloy to obtain a homogeneous initial alloy melt; where a major ingredient of the initial alloy melt is RE<sub>a</sub>Al<sub>b</sub>M<sub>c</sub>T<sub>d</sub>, RE includes at least one of Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, and Lu, M includes at least one of W, Cr, Mo, V, Ta, Nb, Zr, Hf, Ti, Fe, Co and Ni; T is an impurity element including at least one of O, H, N, P, S, F, and Cl; a, b, c and d represent atomic percent contents of corresponding constituent elements respectively and 35%&#x2264;a&#x2264;99.7%, 0.1%&#x2264;b&#x2264;25%, 0.1%&#x2264;c&#x2264;35%, 0&#x2264;d&#x2264;10%;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">at step 2, solidifying the initial alloy melt into an initial alloy ribbon; wherein a solidification structure of the initial alloy ribbon includes a matrix phase and a dispersed particle phase; a melting point of the matrix phase is lower than that of the dispersed particle phase and the dispersed particle phase is wrapped in the matrix phase; an average ingredient of the matrix phase mainly is RE<sub>x1</sub>Al<sub>y1</sub>T<sub>z1</sub>, an ingredient of the dispersed particle phase mainly is M<sub>x2</sub>Al<sub>y2</sub>T<sub>z2</sub>, x1, y1, z1, x2, y2 and z2 represent atomic percent contents of corresponding constituent elements respectively, and 60%&#x2264;x1&#x3c;99.8%, 0.2%&#x2264;y1&#x2264;30%, 0&#x2264;z1&#x2264;30%; 80%&#x2264;x2&#x2264;99.8%, 0.1%&#x2264;y2&#x2264;22%, 0&#x2264;z2&#x2264;1.5% and z2&#x2264;d&#x2264;z1; during the solidification process of the initial alloy melt, the impurity element T in the initial alloy melt is redistributed in the dispersed particle phase and the matrix phase and enriched in the matrix phase so as to purify the dispersed particle phase;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">at step 3, reacting the initial alloy ribbon with an acid solution, wherein the matrix phase in the initial alloy ribbon reacts with an acid to change into an ion entering the solution and the dispersed particle phase not reacting with the acid solution is separated out from the initial alloy ribbon to obtain an aluminum-containing alloy powder material with major ingredient being M<sub>x2</sub>Al<sub>y2</sub>T<sub>z2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In step 1,</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, the impurity element in the initial alloy melt comes from a source including: impurity introduced by the initial alloy raw material and impurity introduced by atmosphere or crucible in a melting process.

In the above alloy material, the addition of the Al element is very important. For example, a titanium alloy Ti6A14V alloy is applied most widely at present. For the Ti6A14V alloy powder, a Ti6A14V alloy melt is usually melted, and then the Ti6A14V alloy powder is obtained by atomization powder making technology. Limited by atomization powder making technology, it is very difficult to obtain an ultrafine Ti6A14V alloy powder, and even a nano-level Ti6A14V alloy powder cannot be obtained by the atomization powder making technology. Therefore, it is of great significance to achieve addition of Al element to a Ti&#x2014;V alloy by a &#x201c;de-phasing&#x201d; method mentioned in the present invention to prepare Ti6A14V alloy powders of different particle sizes. The present invention skillfully finds that, when a considerable content of Al element (e.g. 10 at. % or higher) is added into the alloy formed of RE-M, the Al element in the alloy solidification structure may be present in the matrix phase mainly formed of RE and the dispersed particle phase mainly formed of M at the same time based on a given content distribution relationship. Because the RE-Al matrix phase can be easily removed by reaction with an acid, and Al in the Al-containing dispersed particle phase with M as main is protected by the inert element M and will not be easily removed by the acid (for example, the Ti6A14V alloy has good acid corrosion resistance), it is possible to prepare an aluminum-containing titanium alloy powder by removing the matrix phase through reaction with the acid.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Secondly, by skillful element selection, it is ensured that intermetallic compound formed of RE and M is not generated in the initial alloy ribbon, such that target ingredient alloy particles containing Al and M can be formed in the solidification process of the initial alloy melt and separated in a subsequent process. In the present invention, a metal M containing impurity T, a metal Al and rare earth RE are selected to form an initial alloy melt with a major ingredient being Re<sub>a</sub>Al<sub>b</sub>M<sub>c</sub>T<sub>d </sub>by melting. The solidification structure of the initial alloy melt is formed by a dispersed particle phase with a major ingredient being M<sub>x2</sub>Al<sub>y2</sub>T<sub>z2 </sub>and a matrix phase with an average ingredient mainly being RE<sub>x1</sub>Al<sub>y1</sub>T<sub>z1</sub>, which helps to separate the dispersed particle phase by reaction between the initial alloy ribbon and the acid solution. Specifically, when the initial alloy ribbon reacts with the acid solution, hydrogen ions in the acid solution reacts with the RE element and the Al element in the matrix phase to dissolve the RE element and the Al element into ions entering the solution. Al subjected to solution treatment in the dispersed particle phase with a major ingredient being M<sub>x2</sub>Al<sub>y2</sub>T<sub>z2 </sub>is protected by the inert element M and not easy to react with the acid solution. Therefore, after the matrix phase is removed by reaction with the acid solution, the dispersed particle phase with a major ingredient being M<sub>x2</sub>Al<sub>y2</sub>T<sub>z2 </sub>can be separated out in a dispersion manner to obtain an aluminum-containing alloy powder with a major ingredient being M<sub>x2</sub>Al<sub>y2</sub>T<sub>z2</sub>. Based on different cooling rates of the initial alloy ribbon, the particle size of the dispersed particle phase with a major ingredient being M<sub>x2</sub>Al<sub>y2</sub>T<sub>z2 </sub>may be nano-level, sub-micron-level, micron-level and even millimeter-level. In this case, the particle size of the aluminum-containing alloy powder prepared by it may also be nano-level, sub-micron-level, micron-level and even millimeter-level.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Thirdly, an aluminum-containing alloy powder with monocrystalline particles as main may be obtained. Compared with polycrystalline powder, the monocrystalline powder can obtain prominent and beneficial effects. In a solidification process of the initial alloy melt, Each endogenous dispersed particle is nucleated at a particular position in the melt and then grown up in a specific atomic arrangement manner. By controlling the volume percent content of the matrix phase, it is ensured that in a case that each endogenous particle that can be dispersed for distribution, combined growth is difficult to occur between the endogenous particles. Therefore, most of the finally-obtained dispersed particle phases are monocrystalline phase. For the dendritic particles with scale up to dozens of microns or millimeter-level, the growth direction of each secondary dendrite is in a phase relationship with that of the main dendrite and they still belong to monocrystalline particles. For a polycrystalline material, the grain boundary typically contains an impurity element drained from crystals in a solidification process, and thus, it is very difficult to obtain a high purity polycrystalline powder material. When a powder material is mainly composed of monocrystalline particles, its purity is necessarily guaranteed. Furthermore, the surface atoms of the monocrystalline particles have specific arrangement, for example, (111)-faced arrangement etc. These specific arrangements will endow the monocrystalline powder material special mechanical, physical and chemical performances, thereby resulting in beneficial effects.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Fourthly, a high purity aluminum-containing alloy powder is prepared using a low purity raw material, which proposes a new way to prepare a high purity metal powder material using a low purity raw material, bringing great significance. In the present invention, the purity of the high purity aluminum-containing alloy powder is improved mainly by the following two mechanisms: 1) absorption effect of rare earth RE for the impurity element T of the initial alloy melt. Since there is a strong affinity between the selected rare earth RE and the impurity element T, the impurity element T in the initial alloy melt may either enter, in a larger amount, the matrix phase mainly formed by the RE element or form molten slag with rare earth RE in a case of a molten state and removed by separating from the alloy melt; 2) during a nucleation growth process of the aluminum-containing endogenous alloy powder (endogenously separated dispersed particle phase), the impurity element T may be drained into the remaining melt. As long as the aluminum-containing endogenous alloy powder is separated out no later than the matrix phase in a solidification process, its impurity will be enriched in a finally-solidified melt portion, that is, the melt portion which is mainly composed of rare earth RE and solidified into the matrix phase. The result of the two mechanisms is that the impurity element T is enriched in the matrix phase mainly composed of rare earth RE and the aluminum-containing endogenous dispersed particle phase is purified. Furthermore, due to presence of a second phase matrix, the crucible interacts with the melt during a melting process such that the crucible-related impurities entering the melt are also generally enriched in the second phase matrix, which further reduces the content of the impurity of the aluminum-containing alloy powder. This way, requirements for the crucible in a melting process are further lowered, greatly reducing production costs.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Fifthly, in the alloy ribbon composed of the endogenous aluminum-containing alloy powder and the wrapping body, the in-situ generated matrix phase is used creatively to wrap the endogenous aluminum-containing alloy powder to maintain high purity and high activity of the endogenous aluminum-containing alloy powder. Specifically, for a metal alloy powder prepared by using a conventional chemical or physical method, especially a nanopowder with a extremely large specific surface area, it is extremely easily subjected to autoxidation and all are faced up with difficult storage of powder. For this problem, in one of the technical solutions of the present invention, after an alloy ribbon composed of an endogenous aluminum-containing alloy powder and a wrapping body is prepared, the wrapping body is not removed but directly used to protect the endogenous aluminum-containing alloy powder from autoxidation. The alloy ribbon composed of an endogenous aluminum-containing alloy powder and a wrapping body can be used directly as raw material for downstream production. Therefore, it has the potential to become one category of special products. When the downstream production needs to use a high purity endogenous aluminum-containing alloy powder, a proper time may be selected based on characteristics of a next procedure to release the endogenous aluminum-containing alloy powder from the wrapping body of the alloy ribbon by use of an acid solution in a proper environment and enable the released endogenous aluminum-containing alloy powder to enter a next production flow as soon as possible, such that the possibility that the aluminum-containing alloy powder is contaminated by the impurity such as oxygen is greatly reduced. For example, when the endogenous aluminum-containing alloy powder is a nanopowder, the aluminum-containing alloy powder may be compounded with resin while released from the wrapped body or immediately after being released from the wrapped body, so as to prepare a resin-based compound material added with a high activity aluminum-containing nano-alloy powder.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Sixthly, in step 2, a solid state alloy obtained by solidification in step 2 is a ribbon shape, and it ensures the homogeneity of product shape and the feasibility of mass production. When the alloy ribbon is a thin alloy ribbon, it can be prepared by using spinning As long as a flow rate of the alloy melt flowing into a rotary roller is fixed and the rotation speed of the rotary roller is fixed, a thin alloy ribbon with a uniform thickness can be obtained. Furthermore, the preparation process can be carried out continuously, enabling mass production. When the alloy ribbon is a thick alloy ribbon, it can be prepared by a mature continuous casting with its principle similar to spinning, or a continuous thick ribbon with uniform thickness may be obtained by use of a melt, where the preparation process can be carried out continuously, helping mass production. When the alloy ribbon is of uniform thickness, the cooling rate is also uniform and the particle size of the obtained dispersed particles is also uniform. Comparatively, when the solid state alloy obtained by solidification is in the shape of a cast ingot, based on common knowledge, the cast ingot does not have uniform thickness nor obvious length and generally causes the internal melt to have difficulty in heat dissipation and thus an exceptionally large endogenous particles can be obtained easily.

Generally, the particle size of the dispersed particle phase with an ingredient being M<sub>x2</sub>Al<sub>y2 </sub>is in negative correlation relationship with a cooling rate of the alloy melt, that is, the larger the solidification rate of the alloy melt is, the smaller the particle size of the dispersed particle phase is. Therefore, the solidification rate of the alloy melt is preferably in a range of 0.001 K/s to 10<sup>7 </sup>K/s, such that the particle size of the dispersed particle phase with an ingredient being M<sub>x2</sub>Al<sub>y2 </sub>in the initial alloy is in a range of 2 nm to 50 mm, so as to prepare different morphologies of aluminum-containing alloy powders of nano-level, sub-micron-level, micron-level and millimeter-level.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">In the above sub-step (3), a solidification structure of the initial alloy obtained by solidifying the alloy melt includes a matrix phase and a dispersed particle phase, and the dispersed particle phase is particle phase distributed in the matrix phase in a dispersion manner. An average ingredient of the matrix phase is RE<sub>x1</sub>Al<sub>y1</sub>, an ingredient of the dispersed particle phase is M<sub>x2</sub>Al<sub>y2</sub>, and a small amount of Al subjected to solution treatment in the dispersed particle phase with an ingredient being M<sub>x2</sub>Al<sub>y2 </sub>is protected by the inert element M and thus difficult to react with the acid solution. The matrix phase with an average ingredient being RE<sub>x1</sub>Al<sub>y1 </sub>is active ingredient and very easy to react with the acid.

The solidification structure of the initial alloy is formed by a dispersed particle phase with an ingredient being M<sub>x2</sub>Al<sub>y2 </sub>and a matrix phase with an average ingredient being RE<sub>x1</sub>Al<sub>y1</sub>, which aids in separating the dispersed particle phase through reaction between the initial alloy and an acid solution. Specifically, when the initial alloy reacts with the acid solution, hydrogen ions in the acid solution react with the rare earth element and the Al element in the matrix phase to dissolve the rare earth element and the Al element into ions entering the solution, and a small amount of Al subjected to solution treatment in the dispersed particle phase with an ingredient being M<sub>x2</sub>Al<sub>y2 </sub>is protected by the inert element M and thus difficult to react with the acid solution. Therefore, after the matrix phase with an average ingredient being RE<sub>x1</sub>Al<sub>y1 </sub>is removed by reacting with the acid solution, the dispersed particle phase with an ingredient being M<sub>x2</sub>Al<sub>y2 </sub>is separated out by dispersion to obtain an aluminum-containing alloy powder with an ingredient being M<sub>x2</sub>Al<sub>y2</sub>. The particle size of the aluminum-containing alloy powder may be nano-level, sub-micron-level, micron-level and even millimeter-level.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">Secondly, since a large amount of rare earth element exists in the alloy melt obtained by melting the raw materials in the present disclosure, even if oxygen element enters the alloy melt, all of the oxygen elements will be absorbed quickly by the rare earth element so as to form a dense oxidized rare earth protection film covering a surface of the alloy melt, thus preventing the oxygen element from further entering the channel of the alloy melt. Therefore, in the sub-step (2) of the present disclosure, the raw materials can be melted under a low vacuum condition or even under an atmospheric environment condition. Furthermore, the rare earth element in the alloy melt has good absorption not only for oxygen element but also for other various impurity elements in the raw materials M and Al. Therefore, the dispersed particle phase in the initial alloy obtained by solidification in sub-step (3) will not be contaminated by the oxygen element and has a lower impurity element content than the raw materials M and Al. Therefore, these impurity elements may enter the matrix phase with an average ingredient being RE<sub>x1</sub>Al<sub>y1 </sub>and are removed along with the reaction between the matrix phase with an average ingredient being RE<sub>x1</sub>Al<sub>y1 </sub>and the acid, such that the aluminum-containing alloy powder with an ingredient being M<sub>x2</sub>Al<sub>y2 </sub>has a lower impurity content than the raw materials M and Al.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Therefore, the preparation method features simple process, easy operation and low cost and can prepare different morphologies of aluminum-containing alloy powders of nano-level, sub-micron-level, micron-level and millimeter-level. The aluminum-containing alloy powder has good application prospect in the fields such as photo-electronic devices, absorbing materials, catalysts, 3D metal printing, metal injection molding and corrosion-resistant coating.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0133" num="0132"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an energy spectrum diagram illustrating a Ti&#x2014;V&#x2014;Al powder according to a fifth example of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a scanning electron micrograph illustrating a Ti&#x2014;V&#x2014;Al powder according to a sixth example of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a scanning electron micrograph illustrating a Ti&#x2014;V&#x2014;Al powder according to a seventh example of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a scanning electron micrograph illustrating a Ti&#x2014;V&#x2014;Al powder according to an eighth example of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an energy spectrum diagram illustrating a Ti&#x2014;V&#x2014;Al powder according to an eighth example of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0138" num="0137">A method of preparing an aluminum-containing alloy powder and an application thereof according the present disclosure will be further described below in combination with the accompanying drawings.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">EXAMPLE 1</heading><p id="p-0139" num="0138">The example provides a method of preparing a micron-level Ti&#x2014;V&#x2014;Cr&#x2014;Mo&#x2014;Zr&#x2014;Al alloy powder.
