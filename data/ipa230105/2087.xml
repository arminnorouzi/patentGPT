Both application PCT/EP2021/052442 and DE 10 2020 102 768.0 are herewith incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present application relates to modular isolator systems and methods for filling a container with a liquid. Further, the present application relates to a transfer station and method for transferring a container between a first module and a second module.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present application is primarily concerned with aseptic isolators which have a filling area for fluid filling of objects (e.g. vials, cartridges, bottles, syringes and/or the like), for example by means of filling needles. The term &#x201c;isolator&#x201d; is generally understood to mean an enclosed space which is hermetically and gas-tightly sealed from the surrounding working space. Within an isolator, a defined atmosphere can be generated for processing sensitive or hazardous products. For this purpose, for example, a ventilation system can be provided by means of which the defined atmosphere is generated.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In this context, isolators are commonly used in biopharmaceutical process technology, for example as part of a filling line with multiple process and processing stations, to create a highly clean or sterile, i.e. germ-free, environment and to avoid contamination by germs, in particular bacteria, viruses, pathogens and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The transfer of the objects between the individual processing stations as well as the handling of the handling of the objects at the individual processing stations can, for example, be carried out manually by means of glove port by an operator. The glove port can also be used to handle the germ monitoring during production or possibly to carry out troubleshooting. However, this &#x201c;manual&#x201d; handling by means of glove port is enormously time-consuming. Furthermore, glove pass-throughs, which in practice are made of rubber or plastic, especially butyl, can be damaged when gripping the objects to be handled. Glove ports thus also pose an increased risk of contamination and/or safety as a result of leakage. The non-use and, in the best case, the omission of these glove ports thus eliminates the risk of contamination that they pose.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, to reduce this risk of contamination within an isolator, handling equipment, such as robots, are used within the isolator to transfer the objects to be filled within the isolator between the individual processing stations and to handle the objects at the individual processing stations.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, WO 2016/198391 A1 discloses a method for filling and closing bottles, cartridges, syringes and the like, the bottles, cartridges, syringes and the like being generally referred to as containers, such containers being individually housed in respective seats of a first nest which in turn is contained in a first transport tray. The method comprises feeding the containers individually housed in respective seats of the first nest, which in turn is associated with the first transport tray; removing at least one individual container at a time from the first nest; and transferring the at least one container to a filling station to fill it with a substance; transferring the at least one filled container to a stopper placing station to place a stopper on the container; transferring the at least one filled container to a crimping station, the container being passed through a partition; sealing the at least one container at the crimping station; inserting the at least one sealed container into a respective seat of a second nest. The filling station and the stopper placing station are arranged in a filling module. The crimping station is arranged in a crimping module. The partition is arranged between the filling module and the crimping module. The filling module and the crimping module each have a handling device by means of which the containers are handled in the respective module.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, the known isolator systems and processes still leave room for improvement in terms of throughput rate, design and handling.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, it is an object of the present application to provide an improved isolator system and an improved method for filling a container with a liquid.

In particular, the individual modules of the system may be arranged within the isolator. Furthermore, the isolator system can also be an isolator in which the individual modules of the system are arranged.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0029">The container is preferably a pharmaceutical container, for example a syringe, vial, bottle, cylindrical ampoule or the like. The container is preferably cylindrical in shape. This means that the container is circular cylindrical in cross-section. The liquid is preferably a pharmaceutical, cosmetic or toxic liquid.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0030">The filling station has means for filling the container. For example, the filling station can have one or more filling needles for dispensing the liquid into a container. The filling station can also have a metering device by means of which the quantity of liquid to be dispensed can be metered. The filling station can be connected to a fluid reservoir, in particular a tank, via one or more hoses. The metering device may be arranged in a fluid path between the liquid reservoir and the filling needle. The fluid reservoir may be arranged inside or outside the filling module. Furthermore, the filling station can be designed in such a way that several, in particular two, containers can be filled simultaneously. For this purpose, the filling station can, for example, have several, in particular two, filling needles.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0031">The stopper placing station has means for setting a stopper. For this purpose, the stopper placing station can have, for example, a support structure and stopper insertion device that can be moved by means of the support structure. The stopper placing device is designed to insert a stopper into the opening of the container. The stopper placing station may further comprise a feeder through which the stoppers are fed to the stopper insertion device. The stopper placing station may be connected to a stopper reservoir in which a plurality of stoppers are stored. The stopper reservoir may comprise a singling device in which the stoppers are singled before they are fed singled via the feed to the stopper placing device. Alternatively, the feed can be carried out via loose provision of the stoppers on a plate. The position of the stoppers can be detected via a sensor device, for example a camera. The stopper placing device can have a robot that picks up a stopper on the basis of the detected position and feeds it to the stopper placing device or places it directly on the container. Furthermore, the stopper placing station can be designed in such a way that a stopper can be placed on several, in particular two, containers at the same time.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0032">Each handling device has means for handling the container. For example, each handling device can have a robot with an end effector. The robot can, for example, have a carrier structure, preferably with multiple axes, to the end of which the end effector is attached. By means of the carrier structure, the end effector can be moved within the filling module. The end effector can be designed to handle the container. For this purpose, the end effector may comprise a gripping tool by means of which the end effector can grip the container.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0033">Transferring the container means that the container is moved from a first location, for example the filling station, to a second location, for example the stopper placing station. To transfer the container, a handling device can, for example, pick up or grip the container at the first location, move it to the second location and release it again at the second location.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0034">Furthermore, each handling device can be designed in such a way that it can handle several, in particular two, containers simultaneously. For this purpose, each handling device can, for example, have an end effector with several, in particular two, gripping tools.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0035">The control device is set up to control one or more, in particular all, modules of the isolator system. For this purpose, the control device can send control commands to the handling devices and stations of the respective module of the isolator system in order to execute the respective control steps of the process. For example, the control device may send control commands to the filling station to fill the container. Further, the control device may send control commands to one or more handling devices to transfer the container. Further, the control device may send control commands to the stopper placing station to place a stopper on the container.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0036">For this purpose, the control device may comprise a programmable logic controller (PLC), an integrated circuit (IC) (for example, a microcontroller, a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)) or a computer with a processor, by means of which the control commands are generated according to a predetermined program. The program may be stored on a permanent storage medium, for example.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0037">Up to now, it has been common practice in the state of the art for only one handling device to be used in a filling module, by means of which a container is transferred to a filling station, transferred from the filling station to a stopper placing station after filling, and transferred further from the stopper placing station after placing.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0038">Due to the fact that the filling module has several handling devices for handling the container, it is possible that the individual transfer steps are performed by different handling devices. In particular, if several containers are filled one after the other in the filling module, several containers can be transferred simultaneously to different processing stations in the filling module. In particular, the steps of first transferring, second transferring, and third transferring can be performed in parallel for different containers. For example, a container to be filled can be transferred from the transfer station to the filling station by means of a first handling device, while an already filled container is transferred from the filling station to the stopper placing station or from the stopper placing station to the second transfer station by means of a second handling device. In this way, compared to handling by means of a single handling device, the throughput rate or processing speed can be increased. In other words, this increases the throughput rate in the filling process.<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0039">In a third aspect, an isolator system for filling a container with a liquid is provided, the isolator system comprising:</li>        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0040">a filling module having a filling station for filling the container with the liquid and having a first handling device for handling the container within the filling module;</li>        <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0041">a first transfer station for transferring the container to be filled into the filling module; and</li>        <li id="ul0008-0004" num="0042">a control device,</li>        <li id="ul0008-0005" num="0043">wherein the filling station comprises a filling needle for dispensing the liquid, the control device being arranged to control the filling station and the first handling device such that the following steps are performed:</li>        <li id="ul0008-0006" num="0044">first transferring of the container to be filled from the first transfer station to the filling station by means of the first handling device;</li>        <li id="ul0008-0007" num="0045">filling the container with the liquid in the filling station by means of the filling needle; and</li>        <li id="ul0008-0008" num="0046">moving the container relative to the filling needle by means of the first handling device while the container is being filled.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0025" num="0047">In a fourth aspect, a method of filling a container with a liquid in a filling module of an isolator system is provided, the method comprising the steps of:<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0048">arranging the container to be filled in a first transfer station for transferring the container into the filling module;</li>        <li id="ul0010-0002" num="0049">first transferring of the container from the first transfer station to a filling station of the filling module by means of a first handling device of the filling module;</li>        <li id="ul0010-0003" num="0050">filling the container with the liquid in the filling station by means of a filling needle of the filling station; and</li>        <li id="ul0010-0004" num="0051">moving the container relative to the filling needle by means of the first handling device while the container is being filled.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0026" num="0052">In the prior art, it has been common practice for the container to be filled to be first deposited in the filling station and then filled. During filling, the filling needle carrier carrying the filling needles is moved relative to the container so that the filling needles are moved relative to the container to avoid bubbles forming in the container during filling. For this purpose, the filling needle is moved during filling in such a way that the tip of the filling needle is located close to the surface of the liquid.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0053">According to the third and fourth aspects, it is now proposed to perform this relative movement by means of the first handling device instead.

The nest can be introduced into the isolator in a transport trough (tub) via a transfer lock. The transfer lock represents a plant inlet. The transfer lock can be designed as an H2O2 lock. In addition to an H2O2 airlock, there are other ways in which the transfer tray can enter the removal module. For example, decontamination chambers using electron beam, plasma beam, gamma beam or nitrogen dioxide processes may be used. It is also possible to work without sterilization procedures by pushing or transferring the transport tubs directly into the removal module after cutting open the outer bag. The transport tray can be inserted manually or mechanically into the transfer gate on the input side after an outer bag in particular has been cut open around it. Furthermore, the transport tray can be opened, the opened outer bag and/or an inner bag can be removed and/or the nest can be lifted out of the transport tray. With the airlock closed, the transport tray is then decontaminated with nest, if necessary, via hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or one of the other methods above. Access to the removal module is then opened and processing begins. The removal module may include a removal station and a handling device. In the removal station, the nest may be held or parked, while the handling device removes each container individually from the nest, transfers it to the first transfer station, and places it therein for transfer to the filling module. The handling device can also be designed in such a way that it can remove several, in particular two, containers simultaneously from the nest and arrange them in the transfer station.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0074">In a further refinement, the removal module is arranged upstream of the filling module.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0075">The removal module is thus arranged before the filling module.

In the crimping station, the container is closed by means of a lid, in particular an aluminum cap. For this purpose, the lid is placed on the opening of the container in the crimping station and crimped on the upper edge of the container. This process is therefore also referred to as &#x201c;crimping&#x201d;. The crimping station may further include a feeder through which lids can be fed. The crimping station may be connected to a lid reservoir in which a plurality of lids are stored. The lid reservoir may have a singling device in which the lids are singled before they are fed singled via the feed to the crimping station. The filled container may be transferred from the second transfer gate to the crimping station by one or more of the handling device. Alternatively, the feeding can be done by loosely providing the lids on a plate. The position of the lids may be detected by a sensor device, such as a camera. The crimping station can have a robot that picks up a lid based on the detected position and feeds it to the crimping station or places it directly on the opening of the container.

Alternatively, the freeze-dryer can also be arranged outside the isolator, whereby the freeze-dryer can be coupled to the isolator, in particular to the freeze-drying module. The freeze-drying module may further comprise one or more handling devices for handling the filled container. By means of the handling devices, the container may be handled, in particular transferred, within the freeze-drying module. In particular, the container can be inserted into the freeze-dryer by means of one of the handling devices and removed from the freeze-dryer after freeze-drying. For filling the freeze-dryer, it can also be provided that one or more trays are loaded with containers to be freeze dried and the freeze-dryer is loaded therewith. After freeze-drying, the trays can be unloaded from the freeze-dryer and the freeze-dried containers removed from the tray. The freeze-dryer can be loaded with an entire batch or batch of containers.

For example, for exterior washing, the container may be rinsed with a sterile liquid, particularly sterile water, and/or blown off with an inert gas or sterile air to remove the contaminants. For example, the external washing station may have an array of nozzles from which sterile water exits for cleaning and sterile air exits for drying. Preferably, cleaning agents, such as caustic soda, are mixed with the sterile water.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0102">In another refinement, the external washing module is arranged downstream of the crimping module.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0103">After the container has been sealed, it is thus washed externally in the external washing module to remove any contamination that may have occurred.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0104">In a further refinement, the isolator system further comprises a sixth transfer station between the crimping module and the external washing module for transferring the container between the crimping module and the external washing module.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0105">In this way, the container can be sealed in the crimping module and transferred directly to the external washing module for external washing.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0106">In a further refinement, the isolator system comprises a transport device configured to discharge the container after exterior washing.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0107">The removal of the containers can be designed in different ways. For example, the container can be pushed out into a magazine outside the isolator. Furthermore, the container can be placed on a conveyor belt with corresponding transport out of the isolator. Further, the container may be deposited into a transport screw with appropriate discharge out of the isolator. Furthermore, a unit may be provided by means of which the container is inserted into a nest which is transported out of the isolator with appropriate removal.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0108">In a further refinement, the isolator system is configured such that the container is transferred back through the individual modules into the removal module after filling and stopper placing in the filling module or after capping in the crimping module or after external washing in the external washing module, wherein the removal module is configured to place the container back into the nest from which it was removed.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0109">Preferably, the handling devices of the individual modules are designed to transfer the container from the filling module or from the crimping module or from the external washing module back to the removal module. In this way, for example, containers can be filled, closed or externally washed at the same time, while finished, in particular filled, closed, or externally washed, containers are transferred back in counterflow in the direction of the removal module. In particular, the individual transfer stations are designed to allow, especially simultaneously, transfer in both directions between the respective adjacent modules. For example, the handling devices can be controlled in such a way that they transfer a container still to be finished to a transfer station on the way forward, and remove a finished container from the transfer station on the way back and transfer it back. The simultaneous transfer of the containers in both directions can be referred to as the counterflow principle. After transferring back into the nest, the nest can be placed back into a transfer tray, which is then transferred out of the isolator by means of the transfer gate or another outlet. The counterflow principle does not affect the throughput of containers in the execution, or only insignificantly, since the handling devices travel on the return path with or without processed containers. By means of this counterflow principle, the containers can therefore be returned to the nest and discharged with it in a simple manner without the need for further handling devices.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0110">In a further refinement, a partition is arranged between successive modules of the isolator system.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0111">The individual modules are separated from each other by the partitions. The pressure ratios in the individual modules can be different. In particular, the pressure in the filling module can be higher than in the remaining modules. Preferably, there is an overpressure in each module. The partitions allow an individual pressure to be set in each module. In special applications, for example when processing toxic products, provision can be made for the pressure in the filling module to be lower than in the remaining modules.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0112">In a further refinement, the respective transfer station for transferring the container between the corresponding modules is arranged in each partition.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0113">A transfer of containers between the modules is thus only possible via the transfer stations. Each transfer station thus forms a transition between the modules separated by the respective partition wall.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0114">In a further refinement, each module of the isolator system has at least two handling devices for handling the container in the corresponding module.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0115">By means of two handling devices, the control steps in each module can be executed more quickly, since the respective process steps can be divided between the two handling devices. In this way, individual process steps can be carried out simultaneously when handling several containers, thus increasing the throughput rate, in particular doubling it.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0116">In a further refinement, the isolator system further comprises decontamination device for decontaminating at least one module of the isolator system, wherein at least one module selected from a list comprising the filling module, the removal module, the crimping module, the freeze-drying module, the transferring module, and the external washing module is coupleable to the decontamination device to decontaminate at least the module.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0117">The decontamination device can, for example, gasify the coupled module with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for decontamination. In this way, the corresponding module is decontaminated. If several modules are coupled and not isolated from each other, these modules can be decontaminated simultaneously, for example by gassing them together with hydrogen peroxide. The isolator system can have a ventilation device by means of which the defined atmosphere is generated in the isolator. The ventilation device is coupled to each module of the isolator system. The decontamination device may be coupled to the modules of the isolator system via the ventilation device to gas all modules simultaneously or only selectively gas individual modules with H2O2 to contaminate these modules. During initial decontamination at the start of production and/or at the end of production, the complete room is decontaminated across all modules.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0118">In a further refinement, each transfer station is lockable to isolate the respective adjacent modules from each other.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0119">In this way, the transfer station can be closed during decontamination in order to isolate a module to be decontaminated from the neighboring modules. This makes it possible to decontaminate a single module in a targeted manner, which is significantly faster than decontaminating the entire isolator system. This is particularly advantageous if contamination only occurs in a specific module and only this module needs to be decontaminated. The contamination of a single module may be necessary if there is a malfunction in the container handling process. In order to eliminate the malfunction manually, it may be necessary to open an isolator door to the corresponding module. By this opening, the interior of the isolator becomes unsterile. If the corresponding module is isolated from the other modules, only the corresponding module becomes unsterile when the isolator door is opened, so that only decontamination of the individual module is required, which then takes only a short period of time.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0120">In another refinement, each transfer station includes at least one receptacle for receiving the container.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0121">To transfer a container between two modules, the container can be inserted into the holder of the transfer station by means of a handling device of the transferring module and removed from the holder again by means of a further handling device of the receiving module. In this way, a simple transfer between modules is made possible.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0122">In a further refinement, the receptacle is open in a transfer direction between the adjacent modules towards the adjacent modules, so that the container can be inserted into the receptacle by means of a handling device in the transfer direction and removed from the receptacle by means of a handling device in the transfer direction.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0123">In this way, the container can be inserted into or removed from the fixture directly in the transfer direction without requiring movement perpendicular to the transfer direction. This allows the container to be easily transferred between two modules, simplifying handling and increasing the throughput rate.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0124">In a further refinement, each transfer station includes a retaining device configured to hold the container in the respective receptacle.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0125">If the container is arranged in the holder, the container is held by the retaining device.

In particular, the filling station and the stoppering station can be designed so that two containers can be filled or stoppered at the same time. In this way, the throughput rate of the filling module is doubled. In particular, each handling device can have two gripping tools with which two containers can be gripped and transferred simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0128">In another refinement, each module is designed to handle two containers simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0129">For this purpose, each handling device can be designed in such a way that it can handle two containers simultaneously. In particular, each handling device can have two gripping tools with which two containers can be gripped and transferred simultaneously. Further, each transfer station may have at least two, preferably four or more, receptacles for receiving one container each. Further, each station of the modules may be configured to handle two containers simultaneously. For example, two containers can be removed from the nest in the removal station, two containers can be filled in the filling station, two stoppers can be placed on two containers in the stopper placing station, two containers can be capped in the crimping station, two containers can be inserted or removed in the freeze-dryer, and two containers can be exterior washed in the exterior washing module.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0130">In a further refinement, the filling station comprises a filling needle for dispensing the liquid, wherein in the filling step the container is filled by means of the filling needle.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0131">In other words, the filling needle releases the liquid into the container during filling. The filling needle can be arranged in the container or above an opening of the container for this purpose.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0132">In another refinement, the filling needle is inserted into the container through an opening of the container for filling.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0133">As a result, the filling needle is positioned in the container during filling. In this way, the container can be filled faster with less bubble formation at the same time.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0134">In a further refinement, the control device is arranged to control the first handling device such that the following step is performed:<ul id="ul0013" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0013-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0014" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0014-0001" num="0135">moving the container relative to the filling needle by means of the first handling device while the container is being filled.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0106" num="0136">In this way, bubble formation can be avoided during filling without the need for additional mechanics to perform a corresponding relative movement. This improves handling during the filling process and increases the throughput rate.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0137">In a further refinement, at the beginning of the filling, a tip of the filling needle is arranged at the bottom of the container, and wherein in the moving step, the container is moved such that the tip of the filling needle is displaced from the bottom towards the opening of the container.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0138">In this way, the tip of the filling needle can be kept on the surface of the liquid in the container during the filling process, thus avoiding the formation of bubbles.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0139">In a further refinement, the filling station comprises a weighing device for weighing the container.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0140">By means of the weighing device, the amount of liquid in the container can be controlled.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0141">In a further refinement, the control device is arranged to control the first handling device such that the first handling device places the container on the weighing device for weighing before filling and/or after filling.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0142">In this way, the amount of liquid dispensed into the container can be determined from the difference between the determined weight before and after filling and the density of the liquid, and compared with a setpoint value for control purposes.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0143">In a further refinement, the weighing device is arranged below the filling needle.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0144">In this way, weighing before and/or after filling takes place directly below the filling needle.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0145">The container can therefore either remain on the weighing device during filling or is merely moved relative to the filling needle by means of the first handling device. In this way, setup and handling are simplified. In addition, the container does not have to be transferred to a weighing device separated in space, which also increases the throughput rate.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0146">In a further refinement, the filling station comprises a weighing device for weighing the container, the method further comprising the steps of:<ul id="ul0015" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0015-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0016" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0016-0001" num="0147">first weighing of the container before filling the container by means of the weighing device; and/or</li>        <li id="ul0016-0002" num="0148">second weighing of the container after filling the container by means of the weighing device.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0117" num="0149">In this way, the amount of liquid dispensed into the container can be determined from the difference between the determined weight before and after filling and the density of the liquid, and compared with a setpoint value for control purposes.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0150">In a further refinement, the container is placed on the weighing device for weighing before filling and/or after filling by means of the first handling device.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0151">As previously stated, this allows the amount of liquid dispensed into the container to be determined and compared to a set point for control purposes.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0152">In a further refinement, the filling module further comprises a stopper placing station for placing a stopper on the filled container.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0153">In other words, the stopper placing station is designed to insert a stopper into the opening of the container.

The nest can be introduced into the isolator in a transport trough (tub) via a transfer lock. The transfer lock represents a plant inlet. The transfer lock can be designed as an H2O2 lock. In addition to an H2O2 airlock, there are other ways in which the transfer tray can enter the removal module. For example, decontamination chambers using electron beam, plasma beam, gamma beam or nitrogen dioxide processes may be used. It is also possible to work without sterilization procedures by pushing or transferring the transport tubs directly into the removal module after cutting open the outer bag. The transport tray can be inserted manually or mechanically into the transfer gate on the input side after an outer bag in particular has been cut open around it. Furthermore, the transport tray can be opened, the opened outer bag and/or an inner bag can be removed and/or the nest can be lifted out of the transport tray. With the airlock closed, the transport tray is then decontaminated, with nest if necessary, via hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or one of the other methods above. Access to the removal module is then opened and processing begins. The removal module may include a removal station and a handling device. In the removal station, the nest may be held or parked, while the handling device removes each container individually from the nest, transfers it to the first transfer station, and places it therein for transfer to the filling module. The handling device can also be designed in such a way that it can remove several, in particular two, containers simultaneously from the nest and arrange them in the transfer station.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0164">In a further refinement, the method further comprises the step of:<ul id="ul0023" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0023-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0024" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0024-0001" num="0165">capping of the filled container by means of a crimping module.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0129" num="0166">The crimping module can have a crimping station and one or more handling devices for handling the filled container. In the crimping station, the container is closed by means of a lid, in particular an aluminum cap. For this purpose, the lid is placed on the opening of the container in the crimping station and crimped on the upper edge of the container. This process is therefore also referred to as &#x201c;crimping&#x201d;. The crimping station may further include a feeder through which lids can be fed. The crimping station may be connected to a lid reservoir in which a plurality of lids are stored. The lid reservoir may have a singling device in which the lids are singled before they are fed singly via the feed to the crimping station.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0167">The filled container may be transferred from the second transfer gate to the crimping station by one or more of the handling device. Alternatively, the feeding can be done by loosely providing the lids on a plate. The position of the lids may be detected by a sensor device, such as a camera. The crimping station can have a robot that picks up a lid based on the detected position and feeds it to the crimping station or places it directly on the opening of the container. Furthermore, the crimping station can be designed in such a way that several, in particular two, containers can be closed simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0168">In a further refinement, the method further comprises the step of:<ul id="ul0025" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0025-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0026" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0026-0001" num="0169">freeze-drying of the filled container by means of a freeze-drying module.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0132" num="0170">For this purpose, the freeze-drying module can have a freeze-dryer in which the container can be freeze-dried. Alternatively, the freeze-dryer can also be arranged outside the isolator, whereby the freeze-dryer can be coupled to the isolator, in particular to the freeze-drying module. The freeze-drying module may further comprise one or more handling devices for handling the filled container. By means of the handling devices, the container may be handled, in particular transferred, within the freeze-drying module. In particular, the container can be inserted into the freeze-dryer by means of one of the handling devices and removed from the freeze-dryer after freeze-drying. For filling the freeze-dryer, it can also be provided that one or more trays are loaded with containers to be freeze dried and the freeze-dryer is loaded therewith. After freeze-drying, the trays can be unloaded from the freeze-dryer and the freeze-dried containers removed from the tray. The freeze-dryer can be loaded with an entire batch or batch of containers.

For example, for exterior washing, the container may be rinsed with a sterile liquid, particularly sterile water, and/or blown off with an inert gas or sterile air to remove the contaminants. For example, the external washing station may have an array of nozzles from which sterile water exits for cleaning and sterile air exits for drying.

For example, the container can be pushed out into a magazine outside the isolator. Furthermore, the container can be placed on a conveyor belt with corresponding transport out of the isolator. Further, the container may be deposited into a transport screw with appropriate discharge out of the isolator. Furthermore, a unit may be provided by means of which the container is inserted into a nest which is transported out of the isolator with appropriate removal.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0180">In a further refinement, the method further comprises the step of:<ul id="ul0033" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0033-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0034" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0034-0001" num="0181">returning the container to the nest from which it was removed, in particular wherein the container is transferred back to the removal module after filling and stopper placing in the filling module or after capping in the crimping module or after external washing in the external washing module through the individual modules, wherein the removal module is configured to place the container back into the nest from which it was removed.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0140" num="0182">Preferably, the handling devices of the individual modules are designed to transfer the container from the filling module or from the crimping module or from the external washing module back to the removal module. In this way, for example, containers can be filled, closed or externally washed at the same time, while finished, in particular filled, closed, or externally washed, containers are transferred back in counterflow in the direction of the removal module. In particular, the individual transfer stations are designed to allow, especially simultaneously, transfer in both directions between the respective adjacent modules. For example, the handling devices can be controlled in such a way that they transfer a container still to be finished to a transfer station on the way there, and remove a finished container from the transfer station on the way back and transfer it back. The simultaneous transfer of the containers in both directions can be referred to as the counterflow principle. After transferring back into the nest, the nest can be placed back into a transfer tray, which is then transferred out of the isolator by means of the transfer gate. The counterflow principle does not affect the throughput of containers in the execution, or only insignificantly, since the handling equipment travels down the return path with or without processed containers. By means of this counterflow principle, the containers can therefore be returned to the nest and discharged with it in a simple manner without the need for further handling equipment.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0183">In a further refinement, the method further comprises the following steps:<ul id="ul0035" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0035-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0036" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0036-0001" num="0184">coupling at least one module selected from a list comprising the filling module, the removal module, the crimping module, the freeze-drying module, the transferring module, and the external washing module with a decontamination device;</li>        <li id="ul0036-0002" num="0185">decontaminating the module by means of the decontamination device.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0142" num="0186">The decontamination device can, for example, gasify the coupled module with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for decontamination.

The isolator system can have a ventilation device by means of which the defined atmosphere is generated in the isolator. The ventilation device is coupled to each module of the isolator system. The decontamination device may be coupled to the modules of the isolator system via the ventilation device to gas all modules simultaneously or only selectively gas individual modules with H2O2 to contaminate these modules.

This makes it possible to decontaminate a single module in a targeted manner, which is significantly faster than decontaminating the entire isolator system. This is particularly advantageous if contamination only occurs in a specific module and only this module needs to be decontaminated. The contamination of a single module may be necessary if there is a malfunction in the container handling process. In order to eliminate the malfunction manually, it may be necessary to open an isolator door to the corresponding module. By this opening, the interior of the isolator becomes unsterile. If the corresponding module is isolated from the other modules, only the corresponding module becomes unsterile when the isolator door is opened, so that only decontamination of the individual module is required, which then takes only a short period of time.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0190">In a further refinement, each transfer station comprises at least one receptacle for the container, the method further comprising the step of:<ul id="ul0039" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0039-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0040" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0040-0001" num="0191">removing the container to be filled from the receptacle of the first transfer station by means of the first handling device; and</li>        <li id="ul0040-0002" num="0192">inserting the filled container into the receptacle of the second transfer station by means of the second handling device.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0146" num="0193">To transfer a container between two modules, the container can be inserted into the holder of the transfer station by means of a handling device of the transferring module and removed from the holder again by means of a further handling device of the receiving module.

However, the diameters of the containers may be different. The retaining device can be variable or flexible in such a way that it can adapt to the diameter of the containers.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0196">In another refinement, the retaining device comprises elastic elements arranged perpendicular to the transfer direction opposite the receptacle, the elastic elements being arranged to be pushed apart when a container is placed between the elastic elements.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0197">In other words, the elastic elements are arranged so close together that when the container is inserted into the receptacle, the container pushes the elastic elements apart.

In this way, it is achieved, for example, that different containers with different geometries, in particular with different diameters, can be held in the receptacle by means of the retaining device. The clamping elements, in particular the clamping elements designed as spring elements or elastic elements, can form a prism into which the objects are inserted.
