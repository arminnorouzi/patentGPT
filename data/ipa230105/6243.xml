device.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A lithium ion secondary battery is widely in use for electronic equipment such as personal computers and communication terminals, automobiles, and the like because the battery has high energy density. The lithium ion secondary battery generally includes a pair of electrodes, which are electrically separated from each other by a separator, and a nonaqueous electrolyte interposed between the electrodes, and is configured to allow lithium ions to be transferred between the two electrodes for charge-discharge. A capacitor such as a lithium ion capacitor is also widely in use as an energy storage device except for the lithium ion secondary battery.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, as a nonaqueous electrolyte, an energy storage device using a solid electrolyte such as a sulfide solid electrolyte instead of a nonaqueous electrolyte solution in which an electrolyte salt is dissolved in a liquid such as an organic solvent has been proposed. As one of sulfide solid electrolytes, Patent Document 1 describes a sulfide solid electrolyte material which has Li, A (A is at least one of P, Si, Ge, Al, and B), X (X is halogen), and S, is a glass ceramic, and has peaks at 2&#x3b8;=20.2&#xb0; and 23.6&#xb0; in X-ray diffraction measurement using a CuK&#x3b1; ray. In addition, Patent Document 2 describes that a sulfide solid electrolyte having a composition of xLi<sub>2</sub>S-25P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub>-yLi<sub>3</sub>N is produced using Li<sub>2</sub>S, P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub>, and Li<sub>3</sub>N as starting materials.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Patent Document 1: JP-2013-016423</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent Document 2: JP-2018-041671</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Since the sulfide solid electrolyte has low water resistance, there is a disadvantage that the sulfide solid electrolyte reacts with water in the atmosphere. For this reason, even when the sulfide solid electrolyte is left in a dry air atmosphere having a small water content, there is a disadvantage that ionic conductivity decreases by reacting with water, and the ionic conductivity is not sufficiently recovered even if the sulfide solid electrolyte is dried thereafter. Here, Patent Document 2 describes that the water resistance of the sulfide solid electrolyte can be improved by the sulfide solid electrolyte containing nitrogen. However, when Li<sub>3</sub>N is used as a raw material of such a sulfide solid electrolyte, nitrogen is easily discharged to the outside of the system during heat treatment, and a sufficient water resistance improving effect cannot be obtained.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention has been made based on the above circumstances, and an object of the present invention is to provide a solid electrolyte having high water resistance, a method for producing such a solid electrolyte, and an energy storage device using such a solid electrolyte.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">One aspect of the present invention made to solve the above problems is a solid electrolyte containing lithium, phosphorus, sulfur, halogen, and tin as constituent elements and having a crystal structure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another aspect of the present invention is a method for producing a solid electrolyte, including: preparing a composition containing lithium, phosphorus, sulfur, halogen, and tin; reacting the composition to obtain an intermediate; and heating the intermediate.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another aspect of the present invention is an energy storage device containing the solid electrolyte according to one aspect of the present invention.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantages of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to one aspect of the present invention, it is possible to provide a solid electrolyte having high water resistance, a method for producing such a solid electrolyte, and an energy storage device using such a solid electrolyte.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of an all-solid-state battery as an embodiment of an energy storage device of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic view illustrating an energy storage apparatus configured by aggregating a plurality of energy storage devices according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an X-ray diffraction diagram of solid electrolytes of Examples 1, 3, 3&#x2032;, and 5 and Comparative Example 1.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0010" level="1">MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">First, outlines of a solid electrolyte, a method for producing a solid electrolyte, and an energy storage device disclosed in the present specification will be described.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The solid electrolyte according to an embodiment of the present invention is a solid electrolyte containing lithium, phosphorus, sulfur, halogen, and tin as constituent elements and having a crystal structure.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The solid electrolyte has high water resistance. Therefore, according to the solid electrolyte, the ionic conductivity is less likely to decrease when the solid electrolyte is left in a dry air atmosphere or the like, and the recovery rate of the ionic conductivity is also high when the solid electrolyte is dried thereafter. Although the reason why the solid electrolyte exerts such an effect is not clear, the following reason is presumed. The solid electrolyte contains lithium, phosphorus, sulfur, and halogen, and further contains tin as compared with a conventional sulfide solid electrolyte having a crystal structure. According to HSAB (Hard and Soft Acids and Bases) rule, a hard anion (O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup>) is easily bound to a hard cation (P<sup>5+</sup>). Therefore, in the conventional sulfide solid electrolyte, a reaction between water molecules in the atmosphere and phosphorus in the sulfide solid electrolyte easily occurs. On the other hand, in the solid electrolyte according to an embodiment of the present invention, it is presumed that since tin (Sn<sup>4+</sup>) which is a soft cation is contained, a portion easily bonded to oxygen is reduced, and as a result, water resistance is enhanced.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The crystal structure can be confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction measurement. More specifically, &#x201c;having a crystal structure&#x201d; means that a peak derived from the crystal structure of the solid electrolyte is observed in an X-ray diffraction diagram in powder X-ray diffraction measurement. The solid electrolyte may contain an amorphous part. The powder X-ray diffraction measurement is performed by the following procedure. An airtight sample holder for X-ray diffraction measurement is filled with a solid electrolyte powder to be measured in an argon atmosphere having a dew point of &#x2212;50&#xb0; C. or lower. Powder X-ray diffraction measurement is performed using an X-ray diffractometer (&#x201c;MiniFlex II&#x201d; from Rigaku Corporation). A CuK&#x3b1; ray is used as a radiation source, a tube voltage is 30 kV, and a tube current is 15 mA. The diffracted X-ray passes through a K&#x3b2; filter having a thickness of 30 &#x3bc;m and is detected by a high-speed one-dimensional detector (model number: D/teX Ultra 2). A sampling width is 0.01&#xb0;, a scanning speed is 5&#xb0;/min, a divergence slit width is 0.625&#xb0;, a light receiving slit width is 13 mm (OPEN), and a scattering slit width is 8 mm.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The crystal structure of the solid electrolyte preferably has diffraction peaks in a range of 20.2&#xb0;&#xb1;0.5&#xb0; and a range of 23.6&#xb0;&#xb1;0.5&#xb0; in an X-ray diffraction diagram using a CuK&#x3b1; ray. A HICP (High Ion Conduction Phase), which is a high Li ion conductive crystal phase, has diffraction peaks in the range of 20.2&#xb0;&#xb1;0.5&#xb0; and the range of 23.6&#xb0;&#xb1;0.5&#xb0; in the X-ray diffraction diagram using a CuK&#x3b1; ray. Therefore, when such a diffraction peak appears in the solid electrolyte, it can be said that HICP is sufficiently formed, and high ionic conductivity can be exhibited. The &#x201c;X-ray diffraction diagram using a CuK&#x3b1; ray&#x201d; is obtained by the powder X-ray diffraction measurement described above.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The crystal structure of the solid electrolyte preferably has a diffraction peak in a range of 25.6&#xb0;&#xb1;0.5&#xb0; in the X-ray diffraction diagram using a CuK&#x3b1; ray. The phase of Li<sub>4/3</sub>Sn<sub>1/3</sub>S<sub>4/3 </sub>(LSS) having high water resistance has a diffraction peak in the range of 25.6&#xb0;&#xb1;0.5&#xb0; in the X-ray diffraction diagram using a CuK&#x3b1; ray. Therefore, when such a diffraction peak appears in the solid electrolyte, it can be said that the phase of LSS is sufficiently formed, and the water resistance tends to be further enhanced. In addition, the ionic conductivity of the LSS is higher in a glass ceramic state having a crystal structure than in an amorphous state (glass state). Therefore, in the solid electrolyte, for example, even if the solid electrolyte has the same elemental composition, when the solid electrolyte has a diffraction peak in the range of 25.6&#xb0;&#xb1;0.5&#xb0; in the X-ray diffraction diagram using a CuK&#x3b1; ray, the ionic conductivity tends to be further enhanced.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the solid electrolyte, the molar ratio of the content of the tin to the content of the phosphorus is preferably 0.05 or more and 1.0 or less. When the content of tin is in the above range, both water resistance and ionic conductivity can be enhanced in a well-balanced manner.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">It is preferable that the solid electrolyte further contains nitrogen and an element M as constituent elements, and the element M is at least one selected from the group consisting of aluminum, tantalum, silicon, scandium, magnesium, niobium, boron, hafnium, carbon, zirconium, and titanium.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the case of such a solid electrolyte, in the production process of the solid electrolyte, discharge of nitrogen, which is an element for enhancing the water resistance described above, to the outside of the system is suppressed, so that the water resistance is further enhanced. Although the reason therefor is not clear, the following reason is presumed. In the method for producing a sulfide solid electrolyte using Li<sub>3</sub>N disclosed in Patent Document 2, defect generation energy of nitrogen of Li<sub>3</sub>N is small, and nitrogen gas is easily generated. On the other hand, when a raw material compound containing nitrogen and the element M is used, defect generation energy of nitrogen is large, and a nitrogen defect is hardly generated in a synthesis process, so that nitrogen gas is hardly generated. Therefore, it is possible to suppress the discharge of nitrogen to the outside of the system in the production process. The element M is an element having a defect generation energy of nitrogen calculated by first principle calculation described later in a compound represented by A&#x3b1;M&#x3b2;N (A is at least one element selected from the group consisting of lithium, sodium, and potassium, M is the element M, and &#x3b1; and &#x3b2; are numerical values that give a stoichiometric ratio according to the type of the element M) of 4.00 eV or more. The definition of defect generation energy of nitrogen and the like will be described later.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The solid electrolyte preferably contains at least one selected from bromine and iodine as the halogen. When at least one selected from bromine and iodine is contained as the halogen, the ionic conductivity of the solid electrolyte can be further enhanced.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A method for producing a solid electrolyte according to an embodiment of the present invention is a method for producing a solid electrolyte including; preparing a composition containing lithium, phosphorus, sulfur, halogen, and tin; reacting the composition to obtain an intermediate; and heating the intermediate.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to the production method, a solid electrolyte having high water resistance can be produced.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The &#x201c;composition&#x201d; means a mixture obtained by mixing two or more kinds of compounds or simple substances (hereinafter, the compound and the simple substance are also collectively referred to as a compound or the like).

By preparing or synthesizing such a compound in advance, reacting a composition containing the compound to obtain an intermediate, and heating the intermediate, a solid electrolyte having higher water resistance and ionic conductivity can be produced.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">An energy storage device according to an embodiment of the present invention is an energy storage device containing the solid electrolyte. Since the energy storage device uses a solid electrolyte having high water resistance, the reaction of the solid electrolyte with water is suppressed even when the solid electrolyte is placed in the air environment even temporarily during the production process or the like, and good energy storage device performance is exhibited.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Hereinafter, a solid electrolyte, a method for producing a solid electrolyte, and an energy storage device according to an embodiment of the present invention will be sequentially described in detail.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">&#x3c;Solid Electrolyte&#x3e;</heading><heading id="h-0012" level="2">(Composition)</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The solid electrolyte according to an embodiment of the present invention contains lithium, phosphorus, sulfur, halogen, and tin as constituent elements.

(&#x3c3;<sub>25c</sub>/&#x3c3;<sub>25a</sub>) of ionic conductivity after being left in a dry air atmosphere and further dried. It is considered that since the solid electrolytes of Examples contain tin as a constituent element, water resistance is high, and the reaction with water when brought into contact with moisture in the atmosphere is suppressed. In addition, the solid electrolytes of Examples also have a high retention rate (&#x3c3;<sub>25b</sub>/&#x3c3;<sub>25a</sub>) of ionic conductivity after being left in a dry air atmosphere, and thus it can be said that the water resistance is high.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0193">As shown in Tables 4 and 5, it is found that the ionic conductivity is enhanced by setting the content ratio of tin to a relatively small amount, and the water resistance and the ionic conductivity can be optimized in a well-balanced manner by adjusting the content ratio of tin.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0194">In addition, comparing Example 3 and Example 3&#x2032; which are solid electrolytes having the same composition, the solid electrolyte of Example 3 obtained by synthesizing glassy Li<sub>4/3</sub>Sn<sub>1/3</sub>S<sub>4/3 </sub>in advance and then mixing with another raw material compound was slightly more excellent in ionic conductivity and water resistance than the solid electrolyte of Example 3&#x2032; obtained by synthesizing glassy Li<sub>4/3</sub>Sn<sub>1/3</sub>S<sub>4/3 </sub>and mixing with another raw material compound at once.
