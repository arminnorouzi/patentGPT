Generally, the centrifugal fan has a base made of one single type of plastic material or a thin metal plate. In the case of using a plastic base, it is manufactured through a plastic injection molding process. However, since the plastic base has inferior structural strength, the thin metal plate is usually selected as the material for forming the fan base. Thereafter, a vertical side wall is formed along an outer peripheral edge of the metal base by way of an overmolding process to complete the centrifugal fan frame.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As mentioned above, the widely applied centrifugal fan frame generally includes a metal base and a plastic side wall. Usually, the centrifugal fan frame is formed by overmolding the metal base with a plastic molding material. Since the overmolding plastic material tends to produce a wrapping force after the material is molded, and the metal base subjected to the wrapping force tends to be pressed and deformed. In the subsequent assembling process, the deformed base would affect the designed clearance size, horizontality and balance between the fan blades and the base of the finished product of fan. In a worse condition, the fan performance is also affected due to interference of the fan blades with the base, changes in the relationship between the static pressure (P) and air flow rate (Q) of the fan, changes in produced noise, etc.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is therefore desirable to improve the problem of a deformed metal base caused by the insert molded side wall of the centrifugal fan frame.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To effectively solve the above problem, a primary object of the present invention is to provide an improved fan frame structure that can overcome the disadvantage of the conventional injection molded centrifugal fan frame side wall, which tends to cause deformation of the metal base of the fan frame.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To achieve the above and other objects, the fan frame structure according to the present invention includes a base portion and a wall portion.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The base portion includes at least one extension section vertically extended from an outer peripheral edge of the base portion, and the extension section has connecting sides. The wall portion is formed along the outer peripheral edge of the base portion through insert molding and includes a plurality of wall segments. The wall segments are respectively connected to the connecting sides of the extension sections, and a clearance is formed between any two adjacent wall segments. With these arrangements, the fan frame structure has increased capability of resisting a wrapping force applied by the insert molded wall portion to the base portion and preventing the base portion from deformation under the wrapping force.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the fan frame structure of the present invention, since the wall segments are connected to the extension sections in the insert molding process with a clearance reserved between any two adjacent wall segments to provide sufficient expansion allowance for the wall segments, it is able to prevent any expansion of the insert molded wall portion to press against the base portion and deform the latter.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The structure and the technical means adopted by the present invention to achieve the above and other objects can be best understood by referring to the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments and the accompanying drawings, wherein</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of a fan frame structure according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an assembled view of the fan frame structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of a fan frame structure according to another embodiment of the present invention</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention will now be described with some preferred embodiments thereof and by referring to the accompanying drawings.
