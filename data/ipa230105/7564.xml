id="p-0002" num="0001">Embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to wireless communications and, more particularly, to default path assignment for integrated access and backhaul (IAB) networks.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Generally, all terms used herein are to be interpreted according to their ordinary meaning in the relevant technical field, unless a different meaning is clearly given and/or is implied from the context in which it is used. All references to a/an/the element, apparatus, component, means, step, etc. are to be interpreted openly as referring to at least one instance of the element, apparatus, component, means, step, etc., unless explicitly stated otherwise. The steps of any methods disclosed herein do not have to be performed in the exact order disclosed, unless a step is explicitly described as following or preceding another step and/or where it is implicit that a step must follow or precede another step. Any feature of any of the embodiments disclosed herein may be applied to any other embodiment, wherever appropriate. Likewise, any advantage of any of the embodiments may apply to any other embodiments, and vice versa. Other objectives, features, and advantages of the enclosed embodiments will be apparent from the following description.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) includes standards for integrated access and wireless access backhaul (IAB) in fifth generation (5G) new radio (NR). The usage of short range mmWave spectrum in NR creates a need for densified deployment with multi-hop backhauling. However, optical fiber to every base station is costly and sometimes not even possible (e.g., historical sites). The main IAB principle is using wireless links for the backhaul (instead of fiber) to enable flexible and dense deployment of cells without the need for densifying the transport network. Use case scenarios for IAB can include coverage extension, deployment of massive number of small cells and fixed wireless access (FWA) (e.g., to residential/office buildings). The larger bandwidth available for NR in mmWave spectrum provides opportunity for self-backhauling, without limiting the spectrum to be used for the access links. On top of that, the inherent multi-beam and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) support in NR reduce cross-link interference between backhaul and access links facilitating higher densification.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The IAB architecture may leverage the Central Unit (CU)/Distributed Unit (DU) split architecture of NR, where the IAB node hosts a DU part that is controlled by a central unit. The IAB nodes also have a Mobile Termination (MT) part to communicate with their parent nodes.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The specifications for IAB reuses some existing functions and interfaces defined in NR. In particular, MT, gNB-DU, gNB-CU, user plane function (UPF), access and management function (AMF) and session management function (SMF) as well as the corresponding interfaces NR Uu (between MT and gNB), F1, NG, X2 and N4 are used as baseline for the IAB architectures. Modifications or enhancements to these functions and interfaces for the support of IAB is described in more detail in the context of the architecture discussion. Additional functionality, such as multi-hop forwarding, is included in the architecture discussion as it is necessary for the understanding of IAB operation and because certain aspects may require standardization.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The Mobile-Termination (MT) function is a component of the IAB node. As used herein, MT is referred to as a function residing on an IAB-node that terminates the radio interface layers of the backhaul Uu interface toward the IAB-donor or other IAB-nodes.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a high-level architectural view of an IAB network. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a reference diagram for IAB in standalone mode, which contains one IAB-donor and multiple IAB-nodes. The IAB-donor is treated as a single logical node that comprises a set of functions such as gNB-DU, gNB-CU-CP, gNB-CU-UP and potentially other functions. In a deployment, the IAB-donor can be split according to these functions, which can all be either collocated or non-collocated as allowed by 3GPP NG-RAN architecture. IAB-related aspects may anise when such a split is exercised. Also, some of the functions presently associated with the IAB-donor may eventually move outside of the donor in case it becomes evident that they do not perform IAB-specific tasks.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The baseline user plane and control plane protocol stacks for IAB are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a baseline UP protocol stack for IAB. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-C</figref> are block diagrams illustrating a baseline CP protocol stack for IAB. As illustrated, the chosen protocol stacks reuse the current CU-DU split specification, where the full user plane F1-U (GTP-U/UDP/IP) is terminated at the IAB node (like a normal DU), and the full control plane F1-C (F1-AP/SCTP/IP) is also terminated at the IAB node (like a normal DU). In the illustrated examples, Network Domain Security (NDS) is used to protect both UP and CP traffic (IPsec in the case of UP, and DTLS in the case of CP). IPsec may also be used for the CP protection instead of DTLS (in this case no DTLS layer is used).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A protocol layer referred to as Backhaul Adaptation Protocol (BAP) in the IAB nodes and the IAB-donor is used for routing of packets to the appropriate downstream/upstream node and also mapping the UE bearer data to the proper backhaul radio link control (RLC) channel (and also between ingress and egress backhaul RLC channels in intermediate IAB nodes) to satisfy the end to end QoS requirements of bearers.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Routing and bearer mapping (e.g., mapping of backhaul RLC channels) are adaptation layer functions. The transmit part of the adaptation layer performs routing and bearer mapping, and the receive part of the adaptation layer performs bearer demapping. Service data units (SDUs) are forwarded from the receive part of the adaptation layer to the transmit part of the adaptation layer (for the next hop) for packets that are relayed by the IAB node.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">BAP includes a DU part configured by F1-AP and a MT part configured by radio resource control (RRC). A BAP DU part and MT part each has one transmitter and one receiver. The BAP Routing ID (carried in the BAP header) consists of BAP address and BAP path ID. Each BAP address defines a unique destination (unique for IAB network of one donor, either an IAB access node, or the IAB donor). Each BAP address can have one or multiple entries in the routing table to enable local route selection. Multiple entries are for load balancing or re-routing at radio link failure (RLF). Each BAP Routing ID has only one entry in the routing table. The BAP address of the IAB node is used to differentiate traffic to be delivered to upper layers from traffic to be delivered to egress RLC layer.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">For routing and bearer mapping of a packet retrieved from RLC layer, the IAB-node may be configured with the following mappings: BAP routing ID in BAP header to egress link (routing table); and ingress RLC channel to egress RLC channel (bearer mapping). For the selection/addition of a BAP routing ID as well as routing and bearer mapping for a packet retrieved from upper layers, the IAB-node and IAB donor may be configured with the following mappings: upper layer information to BAP Routing ID in BAP header; BAP routing ID in BAP header to egress link; and upper layer information to egress RLC channel.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">With respect to the BAP header, the routing ID is 13 bits, there is a C/D bit, and the length of the BAP address and BAP path ID sub-fields of the BAP routing ID are fixed/predefined. For the downlink, BAP address is 10 bits and BAP path ID is 3 bits. The specification may not restrict configuration of routing ID and its components; thus the network may have to ensure that e.g. there is no path confusion.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a sample header for the data PDU, where the MSB indicates whether it is a control or data header and then a few reserve bits for flags and future compatibility.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The radio bearers carrying CP/UP traffic for the MT functionality of an IAB node are handled separately from the backhaul RLC channels. Note that the backhaul RLC channels are used to carry traffic to/from the IAB DU functionality, which could either be intended for the UEs served by the IAB node or for the child IAB nodes. The traffic of child IAB nodes and UE served by IAB DU are handled separately by employing different logical channel IDs.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> illustrate the flow of packets in the downlink direction. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an example of bearer mapping in IAB nodes for downstream transmission. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an example of the functions performed by BAP entities for downstream transmission.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">For downlink, when a packet arrives at the IAB donor DU (from the donor CU) and is processed first by the upper layers (because there is no MT BAP layer at the donor DU), then if the packet is destined to UEs directly connected to the IAB donor DU or it is an F1-AP traffic destined at the IAB donor DU, the packet is forwarded to higher layers (IP/UDP/GTP-U for UP, IP/SCTP/F1-AP for CP).

When a packet arrives at an IAB node in the uplink direction, if it is coming from a child IAB node via backhaul RLC channels, the packet is processed first by the DU BAP layer and, because every uplink packet is destined to be forwarded to the donor CU, it is passed on to the MT BAP layer. If the packet is from a UE connected directly to the IAB node, or it is an F1-AP traffic originating from the IAB node, the packet is processed first by the higher layers (IP/UDP/GTP-U for UP, IP/SCTP/F1-AP for CP) and is forwarded to the MT BAP layer.

For example, the IAB-node may have redundant routes with the IAB-donor CU. Multiple paths are possible towards IAB node, via single or dual-connectivity, via one or multiple IAB-donor-DUs. The IAB-donor-CU can employ multipath for load balancing purposes, i.e., IAB-donor-CU can assign different paths to traffic belonging to different UEs served by an IAB node, or even different data radio bearers (DRBs) pertaining a UE.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The NR-DC framework may be reused for setting up multi-connectivity to IAB nodes. To use NR-DC for IAB nodes, however, some changes to the user plane aspects may be required. The reasons are that: the IAB nodes do not terminate packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) for F1-U traffic; the parent nodes to the IAB do not terminate F1-U for other IAB nodes (the forwarding is instead handled by the BAP layer); the architecture based on full F1-U support to the IAB node does not assume that there is any CU-UP function for traffic going to the IAB node (instead the DU handles IP routing); and the IP connectivity for non-IAB NR DC terminates in the UPF, which is not in line with the architecture for IAB network.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The user plane solutions for NR DC cannot be used in their current form to support multi-path connectivity to IAB nodes for F1-U traffic for several reasons, including lack of PDCP and CU-UP function for IAB nodes.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">However, for an IAB network, a simplified version of NR DC for enabling multi-path communication may be used in line with existing architecture assumptions and avoids additional complexities such as tunnelling in tunnelling, with the following assumptions.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">No split bearers are supported. This simplification avoids introduction of CU-UP functionality and re-ordering functionality, etc.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Each path is associated with a separate BAP Routing ID. This simplification avoids GTP tunnels to the parent nodes (carrying GTP tunnels to IAB node).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Each path is associated with its own IP address making the paths visible on the F1 application layer. This simplification makes it possible to set up paths through different donor DUs.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">With the assumptions above, it is possible to support redundancy and rudimentary load balancing mechanism on the F1 application layer using features such as Multipath SCTP and smart load balancing of UE GTP tunnels to different paths.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">For the user plane, it is possible to support a simplified version of NR-DC for IAB nodes, where each path is seen as a separate IP connection, which can be used by the application layer (F1-C/F1-U) for redundancy and rudimentary load balancing. This is described in more detail in TR 38.874 section 9.7.9.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">When using NR-DC to support multi-connectivity for IAB nodes, the following assumptions are made. Only master cell group (MCG) or secondary cell group (SCG) backhaul bearers are supported. Split backhaul bearers are not supported. Each separate connection to a given IAB node is associated with a separate BAP identifier (e.g., address, path, address+path). Each separate connection is associated with at least one separate IP address to support multiple connections to use different donor DUs and allow selection of which connection to use by the end nodes (IAB node, donor CU).

The routing is based on BAP identifier 1 associated with IP address 1.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The donor CU determines e.g., based on IAB node 1 RRC level measurements, IAB node capabilities, etc., that IAB node 1 should establish dual connectivity to IAB node 3. Existing NR-DC RRC procedure is used to establish an SCG connection to IAB node 3. As part of this message the donor CU will configure the BAP identifier for the SCG link to IAB node 3, one or more backhaul RLC channels between the IAB node 1 and IAB node 3, and a new BAP route for the new connection.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">After the new path is set up on the BAP, IAB node 1 may be allocated a new IP address 2 for the new connection.

As described above, in IAB networks the IAB donor CU is in control of paths towards the IAB node, where a path is identified by a BAP routing ID. An IAB node first connects to the network via RRC connection using its IAB-MT part. In this first phase of integration process, the IAB node may receive a number of IP addresses. Thereafter, F1-C communication is established, followed by F1-U communication establishment. The setup of the F1-C connection in IAB is triggered by the IAB node DU functionality (similar to legacy CU-DU split), by sending an F1 setup request message to the IAB donor CU, and the IAB donor CU replies with an F1 setup response, to confirm the F1-C establishment.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">An IAB node may be several hops away from the IAB donor CU, where it could theoretically reach or communicate with the IAB donor CU via different paths.

Particular embodiments include a method at the gNB CU CP configured as an IAB donor CU CP for IAB nodes. The method comprises sending the following information to the IAB node.

The IAB node then, when having to route a packet that does not have a matching route configured in the routing table, will try to use the primary path first, and if that is not possible or does not perform as expected, will choose the second highest priority path, and so on.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Some embodiments include RRC signaling for the IAB donor CU CP to communicate to the IAB node in the BAP configuration, which IPv4 addresses or IPv6 prefix has been allocated for each path.

<b>12</b></figref> illustrates an example wireless network, according to certain embodiments. The wireless network may comprise and/or interface with any type of communication, telecommunication, data, cellular, and/or radio network or other similar type of system. In some embodiments, the wireless network may be configured to operate according to specific standards or other types of predefined rules or procedures. Thus, particular embodiments of the wireless network may implement communication standards, such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), Long Term Evolution (LTE), and/or other suitable 2G, 3G, 4G, or 5G standards; wireless local area network (WLAN) standards, such as the IEEE 802.11 standards; and/or any other appropriate wireless communication standard, such as the Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMax), Bluetooth, Z-Wave and/or ZigBee standards.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0102">Network <b>106</b> may comprise one or more backhaul networks, core networks, IP networks, public switched telephone networks (PSTNs), packet data networks, optical networks, wide-area networks (WANs), local area networks (LANs), wireless local area networks (WLANs), wired networks, wireless networks, metropolitan area networks, and other networks to enable communication between devices.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0103">Network node <b>160</b> and WD <b>110</b> comprise various components described in more detail below. These components work together to provide network node and/or wireless device functionality, such as providing wireless connections in a wireless network. In different embodiments, the wireless network may comprise any number of wired or wireless networks, network nodes, base stations, controllers, wireless devices, relay stations, and/or any other components or systems that may facilitate or participate in the communication of data and/or signals whether via wired or wireless connections.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0104">As used herein, network node refers to equipment capable, configured, arranged and/or operable to communicate directly or indirectly with a wireless device and/or with other network nodes or equipment in the wireless network to enable and/or provide wireless access to the wireless device and/or to perform other functions (e.g., administration) in the wireless network.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0105">Examples of network nodes include, but are not limited to, access points (APs) (e.g., radio access points), base stations (BSs) (e.g., radio base stations, Node Bs, evolved Node Bs (eNBs) and NR NodeBs (gNBs)). Base stations may be categorized based on the amount of coverage they provide (or, stated differently, their transmit power level) and may then also be referred to as femto base stations, pico base stations, micro base stations, or macro base stations.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0106">A base station may be a relay node or a relay donor node controlling a relay. A network node may also include one or more (or all) parts of a distributed radio base station such as centralized digital units and/or remote radio units (RRUs), sometimes referred to as Remote Radio Heads (RRHs). Such remote radio units may or may not be integrated with an antenna as an antenna integrated radio. Parts of a distributed radio base station may also be referred to as nodes in a distributed antenna system (DAS). Yet further examples of network nodes include multi-standard radio (MSR) equipment such as MSR BSs, network controllers such as radio network controllers (RNCs) or base station controllers (BSCs), base transceiver stations (BTSs), transmission points, transmission nodes, multi-cell/multicast coordination entities (MCEs), core network nodes (e.g., MSCs, MMEs), O&#x26;M nodes, OSS nodes, SON nodes, positioning nodes (e.g., E-SMLCs), and/or MDTs.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0107">As another example, a network node may be a virtual network node as described in more detail below. More generally, however, network nodes may represent any suitable device (or group of devices) capable, configured, arranged, and/or operable to enable and/or provide a wireless device with access to the wireless network or to provide some service to a wireless device that has accessed the wireless network.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0108">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, network node <b>160</b> includes processing circuitry <b>170</b>, device readable medium <b>180</b>, interface <b>190</b>, auxiliary equipment <b>184</b>, power source <b>186</b>, power circuitry <b>187</b>, and antenna <b>162</b>. Although network node <b>160</b> illustrated in the example wireless network of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> may represent a device that includes the illustrated combination of hardware components, other embodiments may comprise network nodes with different combinations of components.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0109">It is to be understood that a network node comprises any suitable combination of hardware and/or software needed to perform the tasks, features, functions and methods disclosed herein. Moreover, while the components of network node <b>160</b> are depicted as single boxes located within a larger box, or nested within multiple boxes, in practice, a network node may comprise multiple different physical components that make up a single illustrated component (e.g., device readable medium <b>180</b> may comprise multiple separate hard drives as well as multiple RAM modules).</p><p id="p-0112" num="0110">Similarly, network node <b>160</b> may be composed of multiple physically separate components (e.g., a NodeB component and a RNC component, or a BTS component and a BSC component, etc.), which may each have their own respective components. In certain scenarios in which network node <b>160</b> comprises multiple separate components (e.g., BTS and BSC components), one or more of the separate components may be shared among several network nodes. For example, a single RNC may control multiple NodeB's. In such a scenario, each unique NodeB and RNC pair, may in some instances be considered a single separate network node.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0111">In some embodiments, network node <b>160</b> may be configured to support multiple radio access technologies (RATs). In such embodiments, some components may be duplicated (e.g., separate device readable medium <b>180</b> for the different RATs) and some components may be reused (e.g., the same antenna <b>162</b> may be shared by the RATs).
