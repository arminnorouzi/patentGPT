id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method for in situ production of antimicrobial filtration membranes that uses self-assembly of surfactants such as block copolymers as a template. The mesophase structure (for example hexagonal or lamellar) can be determined, and membrane pore size can be controlled in the nanometer range, by changing the block copolymer and the amounts of the components such as the block copolymer, aqueous solution, monomer, crosslinker, and initiator. The monomer phase cures in the template and there is no need for organic solvents and coagulation bath or other post-modification. As-synthesized membranes were found to have pore sizes with a narrow size distribution in the range of 3-4 nm with a molecular weight cutoff of 1500 g/mol and displayed both excellent fouling resistance and high permeance of water, vastly outperforming a conventional NIPS UF membrane. The monomer can comprise a quaternary ammonium group so that the membrane is antibacterial. The block copolymer can comprise hydrophilic blocks which form the surfaces of the membrane pores, rendering them hydrophilic.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="67.99mm" wi="158.75mm" file="US20230001359A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="182.03mm" wi="168.49mm" file="US20230001359A1-20230105-D00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-D00002" he="78.82mm" wi="162.73mm" file="US20230001359A1-20230105-D00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-D00003" he="184.66mm" wi="125.39mm" file="US20230001359A1-20230105-D00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-D00004" he="191.85mm" wi="163.91mm" file="US20230001359A1-20230105-D00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-D00005" he="80.60mm" wi="165.10mm" file="US20230001359A1-20230105-D00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-D00006" he="152.48mm" wi="133.01mm" file="US20230001359A1-20230105-D00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00007" num="00007"><img id="EMI-D00007" he="159.68mm" wi="138.68mm" file="US20230001359A1-20230105-D00007.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00008" num="00008"><img id="EMI-D00008" he="139.70mm" wi="115.15mm" file="US20230001359A1-20230105-D00008.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00009" num="00009"><img id="EMI-D00009" he="163.83mm" wi="135.89mm" file="US20230001359A1-20230105-D00009.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00010" num="00010"><img id="EMI-D00010" he="203.54mm" wi="162.39mm" file="US20230001359A1-20230105-D00010.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00011" num="00011"><img id="EMI-D00011" he="213.02mm" wi="163.24mm" file="US20230001359A1-20230105-D00011.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00012" num="00012"><img id="EMI-D00012" he="134.54mm" wi="164.51mm" file="US20230001359A1-20230105-D00012.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><description id="description"><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation application of U.S. patent application Ser.

Discussion of such publications herein is given for more complete background of the scientific principles and is not to be construed as an admission that such publications are prior art for patentability determination purposes.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Ultrafiltration (UF) and microfiltration (MF) are among the most commonly employed separation techniques with applications in a variety of industries ranging from food processing to chemical manufacturing and protein purification. In the treatment of water and wastewater, UF and/or MF play a key role in the removal of suspended particles, viruses, and bacteria. Conventionally, these membranes are produced by non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS), a method that is environmentally questionable due to its use of large quantities of organic solvent, approximately 70% (by volume). Additionally, NIPS membranes are anisotropic with low surface porosity, leading to increased fouling on the surface of the membrane. Bio-fouling is a common problem found in membrane filtration as proteins, bacteria, and viruses accumulate on the surface of membranes. As a result, there has been a great deal of effort to develop improved UF membranes via modification of the NIPS method and resultant membranes as well as the development of alternative UF membrane production routes.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The most common approach taken in the development of improved UF membranes has been surface modification. Grafting hydrophilic groups, such as poly(ethylene glycol), to the surface of membranes has been proven to reduce fouling. However, surface modification is costly. Another approach, a combination of polymer self-assembly and NIPS, referred to as SNIPS, affords resultant membranes with high flux and anti-fouling properties. In this method, immersion of a self-assembled block copolymer film in a non-solvent bath leads to the formation of hierarchically porous membranes. However, the SNIPS method still requires large quantities of organic solvent and, as such, is not eco-friendly. Templating is an alternative route to porous membranes in which a structured or porous material is used as a template to impart structure to another material and subsequently removed. Consequently, the pore size and pore size distribution can be readily controlled by changing the template. Surface-active agents (surfactants) can self-assemble in water/oil mixtures to form anisotropic, mesomorphic phases (mesophases) exhibiting high extension in one or two dimensions, making them ideal templates for membranes. These mesophase templates are thermodynamically stable systems with length scales on the order of 2-50 nm, and can be prepared through polymerization of mesoporous polymers. A critical problem observed in this templating approach is polymerization-induced phase separation/inversion in which the template structure is not retained after polymerization. The use of amphiphilic block copolymers as surfactants has been shown to improve the retention of the template structure due to the slow kinetics of block copolymers. However, most of the reported lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) templating techniques found to retain the LLC structure after polymerization require polymerizable surfactants prepared via complex chemistries.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, bio-fouling is a common problem found in membrane filtration as proteins, bacteria, and viruses accumulate on the surface of membranes. Currently, chlorination is utilized in municipal water systems to remove tiny micro-organisms and bacteria. However, harmful disinfection byproducts produced during the chlorination process have raised concerns and motivated exploration of other disinfection agents. Therefore, if combined with disinfection, ultrafiltration and microfiltration can transform not only municipal water treatment, but also the treatment of wastewater containing harmful micro-organisms and bacteria due to their high flux rate and efficiency. In recent years, antibacterial membranes have attracted industrial and academic interest for the removal of bacteria and micro-organisms from water. Conventionally, antibacterial membranes are prepared through surface modification, but most surface modification routes are limited to specific types of membranes. Furthermore, these routes require the use of complex and often expensive chemical reactions to graft antibacterial groups onto the surface, making the final product costly.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION (DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION)</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is a method of manufacturing a membrane, the method comprising mixing a surfactant, an aqueous solution, and a monomer solution to form a mesophase; coating the mesophase on a porous support; and polymerizing the mesophase to form a porous membrane.

Membrane pore sizes can be controlled in the range of 2-50 nm by changing the block copolymer and the ratio of components. The monomer phase cures in the template and there is no need for organic solvents or a coagulation bath. The membranes can be scaled-up for industrial purposes as well as adapted in small portable units for production in rural areas and small communities. The templating approach provides improved permeability over other methods, and enables flexibility in producing membranes with different chemistries and mechanical properties. The characteristics of final membranes may be varied depending on the composition and characteristics of the components. Antimicrobial membranes produced from the method of the present invention are useful for municipal water and wastewater treatment facilities, food industries, biomedical applications, and pharmaceutical industries. The membranes of the present invention preferably do not comprise silver nanoparticles.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The template preferably comprises three main components: a surfactant phase, an aqueous phase, and an organic or oil phase. In general, the monomer phase (which may be the organic/oil or aqueous phase) preferably comprises mixtures of monomers, crosslinkers, and thermal and/or photo initiators. Preferably no organic solvent is necessary to produce membranes of the present invention. The surfactant phase preferably comprises approximately from 20-80 wt %, more preferably approximately from 30-70 wt %, and most preferably approximately from 50-60 wt % of the mixture.

However, these assumptions greatly simplify our calculations without losing a great deal of information. For Pluronic L64, the PPO block constitutes 60% of the block copolymer's weight. Assuming PPO and PEO to be at bulk density (PPO-1.005 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>and PEO-1.11 g/cm<sup>3</sup>), we can conclude that approximately 62% of polymer volume is the PPO block while PEO makes up the other 38% of Pluronic L64 volume.

Table 3 also shows that polymerization results in a modest increase in both the lattice parameter and apolar domain size. Both decrease and increase in the domain spacing upon polymerization have been reported in the literature. The former has been explained in term of a density change within the polymerized region, whereas the latter is attributed to changes in the original LLC structure. The observed increase in the domain size may be attributable to a competition between thermodynamics and kinetics. On one hand, as the polymerization proceeds, the molecular weight of the oil phase and consequently, &#x3c7;N, a measure of the enthalpic penalty of mixing, approaches infinity. This dramatic increase in the enthalpic penalty can drive the system towards phase separation, leading to an increase in the domain size. Changes in the surface energy of the polymerizing phase can also lead to a phase transition or inversion in the self-assembled structure. On the other hand, in our system, the polymerization results in a density increase (shrinkage with &#x394;&#x3c1;&#x2dc;10%). Since crosslinking arrests molecular rearrangement, trapping the structure in a non-equilibrium morphology can be achieved if the self-organization kinetics of Pluronic are slower than the reaction kinetics. As such, the reaction kinetics and crosslinker content are of critical importance for limiting polymerization induced phase inversion/transition. Additionally, this explains the observed transition from an HM/HPL morphology to a hexagonal one. As shown in Table 3, expansion of the lattice parameter and apolar domain size is less significant when the monomer volume fraction increases. We attribute this to a higher shrinkage of the oil phase upon polymerization since the volume reduction is directly proportional to the overall concentration of the oil phase.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0059">In contrast to the above discussion, a slight decrease or increase in the domain size with increasing temperature has been observed for the unpolymerized mesophases. It should be noted that this behavior is representative of the equilibrium self-assembly and not the morphology induced by the polymerization described above. It is evident from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, which displays 1D SAXS profiles as a function of temperature for sample I, that the mesostructure appears stable during the temperature sweep and does not exhibit thermally induced phase separation (i.e. the measurement duration is shorter than the time required for polymerization). The observed decrease in the principal scattering vector (increase in domain size) with increasing temperature can be attributed to a change in the surface energy of the polymerizing phase. Additionally, this result provides evidence that the elevated temperature for the thermal initiation process should not have a significant effect on the nanoscale structure of the membrane. The limited morphological changes observed by SAXS and polarized light microscopy suggest that the wide stability window of the studied mesophases and rapid arrestment of morphological changes through crosslinking make this process fairly robust. This is a significant finding as elimination of polymerization induced phase separation generally requires the use of polymerizable surfactants. The method of the present invention is both scalable and flexible, utilizing a commercially available surfactant. Additionally, monomer chemistry and surfactants are easily adaptable, enabling production of membranes tailored in terms of surface chemistry and pore size.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00004" num="00004"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="7"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" rowsep="1">TABLE 4</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Commercial</entry><entry>Membrane</entry><entry>Membrane</entry><entry>Membrane</entry><entry>Membrane</entry></row><row><entry>Parameter</entry><entry>Unit</entry><entry>membrane <sup>a</sup></entry><entry>I</entry><entry>II</entry><entry>III</entry><entry>IV</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Q</entry><entry>L/hr</entry><entry>0.12 &#xb1; 0.01</entry><entry>0.25 &#xb1; 0.01</entry><entry>0.24 &#xb1; 0.02</entry><entry>0.21 &#xb1; 0.03</entry><entry>0.22 &#xb1; 0.01</entry></row><row><entry>&#x3ba;/l</entry><entry>10<sup>&#x2212;10 </sup>L/m<sup>2</sup></entry><entry>1.47 &#xb1; 0.01</entry><entry>3.05 &#xb1; 0.01</entry><entry>2.97 &#xb1; 0.01</entry><entry>2.60 &#xb1; 0.01</entry><entry>2.69 &#xb1; 0.01</entry></row><row><entry>BSA</entry><entry>%</entry><entry>&#x3c;68%</entry><entry>&#x3e;95%</entry><entry>&#x3e;95%</entry><entry>&#x3e;95%</entry><entry>&#x3e;95%</entry></row><row><entry>rejection</entry></row><row><entry>Tortuous</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>N/A</entry><entry>(6.3 &#xb1;</entry><entry>(7.70 &#xb1;</entry><entry>(7.6 &#xb1;</entry><entry>(1.1 &#xb1;</entry></row><row><entry>(effective)</entry><entry/><entry/><entry>0.30) &#xd7; 10<sup>&#x2212;7</sup></entry><entry>0.7) &#xd7; 10<sup>&#x2212;7</sup></entry><entry>1.2) &#xd7; 10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup></entry><entry>0.1) &#xd7; 10<sup>&#x2212;7</sup></entry></row><row><entry>path length</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="left" id="FOO-00002"><sup>a </sup>The commercial membrane was a GE, PT8040F30.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0076" num="0060">The flow rate, normalized permeability, BSA rejection, and tortuosity of as-synthesized lamellar and hexagonal membranes compared to a commercial membrane are tabulated in Table 4.

Note this calculation assumes all channels are oriented as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, whereas, in reality, some channels may be laying perpendicular to the surface. Effective path values for each membrane has been calculated in Table 4. At the same membrane thickness, the tortuosity value is proportional to the effective path. It can be seen that, despite exhibiting higher flow rates than their hexagonal counterparts (III &#x26; IV), the lamellar membranes (I &#x26; II) displayed a more tortuous path. This observation can be attributed to the difference in flow geometry.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0063">Grain boundaries in ordered phases can lead to dead-end pores and restrict flow, affecting the tortuosity, as shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows only a single unit of each mesophase type.

It should be noted that this calculation neglects the effects of paracrystallinity, temperature, and strain on the FWHM. Therefore, the grain size is likely underestimated in our calculation. Nonetheless, this calculation allows us to estimate that the membranes have on the order of 100 grains across the thickness of the membrane. In polymer blends containing ion-conducting domains, it has been shown that two out of three grain boundary orientations in lamellar structures were effective for ion diffusion, while just one out of three cylinder orientations in hexagonal structures was efficient. As such, the lower fluxes observed for the hexagonal mesophases over their lamellar counterparts can be rationalized by the higher probability of dead-ends at grain boundaries in hexagonal mesophases. Further, these results suggest that increasing the grain size relative to the membrane thickness, which can be accomplished via shear, thermal annealing, or mere reduction of the membrane thickness, can reduce tortuosity and therefore improve the permeability of the present membranes even further.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0064">To evaluate membrane separation performance, dead-end stirred cell filtration was performed with a 1 mg/mL BSA feed solution. UV-Vis results for the feed and permeate of commercial, lamellar (I), and hexagonal (III) membranes with a BSA feed solution are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A</figref>. A calibration curve for absorbance as a function of BSA concentration, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>B</figref>, was determined and used to calculate the concentration of BSA in each stream. The minimum detectable concentration of BSA through this method was 0.05 mg/mL. It can be seen that neither I or III permeates displayed a noticeable peak at 280 nm. As a result, it can be concluded that BSA concentration in the permeates of these two membranes is less than 0.05 mg/mL. Therefore, BSA rejection for both lamellar and hexagonal membranes is greater than 95%. In contrast, the commercial NIPS membrane only displayed 68% BSA rejection.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0065">Additionally, the fouling resistance of lamellar (I) and hexagonal (III) membranes was measured and compared with the commercial membrane. Macromolecules and proteins are two of the primary foulants encountered in water filtration. As such, 1 mg/mL BSA and 1 mg/mL PEG300 solutions in DI water were used as foulants. Flux decline curves are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B</figref>. Our results show that the flux declines slightly (only 6%) over 12 h for lamellar and hexagonal membranes, while there is a significant flux decline (89%) observed for the commercial membrane. These results indicate that, despite their small pore size (&#x3c;5 nm), the present membranes display a superior fouling resistance (even in a dead-end configuration) when compared to a conventional NIPS UF membrane. This improvement can be attributed to the consistent pore structure throughout the present membranes, as well as the hydrophilicity of the Pluronic's PEG block decorating them, which is in stark contrast to the anisotropic structure of NIPS membranes. This anisotropy as well as the low surface porosity of NIPS membranes results in reduced fouling resistance. In addition, the fouling resistance of the present membranes is further enhanced by the hydrophilicity of the pore surfaces, due to retained PEG chains. Additionally, the similarity between the flux decay profiles for both BSA and PEG300 is striking considering BSA was found to be completely rejected, while the PEG300 was found to pass through the membrane (as will be discussed). This can be attributed in part to the high stir rate used during these experiments, which prevented a substantial over-layer of BSA from forming. However, the stark contrast between the present membranes and the commercial membrane suggest, as noted above, that the high fouling resistance of the present membranes also contributed.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>A-<b>15</b>B</figref> shows the MWCO graphs for lamellar and hexagonal membranes. In both cases, the rejection values for M=1500 g/mol are greater than 89.5%. Thus, the MWCO is &#x2dc;1500 g/mol. The PEG Stokes radius, &#x3b1;<sub>stokes </sub>(nm), can be calculated as follows [39]:</p><p id="p-0089" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x3b1;<sub>stokes</sub>=16.73&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;10</sup><i>M</i><sup>0.557 </sup><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0090" num="0000">where M is the molecular weight of PEG. For M=1500 g/mol, the PEG diameter is 2.0 nm, which is close to the pore size of the membranes calculated in Table 3. This suggests that, as was assumed in the calculations above, the block polymer is retained in the pores. The modest difference between the calculated pore size and the separable solute size can be attributed in part to the assumption that the phases were completely segregated.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a cross-sectional SEM image for membrane I showing an average thickness of 10&#xb1;2 &#x3bc;m for the membrane.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0068">In conclusion, self-assembled mesostructures of a surfactant in the presence of water and oil were used as templates for the production of UF membranes without the need for organic solvent. Cross-polarized light microscopy and SAXS confirmed the retention of hexagonal and lamellar mesophases after polymerization for most samples, with only a modest transition from a HM/HPL to a hexagonal morphology observed for sample with Pluronic/water/oil 60/15/25 composition. As-synthesized membranes were found to have excellent permeability with operational permeabilities double that of a commercial NIPS UF membrane. Additionally, the membranes exhibited MWCO of 1500 g/mol with exceptional rejection performance, &#x3e;95% of BSA in a 1 mg/mL feed. Notably, the flux decline observed for both lamellar and hexagonal membranes with 1 mg/mL BSA and PEG300 solutions over 12 hr was minimal, indicating substantial fouling resistance. Consequently, it can be concluded that membranes produced via the present approach significantly outperform the commercial NIPS UF membrane used in this study. As such, these results confirm that mesophase-templated membranes could provide an eco-friendly and more effective alternative to conventional NIPS UF membranes.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0069">Note that in the specification and claims, &#x201c;about&#x201d; or &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; means within twenty percent (20%) of the numerical amount cited.
