More specifically, the present disclosure relates to a lubricant supported electric motor with an integrated wheel support.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">This section provides a general summary of background information and the comments and examples provided in this section are not necessarily prior art to the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various drivelines in automotive, truck, and certain off-highway applications take power from a central prime mover and distribute the power to the wheels using mechanical devices such as transmissions, transaxles, propeller shafts, and live axles. These configurations work well when the prime mover can be bulky or heavy, such as, for example, various internal combustion engines (&#x201c;ICE&#x201d;). However, more attention is being directed towards alternative arrangements of prime movers that provide improved environmental performance, eliminate mechanical driveline components, and result in a lighter-weight vehicle with more space for passengers and payload.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">&#x201c;On wheel&#x201d;, &#x201c;in-wheel&#x201d; or &#x201c;near-wheel&#x201d; motor configurations are one alternative arrangement for the traditional ICE prime mover that distributes the prime mover function to each or some of the plurality of wheels via one or more motors disposed on, within, or proximate to the plurality of wheels. For example, in one instance, a traction motor, using a central shaft though a rotor and rolling element bearings to support the rotor, can be utilized as the &#x201c;on wheel&#x201d;, &#x201c;in wheel&#x201d; or &#x201c;near wheel&#x201d; motor configuration. In another instance, a lubricant supported electric motor, such as described in U.S. application Ser. No. 16/144,002, can be utilized as the &#x201c;on wheel&#x201d;, &#x201c;in wheel&#x201d; or &#x201c;near wheel&#x201d; motor configuration. While each of these motor configurations result in a smaller size and lighter weight arrangement as compared to the prime movers based on the internal combustion engine, they each have certain drawbacks and disadvantages.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, the utilization of traction motors as the &#x201c;on wheel&#x201d;, &#x201c;in wheel&#x201d; or &#x201c;near wheel&#x201d; configuration still results in motors that are too heavy and not robust enough to shock loading to be useful for wheel-end applications. In other words, present traction motors are large, heavy structures supported by rolling element bearings, which are too heavy and large to be practical for wheel end applications.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with one aspect, the subject invention is directed to a lubricant supported electric motor including a stator extending along an axis, and a rotor extending along the axis and rotatably disposed around the stator in radially surrounding and spaced relationship to define at least one support chamber extending between the stator and the rotor. A lubricant is disposed in the at least one support chamber for supporting the rotor around the stator. A wheel rim is fixedly attached to the rotor and is disposed in surrounding relationship with the rotor and the stator. Thus, in this aspect, rotation of the rotor is directly transferred to the wheel rim such that the wheel rim rotates in accordance with the rotation of the rotor. In other words, the rotor of the lubricant supported electric motor directly supports a driven wheel.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with another aspect, the subject invention is directed to a lubricant supported electric motor includes a stator extending along an axis, and a rotor extending along the axis and rotatably disposed radially within the stator in spaced relationship to define at least one support chamber extending between the stator and rotor. A lubricant is disposed in the at least one support chamber for supporting the rotor within the stator. A wheel rim is disposed in radially surrounding relationship with the stator and the rotor, and a planetary gear reduction mechanism is operably interconnected to the rotor, the stator, and the wheel rim and configured to rotate the wheel rim in response to rotation of the rotor within the stator.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The lubricant supported electric motor in either of these aspects is light and small, and thus contributes to the overall design strategy for eliminating weight and size from automobiles and land vehicles.

Each of these example embodiments are provided so that this disclosure is thorough and fully conveys the scope of the inventive concepts, features and advantages to those skilled in the art. To this end, numerous specific details are set forth such as examples of specific components, devices and mechanisms associated with the lubricant supported electric motor to provide a thorough understanding of each of the embodiments associated with the present disclosure. However, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art, not all specific details described herein need to be employed, the example embodiments may be embodied in many different forms, and thus should not be construed or interpreted to limit the scope of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a lubricant supported electric motor <b>10</b> in accordance with an aspect of the disclosure. As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the lubricant supported electric motor <b>10</b> includes a stator <b>12</b> and a rotor <b>14</b> extending along an axis A and movably disposed within the stator <b>12</b> to define a support chamber or gap <b>16</b> therebetween. A lubricant <b>18</b> is disposed in the gap <b>16</b> for supporting the rotor <b>14</b> within the stator <b>12</b>, and providing continuous contact between these components. The lubricant <b>18</b> may therefore act as a buffer (e.g., suspension) between the rotor <b>14</b> and stator <b>12</b> minimizing or preventing contact therebetween. In other words, the lubricant <b>18</b> prevents direct contact between the stator <b>12</b> and rotor <b>14</b> and provides an electric lubricant supported motor <b>10</b> which is robust to shock and vibration loading due to the presence of the lubricant <b>18</b>. Additionally, and alternatively, a substantially incompressible lubricant <b>18</b> may be used in order to minimize the gap between the stator <b>12</b> and rotor <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As further illustrated <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the stator <b>12</b> defines a passageway <b>20</b> disposed in fluid communication with the gap <b>16</b> for introducing the lubricant <b>18</b>. However, the passageway <b>20</b> could be provided on any other components of the lubricant supported electric motor <b>10</b> without departing from the subject disclosure. According to an aspect, the lubricant <b>18</b> may be cycled or pumped through the passageway <b>20</b> and into the gap <b>16</b> in various ways. For example, a high pressure source (e.g., a pump) <b>22</b> of the lubricant <b>18</b> may be fluidly coupled to a low pressure source (e.g., a sump) <b>24</b> of the lubricant <b>18</b>, where the lubricant may move from the high pressure source to the lower pressure source, through the passageway <b>20</b> and into the gap <b>16</b>. Rotation of the rotor <b>14</b> relative to the stator <b>12</b> may operate as a self-pump to drive lubricant <b>18</b> through the passageway <b>20</b> and into the gap <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the rotor <b>14</b> is interconnected to a drive assembly <b>22</b> for coupling the lubricant supported electric motor <b>10</b> to one of the plurality of wheels of a vehicle. For example, in one instance, the drive assembly <b>22</b> may include a planetary gear system. Alternatively, the drive assembly <b>22</b> may include one or more parallel axis gears. The stator <b>12</b> and rotor <b>14</b> are configured to exert an electromagnetic force therebetween to convert electrical energy into mechanical energy, moving the rotor <b>14</b> and ultimately driving the wheel coupled to the lubricant supported electric motor <b>10</b> via the drive assembly <b>22</b>. The drive assemblies <b>22</b> may provide one or more reduction ratios between the lubricant supported electric motor <b>10</b> and the wheel in response to movement of the rotor <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The above described aspect of the disclosure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is directed to the illustrated embodiment in which the stator <b>12</b> surrounds the rotor <b>14</b>. However, the general operation of the lubricant <b>18</b> and the relationship between the stator <b>12</b> and the rotor <b>14</b> may be used in alternative arrangements of the rotor <b>14</b> and stator <b>12</b>, such as the rotor <b>14</b> being disposed radially outward from the stator <b>12</b>, as further described below. In such instances, the wheel structure may be supported by the rotor <b>14</b>, rather than the rotor <b>14</b> being connected to a drive assembly that drives the wheel.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a wheel end electric motor system <b>100</b> of another aspect of the disclosure is provided. The system <b>100</b> may include a wheel directly supported on a lubricant supported electric motor <b>110</b>. This configuration may be desirable for single-track vehicles, such as scooters, where strong overturning moments on the wheel are reduced or non-existent.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The system <b>110</b> may include a stator <b>112</b> and a rotor <b>114</b> extending along an axis A movably disposed around the stator <b>112</b> to define a gap or support chamber <b>116</b> disposed therebetween. A lubricant <b>118</b> is disposed in the gap <b>116</b> for supporting the rotor <b>114</b> around the stator <b>112</b>, and providing continuous contact between these components. The lubricant <b>118</b> may therefore act as a buffer (e.g., suspension) between the rotor <b>114</b> and stator <b>112</b> minimizing or preventing contact therebetween.

Additionally, and alternatively, a substantially incompressible lubricant <b>118</b> may be used in order to minimize the gap between the stator <b>112</b> and the rotor <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As further illustrated <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the stator <b>112</b> defines a passageway <b>120</b> disposed in fluid communication with the gap <b>116</b> for introducing the lubricant <b>118</b>. However, the passageway <b>120</b> could be provided on any other components of the lubricant supported electric motor <b>110</b> without departing from the subject disclosure. According to an aspect, the lubricant <b>118</b> may be cycled or pumped through the passageway <b>120</b> and into the gap <b>116</b> in various ways. For example, a high pressure source <b>121</b> (e.g., a pump) of the lubricant <b>118</b> may be fluidly coupled to a low pressure source (e.g., a sump, not shown) of the lubricant <b>118</b>, where the lubricant may move from the high pressure source to the lower pressure source, through the passageway <b>120</b> and into the gap <b>116</b>. Rotation of the rotor <b>114</b> relative to the stator <b>112</b> may operate as a self-pump to drive lubricant <b>118</b> through the passageway <b>120</b> and into the gap <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The stator <b>112</b> may be attached to or integrated with an axle <b>123</b> that extends coaxially with the axis A.

The axle <b>123</b> may further define an outlet <b>125</b> in fluid communication with the gap <b>116</b>. During operation of the motor <b>110</b>, the lubricant <b>118</b> may be drained from the gap <b>116</b> and directed back toward the pump <b>121</b>, with fresh lubricant <b>118</b> replacing the used lubricant <b>118</b>. Accordingly, the lubricant <b>118</b> may be cycled through the motor <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The lubricant supported electric motor <b>110</b> may further include a housing or casing <b>127</b> that surrounds the stator <b>112</b>. The casing <b>127</b> may be attached to the rotor <b>114</b>, and may therefore rotate along with the rotor <b>114</b> during operation of the motor <b>110</b>. The casing <b>127</b> may further include a seal portion <b>129</b> that interfaces with the axle <b>123</b> and/or stator <b>112</b>. The casing <b>127</b> therefore defines an internal cavity <b>131</b>, which is disposed in fluid communication with and may include the gap <b>116</b>. The gap <b>116</b> generally refers to the area radially between the rotor <b>114</b> and stator <b>112</b>, but the gap <b>116</b> is in fluid communication with the remainder of the cavity <b>131</b>, and lubricant in the gap <b>116</b> may flow freely into the remainder of the cavity <b>131</b>. The above described outlet <b>125</b> may intersect the cavity <b>131</b> at a location axially outward from the gap <b>116</b>. As the rotor <b>114</b> rotates and the casing <b>127</b> rotates, the seal portion <b>129</b> will generally bear against axle <b>123</b> and/or stator <b>112</b>, while retaining the lubricant <b>118</b> within the cavity <b>131</b>, such that the lubricant <b>118</b> will be limited to exiting the cavity via the outlet <b>125</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The axle <b>123</b> is preferably connected to the vehicle suspension or chassis (not shown), and does not rotate. The axle <b>123</b> may include wiring channels or passageways <b>128</b> for receiving and routing wiring or the like that may transfer current to the stator <b>112</b>. The stator <b>112</b> includes windings or the like that receive a current for creating the electrical field that drives the rotor <b>114</b>. The current supplied to the stator <b>112</b> may be a phase current.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the rotor <b>114</b> is rotationally fixed to a wheel <b>122</b>. The wheel <b>122</b> may be in the form of a wheel rim <b>132</b> with an attached tire <b>134</b>, or the wheel <b>122</b> may include an outer surface designed to directly bear against a ground surface. The rotor <b>114</b> may be directly attached to the wheel <b>122</b>, or the rotor <b>114</b> may be fixedly attached to the wheel <b>122</b> via intermediate structure. In the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the rotor <b>114</b> and wheel <b>122</b> are directly attached, permitting direct-drive of the wheel <b>122</b> from the motor <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Optionally, the system <b>110</b> may include a suspension element disposed radially between the rotor <b>114</b> and the wheel <b>122</b> to provide a damping feature. This suspension material may be in the form of a compliant wheel structure, and allow the wheel <b>122</b> to shift radially relative to the rotor <b>114</b>, which acts as a hub. This additional damping material may allow for the system <b>100</b> to be used in various vehicles, such as electric bikes or golf carts, such that other suspension components typically attached to the axle <b>123</b> may be eliminated or reduced.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As described above, the lubricant <b>118</b> may delivered to the gap <b>116</b> (and also the cavity <b>131</b>) through the axle <b>123</b> and stator <b>112</b>. The stator <b>112</b> may include lubricant channels <b>120</b> therein that communicate with corresponding lubricant channels <b>120</b><i>a </i>in the axle <b>123</b>. The lubricant <b>118</b> cycles through the system <b>100</b>, where it drains from the gap <b>116</b> and cavity <b>131</b> through the outlet <b>125</b> in the axle <b>123</b> and returns to the pump <b>121</b>. The pump <b>121</b> may include a known mechanism for pumping fluid, and the pump <b>121</b> may further include additional components for treating the lubricant <b>118</b>, such as a thermal control mechanism <b>136</b> that may cool or heat the lubricant to a desired temperature to control viscosity. The thermal control mechanism <b>136</b> may include sensors <b>138</b> and a controller <b>140</b> for managing the lubricant temperature. The pump <b>121</b> may further include a filter mechanism that filters the lubricant <b>118</b> to remove impurities and the like. The pump <b>121</b> may include sensors associated with the filter mechanism to measure the status of the fluid and/or filter.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The above described system <b>100</b>, providing wheel support on the electric motor <b>110</b>, reduces the overall size of the wheel end system, such that the motor <b>110</b> does not need to placed beside the wheel hub to drive the wheel.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in another aspect, a system <b>200</b> includes a lubricant supported electric motor <b>210</b> having a stator <b>212</b> and a rotor <b>214</b>. In this aspect, the rotor <b>214</b> is disposed within the stator <b>212</b>, similar to the arrangement of the lubricant supported electric motor <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. However, unlike the lubricant supported motor <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, gear reduction and wheel support is provided by structure surrounding the rotor <b>214</b>, which is further described below.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The lubricant supported electric motor <b>210</b> includes a gap or support chamber <b>216</b> disposed between radially between the rotor <b>214</b> and stator <b>212</b>, with the gap <b>116</b> configured to receive lubricant <b>218</b> to support the rotor <b>214</b> within the stator <b>212</b>. The lubricant <b>218</b> within the gap <b>216</b> may also drain out of the gap <b>216</b> and be cycled through the system <b>210</b> to a pump or the like (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), similar to the pump <b>121</b> of the system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The lubricant supported electric motor <b>210</b> further includes a gear reduction mechanism <b>222</b>. The gear reduction mechanism <b>222</b> may be in the form of a planetary gear reduction mechanism, in which a number of circumferentially fixed planet gears P are disposed around a rotatable sun gear S, which rotates the planet gears P about their individual axes, causing a ring gear R that surrounds the planet gears P to rotate at a different rotational velocity than the sun gear S.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The planet gears P are attached to a planet carrier <b>223</b>, which may be fixedly attached to a vehicle chassis. The planet carrier <b>223</b> may be considered a replacement for an axle type structure, or the chassis may include an axle portion that is fixed to the planet carrier <b>223</b>. The planet carrier <b>223</b> remains in a generally fixed position relative to the axle/chassis of the vehicle. The planet carrier <b>223</b> may include a pair of outer body portions <b>223</b><i>a </i>that support a plurality of circumferentially arranged pins <b>223</b><i>b</i>. The pins <b>223</b><i>b </i>remain in a generally fixed position relative to the planet carrier <b>223</b>, and the pins <b>223</b><i>b </i>support the planet gears P for rotation. Thus, each of the individual planet gears P may rotate about an axis defined by the pin <b>223</b><i>b </i>on which they are supported.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The planet carrier may further include an inner body portion <b>223</b><i>c</i>. The inner body portion <b>223</b><i>c </i>may have the same general axial location as the rotor <b>214</b> and stator <b>212</b>, and the inner body portion <b>223</b><i>c </i>may have an annular shape that supports the pins <b>223</b><i>b</i>, similar to the outer body portion <b>223</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the pins <b>223</b><i>b </i>extend axially between the outer body portion <b>223</b><i>a </i>and the inner body portion <b>223</b><i>c</i>. The inner body portion <b>223</b><i>c</i>, along with the outer body portion <b>223</b><i>a </i>and the pins <b>223</b><i>b</i>, remains stationary during operation of the motor <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The stator <b>212</b> is mounted to or otherwise fixedly attached to the inner body portion <b>223</b><i>c</i>. The stator <b>212</b> may be integrally formed with the inner body portion <b>223</b><i>c</i>, or it may be separate component. The stator <b>212</b>, including the windings and the like, may be disposed radially inward from the inner body portion <b>223</b><i>c</i>, such that the stator <b>212</b> is radially between the inner body portion <b>223</b><i>c </i>and the rotor <b>214</b>. In an alternative approach, the stator <b>212</b> may be mounted or attached to the inner body portion <b>223</b><i>c </i>such that the inner body portion <b>223</b><i>c </i>is disposed radially between the stator <b>212</b> and the rotor <b>214</b>. In this approach, the distance between the rotor <b>214</b> and the stator <b>212</b> is small enough that the current applied to the stator <b>212</b> will still effectively rotate the rotor <b>214</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The stator <b>212</b> and the planet carrier <b>223</b> thereby combine to define a fixed structure, with the rotor <b>214</b> disposed within this fixed assembled structure. The lubricant <b>218</b> may be delivered into the lubricant supported electric motor <b>210</b> and drained from the motor <b>210</b> via fluid channels <b>224</b> disposed in both the planet carrier <b>223</b> and the stator <b>212</b>. The fluid channels <b>224</b> may extend through one or more of the pins <b>223</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The reduction mechanism <b>222</b> includes the ring gear R previously described above. The ring gear R has a generally annular shape and circumferentially and radially surrounds the planet gears P. The ring gear R therefore has inner teeth that engage outer teeth of the planet gears P. The ring gear R may be in the form of axially outer portions that are disposed on opposite axial sides of the rotor <b>214</b> and stator <b>212</b>. The ring gear R rotates in response to rotation of the planet gears P.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The ring gear R is fixedly attached to a wheel rim <b>225</b> that surrounds the inner body portion <b>223</b><i>c</i>, stator <b>212</b>, and rotor <b>214</b>. The wheel rim <b>225</b> will therefore rotate around the stationary stator <b>212</b> and inner body portion <b>223</b><i>c </i>of the planet carrier <b>223</b> in accordance with the rotation of the ring gear R. The ring gear R and wheel rim <b>225</b> will also rotate around the rotor <b>214</b>, which is disposed at the radial center of the motor <b>210</b>. The wheel rim <b>225</b> may support a tire attached thereto (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), or the wheel rim <b>225</b> may include wheel structure configured to engage the ground in lieu of a separate tire.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As described above, the lubricant <b>218</b> is disposed in the gap <b>216</b> between the rotor <b>214</b> and the stator <b>212</b> or inner body portion <b>223</b><i>c </i>of the planet carrier <b>223</b> that supports that the stator <b>212</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the lubricant <b>218</b> may also be disposed radially between the wheel rim <b>225</b> and the inner body portion <b>223</b><i>c </i>or the stator <b>212</b> (whichever is disposed radially adjacent the wheel rim <b>225</b>) in an outer gap <b>216</b><i>a</i>. The lubricant <b>218</b> may be delivered to the outer gap <b>216</b><i>a </i>via the channel <b>224</b> extending through the stator <b>212</b> and the inner body portion <b>223</b><i>c</i>, or the lubricant <b>218</b> may reach the outer gap <b>216</b><i>a </i>by traveling through other fluid channels defined within the lubricant supported electric motor <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The system <b>200</b> may include a sealing portion <b>227</b> that extends between the outer portion <b>223</b><i>a </i>of the planet carrier <b>223</b> and the ring gear R, with the sealing portion <b>227</b> being fixed to either the outer body portion <b>223</b><i>a </i>or the ring gear R. The sealing portion <b>227</b> operates to seal the interior of the lubricant supported electric motor <b>210</b> and retain the lubricant <b>218</b> therein, such that the lubricant will be limited to exiting the lubricant supported electric motor <b>210</b> via a drain channel. The system <b>200</b> may also include wiring channels or passageways <b>230</b> extending through the pins <b>223</b><i>b </i>and the inner body portion <b>223</b><i>c </i>of the planet carrier <b>223</b> for receiving and routing wiring or the like to transfer current to the stator <b>212</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As described above, the rotor <b>214</b> is disposed within the stator <b>212</b> and is supported by the lubricant <b>218</b>. The rotor <b>214</b> may therefore rotate relative to the stator <b>212</b> in response to providing the current to the stator <b>212</b>. The rotor <b>214</b> is fixedly attached to the sun gears S, which have outer teeth configured to engage the outer teeth of the planet gears P. When the rotor <b>214</b> rotates, the sun gears S accordingly rotate along with the rotor <b>214</b>. Rotation of the sun gears S causes a rotation of the planet gears P about their individual axes, which in turn cause a rotation of the ring gear R and the wheel rim <b>225</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Thus, the wheel rim <b>225</b> is directly supported by the reduction mechanism <b>222</b>, in particular the ring gear R, and the reduction mechanism is directly supported by the lubricant supported electric motor <b>210</b> and attached to the lubricant supported electric motor <b>210</b>. In particular, the stator <b>212</b> is supported by or supports the inner body portion <b>223</b><i>c </i>of the planet carrier <b>223</b>. The system <b>200</b> can therefore provide integrated gear reduction, allowing for a smaller assembly, and eliminating additional connective components that would otherwise connect an electric motor with a reduction mechanism that is further attached to a wheel.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The foregoing description of the embodiments has been provided for purposes of illustration and description.
