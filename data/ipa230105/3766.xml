to a device for measuring current of 3-phase inverter, and more specifically, relates to: a device and method for measuring the current of a 3-phase inverter by using a current measurement in one shunt resistor and a switch; and an over current detection circuit and method for detecting and blocking over current of a control unit by adding a current detection element.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">When measuring 3-phase current of 3-phase inverter, current is measured using a separate current sensor. Among them, the method using a single current sensor is widely used because of various advantages in terms of merits, for example, price or system size.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The 3-phase inverter system using such a single current sensor installs a single current sensor in a DC-link and measures the current from the single current sensor. In the inverter system using a single current sensor, a single current sensor is installed in the DC link, and the signal detected by the sensor is connected to the A/D converter to measure the U, V, and W phase currents. Here, in order to measure an accurate current value of two different phases, two switching states must be maintained for a predetermined time or longer. However, there is a case in which it is not possible to actually maintain a predetermined time, so there is a problem in that an area in which current measurement is not possible with a single current sensor occurs.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A vehicle provides the necessary power to an electronic control unit (ECU) or electronic control device inside the vehicle by using the power of a battery installed therein. The ECU can be used for a vehicle's electric power steering (EPS) actuator, and controls various devices including motors, and in particular, controls devices essential for safety. For safety, precision control is important, and to this end, a stable power must be provided to the ECU.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When an over current occurs due to battery power or a malfunction inside the ECU, the controller inside the ECU may be damaged, and problems may occur in the controller, the wiring inside the vehicle, and the upper level controller. Over current may be caused by a load exceeding the capacity of the controller, a failure due to a short circuit in the controller, or an inrush current. In the case of a current detection circuit that measures the motor current, there is a problem in that it cannot detect an abnormality even if an over current flows inside of the controller.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Subject</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The technical problem to be solved by the present invention is to provide a device and a method for measuring the current of a 3-phase inverter by using a current measurement in one shunt resistor and a switch.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another technical problem to be solved by the present invention is to provide an over current detection circuit and a method for detecting and blocking the over current in a control unit by adding a current detection element.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The problems of the present invention are not limited to the problems mentioned above, and other problems not mentioned will be clearly understood by those skilled in the art from the following description.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A device for measuring a current of a three-phase inverter according to a first embodiment of the present invention comprises: a current detection element connected to a lower end of one of three lower switches comprising an inverter;

By connecting the current detection element <b>120</b> to a lower end of one among the three lower switches <b>112</b> without connecting the current detection element to all of the three lower switches <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, and <b>113</b>, it can be used to measure the current of all three phases.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">An inverter refers to a device that converts direct current (DC) into alternating current (AC). As in the case of operating a 3-phase motor using DC power, it serves to convert DC power into AC power to be suitable to a 3-phase power of the 3-phase motor. The inverter may be used for various purposes, such as a power inverter required for a motor, a motor control inverter, and an inverter for lighting.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The inverter may include: three upper switches connected in parallel to convert direct current to alternating current; three lower switches connected to each of the three upper switches; and three nodes connected to each of the upper switches and lower switches to apply power to a load such as a motor. The upper switches and the lower switches connected to each other form a half-bridge circuit, and are complementary connected to each other and can transfer power of three phases to a load.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The three lower switches <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, and <b>113</b> forming the inverter <b>110</b> may be configured as FETs. FET is a field effect transistor, a semiconductor having three poles of a source, a drain, and a gate. A current between the source and the drain can be controlled by an electrostatic field generated by a voltage between the gate and the source. It can be used as a switching device by using these characteristics. The inverter <b>110</b> may use an FET as a lower switch.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In the case where the inverter <b>110</b> is an inverter for operating a motor and the like, currents in each of the three phases may be measured, and the motor may be controlled according to the measured currents. Current measurement in three phases is important for accurate motor control. For current measurement in three phases, the current detection element <b>120</b> is connected in series to a lower end of one of the three lower switches.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The current detection element <b>120</b> may include a shunt resistor. A shunt resistor is a resistor with a very low resistance value, and is also called a shunt. A shunt resistor is a resistor that divides the current and is used to measure the current. By connecting a shunt resistor in series to an element to measure the current, the voltage generated by the resistor can be measured to measure the current. In order to measure the current in this way, the shunt resistor may be connected in series to a lower end of one lower switch among the three lower switches of the inverter <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The current measurement unit <b>130</b> measures a current using the other two lower switches <b>111</b> and <b>113</b> to which the current detection element <b>120</b> is not connected and the current detection element <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">More specifically, in order to measure a 3-phase current, the current measurement unit <b>130</b> measures the current in the other two lower switches <b>111</b> and <b>113</b> to which a current detection element <b>120</b> is not connected, and the current in the current detection element <b>120</b> is measured. The current measurement unit <b>130</b> measures a current in lower switches <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, and <b>113</b> of the inverter <b>110</b> through which the 3-phase current flows, and for an accurate current measurement, a current is measured from the current detection element <b>120</b> connected to a lower end of one lower switch <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The current measurement unit <b>130</b> may measure the current by detecting a voltage drop component when measuring the current from the current detection element <b>120</b>. When a shunt resistor is used as the current detection element <b>120</b>, the current measurement unit <b>130</b> may measure the first current value by detecting a voltage drop component of the shunt resistor.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Voltage drop means that the voltage decreases when the voltage meets the resistance, and it is measured as the difference in voltage between the two terminals of the passive impedance. That is, the voltage drop may be detected by measuring the voltage difference between both ends of the current detection element <b>120</b>, that is, the shunt resistor.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The current measurement unit <b>130</b> may measure the second current value and the third current value by detecting the voltage drop component of each of the two lower switches <b>111</b> and <b>113</b> to which the current detection element <b>120</b> is not connected. A second current value and a third current value can be measured by measuring the voltage drop at each of the lower switches <b>111</b> and <b>113</b> by measuring the voltage difference between both ends of each of the lower switches.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">When the current measurement unit <b>130</b> measures the second current value and the third current value, when the lower switch is turned on, a second current value or a third current value may be measured by measuring the voltage drop caused by the resistance value across the drain and source. As previously described, in the inverter <b>110</b>, one upper switch and one lower switch forming one half-bridge form a pair and are operated while complementarily conducting to each other, and in order to measure the current flowing through the lower switch, when the lower switch is turned on, current can be measured by measuring the voltage drop. A lower switch can be comprised of an FET, and when the lower switch is turned on, the current can be measured by measuring the voltage drop occurring in the resistance value between the drain and the source of the FET.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">When measuring the second current value and the third current value, the current measurement unit <b>130</b> may measure the second current value and the third current value by using each Rdson of the two lower switches. When the lower switch is comprised of an FET, the power loss occurring in each lower switch can be expressed as Rds resistance in the equivalent circuit. That is, when the switch is turned on, the voltage at the drain and source terminals is Vds=I*Rds due to the resistance of Rds, and the voltage Vds is applied to both ends of the switch. The resistance value at this time is called Rdson, and the current flowing through the switch can be measured by using the Vds voltage. In an ideal switch, Rdson (resistance value between drain and source when the switch is turned on) is 0 when turned on, but a series resistance component exists in an actual switch. Therefore, the current can be measured by measuring the voltage drop caused by Rdson.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The current correction unit <b>140</b> corrects the second current value and the third current value based on the relationship between a first current value measured using the current detection element <b>120</b>, a second current value measured using the two lower switches <b>111</b> and <b>113</b>, and a third current value.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">More specifically, although the first current value measured by the current detection element <b>120</b> is accurate, since the second current value and the third current value measured using the two lower switches <b>111</b> and <b>113</b> may not be accurate, the current correction unit <b>140</b> corrects the second current value and the third current value based on the relationship between the first current value, the second current value, and the third current value.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">As described above, the lower switches <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, and <b>113</b> are comprised of FETs, and since Rdson, which can be used to measure the voltage drop component in the lower switches, varies depending on the temperature or the size of the current, a precision current measurement may be difficult. That is, the current measurement unit <b>130</b> determines whether the current measured in the lower switches <b>111</b> and <b>113</b> is accurate through comparison with the current detected using the current detection element <b>120</b> with respect to the current measured in the lower switches <b>111</b> and <b>113</b> without the current detection element <b>120</b>, and when determines that the current is not accurate, the corresponding current may be corrected to calculate an accurate current value.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In correcting the second current value and the third current value based on the relationship between the first current value, the second current value, and the third current value, the current correction unit <b>140</b> first determines whether the peak value of the first current value and the second current value or the third current value is the same, and when the peak value of the first current value and the second current value or the third current value is different, the scale of the second current value or the third current value having a different peak value from the first current value may be adjusted based on the first current value.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In converting direct current to alternating current in the inverter <b>110</b>, current flows through each of the three phases, and each current actually flowing through the three phases must have the same peak value. Using this, it may be determined whether the second current value or the third current value is correct or whether correction is required. Specifically, it is determined whether the peak value of the first current value and the second current value or the third current value is the same. A peak value or a peak to peak value can be used. When the peak value of the second current value or the third current value is equal to the peak value of the first current value, the second current value or the third current value may be determined to be accurate. That is, it may be determined that the correction of the current value is not necessary.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">However, when the peak value of the first current value and the second current value or the third current value is different, the second current value or the third current value different from the first current value or the third current value is not accurate, and it may be determined that correction is necessary. The second current value or the third current value determined to be corrected may be corrected by adjusting the scale of the current value.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The current control unit <b>150</b> uses the corrected current value as a control signal of the inverter.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">More specifically, the current control unit <b>150</b> uses a current value of the three phases as a control signal of the inverter <b>110</b>.
