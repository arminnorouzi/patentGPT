The way human eyes perceive an image or luminance of an image is different from how a television and/or a display device presents an image. Human eyes may notice more difference in lower range of values than higher range. For example, individuals are more sensitive to darker parts of an image and may notice differences in the darker parts of an image verses a same amount of difference in a bright part of an image.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Encoders that encode an image or video may be unaware of the differences between human perception of images and how a television and/or a display device may present an image. Prior to encoding an image or video, the image or video is converted into a number system that the encoders use to encode the image or video. Encoders may treat all values equal, and thus, encoders may encode low brightness regions or high brightness regions in a similar manner. As such, encoders may waste precious bits in high ranges (e.g., bright regions of an image) where individuals cannot see the differences in an image or video.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Different Electro-Optical Transfer Function (EOTF) curves defined by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) standards may be used to convert the image or video prior to encoding. Currently, for all Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) content, an EOTF curve SMPTE Rec. 709 is used, as defined in the SMPTE standards, which is not consistent with human perception of an image. SDR content covers up to 100 nits, where one nit is a unit of brightness equal to one candelas per square meter cd/m2. The SMPTE Rec. 709 EOTF curve uses 8 bits of color depth, which limits the granularity of the darker content in SDR images or videos.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">For High Dynamic Range (HDR) content a new type of EOTF curve is used, SMPTE Rec. 2084, as defined in the SMPTE standards, which is consistent with human perception of an image. HDR content covers up to 10,000 nits and uses 10 bits encoding. As such, the EOTF SMPTE Rec. 2084 curve may enable the creation of video images with an increased luminance range so that the upper ranges of scene exposure may not need to be highly compressed while still providing realism and scene presence in the video images. While the EOTF SMPTE Rec. 2084 curve is more consistent with human perception, the EOTF SMPTE Rec. 2084 curve is specifically designed for HDR content and is not applicable to SDR content.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The devices and methods may use a modified SMPTE Rec. 2084 EOTF curve in such a way that the modified EOTF curve only covers the 100 nits needed for SDR content while encoding at 8 bit precision without showing banding. This disclosure includes several practical applications that provide benefits and/or solve problems associated with improving transmitting SDR content to a client device for presentation on a display.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The devices and methods may improve a quality of the images transmitted in SDR content. The devices and methods may also save encoded bits during the encoding of SDR content, and thus, reducing networking bandwidth requirements for streaming SDR content. The modified EOTF curve may make encoding more efficient by achieving the same or better image quality while using less bits during encoding, for example, 7% less bits.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As such, the devices and methods may reduce a bit rate for encoding the SDR content while maintaining or improving a quality of the images displayed by preventing banding while encoding at a lower bit rate. Thus, the devices and methods may provide SDR content that may be consistent with human perception of the image.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, illustrated is a system <b>100</b> for use with transmitting SDR content <b>10</b> from one or more devices <b>102</b> to one or more client devices <b>106</b> via a network <b>104</b> for presentation on a display <b>30</b>.

Alternatively, the components of pre-encoding component <b>12</b>, encoder <b>18</b>, decoder <b>22</b>, and/or color processing component <b>26</b> may include hardware, such as a special purpose processing device to perform a certain function or group of functions.

In addition, or as an alternative, one or more of the client devices <b>106</b> may be communicatively coupled (e.g., wired or wirelessly) to a display <b>30</b> having a graphical user interface thereon for providing a display of content.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">One example use case may include client device <b>106</b> requesting to stream a movie or show for presentation on display <b>30</b>. Another example use case may include client device <b>106</b> requesting to stream gaming content for a digital game for presentation on display <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Device <b>102</b> may include a pre-encoding component <b>12</b> that may receive the SDR content <b>10</b> requested by client device <b>106</b> and may identify that SDR content <b>10</b> is in an SDR format. For example, SDR content <b>10</b> may be encoded using Rec. 709. In an implementation, device <b>102</b> may be a gaming console and pre-encoding component <b>12</b> may be hardware in the display pipeline of the gaming console. In another implementation, device <b>102</b> may be a personal computer and pre-encoding component <b>12</b> may be hardware in the graphics processing unit (GPU) pipeline.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Pre-encoding component <b>12</b> may select a modified EOTF curve <b>14</b> for converting the SDR content <b>10</b> from nonlinear color values provided with the SDR content <b>10</b> to an optical output value. Thus, instead of using the SMPTE Rec. 709 EOTF curve for pre-processing the SDR content <b>10</b> prior to encoding, pre-encoding component <b>12</b> may select the modified EOTF curve <b>14</b> for pre-processing the SDR content <b>10</b> prior to encoding.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The modified EOTF curve <b>14</b> may provide an efficient mapping from digital code values containing as few as 8 bits to a luminance range of 100 candelas per square meter (cd/m2), where one nit is equal to one cd/m2. As such, the modified EOTF curve <b>14</b> may be constrained to the 100 nits needed for SDR content. The modified EOTF curve <b>14</b> may also allow encoding at 8 bit precision without showing banding. Banding may include a line between different color regions of an image. The modified EOTF curve <b>14</b> may allow encoding at 8 bit precision while maintaining a smooth gradation from one color to a different color in the image. By combining the use of Rec. 709 color space (which is a smaller color space relative to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Recommendation 2020 color space, also known as, Rec. 2020) and the additional gradation provided with the modified EOTF curve <b>14</b>, banding may be prevented in SDR images. Using the modified EOTF curve <b>14</b> may provide SDR images with an increase in realism and sense of presence, and thus, may provide images more consistent with human perception. The modified EOTF curve <b>14</b> may represent a number system that closely matches how humans respond to light intensity. Thus, the modified EOTF curve <b>14</b> may be a quantizing function that mimics human perception for use with SDR video and images.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Pre-encoding component <b>12</b> may use the modified EOTF curve <b>14</b> to convert SDR content <b>10</b> to modified SDR content <b>16</b>. Pre-encoding component <b>12</b> may use the modified EOTF curve <b>14</b> to transform the pixel input values for the captured SDR content <b>10</b> to the pixel output values for the modified SDR content <b>16</b>. For example, the SDR content <b>10</b> may be represented in 8 bits and the pixel input values may be a value in a range of 0 to 255. Pre-encoding component <b>12</b> may send, or otherwise transmit, the modified SDR content <b>16</b> to encoder <b>18</b>. Encoder <b>18</b> may encode the modified SDR content <b>16</b> using 8 bits and may save the encoded data <b>20</b>.

For example, device <b>102</b> may stream the encoded data <b>20</b> to client device <b>106</b> via network <b>104</b>. Since encoding was performed using 8 bits, an amount of network bandwidth required to transmit the encoded data <b>20</b> may be reduced. By using the modified EOTF curve <b>14</b>, the same or better image quality may be achieved using less bits during encoding.

Pre-encoding component <b>12</b> may use a modified EOTF curve <b>14</b> to convert SDR content <b>10</b> to modified SDR content <b>16</b>. Pre-encoding component <b>12</b> may use the modified EOTF curve <b>14</b> to transform the pixel input values for the captured Rec. 709 SDR content <b>10</b> to the pixel output values for the modified SDR content <b>16</b>. The pixel input values to the modified EOTF curve <b>14</b> may range from 0 to 255 for 8 bit content. Thus, instead of using the SMPTE Rec. 709 EOTF curve for pre-processing the SDR content <b>10</b> prior to encoding, pre-encoding component <b>12</b> may select the modified EOTF curve <b>14</b> for pre-processing the SDR content <b>10</b> prior to encoding.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The modified EOTF curve <b>14</b> may provide an efficient mapping from digital code values containing as few as 8 bits to a luminance range of 100 candelas per square meter (cd/m2), where one nit is equal to one cd/m2. As such, the modified EOTF curve <b>14</b> may be constrained to the 100 nits needed for SDR content. The modified EOTF curve <b>14</b> may allow encoding at 8 bit precision without showing banding. Banding may include a line between different color regions of an image. The modified EOTF curve <b>14</b> may allow encoding at 8 bit precision while maintaining a smooth gradation from one color to a different color in the image. Using the modified EOTF curve <b>14</b> may provide SDR images with an increase in realism and sense of presence, and thus, may provide images more consistent with human perception. For example, the modified EOTF curve <b>14</b> may increase a level of granularity in darker portions of SDR content <b>10</b>. Users may not perceive banding in SDR content <b>10</b> because the granularity of the proposed EOTF curve <b>14</b> is almost two times the granularity of an EOTF SMPTE Rec. 2084 curve and HDR content uses Rec. 2020 color space, which covers three times more space than SDR color space Rec. 709. In addition, the modified EOTF curve <b>14</b> may reduce an amount of visual information lost in SDR content <b>10</b> during the compression of SDR content <b>10</b>.
