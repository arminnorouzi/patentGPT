Channels may include, for example, email, web, direct mail, and digital television. In providing these services, the MSPs may, for example, perform customer data integration, data enhancement, data hygiene and quality improvements, deduping, database marketing, prospecting, marketing campaign management, data analytics, and related services. All of these services are driven by the data maintained by the MSP pertaining to consumers. In order to access the consumer data that drives the services offered by MSPs, many MSPs will enter into partnership arrangements with consumer data brokers. Some MSPs may have partnership arrangements with a great many different data brokers in order to provide the most comprehensive solution suite for their clients.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">MSPs must take steps to ensure that the data provided to them by data partners is ethically sourced. This process is extremely time consuming and expensive. A single data partner may have collected data from tens of thousands of websites associated with particular uniform resource locators (URLs). Considering that there may be a large number of data partners each of whom collect data from a very large number of URLs, it is not feasible for the MSP to individually check each URL by hand to ensure that the data collected there is ethically sourced under an appropriate privacy policy. By the time a manual check of this nature were completed, the data would no longer be sufficiently fresh to be useful. This problem becomes even more complex when one considers that the privacy policies at any of these URLs are not set in stone and thus may change at any time, which requires periodic re-checking. By the time any manual check was completed, it is quite possible that some of the privacy policies of the associated URLs would have changed, rendering the effort pointless.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Nevertheless, the process that MSPs use to ensure that their data is ethically sourced has traditionally been performed by hand because there is no alternative. Each data partner fills out a form listing the URLs for its data sources, and then personnel at the MSP check each of those URLs individually. This is very costly to the MSP, because of the large number of employee hours that must be dedicated to this task. The delay caused by the hand checking of URLs means that MSPs must wait before using the newest and potentially most accurate sources of data, thereby degrading the quality of the product eventually delivered to the MSP's clients. This creates particular difficulty with respect to data that must be acted on quickly, such as, for example, an indication that a consumer is currently in the market seeking a particular product. Finally, the manual process makes it impossible to continually check the data-source URLs to see if any policies have changed, which degrades the quality of the process for checking the data, and increasing the chance that unethically sourced data may be allowed into the MSPs systems. Only occasional periodic checks are feasible. In the world of today where data is most valuable when it is most fresh, where labor costs continue to rise, and where penalties for the use of unethically sourced data (even if accidental) continue to increase, the manual method of checking data sources is simply no longer an option. What is desired is an automated system and method for ensuring that data is ethically sourced, which provides results quickly enough that fresh data can be acted upon right away, and that continually checks the URLs for data provided by data partners in order to quickly identify any change in privacy policies that would demonstrate that the data may no longer have been collected and stored in an ethical manner.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">References mentioned in this background section are not admitted to be prior art with respect to the present invention.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention is directed to an automated software-implemented system and method for use by an MSP to ensure that data from a data partner has been ethically sourced. The software continuously reviews active data source URLs to ensure that the data may ethically be used in a marketing campaign. Source and privacy data is extracted and captured for each of the great many URLs from which data partners may source data, and this information is analyzed and stored in a particular structure for future use. In certain implementations, a keyword set is used to analyze the privacy terms of websites associated with the URLs. In certain implementations, a keyword set database may be used to track keywords for this purpose. URLs associated with websites that ethically collect data are stored in a URL database, such that these URLs need not be checked each time a new data partner identifies these URLs as the source of its data. Alternatively, all checked URLs may be maintained in the database with additional information pertaining to their associated policies, such as flags indicating ethical sourcing or a score reflective of the ethics used in sourcing the data. Also, in certain implementations, the system may periodically re-check the URLs in the URL database to ensure that no changes have been made to the corresponding website's data collection practices that would indicate the data is no longer being ethically sourced. This check may be scheduled to run on a particular schedule, may be run when resources are available, or even may be constantly re-run to ensure that the latest privacy information is available for each corresponding URL.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">These and other features, objects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood from a consideration of the following detailed description in conjunction with the drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a process flow diagram according to a first implementation of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a system architecture diagram according to an implementation of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a process flow diagram according to a second implementation of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Before the present invention is described in further detail, it should be understood that the invention is not limited to the particular embodiments described, and that the terms used in describing the particular embodiments are for the purpose of describing those particular embodiments only, and are not intended to be limiting.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Before the software-implemented automated portions of the process take place, the process begins by presenting a series of questions to a potential data partner.

The answers received back from the questionnaire are reviewed in order to identify obvious up-front problems. If there are no such issues, then the information is input into the software-implemented machine-learning system for ensuring that ethical data is being provided.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a particular implementation of a system for performing this automated process. A marketing services provider (MSP) server <b>30</b> provides a central processing server for the marketing services provider. It communicates with machine learning system <b>32</b>, which will provide artificial intelligence processing for the system as described below. Machine learning system <b>32</b> takes various inputs, whether actual inputs or training inputs, and learns to identify privacy policies that are indicative of ethical data sourcing. It may also derive a score for the level of ethics involved in data collection at a particular website and/or create a flag indicating a site that ethically sources data. The MSP server <b>30</b> receives a list of URLs <b>38</b> as an input, and maintains a database <b>34</b> of URLs for approved (or, alternatively, reviewed and scored or flagged) websites. The machine learning system <b>32</b> utilizes a keyword set <b>36</b>, containing keywords and potentially key phrases for the review of privacy policies. These are applied against websites <b>40</b> that correspond to URLs in URL database <b>34</b>, with websites <b>40</b> being accessed through the MSP server <b>30</b> across a network such as Internet <b>44</b>. Each data provider <b>42</b> connects to one or more of the websites <b>40</b> because that is the means through which data provider <b>42</b> collects its data. The data provider <b>42</b> also has a connection (not shown) to MSP server <b>30</b> in order to provide the data it has collected for use by the MSP, and also to provide to the MSP server <b>30</b> the URLs from which this data has been collected.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0102">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to describe a process for using the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, it may be seen that after step <b>10</b> in which the data partner is selected and step <b>12</b> where the URL data <b>38</b> is collected (by means of the foregoing forms or otherwise), then processing moves to step <b>14</b>, during which the URLs that have been identified are uploaded to the MSP server <b>30</b> for review by the machine-learning system <b>32</b> that powers the automated portion of the processes from here forward.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0103">The machine-learning system <b>32</b> of the MSP maintains a URL database <b>34</b> of URLs that it has already cleared as being ethical sources of data. At step <b>16</b>, the machine-learning system first checks to see, for each URL provided to the server by the potential partner being reviewed, whether such URL has already been reviewed and passed as an ethical data source by the system according to URL database <b>34</b>. Alternatively, URL database <b>34</b> may retain information for all URLs that have been checked, along with the score assigned to those URLs or a Boolean flag indicating whether or not the URL was accepted for use. In that case, the check to database <b>34</b> is a check to see if the appropriate score (i.e., meeting the threshold score) or flag is presented to indicate that data from the URL of interest is acceptable for ethical use. If so, then no further review of the URL is undertaken here. This step eliminates the duplication that would otherwise result in checking URLs, because many potential data source partners may be using overlapping sets of URLs in order to collect data, and thus previous manual systems required re-checking of the same URLs many times over.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0104">At step <b>18</b>, the machine-learning system scans the material available at website <b>40</b> associated with a given URL using predefined keywords in order to extract the pertinent privacy policy components from the URL, that is, those privacy policy components that are indicative of whether the data provided at the URL was ethically sourced. (It will be understood that although a single website <b>40</b> is illustrated, the system contemplates a great many data providers <b>42</b> and associated websites <b>40</b> may be employed, and further that multiple websites <b>40</b> may be associated as a data source for a particular data provider <b>42</b>. There may be, for example, hundreds of data providers <b>42</b> and tens of thousands of websites <b>40</b>.) Note again that the URL for website <b>40</b> was provided by data provider <b>42</b>, which has indicated that it is using data collected through website <b>40</b>. The machine-learning system <b>32</b> may be initially seeded by a predefined keyword set stored in keyword database <b>36</b>, but over time the system may learn additional keywords that are useful in this process on its own by inputting words from privacy policies that are found to be associated with ethical data. This information may be stored in the keyword set database <b>36</b> by machine learning system <b>32</b> on an ongoing basis. Training websites may be used for this purpose in a fashion intended for use in machine learning systems. Once the privacy policy components are extracted, they are added to a dashboard graphical user display for review by the MSP at step <b>20</b>. This review may initially be performed by humans, but eventually the review is performed by the machine-learning system <b>32</b> and the graphical display may, alternatively, simply display the results of the process for a human reader.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0105">At step <b>22</b>, the URLs are assigned a score for their privacy policy components. This review and scoring is performed by the machine-learning system <b>32</b>. The system improves its accuracy over time through feedback on its results periodically provided by humans. Based on the score, the URLs are either accepted or rejected for use, with those having a score at or above a threshold score being accepted. Those that have been accepted for use are then written to the database <b>34</b> at step <b>24</b>, so that once these URLs have been approved they need not be checked again when a new partner is being evaluated.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0106">At step <b>26</b>, URLs that have already been approved are re-reviewed by the machine learning system <b>32</b> in order to determine if any relevant changes have taken place with respect to the URL's privacy policy. These re-reviews may be performed on a periodic basis, or they may be run whenever the system has hardware resources available to perform these re-reviews, or there may even be dedicated systems within machine learning system <b>32</b> to continually re-review each of the URLs in URL database <b>34</b>. If there are no changes, then no change is made to the information in database <b>34</b>. If there are changes, then processing returns to step <b>22</b> in order to re-score or reevaluate the URL. In the case where only those URLs associated with websites that ethically source data are stored in URL database <b>34</b>, then any URL that is found to be associated with a website that no longer ethically sources data may be deleted from database <b>34</b>. In those cases where all URLs are retained but a Boolean flag is used to indicate ethical compliance, then the flag may be changed. In those cases where all URLs are retained and a score is maintained for the URL that indicates ethical compliance, then the old score may be overwritten with a new score.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0107">The processing of the machine-learning system completes at step <b>28</b>. It will be understood that as the machine learns from performing evaluations of potential partners and the URLs used by those potential partners for collecting their data, that human input will gradually become less and less important. Eventually, it is anticipated to be possible to entirely eliminate human involvement in all steps of this process as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0108">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a second process for implementing the invention may now be described. At step <b>50</b>, user authentication is performed, in one implementation using single sign-on (SSO) technology. At step <b>52</b>, the one or more URLs are uploaded for evaluation of policies and terms. It should be noted here that there is a distinction between the policies and the terms of a website associated with the URL. A policy is meant to cover consumer privacy policies specifically, which includes information collection, use, sharing, opt-outs, etc. Terms is meant to cover website terms and conditions which cover appropriate uses of the site (and information on it) and user/usage agreements. In some cases, the data being evaluated is harvested from the website and in those cases the terms are reviewed to ensure nothing prevents intended uses of the corresponding data. At step <b>54</b>, URL identification/validation is performed. Specifically, the system reviews the input for proper URL formatting and will make a call to the website to get a response and confirm that the domain is in fact active. Any domains that cannot be validated as active will be captured in an exception report for further research. The policies and terms are then downloaded for validated domains at step <b>30</b>. Once downloaded, they will be classified as either privacy policies or terms and conditions, with each being tied to one or more data partners under which the evaluation is being performed. This will generate a time stamp and a new entry in the corresponding database for each document.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0109">Step <b>58</b> is the periodic determination of sourcing policy. The system will re-capture all active policies and terms under new management. If changes in text are detected from the previous policies and terms, the download and classification process will start again. If the text has not changed, the system will create a timestamp entry of the review and indicate that no changes were detected. In either case, processing then continues to step <b>60</b>, where natural language processing (NLP) techniques are applied to understand the context of the privacy policies to extract data points necessary in approving or rejecting a certain source. By creating neutral network understandable data points on why/how a certain policy was rejected or approved, the AI model will learn the semantics and over time will be able to automatically adjudicate rejection or approval without manual intervention.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0110">At step <b>62</b>, the policies and terms are taxonomized. The system uses established key elements that need to be present in the policy, and the processing will identify, capture and present that specific text within the predefined taxonomy to enable both human and machine review. In this way, the process is standardized for various text and phrases within a policy that enables or prevents data use. The taxonomized policy and terms may then be presented through a user interface (UI) at step <b>64</b>. The UI is used at step <b>66</b> so that human reviewers may examine the policies for language that allows or prevents the sharing of data with third parties. In this case, the system is doing much of the preparatory work to surface the relevant text in an easy to navigate taxonomy. These human reviews will form the basis for the training data set necessary to enable machine scoring. It should be understood that after a period of time when the machine learning system has matured using the input from manual review at step <b>66</b>, the manual step may eventually be eliminated entirely.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0111">Once the system has matured such that human review is no longer required, processing will move instead to step <b>90</b>, where instead of surfacing text for human review through a UI, the data points are extracted and processed through the machine-learning algorithm to produce a quantified output, i.e., a score, on how closely the policy meets the approved and failed policies contained within the learning set at step <b>70</b>. In either the manual or machine-learning automated case, at decision block <b>72</b> it is determined whether the policy contains language that prevents or permits the sharing of consumer data with third parties, and whether the terms allow for or prevent commercial use of the data. A pass indicates that the data may be included in campaigns, while a fail indicates that the data will be excluded.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0112">The systems and methods described herein may in various embodiments be implemented by any combination of hardware and software.

The computing system includes one or more processors (any of which may include multiple processing cores, which may be single or multi-threaded) coupled to a system memory via an input/output (I/O) interface. The computer system further may include a network interface coupled to the I/O interface.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0114">In various embodiments, the computer system may be a single processor system including one processor, or a multiprocessor system including multiple processors. The processors may be any suitable processors capable of executing computing instructions. For example, in various embodiments, they may be general-purpose or embedded processors implementing any of a variety of instruction set architectures. In multiprocessor systems, each of the processors may commonly, but not necessarily, implement the same instruction set. The computer system also includes one or more network communication devices (e.g., a network interface) for communicating with other systems and/or components over a communications network, such as a local area network, wide area network, or the Internet. For example, a client application executing on the computing device may use a network interface to communicate with a server application executing on a single server or on a cluster of servers that implement one or more of the components of the systems described herein in a cloud computing or non-cloud computing environment as implemented in various sub-systems. In another example, an instance of a server application executing on a computer system may use a network interface to communicate with other instances of an application that may be implemented on other computer systems.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0115">The computing device also includes one or more persistent storage devices and/or one or more I/O devices. In various embodiments, the persistent storage devices may correspond to disk drives, tape drives, solid state memory, other mass storage devices, or any other persistent storage devices. The computer system (or a distributed application or operating system operating thereon) may store instructions and/or data in persistent storage devices, as desired, and may retrieve the stored instruction and/or data as needed. For example, in some embodiments, the computer system may implement one or more nodes of a control plane or control system, and persistent storage may include the SSDs attached to that server node. Multiple computer systems may share the same persistent storage devices or may share a pool of persistent storage devices, with the devices in the pool representing the same or different storage technologies.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0116">The computer system includes one or more system memories that may store code/instructions and data accessible by the processor(s). The system memories may include multiple levels of memory and memory caches in a system designed to swap information in memories based on access speed, for example. The interleaving and swapping may extend to persistent storage in a virtual memory implementation.

Any or all of program instructions may be provided as a computer program product, or software, that may include a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having stored thereon instructions, which may be used to program a computer system (or other electronic devices) to perform a process according to various implementations. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium may include any mechanism for storing information in a form (e.g., software, processing application) readable by a machine (e.g., a computer). Generally speaking, a non-transitory computer-accessible medium may include computer-readable storage media or memory media such as magnetic or optical media, e.g., disk or DVD/CD-ROM coupled to the computer system via the I/O interface. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium may also include any volatile or non-volatile media such as RAM or ROM that may be included in some embodiments of the computer system as system memory or another type of memory. In other implementations, program instructions may be communicated using optical, acoustical or other form of propagated signal (e.g., carrier waves, infrared signals, digital signals, etc.) conveyed via a communication medium such as a network and/or a wired or wireless link, such as may be implemented via a network interface. A network interface may be used to interface with other devices, which may include other computer systems or any type of external electronic device. In general, system memory, persistent storage, and/or remote storage accessible on other devices through a network may store data blocks, replicas of data blocks, metadata associated with data blocks and/or their state, database configuration information, and/or any other information usable in implementing the routines described herein.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0118">In certain implementations, the I/O interface may coordinate I/O traffic between processors, system memory, and any peripheral devices in the system, including through a network interface or other peripheral interfaces. In some embodiments, the I/O interface may perform any necessary protocol, timing or other data transformations to convert data signals from one component (e.g., system memory) into a format suitable for use by another component (e.g., processors). In some embodiments, the I/O interface may include support for devices attached through various types of peripheral buses, such as a variant of the Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus standard or the Universal Serial Bus (USB) standard, for example. Also, in some embodiments, some or all of the functionality of the I/O interface, such as an interface to system memory, may be incorporated directly into the processor(s).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0119">A network interface may allow data to be exchanged between a computer system and other devices attached to a network, such as other computer systems (which may implement one or more storage system server nodes, primary nodes, read-only node nodes, and/or clients of the database systems described herein), for example. In addition, the I/O interface may allow communication between the computer system and various I/O devices and/or remote storage. Input/output devices may, in some embodiments, include one or more display terminals, keyboards, keypads, touchpads, scanning devices, voice or optical recognition devices, or any other devices suitable for entering or retrieving data by one or more computer systems.

Multiple input/output devices may be present in communication with the computer system or may be distributed on various nodes of a distributed system that includes the computer system. The user interfaces described herein may be visible to a user using various types of display screens, which may include CRT displays, LCD displays, LED displays, and other display technologies. In some implementations, the inputs may be received through the displays using touchscreen technologies, and in other implementations the inputs may be received through a keyboard, mouse, touchpad, or other input technologies, or any combination of these technologies.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0120">In some embodiments, similar input/output devices may be separate from the computer system and may interact with one or more nodes of a distributed system that includes the computer system through a wired or wireless connection, such as over a network interface. The network interface may commonly support one or more wireless networking protocols (e.g., Wi-Fi/IEEE 802.11, or another wireless networking standard). The network interface may support communication via any suitable wired or wireless general data networks, such as other types of Ethernet networks, for example. Additionally, the network interface may support communication via telecommunications/telephony networks such as analog voice networks or digital fiber communications networks, via storage area networks such as Fibre Channel SANs, or via any other suitable type of network and/or protocol.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0121">Any of the distributed system embodiments described herein, or any of their components, may be implemented as one or more network-based services in the cloud computing environment. For example, a read-write node and/or read-only nodes within the database tier of a database system may present database services and/or other types of data storage services that employ the distributed storage systems described herein to clients as network-based services. In some embodiments, a network-based service may be implemented by a software and/or hardware system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. A web service may have an interface described in a machine-processable format, such as the Web Services Description Language (WSDL). Other systems may interact with the network-based service in a manner prescribed by the description of the network-based service's interface. For example, the network-based service may define various operations that other systems may invoke, and may define a particular application programming interface (API) to which other systems may be expected to conform when requesting the various operations.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0122">In various embodiments, a network-based service may be requested or invoked through the use of a message that includes parameters and/or data associated with the network-based services request. Such a message may be formatted according to a particular markup language such as Extensible Markup Language (XML), and/or may be encapsulated using a protocol such as Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). To perform a network-based services request, a network-based services client may assemble a message including the request and convey the message to an addressable endpoint (e.g., a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)) corresponding to the web service, using an Internet-based application layer transfer protocol such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). In some embodiments, network-based services may be implemented using Representational State Transfer (REST) techniques rather than message-based techniques. For example, a network-based service implemented according to a REST technique may be invoked through parameters included within an HTTP method such as PUT, GET, or DELETE.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0123">Unless otherwise stated, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.
