Note that the telepresence system <b>11</b> may have a configuration in which two bases <b>31</b> are connected, or three or more bases <b>31</b> are connected.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">For example, the bases <b>31</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>31</b>-<b>2</b> are outdoor environments such as camping sites, and telepresence apparatuses <b>51</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>51</b>-<b>2</b> are provided in the respective bases. Meanwhile, the base <b>31</b>-<b>3</b> is an indoor environment such as an office building <b>71</b>, and a telepresence apparatus <b>51</b>-<b>3</b> is provided therein. Note that, in a case where there is no need to distinguish the bases <b>31</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>31</b>-<b>3</b> from one another and the telepresence apparatuses <b>51</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>51</b>-<b>3</b> from one another, they are simply referred to as bases <b>31</b> and telepresence apparatuses <b>51</b>, and other components are also referred to in a similar manner. Also, a plurality of telepresence apparatuses <b>51</b> may be provided in one base <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Further, in the telepresence system <b>11</b>, telepresence apparatuses <b>51</b> designed in similar manners are provided in a plurality of bases <b>31</b>, and video images and sound are transmitted and received via the network <b>32</b>. With this arrangement, the video images and the sound are shared among the respective bases <b>31</b>, and the users who are using the respective telepresence apparatuses <b>51</b> can experience telepresence. For example, telepresence is realized so that users at different bases <b>31</b> can interact with each other as if they were in the same place.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Also, in the telepresence system <b>11</b>, the telepresence apparatus <b>51</b>-<b>3</b> at the base <b>31</b>-<b>3</b> set in the office building <b>71</b> shares the outdoor environment (including a video image and the like) of the base <b>31</b>-<b>1</b> or <b>31</b>-<b>2</b> with the telepresence apparatus <b>51</b>-<b>1</b> or <b>51</b>-<b>2</b>. Accordingly, the user using the telepresence apparatus <b>51</b>-<b>3</b> can experience telepresence as if the user were in an outdoor environment like the base <b>31</b>-<b>1</b> or <b>31</b>-<b>2</b>, for example. Also, the telepresence system <b>11</b> may be designed so that that video images and sound can be shared between indoor bases <b>31</b> or between outdoor bases <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As described above, a user who is using the telepresence system <b>11</b> can experience telepresence as if the user were sharing space and having communication with a user at a spatially distant base <b>31</b> via the network <b>32</b>. In the telepresence realized by the telepresence system <b>11</b> described below, the virtual space in which communication is performed as if shared by users, which is the entire space over the network <b>32</b>, will be referred to as the communication space, as appropriate.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an example configuration of a telepresence apparatus <b>51</b> is described.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a telepresence apparatus <b>51</b> includes an information processing device <b>91</b>, a display device <b>92</b>, a sensing unit <b>93</b>, an antenna <b>94</b>, and a central presentation device <b>95</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The information processing device <b>91</b> includes a personal computer or the like, for example, and controls the respective components constituting the telepresence apparatus <b>51</b>, to realize telepresence in the telepresence system <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The display device <b>92</b> includes a light emitting diode (LCD), an organic electro-luminescence (EL), a projector, or the like, for example, and displays a video image supplied via the information processing device <b>91</b>. For example, the display device <b>92</b> displays a video image that has been captured by a user who is using another telepresence apparatus <b>51</b> and been transmitted from another base <b>31</b>. Further, the display device <b>92</b> includes an imaging unit <b>92</b><i>a </i>that images users who are using the telepresence apparatus <b>51</b>, and transmits a video image obtained through the imaging to another base <b>31</b> via the information processing device <b>91</b>. Note that the display device <b>92</b> includes a speaker (not shown), and can output a voice transmitted from another base <b>31</b> so as to be heard from the position of the user who has uttered the voice.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The sensing unit <b>93</b> senses an emotion, biological information, various states, and the like of the users experiencing telepresence using the telepresence system <b>11</b>. The sensing unit <b>93</b> also senses the context of communication between a plurality of users using the telepresence system <b>11</b>, various situations, and the like. The sensing unit <b>93</b> then supplies sensing information indicating the results of the sensing to the information processing device <b>91</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The antenna <b>94</b> is connected to a communication unit <b>112</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, which will be described later) of the information processing device <b>91</b>, and transmits and receives radio waves for performing wireless communication via the network <b>32</b>, for example.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The central presentation device <b>95</b> is disposed at the position to be the center of the communication space in the telepresence to be realized by the telepresence system <b>11</b>. For example, the central presentation device <b>95</b> is not disposed at the actual center of a plurality of users present at one base <b>31</b>, but is disposed at a virtual center of users including a plurality of users present at another base <b>31</b> displayed on the display device <b>92</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">For example, when a plurality of users has an interaction, the users face each other during the interaction. As the number of users increases, the seats normally form a ring so that the users sit in a circle. Likewise, when a plurality of users present at different bases <b>31</b> has an interaction using the telepresence system <b>11</b>, the users are likely to be sit in a ring. In other words, even if the users do not exist in the same space, the users are likely to feel as if they were sitting in a ring during an interaction, and recognize such a space and the existence of the users. Further, in the telepresence system <b>11</b>, the center of the ring formed with the plurality of users at the different bases <b>31</b> appears in the vicinity of the display device <b>92</b> serving as the boundary virtually connecting the respective spaces, and the central presentation device <b>95</b> is preferably disposed in the vicinity (front) of the display device <b>92</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The central presentation device <b>95</b> then performs various kinds of presentation so as to prompt all the users using the telepresence system <b>11</b> to share the communication space and have preferable communication. For example, the central presentation device <b>95</b> can present a virtual bonfire by outputting a video image, sound, light, heat, a scent, and the like of a bonfire, for example.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a first situation in a communication space realized by the telepresence system <b>11</b> is described.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, users A to G present at two bases <b>31</b>, with a bonfire being presented by the central presentation device <b>95</b> at the center, for example, can experience telepresence that shares a communication space as if surrounding one bonfire over the distance.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Here, the base <b>31</b> at which the users A to C surrounded by a double-dot-and-dash line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> among the users A to G are present is also referred to as the other base <b>31</b>, and the base <b>31</b> at which the other users D to G are present is also referred to as the subject base <b>31</b>. For example, the users A to C at the other base <b>31</b> are displayed in a life size on the display device <b>92</b> of the subject base <b>31</b>. At this point of time, the display device <b>92</b> can create a communication space in which the users A to G at the two bases <b>31</b> surround the central presentation device <b>95</b> at the center, using an arc-shaped display (such as a projector that projects a video image onto an arc-shaped screen, for example) shown by the double-dot-and-dash line. Further, the display device <b>92</b> is preferably formed with a transparent or semi-transparent display, so that the users A to C at the other base <b>31</b> are displayed as if floating in the air, and the landscape of the subject base <b>31</b> is visible behind the users A to C.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Meanwhile, the central presentation device <b>95</b> stereoscopically outputs a video image of a bonfire, and the users D to G at the subject base <b>31</b> can see the bonfire from anywhere around the central presentation device <b>95</b>. Further, the central presentation device <b>95</b> can output sound, heat, light, scent, and the like as experienced with an actual bonfire. With this arrangement, it is possible to emphasize that the same communication space is shared between the users A to C and the users D to G present at the different bases <b>31</b>, and increase the realistic feeling.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Furthermore, like the user G shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, it is possible to freely view the communication space from a distance away from the positions surrounding the central presentation device <b>95</b> and return into the communication space.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Note that the central presentation device <b>95</b> is disposed so as not to be imaged by the imaging unit <b>92</b><i>a, </i>and is not displayed on the display device <b>92</b> at the base <b>31</b> on the other side. With this arrangement, the users at each base <b>31</b> can feel as if one bonfire presented by the central presentation device <b>95</b> of each base <b>31</b> were placed at the center of the communication space.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As described above, the bases <b>31</b> at distant places are connected, and the users at the respective bases <b>31</b> are connected, with the bonfire presented by the central presentation device <b>95</b> being placed at the center. In this manner, communication can be made more active. In other words, the users who are using the telepresence system <b>11</b> can go through an experience to enhance the creativity as a more united team with a feeling as if surrounding the same bonfire, and can achieve multi-modal bidirectional communication.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">That is, using the telepresence system <b>11</b>, it is possible to achieve an effect to make the conversation more active, as the plurality of users sits in a circle surrounding the bonfire. Also, even in a situation where two users face each other on a one-to-one basis, such a bonfire makes it easier to draw out the individuality of each other, and psychological safety can be enhanced as the conversation progresses. Further, feeling the heat, the light, and the scent of the bonfire, the users can relax more, and have communication with flexible mindset.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Also, using the telepresence system <b>11</b>, it is possible to immediately have close communication even with colleagues working at a distant place, for example, without having to worry about superior-inferior relationship or the like. In such a case, with a conventional general-purpose conference system, for example, it is likely that the users are too nervous to have smooth communication. With the telepresence system <b>11</b>, however, more relaxed communication can be performed.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Note that the telepresence system <b>11</b> can have functions such as a face authentication sign-in function using an image of a user captured by the imaging unit <b>92</b><i>a, </i>a device control function using speech recognition, and a device cooperation function using a terminal like a smartphone.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Also, in the telepresence system <b>11</b>, the bases <b>31</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>31</b>-<b>2</b> such as camping sites, and the base <b>31</b>-<b>3</b> such as the office building <b>71</b> can be always connected via the network <b>32</b>. In the telepresence system <b>11</b>, the degree of connection, the display balance, and the like between the bases <b>31</b> are then adjusted so that the users at the other bases <b>31</b> are displayed in life size at each base <b>31</b>. Further, in the telepresence system <b>11</b>, the position of the imaging unit <b>92</b><i>a </i>of each base <b>31</b> is designed so that that the lines of sight of the users meet in the communication space.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a second situation in a communication space realized by the telepresence system <b>11</b> is described.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, for example, users A to E present at two bases <b>31</b> can experience telepresence sharing a communication space as if surrounding a round table <b>97</b> on which the central presentation device <b>95</b> is placed. For example, the central presentation device <b>95</b> may include a mechanism that rotates at the center of the round table <b>97</b>, a mechanism that rises from the inside of the round table <b>97</b>, or the like. In the telepresence system <b>11</b>, personal computers <b>96</b>A to E are also placed on the round table <b>97</b> for the respective users A to E.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Here, the base <b>31</b> at which the users A to C on one side of a double-dot-and-dash line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> among the users A to E are present is also referred to as the other base <b>31</b>, and the base <b>31</b> at which the users D and E on the other side are present is also referred to as the subject base <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In this manner, the telepresence system <b>11</b> can be used to achieve communication between the users A to C and the users D and E at the different bases <b>31</b>, in a communication space having a layout (hereinafter referred to as a round-table layout.) in which the users A to E are seated so as to surround the central presentation device <b>95</b> provided at the center of the round table <b>97</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">For example, when telepresence in the round-table layout is used in the telepresence system <b>11</b>, conversations, ideas, and the like become smoother, and conferences, meetings, and the like can be held in a preferred manner. Further, a conference in the round-table layout prompts the users to more actively participate in the conference.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Also, in the telepresence system <b>11</b>, information shared by all the users is displayed on the central presentation device <b>95</b>, so that the central presentation device <b>95</b> can be used as a means for sharing information like a whiteboard that is used in a general conference, for example. With this arrangement, the telepresence system <b>11</b> can be used in such a manner that all the users participating in a conference face one another at the same time, for example, and visually recognize and share the information displayed on the central presentation device <b>95</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">For example, the telepresence system <b>11</b> can be used in such a manner that the information to be viewed individually by the respective users is displayed on the personal computers <b>96</b>, and the information to be shared by all the users is displayed on the central presentation device <b>95</b>. For example, by making the central presentation device <b>95</b> rotatable, it becomes possible for each user to easily write or view information. Note that, in the telepresence system <b>11</b>, in a case where any information is not shared through the central presentation device <b>95</b>, a video image of a bonfire may be displayed as described above, or some other purposeless video image may be displayed, so that a plurality of users can perform work while sharing such video images.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Here, the round table <b>97</b> is a space shared for interaction by a plurality of users, and is a work space, for example. Also, the round table <b>97</b> is a space in which the users at the respective bases <b>31</b> can work, and the round table <b>97</b> at the other base <b>31</b> is displayed on the display device <b>92</b> at the subject base <b>31</b> as if continuous between the subject base <b>31</b> and the other base <b>31</b>. Further, by presenting the same vibration in the round table <b>97</b> at each base <b>31</b>, it is possible to emphasize that the users at the different bases <b>31</b> share the same communication space, and the realistic feeling can be enhanced.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Also, the central presentation device <b>95</b> at each base <b>31</b> presents common content, and performs physically multi-view or time-division fair presentation so that the content can be shared by all the users at the respective bases <b>31</b>. Further, the central presentation device <b>95</b> can use a stereoscopic display that can be viewed from a plurality of angles, a projector that stereoscopically projects a video image, or the like.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Also, in the telepresence system <b>11</b>, the central presentation device <b>95</b> in a communication space is preferably placed at equal distances from a plurality of users.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, distance sense setting in a communication space realized by the telepresence system <b>11</b> is described.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">For example, in a case where six users A to F use the telepresence system <b>11</b> as shown in A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the users are preferably seated at the positions equivalent to the vertices of a regular hexagon so that the distances between the adjacent users in the positional relationship in the communication space are substantially equal. Also, the users are preferably seated so that the distances between the users on the diagonal lines are substantially equal.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The central presentation device <b>95</b> is then placed at the center of gravity of a figure formed with the external straight lines connecting the users A to F surrounding the central presentation device <b>95</b> in the communication space, and is preferably equidistant from the respective users A to F.

With such a sense of distance, the users A to D can have better communication.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Here, in the telepresence system <b>11</b>, the distance between the users is preferably set between a distant phase in terms of individual distances in proxemics (for example, a distance at which the person on the other end can be reached by hand: 0.75 to 1.2 m), and an adjacent phase in terms of social distances in proxemics (for example, a distance at which a person can easily have a conversation with the person on the opposite side but cannot reach the person on the opposite side by hand: 1.2 to 2 m). Specifically, in the telepresence system <b>11</b>, the distance between users is preferably set so as to be felt like about 1 to 2 m, or at a distance longer than that. Accordingly, the telepresence system <b>11</b> is most suitable for communication in which about six to eight persons surround the central presentation device <b>95</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Further, as described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the ratio between the regions occupied by a plurality of bases <b>31</b> in a communication space can be changed in the telepresence system <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">For example, in a case where a communication space is formed with a first base <b>31</b> and a second base <b>31</b> as shown in A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the region occupied by the first base <b>31</b> and the region occupied by the second base <b>31</b> can be set as indicated by white arrows. Further, in the telepresence system <b>11</b>, the separators (double-dot-and-dash lines) between the region occupied by the first base <b>31</b> and the region occupied by the second base <b>31</b> can be moved to change the ratio between the regions occupied by the first base <b>31</b> and the second base <b>31</b> in the communication space.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Likewise, as shown in B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the ratio among the regions occupied by a first base <b>31</b>, a second base <b>31</b>, and a third base <b>31</b> in a communication space can be changed.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">For example, the telepresence system <b>11</b> can change the ratio between the regions occupied by the respective bases <b>31</b> in a communication space, in accordance with the number of users present at the plurality of bases <b>31</b>.

The telepresence system <b>11</b> then dynamically changes the ratio among the regions displaying the respective video images so that the video image of the user who is talking at the other base <b>31</b> more than the others is displayed in a larger size, for example.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">For example, in a case where the user C is talking, the ratio of each region is automatically changed so that the region displaying the video image of the user C becomes larger than the regions displaying the video images of the users A and B, as shown on the lower side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. After that, when the user C finishes talking, the video images of the users A to C are automatically returned to equal displays, as shown on the upper side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In the user interface that displays video images in this manner, when the ratio among the regions displaying the video images of the users at the respective other bases <b>31</b> is changed, the round tables <b>97</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) at the other bases <b>31</b> are displayed on the display device <b>92</b> in a fixed manner. Alternatively, when the ratio among the regions displaying the video images of the users at the respective other bases <b>31</b> is changed, the round tables <b>97</b> at the other bases <b>31</b> may also be changed on the display device <b>92</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Further, in a case where there is the need to crop the video images in accordance with a change in the ratio among the regions displaying the video images of users present at the respective other bases <b>31</b>, each cropped video image is displayed in a vertically long form. In this case, the video images are neither enlarged nor reduced so that the life size (full scale) is maintained in the displays. Further, the video images may be moved in a lateral direction along the circumference. Alternatively, the layout of the video images of the users at the respective other bases <b>31</b> may be dynamically changed. Further, only the regions showing the users may be cut out, and be combined with a common background.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Furthermore, as described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, in the telepresence system <b>11</b>, layouts can be switched.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The upper side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a top view of the round-table layout that is designed so that users surround a round table <b>97</b>-<b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Also, the lower side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a top view of a layout (hereinafter referred to as an alignment layout) in which users are seated at one end and along both sides of a long table <b>97</b>-<b>2</b> that is normally used in a conference.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, users A to J at two bases <b>31</b> can experience telepresence that shares a communication space so as to surround the round table <b>97</b>-<b>1</b> or to line up along the long table <b>97</b>-<b>2</b>. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, personal computers <b>96</b>A to <b>96</b>J are also provided for the respective users A to J, as in the case illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Here, the base <b>31</b> at which the users A to E on one side of a double-dot-and-dash line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> among the users A to J are present is also referred to as the other base <b>31</b>, and the base <b>31</b> at which the users F to J on the other side are present is also referred to as the subject base <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In a case where the telepresence system <b>11</b> determines that it is necessary to perform relaxed communication on the basis of sensing information, the round-table layout is then selected. For example, in the case of the round-table layout, the users A to E at the other base <b>31</b> and the users F to J at the subject base <b>31</b> are seated along the round table <b>97</b>-<b>1</b> so as to surround the central presentation device <b>95</b> at the center. For example, the round-table layout is suitable for sharing vision, and is more useful when used by a team having no upper limit relationship or by six or more users.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In a case where the telepresence system <b>11</b> determines that it is necessary to perform intensive communication, on the other hand, the alignment layout is selected. For example, in the case of the alignment layout, the users A and B at the other base <b>31</b> and the users H and J at the subject base <b>31</b> are seated along one side of the long table <b>97</b>-<b>2</b> so as to face the users D and E at the other base <b>31</b> and the users F and G at the subject base <b>31</b> seated along the other side, and the user C is seated at one end of the long table <b>97</b>-<b>2</b>. The alignment layout is suitable for achieving greater efficiency, for example.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">For example, switching between the round-table layout and the alignment layout can be performed by hardware changing the layout of the round table <b>97</b>-<b>1</b> and the long table <b>97</b>-<b>2</b> prepared at each base <b>31</b>. Alternatively, the switching can be virtually performed by changing the display (or the expression of the user interface) of the round table <b>97</b>-<b>1</b> and the long table <b>97</b>-<b>2</b> in the video image of the other base <b>31</b> displayed on the display device <b>92</b>. Also, when the positions of the respective users are changed from a surrounding form to an alignment form, the layout may be randomly changed.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Further, the telepresence system <b>11</b> can switch between the round-table layout and the alignment layout, on the basis of sensing information (such as users' emotions, biological information, various states, and the like, or communication contexts, various situations, and the like) obtained through sensing performed by the sensing unit <b>93</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">For example, the telepresence system <b>11</b> can recognize a context, to determine whether to perform switching in accordance with a user's action, utterance, nod, body movement, or the like, or to determine whether to perform switching on the basis of synchronization of biological information (respiration, heartbeat, brain waves, rhythm) between users, a degree of smile, or the like. For example, when the degree of smile of users who are engaged in a conversation while being relaxed becomes higher, it is determined that an atmosphere for communication is formed, and the round-table layout is started. On the other hand, when the degree of smile of users drops during a conference or a meeting in the alignment layout, it is determined that the communication needs to be made smoother, and the layout is switched to the round-table layout.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Meanwhile, the sensing unit <b>93</b> may set all the users in a communication space as sensing targets, or may also set a facilitator of a discussion as a sensing target, for example. Further, in a case where the state of a certain number of the users or the state of a specific user exceeds a preset threshold, it is determined that the communication is active or in a creative state, and the layout can be switched.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Note that layouts may be switched on the basis of a preset scenario (such as a conference program).</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">As described above, as the telepresence system <b>11</b> has the function of switching between the round-table layout and the alignment layout, all the users at a conference, a meeting, or the like can actively participate in discussions with enjoyment, and new ideas can be created. It is also possible to strengthen recognition that the users at the respective bases <b>31</b> participate in a conference, a meeting, or the like in the same communication space.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Further, in the telepresence system <b>11</b>, when layouts are switched, the heights of the lines of sight of the users at each base <b>31</b> are changed, for example, so that an environment visually different from usual is obtained, and the users can have a diversion. For example, the positions of the chairs used in the telepresence system <b>11</b> are regular positions in the alignment layout, and are switched to lower positions in the round-table layout. The lines of sight can be changed in this manner. In this case, the viewpoint from which the imaging unit <b>92</b><i>a </i>performs imaging may be lowered at the side of the other base <b>31</b>. As the layout switching is combined with a change in the line of sight in this manner, it is possible to more efficiently connect the users present at different bases <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Note that, in the telepresence system <b>11</b>, face authentication, smile determination, or the like is performed, for example, so that users in close communication with each other can be recognized. Also, speech recognition is used, so that words or sentences used in conferences, meetings, and the like can be mined (the frequency or the number of times each word appears is analyzed, for example). Further, the telepresence system <b>11</b> can have a function of analyzing bases <b>31</b> between which conversations are frequently held, bases <b>31</b> between which few conversations are held, and the like.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Also, as the round-table layout and the alignment layout are switched by the telepresence system <b>11</b>, more space can be saved than in a case where conference rooms and the like for the respective layouts are prepared, for example. Further, in the telepresence system <b>11</b>, layouts can be easily switched with the use of camping equipment, for example, and a new conceptual space can be created.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Here, the telepresence system <b>11</b> is suitable in a situation where the user C performs presentation for unilaterally presenting information to the entire communication space in the alignment layout shown on the lower side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, for example.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Meanwhile, the round-table layout shown on the upper side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is suitable in a situation where all the users A to J in a communication space have discussions or conversations with one another to achieve co-creation. In this case, the facilitator (or simply the utterer) changes from one user to another, for example. However, a user interface with which the central presentation device <b>95</b> performs presentation so as to clearly indicate which user is the facilitator may be used.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Furthermore, the telepresence system <b>11</b> can use a layout designed to be used in a situation where users simply relax or enjoy casual conversations, even without the aim to establish communication.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Note that the method for switching these layouts may be a method by which a user interface for issuing a layout switching instruction is presented, and a user changes the layout of the round table <b>97</b>-<b>1</b> and the long table <b>97</b>-<b>2</b>, for example. In addition to that, a mechanism for automatically changing the round table <b>97</b>-<b>1</b> and the long table <b>97</b>-<b>2</b> may be introduced. For example, in addition to changing the shape of a table that mechanically deforms with the power of a drive unit, the telepresence system <b>11</b> may give optimum auxiliary information to the facilitator so as to deform the table into a specific desired shape, and a user may change the shape of the table in accordance with an instruction from the facilitator. Likewise, to change the heights of the lines of sight of users, chairs whose heights are changed by the power of a drive unit may be used, for example. In addition to that, users may change the heights of the chairs in accordance with an instruction from the facilitator.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Further, with the use of a table formed by combining a plurality of parts of the same design with dimensions standardized in advance, for example, it is possible to easily change the form of a round table or a long table by combining the parts, and to switch layouts of these tables. Other possible layouts include a layout in which a face-to-face conversation is held by each two users, a layout in which each four users surround a round table and have interactions, a layout in which four to five users as representatives have interactions inside while the outside is surrounded by a large number of users, and a layout in which about ten users are seated in a circle and perform brainstorming. The facilitator then sets these layouts as patterns of large-frame layouts beforehand in accordance with the number of users, the type of the facilitation method to be implemented, and the like, and layout control can be performed so that the layout from among those patterns is automatically optimized, on the basis of context recognition in the telepresence system <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Here, in the telepresence system <b>11</b>, as a user's recognition through the display device <b>92</b> or a device such as virtual reality (VR) goggles, visual information or audio information (layout adjustment for sound source positions, for example) may be presented so that the users at the respective bases <b>31</b> surround a round or long table <b>97</b>, or the users' lines of sight change. With this arrangement, it is possible to provide telepresence in which a mutual space and a user layout that are the best for the users are achieved.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Example Configuration of a Telepresence Apparatus</heading><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Next, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a block diagram showing an example configuration of a telepresence apparatus <b>51</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the telepresence apparatus <b>51</b> includes the information processing device <b>91</b>, the display device <b>92</b>, the sensing unit <b>93</b>, the antenna <b>94</b>, and the central presentation device <b>95</b>.
