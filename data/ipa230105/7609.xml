Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Certain embodiments according to the present disclosure relate to wireless communication, and more particularly to systems and methods for managing context of a user equipment (UE) in a wireless network.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To meet the demand for wireless data traffic having increased since deployment of 4th generation (4G) communication systems, efforts have been made to develop an improved 5th generation (5G) or pre-5G communication system. The 5G or pre-5G communication system is also called a &#x2018;beyond 4G network&#x2019; or a &#x2018;post long term evolution (LTE) system&#x2019;. The 5G communication system is considered to be implemented in higher frequency (mmWave) bands, e.g., 60 GHz bands, so as to accomplish higher data rates. To decrease propagation loss of the radio waves and increase the transmission distance, beamforming, massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), full dimensional MIMO (FD-MIMO), array antenna, analog beamforming, and large scale antenna techniques are discussed with respect to 5G communication systems. In addition, in 5G communication systems, development for system network improvement is under way based on advanced small cells, cloud radio access networks (RANs), ultra-dense networks, device-to-device (D2D) communication, wireless backhaul, moving network, cooperative communication, coordinated multi-points (CoMP), reception-end interference cancellation and the like. In the 5G system, hybrid frequency shift keying (FSK) and Feher's quadrature amplitude modulation (FQAM) and sliding window superposition coding (SWSC) as an advanced coding modulation (ACM), and filter bank multi carrier (FBMC), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and sparse code multiple access (SCMA) as an advanced access technology have been developed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The Internet, which is a human-centered connectivity network, where humans generate and consume information, is now evolving to an Internet of things (IoT), where distributed entities, such as things, exchange and process information without human intervention. The Internet of everything (IoE), which is a combination of the IoT technology and the big data processing technology through connection with a cloud server, has emerged. As technology elements, such as &#x201c;sensing technology&#x201d;, &#x201c;wired/wireless communication and network infrastructure&#x201d;, &#x201c;service interface technology&#x201d;, and &#x201c;security technology&#x201d; have been demanded for IoT implementation, a sensor network, a machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, machine type communication (MTC), and so forth have been recently researched. Such an IoT environment may provide intelligent Internet technology services that create a new value to human life by collecting and analyzing data generated among connected things. IoT may be applied to a variety of fields including smart home, smart building, smart city, smart car or connected cars, smart grid, health care, smart appliances and advanced medical services through convergence and combination between existing information technology (IT) and various industrial applications.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In line with this, various attempts have been made to apply 5G communication systems to IoT networks. For example, technologies such as a sensor network, MTC, and M2M communication may be implemented by beamforming, MIMO, and array antennas. Application of a cloud RAN as the above-described big data processing technology may also be considered to be as an example of convergence between the 5G technology and the IoT technology.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As described above, various services can be provided according to the development of a wireless communication system, and thus a method for easily providing such services is required.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Certain embodiments according to the present disclosure provide a system and method for managing a context of user equipment (UE) in a wireless network.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Certain embodiments according to the present disclosure determine whether the UE is genuine or not by executing an authentication procedure with the UE when the network entity receives, an attach request message from the UE in a registered state.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Various embodiments according to the present disclosure re-register the UE with the network entity and delete an old context of the UE in the registered state only when the network entity determines that the UE is genuine.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Some embodiments according to the present disclosure deny the registration request of the UE and continue with the old context of the UE in the registered state when the network entity determines that the UE is not genuine.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Various embodiments according to the present disclosure determine by the network entity whether the UE is genuine by verifying a unique identifier of the UE when the network entity receives, the attach request message from the UE in the registered state.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, some embodiments according to this disclosure comprise a system and method for managing a context of user equipment (UE) (<b>100</b>) in a wireless network.

As number of wireless communication users increases, the security aspect associated with wireless communication also has increased drastically. The security aspect associated with wireless communication includes attacks launched by hackers such as Denial of Service (DoS), Man in Middle (MIM) attack, phishing, data theft, etc. The attacks launched by hackers have serious repercussions when the number of wireless communication users is very large as the attack launched by the hackers can bring down the processing capacity of a wireless communication network impacting the wireless communication users. Further, the attacks launched by hackers can also lead to blockage of services to the wireless communication users causing discomfort.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">For example, consider a genuine User Equipment (UE) (<b>100</b>) is trying to register with a network entity (<b>200</b>) of the wireless communication network by sending a registration request message (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The registration request message comprises at least one of a globally unique temporary identity (GUTI), a subscription concealed identifier (SUCI), any identity (the UE identifier or a subscription identifier) like an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), an International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), the GUTI, the SUCI etc. Further, consider that an attacker UE (<b>300</b>) snoops and acquires the GUTI/IMSI when the genuine UE (<b>100</b>) sends the registration request message to the network entity (<b>200</b>). When the UE is in registered state with the network, the UE is expected to execute TRACKING AREA UPDATE procedure to update any incremental changes in the UE context to the network. This will allow the network to keep updating the latest registration area and MM context of the UE. In general conditions it is not expected that the UE will trigger an attach procedure or initial registration procedure with the network as the UE is already registered with the network. Attach and initial registration procedures are executed to create the UE context in the network and not to update the context, it is obvious that after the context is created, these procedures are not expected to be executed.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">However, to handle certain abnormal cases, current art allows the UE to trigger attach or initial registration procedure though a UE in the registered state with the network (for example, the situations in which the UE was not able to trigger detach and get deregistered with the network and the UE locally gets into deregistered state, (i.e., if the UE had accidentally been dropped, had its battery removed, or had been switched off). In such abnormal situations, a UE may not have an opportunity to indicate to the network that it is moving to a deregistered state. A further example of a UE not indicating its switch to a deregistered state arises if a user triggered the power off button when the UE is in an out of service area again in this situation the UE will do the local detach.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Thus, in certain known networks, whenever the network receives the attach message or initial registration message when a user equipment's context is available and in a registered state, the network will assume that the UE has faced some abnormal situation and due to which, it has deleted its context and has gone to deregister state locally and now the UE is trying to register again or attach with the network. As a response to this step, the network deletes the UE context it has because the network assumes that the old context for the UE maintained at the network has already been deleted at the UE.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">An attacker UE can exploit the current art procedure for handling context in abnormal situations in the UE. Specifically, in one form of attack, the attacker UE (<b>300</b>) sends the initial registration request message or attach message to the network entity (<b>200</b>) using a snooped GUTI/IMSI of the genuine UE (<b>100</b>), which leads to deletion of a context of the genuine UE (<b>100</b>) by the network entity (<b>200</b>), because the network entity assumes that UE has faced abnormal situation and it is trying to register again. The next step the network executes is an authentication procedure, but the authentication procedure will fail as the procedure gets executed by the attacker UE. However, the damage is already done on network side and the UE context is already lost. As a result, when there is an incoming call to the genuine UE (<b>100</b>), the actions of the attacker UE imply that there is no context of the UE available with the network, the incoming call is denied to the genuine UE (<b>100</b>). The denial of service to the genuine UE (<b>100</b>) due to the attacker UE (<b>300</b>) is of serious concern and causes inconvenience to the users.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Thus, it is desired to address the above mentioned disadvantages or other shortcomings or at least provide a useful alternative.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A UE (<b>100</b>) is a genuine UE (<b>100</b>) which is authorized to communicate with a network entity (<b>200</b>).
