Many of semiconductors utilized for devices have a layered structure, and are formed through crystal growth on a substrate made of a semiconductor, sapphire, or the like using a crystal growth device. Although crystal growth has been performed to achieve lattice matching with the substrate, lattice mismatched growth (heteroepitaxial growth) such as crystal growth of GaN on a sapphire substrate and crystal growth of a compound semiconductor on a Si substrate have come to be performed for the purpose of mass production and improvement of device properties.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In heteroepitaxial growth, any type of crystal defects is introduced into a heterointerface, and this extends through into a layer (device layer) constituting a semiconductor electronic/optical device. Since this threading defect degrades device properties, it is important to prevent the threading defect (threading dislocation density). Some technologies for reducing the threading dislocation density have been proposed so far, and include, for example, epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELO), aspect ratio trapping (ART), confined epitaxial lateral overgrowth (CELO), a dislocation filter using strained layer superlattice (SLS), and the like.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In ELO described in Non-Patent Literature 1, for example, a material such as SiO<sub>2 </sub>is deposited on a semiconductor substrate to be subjected to heteroepitaxial growth to form a mask. This mask is partly provided with an opening, and crystal growth is performed from a surface of the semiconductor substrate exposed at the bottom surface of this opening. In this crystal growth, use of growth conditions for growing semiconductor crystals so as to cover the mask around the opening in addition to a place directly above the mask opening enables propagation of dislocations from the substrate to be prevented in semiconductor layers formed on the mask. However, it is difficult for ELO, which is free from the effect of preventing propagation of dislocations in the mask opening, to reduce the dislocation density in the grown semiconductor layers over the whole region in a planar direction of a substrate. In addition, lateral crystal growth over the mask around the opening is more difficult than typical growth in the direction vertical to the plane of the substrate, and the shape of the mask and the shape of the opening as seen in plan view are restricted. Thus, there arise problems in that, for example, a necessary semiconductor device structure cannot necessarily be produced in semiconductor layers formed on the mask.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Next, ART described in Non-Patent Literature 2 will be described. ART is a method of forming a mask including an opening of a stripe structure whose ratio (aspect ratio) of thickness to length (width) in the planar direction is increased, and selectively performing crystal growth on the surface of the substrate at the place of the opening, thereby terminating dislocations in the inner wall of the opening. However, propagation of dislocations cannot be prevented in the direction in which stripes extend because of the absence of the inner wall, although the effect of preventing propagation of dislocations is exerted in a direction orthogonal to the direction in which the stripes extend. In addition, growth with increased aspect ratio raises problems in that a region that enables growth is reduced, and a grown surface is not flat.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Next, CELO described in Non-Patent Literature 3 will be described. CELO is a method of forming thin channels in a surface of a substrate by processing an insulation film formed on the substrate, and supplying raw materials and performing growth through the channels to significantly reduce the dislocation density. In this CELO, however, production of a channel structure is complicated, and a region that enables growth is extremely small. In addition, in CELO, growth needs to be performed on a crystal surface in directions other than a direction vertical to the surface of the substrate, which makes the growth itself difficult.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Next, SLS described in Non-Patent Literature 4 will be described. SLS uses a dislocation filter. This dislocation filter is easy to produce, and thus, SLS has already been widely used. On the other hand, SLS is less effective in reducing the dislocation density, and forms no layer made of an insulation material. Thus, it is not always possible to prevent dislocations from rising from the substrate side toward layers in which devices are formed after producing a device structure.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Non-Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0008">Non-Patent Literature 1: H.

substrate <b>101</b>, the first semiconductor layer <b>102</b> being different from the substrate <b>101</b> in lattice constant in a planar direction of a surface of the substrate <b>101</b> (first step). In the first embodiment, a buffer layer <b>104</b> is formed through crystal growth on the substrate <b>101</b>, and the first semiconductor layer <b>102</b> is formed through crystal growth (epitaxially grown) on the buffer layer <b>104</b>. The substrate <b>101</b> is composed of GaAs, for example, and the buffer layer <b>104</b> is composed of InP. Alternatively, the substrate <b>101</b> can be composed of Si.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0036">The first semiconductor layer <b>102</b> is composed of AlAsSb. AlAsSb is a compound semiconductor containing Al. A second semiconductor layer <b>103</b> can also be composed of a compound semiconductor containing a large amount of Al, such as InAlAs. The above-described respective layers can be formed by a method such as metalorganic vapor-phase epitaxy or molecular-beam epitaxy, for example.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0037">The buffer layer <b>104</b> composed of InP and the first semiconductor layer <b>102</b> composed of AlAsSb are different from the substrate <b>101</b> composed of GaAs in lattice constant in the planar direction of the surface of the substrate <b>101</b>. This produces a threading dislocation <b>121</b> and a threading dislocation <b>122</b> at a heterointerface between the substrate <b>101</b> and the buffer layer <b>104</b> in the first embodiment. The threading dislocation <b>121</b> and the threading dislocation <b>122</b> as occurred propagate to the surface of the first semiconductor layer <b>102</b>.

In order to prevent such problems, the buffer layer <b>104</b> can also be composed of two layers to prevent a significant change in lattice constant, for example. Alternatively, the buffer layer <b>104</b> can also be composed of more layers to change the lattice constant in multiple stages. In other words, if the lattice constant of the buffer layer <b>104</b> in the planar direction of the surface of the substrate is changed to approach the lattice constant of the first semiconductor layer in the planar direction of the surface of the substrate toward the first semiconductor layer, the above-described problems in crystal growth can be prevented.

This allows semiconductor layers with reduced dislocation density to be produced by a simple production method, and allows dislocations to be prevented from rising to a desired semiconductor layer after production.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0077">Note that it is apparent that the present invention is not limited to the embodiments described above, and many modifications and combinations can be made by those skilled in the art within the technical scope of the present invention.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">REFERENCE SIGNS LIST</heading><p id="p-0076" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0078"><b>101</b> substrate</li>        <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0079"><b>102</b> first semiconductor layer</li>        <li id="ul0003-0003" num="0080"><b>103</b> second semiconductor layer</li>        <li id="ul0003-0004" num="0081"><b>104</b> buffer layer</li>        <li id="ul0003-0005" num="0082"><b>105</b> third semiconductor layer</li>        <li id="ul0003-0006" num="0083"><b>106</b> recess</li>        <li id="ul0003-0007" num="0084"><b>107</b> recess</li>        <li id="ul0003-0008" num="0085"><b>108</b> through-hole</li>        <li id="ul0003-0009" num="0086"><b>109</b> through-hole</li>        <li id="ul0003-0010" num="0087"><b>112</b> insulation film</li>        <li id="ul0003-0011" num="0088"><b>121</b> threading dislocation</li>        <li id="ul0003-0012" num="0089"><b>122</b> threading dislocation</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
