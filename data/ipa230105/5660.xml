Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A display apparatus visually displays image information received from an external source or stored therein, and is used in various fields such as home or workplace.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, the display apparatus includes a monitor device connected to a personal computer (PC) or a server computer, a portable computer device, a navigation terminal device, a general television device, an Internet Protocol television (IPTV) device, a portable terminal device, such as a smart phone, a tablet PC, a personal digital assistant (PDA), or a cellular phone, various display apparatuses used to reproduce images, such as advertisements or movies in an industrial field, or various kinds of audio/video systems.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, a display apparatus has become larger in size and smaller in thickness.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As the display apparatus has become larger in size, the number of light source elements used to generate an image has been increased, and power to be supplied to the increased number of light source elements has also been increased. In order to stably supply the power to the increased number of light source elements, the volume of a power circuit (e.g., capacitor and/or inductor) that supplies the power to the display apparatus has been increased.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">As such, the increase in the volume of the power circuit acts as a factor that impedes the small thickness of the display apparatus.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Provided is a display apparatus that receives power from an adapter that is separable from the display apparatus.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Also provided is a display apparatus that receives high-voltage power from an adapter through a magnetic interaction between the adapter and the display apparatus, and receives low-voltage power from the adapter through an electrical connection between the adapter and the display apparatus.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Additional aspects will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the presented embodiments.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to an aspect of the disclosure, a display apparatus includes: a body;
