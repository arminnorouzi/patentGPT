At the same time, the scribing lines <b>13</b> define the plurality of light-emitting devices <b>3</b> on the semiconductor wafer. That is, the scribing lines <b>13</b> define the periphery of each light-emitting device <b>3</b>. In one embodiment, the laser <b>27</b> cuts the semiconductor stack <b>12</b> from the upper surface of the protective layer <b>8</b> downward to a depth within the substrate <b>10</b> to form a rough region (not shown) inside the substrate <b>10</b>. In another embodiment, the scribing lines <b>13</b> is formed by dry etching such as inductively coupled plasma (ICP) to etch the upper surface of the protective layer <b>8</b> downward into a depth of the semiconductor stack <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref>, a semiconductor stack side wall etching process is performed. In one embodiment, wet etching is applied to remove a part of the lower semiconductor portion <b>12</b><i>b </i>in the scribing line <b>13</b> to form the first side wall S<b>1</b>. In another embodiment, the etching process further includes etching the patterned structure P on the upper surface <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the substrate under the scribing line <b>13</b>. In one embodiment, the etchant includes H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, HCl, HF, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, after forming the first side wall S<b>1</b>, a roughening step may be performed on the first side wall S<b>1</b>. For example, the first side wall S<b>1</b> is etched with KOH to form a rough structure thereon (not shown). In one embodiment, after the etching process, the patterned structures P covered by the protective layer <b>8</b> and the patterned structures P not covered by the protective layer <b>8</b> have different sizes and/or different shapes. For example, the patterned structures P covered by the protective layer <b>8</b> have conical or hemispherical structure; and the patterned structures P not covered by the protective layer <b>8</b> after the etching process have polygonal structure, such as mesa with a triangular (or polygonal) bottom surface or pyramid with a triangular (or polygonal) bottom surface. The included angle &#x3b8;<b>1</b> between the first side wall S<b>1</b> and the upper surface <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the substrate <b>10</b> can be controlled by the composition of the etchant, the etching time, and the etching temperature.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Next, the protective layer <b>8</b> is removed. Subsequent processes such as forming the insulator, forming the transparent conductive layer, and forming the conductive structure are performed after the protective layer <b>8</b> is removed. In another embodiment, the protective layer <b>8</b> is left on the semiconductor stacks <b>12</b> and then etched to form the insulator <b>23</b> rather than completely removed. After that, the transparent conductive layer and the conductive structures are formed (not shown).</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Finally, the semiconductor wafer is diced into a plurality of light-emitting devices <b>3</b> along the scribing line <b>13</b>. The dicing method is the same as the manufacturing method of the light-emitting device <b>1</b> described above and is not repeated here.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In one embodiment that the laser <b>27</b> cuts the semiconductor stack <b>12</b> downward to a depth within the substrate <b>10</b> to form a rough region inside the substrate <b>10</b>, a rough region is formed correspondingly on the side wall of the substrate <b>10</b> and is connected to the upper surface <b>10</b><i>a </i>after the semiconductor wafer is split into the plurality of light-emitting devices <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In another embodiment of the manufacturing method of the light-emitting device <b>3</b>, the scribing line <b>13</b> is not formed. The plurality of the light-emitting devices <b>3</b> are defined by the trenches <b>36</b> as described in the manufacturing method of the light-emitting device <b>1</b>. The semiconductor stack <b>12</b> is etched downward, for example, by dry etching, until the upper surface <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the substrate to form the trenches <b>36</b>. Next, the protective layer <b>8</b> is formed on all the light-emitting units <b>22</b>, the trenches <b>36</b>, and the upper surface <b>10</b><i>a</i>. Next, lithography and etching are used to form openings of the protective layer. However, being different form the manufacturing method of the light-emitting device <b>1</b>, the openings of the protective layer are only formed along the periphery of each light-emitting device <b>3</b> rather than along the edges of each light-emitting unit and the trenches <b>36</b>. Similarly, wet etching is performed to remove a portion of the lower semiconductor <b>12</b><i>b </i>in the openings to form the first side walls S<b>1</b> adjacent to the periphery of the light-emitting device <b>3</b> or around the light-emitting device <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">It will be apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the devices in accordance with the present disclosure without departing from the scope or spirit of the disclosure.
