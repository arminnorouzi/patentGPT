Taste transduction is one of the most sophisticated forms of chemical-triggered sensation in animals. Signaling of taste is found throughout the animal kingdom, from simple metazoans to the most complex of vertebrates. Mammals are believed to have five basic taste modalities: sweet, bitter, sour, salty, and umami.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease are major health concerns throughout the world, and are growing at an alarming rate. Sugar and calories are key components that can be limited to render a positive nutritional effect on health. Even so, because a number of foods contain components that agonize bitter taste receptors, consumers often use sugar and other sweeteners to offset the perception of bitter taste in such foods. Further, certain nutritionally useful foods, such as vegetable proteins, agonize bitter taste receptors. Thus, despite their nutritional value, consumers may avoid such foods because of their perceived poor taste. Further, many medicinal compounds, such as antibiotics, have a distinctly bitter taste. Therefore, pharmaceutical manufacturers must employ complicated formulation technologies to permit subjects to take such medicines orally without experiencing displeasure.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">But the physiological basis concerning the perception of bitter taste is still not well understood. Many bitter compounds produce their bitter taste, at least in part, by modulating certain cell surface receptors, some of which belong to a family of seven transmembrane domain receptors that interact with intracellular G proteins. These include a family of G-coupled protein receptors (GCPRs), termed T2Rs, which are found in humans and rodents. Humans express at least several dozen different receptors that fall within the T2R family. Some compounds are known to antagonize hT2 receptors. Even so, merely antagonizing the receptor is not always enough to convert otherwise bitter-tasting products into products that consumers view as tasting good. Thus, there is a continuing need to discover formulations and uses of bitter blocking compounds in various food and beverage products.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure relates to the discovery that 3-(1-((3,5-dimethylisoxazol-4-yl)-methyl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1-(3-hydroxybenzyl)imidazolidine-2,4-dione, which is also referred to herein as &#x201c;TM1&#x201d; and which is represented by the chemical structure</p><p id="p-0008" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="26.25mm" wi="70.27mm" file="US20230000122A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0009" num="0000">and comestibly acceptable salts thereof, impart certain beneficial taste properties when used in combination with other sweeteners and flavor-modifying compounds, and when formulated in particular solid-state forms.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0007">In a first aspect, the disclosure provides 3-(1-((3,5-dimethylisoxazol-4-yl)methyl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1-(3-hydroxybenzyl)imidazolidine-2,4-dione, or a comestibly acceptable salt thereof.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0008">In a second aspect, the disclosure provides solid-state forms, such as crystalline polymorphs, co-crystals, and solvates of the compounds of the first aspect.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0009">In a third aspect, the disclosure provides formulations of the compounds of the first aspect or the solid-state forms of the second aspect for use in comestible products, such as food and beverage products, and in combination with other sweeteners, flavor modifiers, mouthfeel enhancers, and the like.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0010">In a fourth aspect, the disclosure provides uses of the compounds of the first aspect, the solid-state forms of the second aspect, or the formulations of the third aspect to modify the flavor or to impart flavor to a comestible product, such as a food or beverage product.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0011">Further aspects, and embodiments thereof, are set forth below in the Detailed Description, the Drawings, the Abstract, and the Claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0012">The following drawings are provided for purposes of illustrating various embodiments of the compositions and methods disclosed herein.

In one embodiment, the compounds as disclosed and described herein, individually or in combination, may be used or provided in its ligand enhancing concentration(s). For example, the compounds as disclosed and described herein, individually or in combination, may be present in an amount of from 0.001 ppm to 100 ppm, or narrower alternative ranges from 0.1 ppm to 50 ppm, from 0.01 ppm to 40 ppm, from 0.05 ppm to 30 ppm, from 0.01 ppm to 25 ppm, or from 0.1 ppm to 30 ppm, or from 0.1 ppm to 25 ppm, or from 1 ppm to 30 ppm, or from 1 ppm to 25 ppm.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0118">In some embodiments, flavor-modifying compounds as disclosed and described herein, individually or in combination, may be provided in a flavoring concentrate formulation, e.g., suitable for subsequent processing to produce a ready-to-use (i.e., ready-to-serve) product. By &#x201c;a flavoring concentrate formulation&#x201d;, it is meant a formulation which should be reconstituted with one or more diluting medium to become a ready-to-use composition. The term &#x201c;ready-to-use composition&#x201d; is used herein interchangeably with &#x201c;ingestible composition&#x201d;, which denotes any substance that, either alone or together with another substance, can be taken by mouth whether intended for consumption or not. In one embodiment, the ready-to-use composition includes a composition that can be directly consumed by a human or animal. The flavoring concentrate formulation is typically used by mixing with or diluted by one or more diluting medium, e.g., any consumable or ingestible ingredient or product, to impart or modify one or more flavors to the diluting medium. Such a use process is often referred to as reconstitution. The reconstitution can be conducted in a household setting or an industrial setting. For example, a frozen fruit juice concentrate can be reconstituted with water or other aqueous medium by a consumer in a kitchen to obtain the ready-to-use fruit juice beverage. In another example, a soft drink syrup concentrate can be reconstituted with water or other aqueous medium by a manufacturer in large industrial scales to produce the ready-to-use soft drinks. Since the flavoring concentrate formulation has the flavoring agent or flavor modifying agent in a concentration higher than the ready-to-use composition, the flavoring concentrate formulation is typically not suitable for being consumed directly without reconstitution. There are many benefits of using and producing a flavoring concentrate formulation. For example, one benefit is the reduction in weight and volume for transportation as the flavoring concentrate formulation can be reconstituted at the time of usage by the addition of suitable solvent, solid or liquid.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0119">The flavored products set forth according to any of the foregoing embodiments, also include, in certain embodiments, one or more additional flavor-modifying compounds, such as compounds that enhance sweetness (e.g., hesperetin, naringenin, glucosylated steviol glycosides, etc.), compounds that block bitterness, compounds that enhance umami, compounds that reduce sourness, compounds that enhance saltiness, compounds that enhance a cooling effect, or any combinations of the foregoing.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0120">In certain embodiments of any aspects and embodiments set forth herein that refer to a sweetening or flavoring concentrate, the sweetening or flavoring concentrate is a non-naturally-occurring product, such as a composition specifically manufactured for the production of a flavored product, such as food or beverage product.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0121">In one embodiment, the flavoring concentrate formulation comprises i) compounds as disclosed and described herein, individually or in combination; ii) a carrier; and iii) optionally at least one adjuvant.
