This need has been realized since ancient times where civilizations would emerge and settle near sources of clean water. With the growth of industrial, materials, and agrochemical production, the contamination of aquatic sources is becoming more prevalent worldwide. Many contaminants (sometimes irregularly referred to as &#x201c;contaminates&#x201d;) have been reported in water, including pesticides, heavy metal ions, biological species, pharmaceutical residues, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). In particular, PFAS (formerly known as perfluorochemicals) have emerged as an increasingly common contaminant in drinking water that are very difficult to remove and persist in the environment due to their unique structures.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">PFAS are synthetic compounds with multiple high energy C&#x2014;F bonds that are used in industrial processes for the preparation of fire-resistant foams, protective coatings, and poly(tetrafluoroethylene) products. In particular, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are two eight-carbon PFAS that are employed for a wide range of applications, including aqueous film-forming foams for firefighting, nonstick cookware, and water-resistant coatings for carpets, leather, and furniture; yet, these substances are widely present in water supplies. Due to the long human body accumulation times for PFOS (5.4 years) and PFOA (3.8 years), both chemicals have been linked to obesity, cancer, hormone disruption, and high cholesterol levels.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">PFOS and PFOA may be introduced into the environment from the waste streams of industrial, military, or urban regions. The current state-of-the-art techniques for PFAS removal are adsorption on granular and powdered activated carbon, ion exchange resins, membrane filtration, and reverse osmosis. Of these approaches, adsorption on highly porous-activated carbon is the most commonly used method today; however, this approach is both nonselective for PFAS, with known limitations in removing shorter chain PFAS, and expensive to implement, which limits its application for large-scale filtration. An additional drawback of these technologies is that they typically concentrate PFAS onto filtration media resulting in ancillary waste streams. The latter, once released into the environment, will cause secondary PFAS contamination. As such, these commercial technologies never permanently eliminate these &#x201c;forever chemicals&#x201d; from the ecosystem. The main reason that PFAS are called &#x201c;forever chemicals&#x201d; is that the carbon-fluorine (C&#x2014;F) bond energy is very high (536 kJ/mol, one of the strongest organic bonds) and thus is extremely hard to break via conventional bond breaking technologies. As a result, when PFAS compounds enter the environment, they build up and accumulate, rather than degrade.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, there remains a long-felt, substantial need for a technology that can sequester PFAS compounds, such as PFOS and PFOA to name a few, present in a liquid (e.g., water) source, and/or destroy PFAS compounds (whether present in a contaminated liquid or bound to a substrate), and sequester fluoride ions that may be generated via the destruction of the PFAS compounds.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">One or more non-limiting, example embodiments described herein solve one or more of the aforementioned problems.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one example embodiment, a contaminant-sequestering coating includes a network of hydrolyzed silane compounds. The hydrolyzed silane compounds include a hydrophilic polar head region, a hydrophobic linker, and an anchor region including a silicon atom. The network of hydrolyzed silane compounds is devoid or substantially devoid of fluorine atoms.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another example embodiment, a method of removing contaminants from a contaminant-containing liquid includes contacting the contaminant-containing liquid with a contaminant-sequestering coating.

Indeed, the invention shown, described, and/or claimed herein may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. As used in the specification, and in the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d;, &#x201c;the&#x201d;, include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Example embodiments relate generally to methods of treating and/or removing contaminants [e.g., per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) compounds] from contaminant-containing materials, such as liquids or fouled substrates (e.g., substrates having PFAS compounds sequestered thereon). In one aspect, certain embodiments provide a non-fluorinated contaminant-sequestering material (e.g., a dry or solid coating bonded to a substrate). For example, the contaminant-sequestering coating (e.g., in a dry state) may include a network of hydrolyzed (e.g., condensed) silane compounds, in which the hydrolyzed silane compounds include (a) a hydrophilic polar head region, (b) hydrophobic linker (e.g., hydrocarbon linker), and (c) an anchor region including a silicon atom. In accordance with certain example embodiments, the network of hydrolyzed silane compounds may be devoid or substantially devoid of fluorine atoms. In accordance with certain embodiments, the term &#x201c;substantially devoid of fluorine atoms&#x201d; may include at most 10 atomic percent of fluorine atoms (0.1 to 10 atomic percent) in the network of hydrolyzed silane compounds, such as at least about any of the following: 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 atomic percent of fluorine atoms in the network of hydrolyzed silane compounds, and/or at most about any of the following: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, and 5 atomic percent of fluorine atoms in the network of hydrolyzed silane compounds. The contaminant-sequestering coating may be deposited and/or bonded to a variety of substrates, such as inorganic substrates typically used in, for example, filtration media and ion-exchange resins. In accordance with certain embodiments, the network of hydrolyzed silane compounds may beneficially sequester a large array of PFAS [e.g., perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)]. Non-limiting examples of PFAS include perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS), and GenX (e.g., a chemical process that uses 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-2-(heptafluoropropoxy)propanoic acid (FRD-903) and produces 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-2-(heptafluoropropoxy)propanoate (FRD-902) and heptafluoropropyl 1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl ether (El), in which the chemicals are used in products such as food packaging, paints, cleaning products, non-stick coatings, outdoor fabrics, and firefighting foam).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In accordance with certain embodiments, the contaminant-sequestering coating may sequester or remove from about 50% to about 100% by weight of one or more PFAS, such as at least about any of the following: 50, 60, 70, 75, 80, and 85% by weight of one or more PFAS and/or one or more, and/or at most about any of the following: 100, 99.5, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 92, 90, 88, 86, and 85% by weight of one or more PFAS compounds. In accordance with certain embodiments, for example, the contaminant-sequestering coating may reduce the amount of one or more PFAS compounds present in a water stream or source to at or below about 80 parts-per-trillion, such as at or below about 70 parts-per-trillion as recommended by the U.S. environmental agency (EPA). In this regard, certain embodiments provide methods and devices that utilize the non-fluorinated contaminant-sequestering coating that may function as an ecofriendly ligand.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Example embodiments also provide several methods of destroying one or more PFAS compounds present in a contaminant-containing liquid and/or present on fouled or spent substrate via a contaminant-sequestering coating bonded thereon. In this regard, the PFAS compound may be destroyed while present within a liquid phase or sequestered by a contaminant-sequestering coating that is anchored or bonded to a suitable substrate (e.g., filtration medium, resin, etc.). In accordance with certain embodiments, the destruction of PFAS compounds may be performed by utilizing a chemical reaction using Frustrated Lewis Pairs (FLP) to perform fluoride abstraction on PFAS compounds to remove them from solution or from a spent substrate (e.g., filter medium) to which the PFAS compounds are sequestered via a contaminant-sequestering coating. The FLPs, for example, may be combined with the PFAS compounds and a reducing agent (e.g., triethylsilane) to form a reaction mixture. The reaction mixture may be heated at a desired temperature for a desired time to obtain a desired level of destruction of the PFAS compounds. The post-reaction mixture may be analyzed for percent PFAS compound removal using 19F NMR or LCMS/MS. In accordance with certain embodiments, such PFAS compound destruction methods may combine adsorption and/or sequestering of the PFAS compounds onto a suitable substrate (e.g., a filtration medium) followed by chemical decontamination of the substrate using FLPs and described and disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In accordance with certain embodiments, the destruction of PFAS compounds may be performed by oxidation techniques involving the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) for bond cleavage, such as by the use of Fenton reagents, in which iron (Fe) species are oxidized or reduced in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, producing reactive oxygen species, including hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals, which are capable of cleaving C&#x2014;F bonds. In accordance with certain embodiments, the foregoing process may be greatly improved via the use of magnetite (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) nanoparticles (an iron spinel mineral), which catalyzes the Fenton reaction for destruction of PFAS compounds. Magnetite is a naturally occurring mineral, and when used in a nanoparticle form, the efficiency of PFAS compound destruction may be particularly desirable for robust destruction of unwanted PFAS compounds. Such embodiments provide, for instance, provide a novel, eco-friendly procedure for the efficient destruction of PFAS compounds. In accordance with certain embodiments, magnetite nanoparticles may be mixed into PFAS-contaminated liquid (e.g., water) at neutral pH or nearly neutral pH (e.g., pH from 6-8), near that of drinking water, as a suspension of nanoparticles. Hydrogen peroxide may be added either prior to, during, or subsequent to the addition of the magnetite nanoparticles to form a reaction mixture, which may be placed, for example, into a UV-C oven for a desired time (e.g., one hour). Following exposure to UV radiation, the post-reaction mixture may be filtered to separate the magnetite nanoparticles, and the remaining liquid (e.g., water) may be tested for PFAS concentration. In accordance with certain embodiments, these method for the destruction of PFAS compounds does not require addition of other ions, such as sulfate, and/or catalysts (e.g., devoid of sulfates) used in previous studies of Fenton reagents and is effective for multiple types of PFAS species. The result provides decontaminated, clean water, that can be further processed for drinking water sources or other valuable uses if so desired.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In accordance with certain embodiments, the destruction of PFAS compounds may be performed by an electrochemical technique, such as by direct or indirect oxidation of the PFAS compounds, driven by the formation of reactive oxygen species. In accordance with certain embodiments, the electrochemical technique or method may utilize a catalyst doped with niobium into ubiquitous titanium oxide, denoted as Nb-doped TiO<sub>2</sub>.
